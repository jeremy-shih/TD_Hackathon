Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Media will be on a listen-only basis.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Todd. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal third quarter of 2019 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Mike. News Corp reap rewards from our digital strategy this quarter, underscored by a robust rise in digital subscriptions across our media properties, a sharp increase in digital audio book sales and continued expansion at our digital real estate businesses, despite volatile conditions in property markets.","In the third quarter, the company saw 17% revenue growth to nearly $2.5 billion reported net income of $23 million versus $1.1 billion net loss in the prior year and there was a 36% increase in total segment EBITDA. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel and, among other things, another distinguished performance by Harper Collins. For the nine months to the end of March, our revenues were 20% higher and profitability was 29% higher.","Turning first to the News and Information Services segment, where Dow Jones continues to expand its national and global digital reach. We have recently entered into a partnership with Apple, which is at an early stage. But the initial signs are encouraging, but in terms of reaching new audiences and the strength of engagement with The Wall Street Journal in the new app.","The journal is the most trusted masthead in America and that value can be seen in its results this quarter, with paid digital-only subscribers of the journal growing to nearly $1.8 million, reflecting 19% growth. In total, 68% of subscribers are now digital-only.","Equally as significant, in the last quarter, about 55% of circulation revenues of Dow Jones were digital, and we believe there is undoubted potential for future growth. In addition to the journal, other noteworthy Dow Jones properties include Barron\u2019s and MarketWatch.","At MarketWatch, audience expanded 13% in the first nine months to approximately $30 million average monthly unique users and revenue rose 13%. Barron\u2019s subscribers grew over 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, approaching $600,000 and its success continued in April, with Barron\u2019s breaking its all-time audience record by achieving for the first time a combined total audience of 10 million print and digital uses.","We\u2019re also expanding the successful Dow Jones Professional Information Business, where risk and compliance reported 22% growth in revenues. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of 20% or more year-over-year growth in that business. It is worth noting that at the time of the separation of News Corp in 2013, annual revenues, risk and compliance were at $31 million. We expect that number to more than quadruple by the end of fiscal 2019 to around $130 million.","We believe that Dow Jones is uniquely able to provide risk and compliance services in an area of significant expected growth. In fact, a market research firm recently valued the global risk and compliance market last year at nearly $28 billion and forecast that it would expand to some $65 billion by 2025.","Dow Jones robust live events business continues to expand across sectors and around the world, with The Wall Street Journal CEO Council set to meet in London and Tokyo this month, and they claim Future of Everything Festival launching here in New York City on May 20.","At News UK, we also saw continued gains in print circulation market share across all titles. And at the Sun, digital traffic improved sequentially with 84 million global monthly users as of March and digital advertising revenue accelerated. The Times & The Sunday Times are another quarter of strong digital subscriber growth of 24% to 286,000 and now have in total 527,000 subscribers.","In the wake of the recent favorable ruling by the UK government that will allow sharing the resources at The Times & The Sunday Times, we look forward to further efficiencies in their operations, even as the editorial independence remains sacrosanct.","At News Corp Australia, digital subscription growth and heighten cost consciousness rounded out another solid quarter, despite the choppy advertising market. News Australia remains the largest print and digital publisher in Australia, with news.com.au still the number one news website significantly ahead of its rivals, with an audience of over 10 million uniques in March. News Corp Australia is looking forward to achieving 500,000 digital subscribers in the coming weeks.","In the Subscription Video Services segment, Foxtel demonstrated its strength. Demand for the iQ4 set-top box launched earlier this fiscal year has exceeded expectation and now serves 43% of our broadcast base. This is important, not only because the customer experience is materially better, but because iQ4 customers have on average a higher build ARPU with lower chance. And while broadcast churn was elevated last quarter at 17.7%, impacted by a recent price rise, we saw a notable improvement in March and in April when churn fell to 16% then 15%, respectively.","We are confident that the renewed focus on churn and loyalty should continue that trend. Obviously, we have been investing in streaming with platform development and marketing costs, as well as leveraging existing sports rights.","Our new sports streaming product, Kayo Sports, has already amassed more than 239,000 users since its launch like last year, with more than 209,000 of them paid subscribers as of May 8. This growth reflects the sophistication of the technology and the strength of the exclusive sporting rights we have acquired. It is clear that the Kayo subscriber base is engaged, consuming an average of over seven hours of content per week. And while it is early days, cannibalization of the core broadcast product appears to be de minimis.","Kayo is reaching a new audience and maximizing the value of our existing sports rights. We\u2019re excited about the upcoming Cricket World Cup, which Kayo has the right too and look forward to maintaining the momentum at Kayo Sports.","We keenly anticipate the integration of Netflix into Foxtel\u2019s next-generation set-top box, which will herald the start of Foxtel aggregating other services. Along with a new user interface later this calendar year, this will create a unified content search experience for our customers and strengthen our position in the market, as providers of the broadest range of original and sports programming.","Meanwhile, the success of the new season of Game of Thrones is attracting record audiences in Australia and demonstrates the power of our platform. As a result, we have seen the acceleration of Foxtel Now sales since quarter-end, with more than 567,000 subscribers as of May 8, and more than 505,000 of those paying subscribers.","The opening episode of The Final Season garnered 962,000 broadcast views overnight on Foxtel in Australia, up 17% on the season premiere in 2017. That\u2019s in addition to the total premier day audience of 333,000 new stream did live or on demand across Foxtel Now and Foxtel Go.","The investment in streaming is starting to payoff. In the aggregate, with Kayo and Foxtel Now, total OTT subscribers at Foxtel increased more than 80% since the beginning of this calendar year to more than 714,000 paying subscribers. Driven by the strong growth of OTT, our closing subscribers as of April 30 totaled approximately 3.1 million, as compared to almost 2.8 million in the prior year.","Turning to Digital Real Estate Services. REA Group continue to significantly outperform the competition, despite a soft listing environment and currency headwinds that is a weak Australian dollar.","The housing market was also challenging in the U.S. but at Move, home of realtor.com real estate revenues, which accounted for 79% of total move revenues rose 14%. Overall, move revenues grew 5%, as we have consciously reduced our advertising inventory to improve the user experience, but are able to increase that ratio according to market conditions.","Speaking of those conditions, there are clear signs that the U.S. housing market is strengthening, with lower mortgage rates, strong economic growth and significant increases in personal disposable income.","As realtor.com\u2019s Chief Economist noted, positive indicators foreshadow a potential strengthening of home sales in the months to come. This has been reinforced by record traffic at realtor.com in April, up 7% from the prior year to over 69 million unique, leading to 209 million visits. Also, the impact of those improving conditions were seen in the most recent new home sales figures.","In March, new home sales rose 4.5% from the prior year to 692,000, the highest level since November 2017. New contracts in March were up 4%. Based on March data from Comscore, realtor.com has a greater number of visits per visitor compared to the competition, with more pages viewed and more time spent on the side. So not only does realtor.com have the most complete and up-to-date for sale listings in the industry, it also has the best level of engagement with its audience.","Likewise, we remain confident in the strategic importance of our recent acquisition of Opcity, which leverages applied analytics and machine learning to quickly match consumers with the right real estate professional. The ability to generate high-quality consumer leads for realtors through Opcity provides a new outlet to sustain revenue growth. This acquisition will involve some investment to increase capacity, but it is an investment in future growth.","We recently expanded Opcity to a number of test markets offering an exclusive performance-based experience to consumers and the industry. We believe that providing higher-quality leads to realtors is part of the changing U.S. property market and will result in higher-quality returns for realtor.com. There is still much potential for growth in the sector, which is at a relatively early stage of digital development. And we expect the sectoral and cyclical wins to be more favorable over the coming year.","Turning to Book Publishing. Harper Collins once again delivered an impressive performance this quarter, with standout hits in our Christian division from best-selling author Rachel Hollis, whose previous title Girl, Wash Your Face has already sold over 3 million units and her latest Girl, Stop Apologizing, shipped another 1 million.","Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 5%, which included 32% growth in downloadable audiobooks. Digital in the aggregate represented 21% of consumer revenues this quarter. Meanwhile, the Harper Collins backlist contributed approximately 63% of consumer revenues in the quarter.","Harper Collins has been strengthening its reach into the U.S. book buying heartland. It is peerless in commissioning new authors, in its savvy editing and in its first-class marketing for best-in-class books. One recent example of the success of the strategy is the latest book from Joanna Gaines, We Are the Gardeners. And Ben Shapiro\u2019s book, The Right Side of History, is now our bestseller in print and e-book. These successes enhance the bottom line with a 12.6% segment EBITDA margin in the quarter, compared to 10.3% in the prior year.","Prospects with News Corp are certainly positive, given the performance thus far in this fiscal year, which is a direct result of the strategic and digital initiatives across our businesses. There is no doubt that the content landscape is changing and that we are seeing more people prepared to pay more for trusted news and innovative entertainment delivered efficiently, seamlessly to their mobile phone or hand devices.","For more details on this quarter\u2019s results, I now turn to Susan Panuccio.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 third quarter revenues were nearly $2.5 billion, up 17% versus the prior year and total segment EBITDA was $247 million, up 36% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel.","On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 2% and EBITDA decreased 4%.","For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.02, as compared to a loss of $1.94 in the prior year, which included a non-cash write-down related to Foxtel, as well as non-cash impairment charges at News America Marketing and FOX SPORTS Australia. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.06 in the prior year.","Turning now to the Individual Operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $52 million, or 4% negative impact and was responsible for most of the decline. Approximately 31% of the segment\u2019s revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.","Advertising revenues for the segment accounted to 48% of segment revenues and were down 9% versus the prior year, with approximately $23 million, or 4% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 44% of segment revenues were relatively flat versus the prior year, this despite foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $22 million, or 4%. Within the segment, revenues at Dow Jones rose 1%, News UK and News America Marketing declined 8% News Australia declined 7%.","I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, 73% of revenues are reoccurring and subscription-based, relating to either consumer products, primarily for The Wall Street Journal and Barron\u2019s or business-to-business through our Professional Information Business, or PIB, which includes risk and compliance, Factiva and Dow Jones Newswires.","Consumer circulation revenues again grew 7%, benefiting from 19% growth in digital-only paid subscribers of The Wall Street Journal to nearly $1.8 million, as well as the benefit of highest subscription pricing ranging from an additional $2 to $6 per month.","Digital paid subscribers accounted for 68% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 62% last year. This quarter we added net 66,000 new subscribers. In addition, subscribers for Barron\u2019s, the financial news in the UK, grew 28% from the prior year, resulting in an overall subscriber \u2013 subscription for Dow Jones consumer products reaching almost 3.3 million, achieving record levels. Of that, over 2.1 million is digital-only.","We also saw stable low single-digit revenue growth at PIB, despite currency headwinds, led by 22% revenue growth from risk and compliance, which remains its growth engine, as Robert mentioned, and a core differentiator versus the industry.","Advertising revenues at Dow Jones fell approximately 8% compared to the prior year, which was weaker than the prior quarter, with the variance versus the second quarter mostly due to digital advertising, although, we expect to show an improvement in the fourth quarter rate.","Elsewhere across our news portfolio, at News Australia, advertising declined 9% compared to the prior year, but rose 1% in local currency, due to the acquisition of Medium Rare and Integrated Content Agency business and digital advertising growth. We saw further weakness in the print advertising market.","In the UK, advertising fell 11% versus the prior year, or down 5% in local currency, due mostly to soft print trends at The Sun, which had a challenging prior year comparison, partially offset by a sequential improvement in digital advertising growth at both The Sun and The Times. Now as Robert mentioned, modest improvement in print advertising revenues at The Times.","Importantly, we saw accelerating year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times & The Sunday Times, up 24% year-over-year to 286,000 and at News Australia up 21% year-over-year to 493,000. That along with cover price increases allowed both markets to post modest gains in circulation and subscription revenues, excluding currency headwinds.","Finally, revenues at News America Marketing fell 8%, as growth in U.S. in-store advertising, which is the biggest contributor to NAM revenues, was more than offset by continued weakness in freestanding insert products.","Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $73 million, down approximately 16%, due primarily to News America Marketing, mostly a function of the top line weakness.","Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues were $539 million versus $129 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $98 million versus $16 million in the prior year. These results reflect the consolidation of Foxtel.","On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $84 million, or 13% compared with the prior year. $53 million of the decline, or 9% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.","Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports.","Broadcast ARPU was over A$79, or down 1% versus the prior year, as the impact of the price increase was more than offset by the impact from the new revenue recognition standards. Compared to the second quarter, broadcast ARPU rose nearly 2%, reflecting a price increase last quarter. We also saw a sequential and year-over-year improvement in Foxtel Now ARPU due to a price increase last quarter.","Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $29 million, down 23% compared to the prior year and a moderation from last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects highest sports programming and production costs, including approximately $25 million of costs related to Cricket Australia, lower revenues and $10 \u2013 $10 million for marketing related to Kayo Sports. These were partially offset by lower overhead and other corporate expenses, as well as lower entertainment programming costs.","On key operating metrics, Foxtel\u2019s total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of March 31, up over 5% against the prior year, driven by higher Kayo Sports and Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of FOX SPORTS Australia.","Compared to the second quarter, we had a modest increase in sequential subscriber growth as higher Kayo subscriptions more than offset broadcast declines. We are making good progress in our OTT strategy, which is helping drive volume growth of Foxtel.","As Robert mentioned, as of May 8, we had over 239,000 total Kayo Sports subscribers, of which 209,000 were paying, more than double our last update. We also had over 567,000 Foxtel Now subscribers as of May 8, of which more than 505,000 are paying, which is an increase of 45% in paying subscribers from quarter-end, driven by the demand for Game of Thrones.","In the third quarter, broadcast churn was 17.7% versus 15.3% in the prior year, higher than we had anticipated. Although the majority of churn is coming from lower-value, shorter tenured customers, many without contract. Importantly, sports customer churn on broadcast has been relatively stable at only 6%.","As we mentioned last quarter, Foxtel has launched proactive churn management initiatives focused on customized solutions for retention and win back and we are seeing real progress in recent weeks. March churn was down to 16.2% and to around 15.1% in April.","Moreover, unlike in recent periods, promotions and new broadcast sales are predominantly with 12-month contracts, which would also help with churn reduction moving forward.","Capital expenditures related to the new Foxtel was $223 million in the first nine months. We now expect full-year CapEx to be higher than the prior year\u2019s level by $25 million or less, which is lower than our previous expectations.","Stepping back, as we have previously indicated, this year was always going to be a big transition year for the new Foxtel, and segment EBITDA performance has been impacted by reinvestments, which have a longer payback period. On this, there are a few points I\u2019d like to make.","We see OTT as a big revenue driver that will have higher contribution margins, given we are leveraging mostly fixed costs for previously acquired rights and we are encouraged by the recent performance of Kayo and Foxtel Now. We believe we can stabilize broadcast churn via proactive churn management and a higher penetration of next-generation boxes, which materially reduce churn. Approximately 43% of households now have either the iQ3 or iQ4 box, up 400 basis points from last quarter. As mentioned, we are seeing good progress on that front.","As we lap the cricket investment, we would expect programming cost to grow at a much more modest rate after this year and we will continue to thoroughly review our content lineup for additional savings. We see an opportunity to reduce non-programming costs, including the ability to flex the variable components of the cost base, like marketing and broader overhead costs.","Finally, on the Foxtel debt structure. We continue to evaluate numerous options to provide Foxtel with more financial flexibility and an optimal capital structure. So that end, we have contributed A$300 million via shareholder loans, which covered the repayment of April maturities.","At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by a strong release slate, which included in Christian Publishing; Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis; and We are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines. UK revenues were also higher helped by Fing, a new release from David Walliams.","Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $421 million and would have been notably higher, excluding negative impacts from revenue recognition and currency. Segment EBITDA increased 29% to $53 million, despite a much more challenging prior year comparison than the second quarter.","At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 3% to $272 million. This growth was more than offset by currency headwinds. Currency had a $16 million negative impact to revenues in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3%.","REA Group revenues were down 4%, but up 6% in local currency due to residential debt growth in Australia, driven by increased yield and higher penetration for Premiere All. This growth was partially offset by an overall 9% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter, which included pronounced declines in both Sydney and Melbourne down 18 and 12%, respectively.","Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook. Move revenues rose 5% to $121 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 14%, resulting from higher yield and growth in buy-side lead volume, albeit at a slower rate due to a more challenging U.S. housing market place, as well as the transfer of leads to Opcity.","It is worth noting that Opcity is performance-based. And as we migrate leads to that model, we monetize differently and this does delay revenue recognition with early data indicating an average delay of four months from an initial lead inquiry.","As Robert alluded to earlier, we have been live testing in a handful of small markets converting to performance-only model and last week, we expanded to over dozen markets, big and small, as we test the scalability of the platform. These markets include, among others, Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland and Nashville. We expect to reallocate resources primarily within realtor.com teams in order to be more streamlined and much better positioned for financial year 2020.","Revenue this quarter was also negatively impacted by the continued reduction of non-listed advertising inventory, similar to the first-half as part of an initiative to improve the consumer experience and engagement. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately $65 million for the quarter, rising 7% versus the prior year. Segment EBITDA fell 16% to $74 million. The quarter reflected additional costs related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 9%.","I would now like to mention a few themes for the fiscal fourth quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect advertising performance to remain relatively similar to the third quarter rate and we expect to continue to expand our digital subscribers, while seeking further cost efficiencies.","In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be more modest in the fourth quarter and we expect to see increased contribution from OTT revenues. On a reported basis, we will be lapping the consolidation of Foxtel.","In Book Publishing, we will face particularly tough comps as in the prior year we recognized $28 million in revenue and $21 million in EBITDA due to the sublicensing agreement for The Lord of the Rings trilogy with Amazon.","At Digital Real Estate Services, listing volumes in Australia remain challenged, impacted by Easter and Anzac Day and in anticipation of the federal election in May. In the U.S., we expect continued reinvestment as we continue to test and monitor the scalability of Opcity.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you very much. I was just going to ask you about your opportunity you see with Apple News. I know that that Journal has agreed to have a partnership with them, The Wall Street Journal. I\u2019m curious about how you envision this relationship to go? And do you have maybe anymore plans to funnel more subscribers to The Wall Street Journal?","Robert Thomson","Well, the first two statistics to bear in mind is that, there are 189 million iPhones in \u2013 used in the U.S. and 1.4 billion iPhones active globally. So that\u2019s quite a broad deep and interesting user base. The Apple deal is important. We are proud to work with companies that value journalism and are popularizing a subscription mechanic.","There\u2019s just no doubt that we are reaching a far larger audience with Apple, readers who may have had preconceptions about The Wall Street Journal, and imagine that it was just the world\u2019s best business newspaper. Well, it\u2019s much more than that. It is the most trusted masthead in America. Its coverage of politics is by far the best in the business and its lifestyle and sports coverage is peerless.","There is no better wittiest sportswriter than Jason Gay, and I just hope my compliments don\u2019t go to his [or she did] [ph]. We are attracting more younger readers and more women from our internal data, that\u2019s very early obviously in the Apple relationship. But what we\u2019re not doing is compromising the business subscribers for whom we will provide even more specialist information.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Alexia. Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Entcho Raykovski of Credit Suisse.","Robert Thomson","Hi, Entcho.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi, Mike. Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. One question from me around the rate of digital revenue growth at News and Info Services. It appears to have slowed a little bit over the last couple of quarters. Susan, you mentioned that Dow Jones digital revenues hadn\u2019t been that strong for the quarter. Can you explain the dynamics which are going on there? Is there \u2013 I suspect there\u2019s no particular FX impact driving this, given it is within Dow Jones. And I guess what gives you confidence that this will improve into the last quarter and beyond?","Susan Panuccio","Hi, Entcho. Thanks for the question. I think \u2013 look at \u2013 you\u2019re right, there\u2019s no real FX impact coming through in those particular subscribers. I mean, what I would say is that the subscribers quarter-on-quarter do ebb and flow. We are happy actually with the growth that we\u2019ve seen with Wall Street this quarter and we do expect it actually to pick up into the next quarter as well.","But in addition to that, we have seen strong growth across our quality masthead around \u2013 within the UK and also within Australia. So I think overall, we are very comfortable with the level of growth that we\u2019ve got and we do expect that to continue.","Robert Thomson","And just to complement Susan\u2019s answer, Entcho, the decisive factor from a macro perspective, a strategic perspective is that more publishers are charging and more readers expect to be charged. That pattern has not been long and emerging. But as the sensibility is socialized, we should be able to charge higher prices for our great journalism. And are we at the end of that journey? Certainly not. But we have traveled further down the road that many people have imagined possible a couple of years ago.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Entcho. Todd, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Kane Hannan of Goldman Sachs.","Kane Hannan","Good morning, Robert and Susan. Just on that revenue slowdown at Move. Can you just comment on how much of that I suppose relates to the U.S. housing market and sort of macro weakness versus how much is coming from the four month delay in Opcity?","Robert Thomson","Well, the prevailing winds in the property market haven\u2019t been particularly auspicious. And I would cite them at this stage as being the most significant influencing factor. And obviously, we acquired Opcity with the aim of providing quality leads to realtors, value-added leads that genuinely add value for our customers and are valuable for us. And we\u2019re in the very early stage of its development. And clearly, there has been some investment to build up that platform, and that clearly has an impact on EBITDA.","But I would still remind you that core real estate revenue at realtor rose 14% year-on-year in that sluggish property market and that the audience in April did indeed rise to a record 69 million uniques. And that momentum has certainly continued in May according to our Journal figures.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Kane. Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Alan Gould of Loop Capital.","Alan Gould","Thank you. I\u2019ve got a question for Robert and a question for Susan. Susan, first, the Foxtel debt, so you\u2019ve financed with some parent company loan. Just wondering why that wasn\u2019t just done as rolled over with some more non-recourse debt from Foxtel?","And then Robert, a bigger picture question. I was at the Fox meeting earlier this morning, and they\u2019ve really simplified that company. I mean, it took years in the making chase Carey Price talked about that five to 10 years ago. What is the process for News Corp to simplify itself?","Susan Panuccio","Alan, I\u2019ll go first. I think it\u2019s important to note that we actually do have a lot of flexibility internally and externally in relation to that financing. And what we do constantly balance is providing the right flexibility for that business at the appropriate cost. It\u2019s also important to note that we\u2019ve put it in as a shareholder loan, so we see that as optionality moving forward in relation to that.","Robert Thomson","Yes. Look, we\u2019re very happy with our asset mix. But it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re constantly reviewing that. And one thing that\u2019s not appreciated at times is the complementarity between those assets, for example, between realtor and our digital media properties which have played a crucial role in generating traffic for realtor.","And you can see from the two most significant investments we\u2019ve made, Move, realtor.com as it\u2019s better known, and Harlequin now a crucial part of HarperCollins that they have been transformative for both digital real estate and Book Publishing and have made us much more a digital company and much more a global company to the benefit of all investors. But we\u2019re constantly reviewing that portfolio to ensure that both in the medium and long-term that investor interest are taken care of.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Alan. Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you. Susan, maybe I missed this, but I always find it helpful when you can give the breakdown for the circulation revenue growth year-over-year with and without currency in your three main areas. And I also have a follow-up question, please.","Susan Panuccio","Yes, just in relation to circulation, so in local currency, Dow Jones was up 7%. Australia was up 3%. News UK was up 2%. So overall circulation revenues were up 4% in local currency.","Craig Huber","And what were those numbers with currency as we have right now?","Susan Panuccio","In currency, they were in my recorded remarks, which I shall just find. I can \u2013 why don\u2019t you ask your second question while the guys get that for me?","Craig Huber","Yes. Robert, on this Apple News, I\u2019m just curious you obviously thought long and hard about this before you put your Wall Street Journal content on there in terms of cannibalization from your digital product. But what percentage of your articles that you have on your main Wall Street Journal website or your main section of the newspaper are available on Apple News?","Robert Thomson","Well, what you have is The Wall Street Journal is obviously through a different prism, different configuration and it\u2019s designed for a general reader. And at the same time, we\u2019ve clearly enhanced the business experience on professional app. So that if you look now, for example, at the financial sector or the tech sector, that there are many more articles than there were a month ago.","So we\u2019re very conscious that it\u2019s a different audience and audience that may not have thought of itself as a Wall Street Journal audience. But we firmly believe that the number of people who will appreciate, benefit from and buy The Wall Street Journal will be enhanced by that partnership.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Susan Panuccio","And Craig, just in relation to the reported numbers, so UK down 4% and Australia down 7%, obviously, Down Jones in line.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Craig Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Eric Pan of JPMorgan.","Eric Pan","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong quarter. Two if I can. As the Game of Thrones comes to an end, does it make sense for you to renew your partnership with HBO when it comes due in a couple of years? And with regards to Kayo, it seems that you\u2019re adding subs at an annual pace of about 400,000. What percentage of households in Australia do you estimate are willing to pay for a sports-only OTT product? Is the ceiling the same as Foxtel or potentially lower?","Robert Thomson","Well, look, I wouldn\u2019t comment on upcoming contract negotiations other than to say that the Game of Thrones has been a tremendous hit for Foxtel and Foxtel Now in Australia. And again, it would be invidious to give you a hard and fast number. But what is very, very clear is that the growth in Kayo is significant, it\u2019s real. And we\u2019ve made clear that we\u2019re in a development phase and there will be investment, but we\u2019re already seeing the results of that investment.","Kayo has been in the market for barely six months and frankly, you\u2019re not just building a brand, but you\u2019re changing habits and meeting changing habits. And the key thing is that what is extremely clear from what we have seen in recent months is that Australians are prepared to pay for higher-quality content delivered when they want to watch, and it must be what they want to watch. And the great enduring myth was that Australians wouldn\u2019t pay. Australians are paying.","Susan Panuccio","Eric, just to follow-up to that just in relation to the market size. We obviously are looking at the market, the 70% of subscribers that don\u2019t take sports, and we know that our penetration has been for the 30% or just below that for quite sometime on the core broadcast product.","We also know from our research that there are about 6 million to 8 million Australians who are very passionate about sports. 70% of that group do not subscribe to Foxtel. And our research also estimates that 4 million of that group are willing to pay for content in some way, shape or form. So that\u2019s really the audience that we\u2019re aiming at.","Eric Pan","Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much. Todd, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Han of Morningstar.","Brian Han","Robert, you mentioned that you incorporate Netflix into your set-top box at Foxtel. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that, and what the commercial arrangement is?","Robert Thomson","Well, obviously, we can\u2019t go into the details of the commercial arrangement. But conceptually, we want Foxtel to be a broad platform to provide the services that Australian consumers want to use. And this particular deal is even \u2013 is indicative of that strategy.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Brian.","Brian Han","[Multiple Speakers]","Michael Florin","I\u2019m sorry.","Brian Han","[Multiple Speakers]","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have no further questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Todd, and thank you for all participating and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"15749":["News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call November  7, 2018  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Florin - SVP & Head, IR","Robert Thomson - CEO & Director","Susan Panuccio - CFO","Analysts","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Kane Hannan - Goldman Sachs Group ","Timothy Nollen - Macquarie Research","Alan Gould - Loop Capital Markets","Eric Pan - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Brian Han - Morningstar Inc.","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the News Corp First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. The conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd now like to turn today's call over to Mike Florin, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Carrie. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. ","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Mike. Fiscal year 2019 is off to an impressive start with growth in revenue and earnings reaffirming our strategy to become increasingly digital and global and to put renewed emphasis on subscriptions in a choppy advertising market. ","We are committed to extracting a premium for our premium content regardless of the platform on which it is published. In the first quarter, News Corp saw growth in revenues and total segment EBITDA, with Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing continuing to thrive and with the strong expansion in digital subscribers across our news businesses. ","Meanwhile, at Foxtel, which has added significantly to our consolidated revenue and EBITDA, the transformation of the company continue to pace. In summary, reported revenues grew 23% to $2.5 billion for the quarter while reported total segment EBITDA expanded 44% to $358 million. These numbers are noteworthy as, even excluding the Foxtel consolidation, we achieved tangible increases over the same period last year. ","In this era of big digital, with its blandishments and banishments, our editors and journalists have consistently reminded readers of their value as trusted sources of real news delivered in real time and with real context. The transition to digital continues, and we will strive as a company to change the contours of the content landscape for the sake of our businesses and our societies.","We are in active negotiations with Google, Facebook and Amazon, and we are in discussions with lawmakers and regulators in Europe, U.K., Australia and the U.S. There is finally a more sophisticated debate about prominence and propriety in these countries, after more than a decade of effort from Rupert Murdoch and the News Corp team.","Our victory over the punitive First Click Free was just a start, and it certainly assisted quality publishers around the world. And Rupert's proposal for a content carriage fee is rightly gathering momentum.","Turning to our business performance. I want to start with the News and Information Services segment, which has shown progress during challenging times for media companies generally. At Dow Jones, print advertising revenues showed significant improvement and had their best performance in the last three years. Total circulation revenue continued to grow, led by a 9% expansion at The Wall Street Journal. Creativity and quality still resonate with readers and advertisers, which is also why subscriptions are growing at Dow Jones. ","The Professional Information Business continues to expand, with Risk and Compliance growing this past quarter recording a 27% increase in revenues. A few weeks ago, I visited the Risk and Compliance Asia hub in Shanghai where the region is experiencing particularly strong growth. Chinese companies are increasingly conscious of risk in international markets. And international companies must ensure that they are compliant across jurisdictions when they do business in China. Meanwhile, WSJ Magazine celebrated its 10th anniversary with the biggest issue ever, driving record advertising revenue. ","At News UK, we again increased our print market share for both The Times and The Sun, and each remains the clear category leader. The Times reported growth in print advertising revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. And we continue to see the evolution of the digital product with subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times up 24% year-over-year, while The Sun was confirmed as the number one news brand across both print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.","In August, we ended our Sun Bets joint venture with Tabcorp, with whom we are proud to have partnered. Both companies learned much from the venture. And we, in particular, saw the power of our mastheads in driving digital audiences to complementary commercial offerings. ","We see that complementarity at Wireless Group with talkSPORT assisting in the development of the Sun brand and vice versa. We believe our ability to maximize the value of content and talent and to drive audiences from brand-to-brand is a clear comparative advantage. Wireless also showed its intent and ambition by hiring the uniquely talented Chris Evans, who will undoubtedly lead a renaissance at Virgin Radio.","Meanwhile, in Australia, digital subscriptions rose 18% this quarter and digital advertising grew strongly, thanks in part to the strength of news.com.au, Australia's leading digital news brand. And at The Australian, digital subscriptions continue to account for more than half of the total subscriber list. ","News Corp Australia has also seen benefits from its joint print and distribution agreement with Fairfax. We are talking with publishers around the world about common sense cost sharing while enhancing our unique attributes, and we believe there is more room for further savings of this collective kind in the U.K. and the U.S.","Our team in Australia has been decidedly diligent since we brought together Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. We have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology, including a more sophisticated set-top box, the iQ4. This is patently a period of transition, but News Corp has successfully overseen the transformation of realtor.com, the digitalization of our newspapers and the digital journey of HarperCollins. ","It is clear that many more Australians than previously presumed are prepared to pay for OTT services, and we believe that we have, by far, the best content offering with the latest technology and not incidentally a new marketing turn.","Our soon-to-be-launched AT&T Sport offering will have 30,000 live hours of aggregated sports content, including rights for all major local sports and the most compelling overseas offerings. As for our fastest revenue growth segment, Digital Real Estate, at Move, the home of realtor.com, real estate revenues rose 19% year-on-year, while overall revenues including B2P software and advertising expanded 10%. It's worth noting that we have nearly doubled revenues at Move since we acquired the company four years ago. ","We made another important acquisition in recent months, Opcity, a market leader in providing professionals with the highest quality leads, matching qualified buyers with realtors in real time. REA group posted another robust quarter, clearly standing apart from the domestic competition. We remain excited about REA's expansion with Smartline and Hometrack Australia and new products that strengthen the company's lead.","In Book Publishing, HarperCollins once again delivered a strong performance this quarter, driven by previously released bestsellers and the excitement over new frontlist titles like Daniel Silva's The Other Woman; Greg Jarrett's The Russia Hoax; and Heather Morris' The Tattooist of Auschwitz. Yesterday, we celebrated the release of Homebody from Joanna Gaines, half of The Magnolia Story duo. Unsurprisingly, it went straight to the top of U.S. bestseller list and is replete with warmth, wit and wisdom.","Meanwhile, in children's books, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas remains as the best-selling young adult hardcover, benefiting from the synergistic movie release in October. One particularly significant trend continues to be the rapid growth of digital audio, which expanded 55% this quarter over the prior year. We are in discussions with several Chinese audio publishers, who are also experiencing express growth in their market, which has been complicated in the past by a lack of IP protection and the proliferation of piracy. There has obviously been a fundamental shift in listening habits not just in the U.S. but globally.","Just over five years since our rebirth, News Corp is leading the evolution of news and media internationally and will continue to quest for provenance and for profits. Clearly, we believe many of our companies are in the midst of a successful journey to a more lucrative future. At a time of such profound change in these sectors, it behooves us to hold our nerve and to navigate with conviction and with concern for all our shareholders. These are certainly times of great challenge but of even greater opportunity for News Corp, for our audiences and advertisers and for our investors.","And now Susan will give a more granular look at a strong set of numbers.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Before I review the results, I wanted to highlight a few things from this quarter. We continue to take steps to stabilize News and Information Services. We are seeing strong growth in digital paid sales while balancing that with ongoing cost efficiencies, including industry solutions. There's still plenty of work to do, but I'm pleased with our progress in the start to the fiscal year. Our revenue mix within the segment is also improving with advertising now making up less than 50% of revenue.","In Digital Real Estate Services, we completed the acquisition of Opcity to Move last month for approximately $210 million, including certain deferred payments and stock bonds. As Robert mentioned, this is a leading best-in-breed real estate tech platform that expands realtor.com's offerings to include a success-based concierge model for prequalified transaction-ready leads. Realtor has made significant progress and remains an area we continue to believe is important to both capital reinvestment and to value creation.","We are making progress at Foxtel. The team is working hard on the launch of its sports-only OTT product while making significant improvements to our core broadcast offerings. We have restructured the management team, adding key expertise and that team is now heavily focused on further improvements to reinvigorate the new Foxtel.","The performance of HarperCollins this quarter again underscores the value of premium content and global scale, posting another quarter of robust EBITDA growth despite more challenging prior year comparables.","With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results in more detail. We reported fiscal 2019 first quarter total revenues of over $2.5 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, which reflects the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, unfavorable currency impact and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues grew 4%.","Reported total segment EBITDA was $358 million, up 44% versus the prior year. As a reminder, last year included a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of accrued net liabilities relating to certain employment taxes in the U.K. Whilst this year, our results include the consolidation of Foxtel and a $48 million benefit from Tabcorp related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 37%.","For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.17 as compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were also $0.17 in the quarter versus $0.07 in the prior year.","Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. The quarter included the settlement payment to Sun Bets but also a $28 million negative impact related to currency. Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%; News UK rose 12%; News Australia declined 7%; and News America Marketing fell 6%. More details will be disclosed in the 10-Q tomorrow.","Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of segment revenues and were down 7% versus the prior year with approximately $15 million or 1\/3 of the decline due to currency fluctuations. Across our portfolio, advertising trends were mixed. While print advertising trends remain under pressure, we saw improvements at Dow Jones combined with continued healthy digital advertising growth in Australia and the U.K.","At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were relatively flat with the prior year, excluding the impact of the closure of the Wall Street International print editions in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. It is worth highlighting that this was the best advertising performance by Dow Jones in recent quarters. ","At News Australia, advertising declined 11% or down just 4% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the fourth quarter rate. The decrease was due to ongoing weakness in the print advertising market, which was partially offset by digital advertising growth notably at news.com.au. News UK was weaker this quarter with advertising down 10% versus the prior year in both reported and local currency due mostly to softer print trends at The Sun. ","News America Marketing fell 6% due to weak home-delivered revenues, which include free-standing inserts, partially offset by modest domestic in-store revenue growth and improving digital revenues. This quarter, domestic in-store was the biggest contributor to revenues within News America Marketing.","Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 2%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $10 million or 1%. We are continuing to see healthy digital subscriber growth, which is helping to underpin our improved performance. ","At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%. And at The Wall Street Journal they grew 9%, benefiting from strong growth in its digital-only subscribers, which were up 20% year-over-year. We raised subscription prices this quarter ranging from $2 to $6 per month, which will be phased in to existing members throughout the year. ","In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 24% to 263,000 and also at News Australia up 18% to over 442,000. In the U.K. and Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales mostly offset print volume decline. The segment is continuing to transition to digital with total digital revenues up to 33% of revenues from 27% in the prior year, partially due to the payment related to Sun Bets in the U.K. For Dow Jones and our mastheads, digital revenues were 37%.","Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $116 million, up 57%, which included higher contributions from Dow Jones and News Australia, along with the onetime impact at News UK. ","At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, as Robert mentioned, notably in the U.S., which exceeded our expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 4% to $418 million and segment EBITDA increased 42% to $68 million. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 55% of consumer revenues in the quarter. ","Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter and represented 22% of consumer revenues, up from 21% last year. Digital audio continues to drive robust results, up over 50% and accounting for over 30% of digital revenues.","At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 8% to $293 million, partially impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange. REA Group revenues grew 9% or 18% in local currency due to strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including high penetration for premier or an increased yield, the expansion of financial services and modest contribution from the Home Track acquisition. Revenue growth was partially impacted by a 3% decline in listing volume. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, which just concluded, for additional detail.","Move revenues rose 10% to $118 million versus the prior year, driven by the continued growth of its Connections for Buyers product. As Robert noted, real estate revenues, which include listing and lead-based product and accounts for approximately 75% of revenues, grew 19% this quarter. This was partially offset by reduced display advertising as part of a broader initiative to enhance the user experience and drive engagement and listing.","Early results have been promising with Connections for Buyers' lead volume growth rates improving versus the fourth quarter while continuing to maintain higher yield per customer. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 60 million for the quarter, rising 9% versus the prior year.","Reported segment EBITDA was up 11% to $105 million. And on an adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 16%. The team at realtor are focused on the integration and operation of Opcity, which closed on the 11th of October. Expanding broker and agent adoption, improving lead volume and using data machine learning to improve conversion rates will be a key focus. We will be managing the transition of leads from Connections for Buyers to Opcity, pending customer demand. Finally, it is important to note that Opcity is a referral model and we recognize revenues on transaction closing.","Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, which as you may recall, includes new Foxtel and Sky News. Revenues were $565 million versus the reported $145 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $113 million versus $27 million in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, revenues in the quarter declined 17% compared to revenues of $680 million in the prior year, with foreign currency impacting revenues by $45 million or 7% of the decline.","Operationally, the revenue decline was driven by lower subscription revenues; including a mix shift to lower-priced packages; lower advertising revenue; and a difficult year-on-year comparison in pay-per-view, which last year included the Macgregor-Mayweather fight. In addition, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard reduced revenues by $4 million.","It is also worth noting that the revenue trends for TV subscriptions, which make up the bulk of the revenues, were relatively stable with the fourth quarter. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined 27% compared to the $154 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, partially offset by a 19% decrease in operating expenses, which includes lower nonsports programming costs and a $6 million benefit related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.","On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were over 2.9 million as of September 30, which is up versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers from Fox Sports Australia, offset by lower broadcast subscribers and the closure and wind-down of T-Box and Optus subscription.","In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 12.9% versus 12.7% in the prior year. ARPU was AUD 76, down about 6%. However, excluding the new revenue standard, ARPU would have been about AUD 2 higher per month and down about 4% versus the prior year, similar to recent trends.","The next 12 months will see the new Foxtel business focusing on three key priorities: firstly to stabilize and revitalize the poor broadcast business, which today accounts for the majority of the revenues and EBITDA. This will be done by improving the content offering and the great marketing presence. Product improvements introduced include the new iQ4 set-top box, Foxtel 4K, Fox Cricket, Foxtel Go, Fox Flicks and Fox Showcase. We believe premium sports is a large competitive advantage and having the recently acquired domestic cricket rights and a dedicated network should help improve churn, significantly enhance our spring and summer schedule and drive subscription growth.","The team will also focus on: expanding our penetration of next-generation boxes, which is a much better user experience and accounted over 10% increase in build ARPU per month; double the pay-per-view buy rates; and higher retention. Currently about 35% of customers have either the iQ3 or iQ4. So far, the reaction in the market to the iQ4 has been very positive, and upgrades are trending above initial expectations, delivering over 47,000 upgrades in the first quarter.","Finally, the Foxtel team has been upgrading the customer service function, and this team will be focused on improving save rates and better optimizing offers. ","The second key priority within the segment is to launch multiple OTT offerings in order to provide new revenue streams for the company aimed at maximizing reach and leveraging our rights over a large base. We are building state-of-the-art customer-centric platforms with selling, streaming and billing to provide a seamless customer experience. ","The first product launch on the new platform will be the sports-only product. We expect, as Robert mentioned, a soft beta launch for web-only access imminently and plan to expand to iOS and Android and other connected devices soon thereafter.","The third key priority will be focused on cost initiative to create room for growth, which include the migration of cable onto a pure satellite IP network and a wider focus on overhead costs. ","I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal second quarter. At News and Information Services, we remain focused on digital subscriber growth and seeking cost efficiencies as the advertising market remains challenged. I'll also remind you that News UK received a onetime benefit relating to Sun Bets in the first quarter. In Subscription Video services, we will launch our sports OTT product and begin to amortize the Cricket Australia rights. Rights and production costs related to Cricket should be around $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter. ","In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited by the upcoming release of Joanna Gaines' Homebody in November. We also have Mitch Albom's The Next Person You Meet in Heaven; and Justin Timberlake's Hindsight & All The Things I Can't See in Front of Me, in addition to strong backlist sales. ","At Digital Real Estate Services, we will begin reporting the Opcity acquisition, which should drive higher revenue growth, although we will have about $3 million per quarter in costs relating to the deferred payments and equity grant. ","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Entcho Raykovski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Entcho Raykovski","My question is around Subscription Video Services. Firstly, could you let us know how much was spent in Q1 on investment into the OTT products? Obviously, that's a focus that you've mentioned. So just interested in how much was spent and how that investment is then expected to be phased over the remainder of the year. And as a follow-on to that question, following the launch of the packages, how do you think about the addressable market? Where do you think penetration can get to? Obviously, you've been sitting around that 2.8 million, 2.9 million mark so just interested about how you're thinking about additional subs.","Robert Thomson","Entcho, I think it's fair to say that what we see in the Australian market in recent years that the presumption of a ceiling on the number of Australians willing to pay for television services and services delivered across other platforms, that, that ceiling no longer exists. And having broken through that ceiling, it creates extra opportunities for the highest quality provider. And we are certainly, in terms of programming, the highest quality provider, like in terms of sports, entertainment, documentaries, children's programming. But we haven't, in the past, delivered those services in the way that potential customers have necessarily wanted. So as you know, we have new leadership, we have new technology. We have a new marketing team. And we are genuinely confident that this confluence of an expanded market and an improved product will make a difference to our percentage share.","Susan Panuccio","And Entcho, just in relation to OTT, we haven't given out the investment numbers in relation to that. But what we have said, and we said this on the last call, we spent about $285 million in CapEx last financial year at Foxtel. And we expect the investment to be at least $50 million higher than that in the current year. And at this stage, we're currently expecting that, that will come in line. We, obviously, when we launched the product, we will have marketing costs that will be associated with the OTT program. So that will come in, in the first quarter -- or in the second quarter and obviously will continue somewhat through the balance of the year. And just as a note, we spent about $69 million of CapEx in relation to Q1, which is flat, relatively speaking, year-on-year.","Operator","Our next question will be from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","My question's on the News and Information Services segment and the strong growth you're seeing in digital subscribers. I guess, any color can you give us on the opportunity for further growth, really sort of how big is the potential opportunity in your opinion, how that may differ by market obviously? And then just my follow-up would be a quick question on HarperCollins. When you look at the pipeline of books out there going into the next calendar year and even the fourth quarter, any sense on how those skew physical versus digital?","Robert Thomson","Alexia, look, obviously, we're doing a lot to change the contents of the -- content marketplace. And the whole subscription scenario has fundamentally changed recently, and in large part, because of the work that News Corporation has done in convincing Google to get rid of First Click Free, which is really punishing premium content. So one thing I'd like to say, if any other publisher around the world, which is now profiting from our efforts would like to send us commission checks, we're welcome to that. The -- really varies paper-by-paper and country-by-country. I'll focus on Dow Jones because it's obviously the largest of our properties. But what we're seeing two phenomena, which are fruitful: one, continuing to use artificial intelligence to identify, through propensity modeling, new customers and using that modeling as well to provide them with a more satisfying experience; and two, from that, an ability to upsell those customers to higher value-added products from our Professional Information Services.","Susan Panuccio","And I think if we just focus on Dow Jones, obviously, the size of the market within the U.S. is very large as well as internationally. And just to give you sort of a sense, we had about 93 million nonsubscriber website visitors in Q1 made up of first-time repeats and even former subscription visitors. So there is a big opportunity, obviously, within that pool of people to drive conversions. And The Wall Street Journal customer base is only 11% made up of international subscription. And given the brand and the strength of that brand on a global scale, we do expect to see growth within international going forward.","Robert Thomson","And as for HarperCollins, Alexia, as you can see from the results quarter-after-quarter, the team has done a wonderful job in identifying talent and having natural empathy that you need not only to satisfy current demand but to anticipate future demand. And that's particularly so as I said with the release this very week of Homebody, which we have great expectations on and the other authors that I mentioned. But it's a tribute, one, to the ability of Brian Murray and his team and Charlie Redmayne in the U.K.; two, put together groups of editors, who can get the best out of authors and then to make the most of the product by marketing it in a clever way, and also being open to do opportunities, which is what you see with the exponential increase in digital audiobooks. And we're very optimistic, as I mentioned, not only about the opportunity in the U.S. but actually around the world, where the same trend is now preeminent. And in that sense, the team deserves particular praise because, at HarperCollins, we have been the author of our own success.","Operator","Our next question will be from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.","Kane Hannan","Can you just provide a little bit more color around the Opcity business, the strategy for integrating that into Move and how the economic program of Opcity lead is compared to a Connections for Buyer lead? And then just one quick one, just on the Sun Bets payment of $48 million, just confirming that's $48 million in EBITDA for the NIS in the quarter?","Susan Panuccio","So just in relation to Sun Bets, yes, it is. We obviously got net offset for coming to that, but yes, the gross payment was $48 million and it dropped to EBITDA.","Robert Thomson","And with the Opcity integration, clearly, we're integrating Opcity not just into realtor but actually into the broader News Corp because it is the complementarity of our platform that has been behind the successful growth and turnaround story really that is realtor.com. Essentially, we believe that realtors should have a choice between quantity leads and quality leads and that they should be appropriately priced. And so we're very much focused on realtors and on buyers and sellers. We're not interested in house flipping, as I said, in other company. And so we do see a lot of loyalty. When you look at the other company's business and there's a fair amount of churn there among their clients, probably more churn than you find in the average butter factory, it is our intent with Opcity to be absolutely focused on realtor leads. And the product of that, we expect in the second half is a significantly higher rate of growth in overall revenue at realtor.com of the order of the mid- to high teens, which, compared to the 10-or-so percent in the quarter just completed, is obviously a tangible increase.","Susan Panuccio","And I think the other thing that's important to note in relation to that is that realtor will be managing the conversion from leads coming in into Opcity to make sure that the customer experience is optimal. And so that may fluctuate as we go throughout the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Timothy Nollen","I have a question about costs, particularly in Australia. I may have missed the News [indiscernible] side how you manage to get some nice EBITDA expansion, I think you mentioned in Australia, despite some revenue declines there. I know you've been doing some cost-out efforts for a while there and maybe that's all that was, a better base. And then similarly on the Subscription Video Side, it looks like some good operating cost cuts. Despite the fact that a lot of those costs are sports-related, I wouldn't think you'd have to adjust to put cost out. Wondering if you could help us maybe quantify a bit more how much the pay-per-view fight contributed to the revenue and the cost differential or how else you managed to save costs in that business.","Susan Panuccio","So just taking News Australia first. I think the team has done a great job at looking at the overall cost bases in that business. And obviously, it's quite large from a geographical perspective. They have been working on industry solutions. They have been looking at editorial savings, production savings, back-office savings. They obviously get the benefit of lower newsprint coming through because of the volumes. And they've also been looking at distribution savings. So they've been going really hard on this with the organizational structure and design and taking cost out where they think it's not going to impact on the end product. So I think they have been very focused on that. They obviously have got the benefit of the cost-out in the previous year. From an annualized perspective it's going through into this year, but they also have to be looking at other cost opportunities in the current year. Just in relation to Subscription Video Services. So your question, can you maybe just repeat your question again in relation to that?","Timothy Nollen","Yes, it's kind of a two part thing. Just trying to understand with the fight and the revenue recognition, I think you gave some comments on that. I just wondered if possible to quantify what the revenue and cost differential was there on the fight and any other item. What I'm trying to understand is how you managed to save a fair amount of operating costs, given a lot of sports rights generally in the mix.","Susan Panuccio","So on pay-per-view, it's about $10 million to $12 million in Q1 so that gives you a quantification of that. And revenue recognition was about $4 million in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question will be from Alan Gould with Loop Capital.","Alan Gould","I know it's just the first quarter that you've consolidated Foxtel with the Australian sports. But I'm just wondering, what sort of time frame should we be looking for and what sort of metrics we'd be looking for to see the success of turning around Foxtel?","Robert Thomson","Well, clearly, we're at an early stage. We're early in the season, we're early in the cricket season in Australia. We're early in the season of renaissance at Foxtel. I would look, really, over the next 12 months, particularly the takeout of the OTT in coming months, then ahead of the next winter sports season in Australia, so the selling season there is sort of in the February, March, April peak selling season, and keep an eye both on the number of new customers and obviously the ARPU. But to be very clear, benchmarks over the coming year, it'll be obvious to you, and we're going to make it obvious to you how we're faring. But we have full confidence in Patrick Delany and the new team and it is an overhauled team. And the early indications are that they have both an understanding of the opportunity, empathy with potential customers and kind of real energy that has brought new life to Foxtel. And so one, it's a great opportunity for the company; and two, the metrics will be very clear.","Operator","Our next question will be from Eric Pan with JPMorgan.","Eric Pan","So just a little bit more on realtor.com, visitor growth there seems to be slowing. Can you talk a little bit about your strategy there to try to boost the visitorship, where you're focusing your energy? And then [indiscernible] you're saying you acquired a mortgage business. Do you foresee either Move or realtor going to the ancillary businesses as well?","Robert Thomson","Well, first of all, the audience growth was certainly greater than that of the competitor in the most recent quarter. And core real estate revenue growth was 19%. The overall was 10%, in part, because we consciously reduced the number of advertisements on the side. We're experimenting with user experience. And we can, frankly, turn that dial up and down as and when we choose. But we're obviously constantly trying to improve the experience, both for users on the site and obviously for our realtor clients. Our focus over the next year will be the integration of Opcity because we believe there really is an opportunity in providing quality leads to realtors and being able to price those leads in a way that reflects our contribution to their success.","Operator","Our next question will be from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","This $48 million revenue benefit from Sun Bets definitely sounds like it's onetime in nature. I guess, I'm just surprised it wasn't taken out of your adjusted EBITDA number. Is there a reason why? I'm just curious. And then secondly, I have a similar question to earlier, somebody else. In your Subscription Video Services, it looked like costs are down, based on Page 19, roughly about 14%, maybe down roughly 7% adjusting for currency. What drove the costs to be down that much, given with the programming costs, were up pretty nicely, right, probably at least mid-single digits or so?","Susan Panuccio","So just in relation to the Sun Bets, it was actually partly operational in nature because the settlement of that was effectively the payout of a contract, bringing forward effectively the minimum revenue guarantee that we had within that contract. So obviously, there's the termination payments in there as well, but the bulk of it was operational. And as a consequence that's why we reported it the way we did. In relation to Subscription Video Services and the costs, we did see cost reductions coming through from nonprogramming as well as some of the program. We didn't have some of the year-on-year costs that we talked about on the pay-per-view, which was $12 million. We didn't have sports, some of the sports costs that came in relative to Q1 of the previous year, but they also are working hard on some of the overhead costs in the background. So they have been looking at driving costs out in the back office, as we said, in order to provide a runway for investment going forward.","Operator","Our next question will be from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","In the books division, can you please explain the big margin improvement in the quarter despite just a 4% revenue increase? I mean, the big growth in digital audio can make up for all that, can it?","Susan Panuccio","Part of the reason obviously is because of the backlist. We get higher margins obviously as they come through from a backlist perspective relative to the frontlist, where we're obviously paying large all throughout [indiscernible] we have. So that's really is what's helping drive that margin improvement.","Brian Han","Susan -- and what was the increase in the backlist revenue during the quarter versus B2P?","Susan Panuccio","We had a backlist that contributed to about 55% of the revenues. I don't have the percentage here in front of me of what that movement was quarter-on-quarter but it contributed 55% to the overall revenues.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Mike Florin.","Michael Florin","Great. Thank you, Carrie, and thank you for participating. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"15745":["News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call November  9, 2017  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Mike Florin - Senior Vice President and Head, Investor Relations","Robert Thomson - Chief Executive Officer","Susan Panuccio - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Brian Han - Morningstar","Raymond Tong - Evans and Partners","Brian Han - Morningstar","Operator","Please standby. We\u2019re about to begin. Good day. And welcome to the News Corp.\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Media is allowed to join today\u2019s conference in a listen-only basis.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Florin","Thank you very much Janet. Hello, everyone. And welcome to News Corp.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2018 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago and it is now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and then we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp.\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp.\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson, for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. Our new fiscal year is off to a sterling start, with robust results reflecting our steadfast strategy to pursue global and digital expansion, and to create a cogently balanced revenue mix.","In the first quarter, revenues and EBITDA increased across every segment of our business compared to the same quarter last year, with particularly strong growth in digital real estate, where we continue to be the world\u2019s largest and leading company.","In summary, revenues grew 5% to $2.1 billion and reported total segment EBITDA grew 92% to reach $249 million, up from $130 million in the prior year. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 46%. Reported earnings per share grew to $0.12 versus loss of $0.03 in the prior year.","These results truly underscore the increasing strength of digital real estate and how it has positively transformed the character of News Corp., and positioned us for further growth in the future. We can also see the tangible benefits of our sustained commitment to cost reduction, while we continue to invest in the highest quality content.","In August, we and Telstra in Australia announced a non-binding agreement to combine Foxtel and FOX SPORTS, with News Corp owning 65% of the new company. Pending definitive documentation and regulatory approval, we expect to close in the first half of calendar year 2018.","Combining Foxtel and FOX SPORTS and providing News Corp with majority control should give us a better opportunity to take advantage of fortified scale to leverage our immensely valuable sports and entertainment rights, as well as a boosting our ability to collect commissioned customer data.","We await regulatory approval and discussion over details continues with our partner, Telstra. But once completed, the combined company is expected to make a substantial contribution to our revenue and EBITDA and fundamentally transform the nature of News Corp.","There was another fundamental change last month, which also bodes well for our future and that of other premium news provider. Google said it would end First Click Free, a seemingly innocently titled policy that undermined business models and damaged providence in societies by banishing premium subscription content.","As many of you are aware, Rupert, Lachlan and I, along with our colleagues at News Corp have long taken a principled and often solitary stand to protect intellectual property and safeguard journalism, so we appreciate this significant first step taken by Google.","We will of course be monitoring the effect of this change across our mastheads even as we continue our discussions with Google and with Facebook about the ways we can profitably connect readers with our mastheads.","We continue to be deeply concerned by the abusive algorithms and by an adulterated digital ad market, which had promised transparency, but has delivered opacity, undermining the confidence of advertisers in the digital marketplace. It is clear that advertisers want their products to be promoted on sites that enhance, not tarnish their image and that they want metrics that are reliable, not risible.","And while on the subject of premium content, let us delve into the News and Information segment, which fared well this quarter, with digital subscriptions up at The Wall Street Journal and at other mastheads across the company. Despite the continued challenging advertising trends, our cost consciousness and steady circulation growth helped to drive EBITDA growth of 59% in the segment.","At Dow Jones, digital accounted for 60% of revenues, a record number. Circulation revenues grew 11% and professional information business revenues increased by 5%, led by risk and compliance with a strong 35% increase year-over-year.","We saw continued subscriber volume growth at The Wall Street Journal with over 2.2 million total subscribers, approximately 60% of them digital. The ongoing implementation of the WSJ 2020 strategy helped to reduce costs, while increasing efficiency.","At the New York Post, we saw digital audience growth of 30% to 84 million unique visitors in September compared to the prior year. Clearly, our U.S. mastheads have a large audience, respected brands and measurable meaningful metrics.","With the upcoming launch of News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, we will leverage our quality journalism to connect advertisers with our fast growing U.S. audience, which reached 115 million monthly unique visitors in September. That number is de-duped unlike many inflated numbers in the digital world, better to be de-duped than duped.","At news in Australia, we emerged as the number one digital network across all key categories. And total digital subscribers across our mastheads including ARM grew more than 30% to over 375,000. Meanwhile, costs continue to be diligently managed by Michael Miller and his team as the composition of the business evolves. Susan Panuccio will explain shortly in more detail.","At News U.K., Sun Digital continues to outpace the competition in growth across all devices with 85 million monthly average unique globally in the quarter based on [ph] IDCE (7:09). We are also gaining on the competition in the U.K. and according to comScore U.K., Sun Digital is now the largest news brand on mobile in the U.K. Audience engagement is on the rise and digital advertising revenues doubled versus the prior year.","This summer saw the launch of the Sun Savers Digital Reward program targeted for casual print buyers. By the end of the first quarter there were approximately 300,000 registered users, each of whom had provided extra day to intelligence in return for genuine discounts from select Sun partners.","Total subscriptions were up across The Times and The Sunday Times as well, exceeding 450,000 at quarter\u2019s end, driven in part by new subscriptions campaign. Digital subscriptions grew 17% in the quarter to 212,000, proving that high quality journalism will attract a discerning paying audience.","Meanwhile at Wireless Group, which Rebekah Brooks and her team have successfully integrated, we saw the arrival of high profile talent, particularly at talkSPORT radio, spurring both digital audience growth and internet-only listening. We have also made progress with exclusive sports rights, including a four-fight boxing package and the NFL, which is growing in popularity in the U.K.","In a world of murky social media and user generated content, which is too often abuser generated content, Storyful is playing an increasing -- increasingly important role verifying facts and assisting companies and brands subject to virulent attacks. Storyful under its new CEO, Sharb Farjami, can not only sit fact from fiction but provide risk analysis for its expanding roster of clients.","Turning to digital real estate, overall segment EBITDA is up 42% with 20% revenue growth, meaning that the segment was once again the biggest contributor to News Corp\u2019s profitability. At Move, home of Realtor.com, we saw core real estate revenues grow 21% as the U.S. property market continued its gradual recovery from the financial crisis.","From a macro perspective, only 5.4% of mortgage holders were underwater compared to 7.1% last year and a peak of 26% in 2009 according to CoreLogic. Overall revenue growth of 15% was partially offset by the $3 million decline in revenue associated with the TigerLead divestiture last November when we chose to focus on the core leads in listening space business. Excluding the impact from the sale, we saw growth at Move of 19% in total, putting it in prime position to benefit from the continuing recovery in real estate.","We are also increasing our focus on New York City, where Realtor.com is developing its services, brand and reputation, taking advantage of the conflict between a lesser competitor and real estate companies, agents and brokers, who have wearied of its arrogance and impetuosity, and who rightly fear its long-term ambition to disintermediate agents and brokers. Across the nation Realtor.com has the most MLS listed for sale homes that are updated every 15 minutes to the benefit of vendors, potential buyers and realtors.","In Australia at REA, we\u2019re empowering consumers with REA\u2019s acquisition of Smartline, a savvy mortgage broking franchise and its new home loan business, which is being developed in conjunction with National Australia Bank. Building the financial segment of the business has been an important component of REA\u2019s growth strategy and the extension into the more huge broker business is a sensible step forward.","Meanwhile, REA remains the clear leader in Australia\u2019s digital real estate markets, with the listing environment performing particularly well in Sydney and Melbourne, and the core residential business remaining very strong.","We saw another solid quarter in Book Publishing, where HarperCollins experienced both revenue and EBITDA growth, powered by the continued success of Hillbilly Elegy and The Subtle Art of Not Giving an Expletive, as well as the strength of new releases such as Daniel Silva\u2019s House of Spies, Karin Slaughter\u2019s The Good Daughter and others.","New for the second quarter, we have Capital Gaines by Chip Gaines, the latest addition of the popular series, The Pioneer Woman Cooks by Ree Drummond and Bruce Dickinson\u2019s autobiography. As you erudite folk on the call well appreciate, Mr. Dickinson is the lead vocalist of Iron Maiden.","Looking ahead, HarperCollins is taking advantage of its global English rights to Agatha Christie\u2019s Murder on the Orient Express to market the book in conjunction with the imminent release of Fox\u2019s movie of the same name. The denouement is worth the price of both the film and the book.","At Foxtel, there was improved volume growth in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year led by the strength of Foxtel Now. Foxtel also benefited from lower churn in the quarter and this week, the company announced the launch of a new IP streaming device as it focuses on improving the user experience.","FOX SPORTS Australia had revenue growth due to higher affiliate revenues, which more than offset lower ad revenues and the network also saw a boost from the McGregor Mayweather fight, which highlighted the potential value of pay-per-view offerings in a sports hungry Australia.","We\u2019re excited about the upcoming launch of Watch NRL, a global IP product, which follows the success of Watch IFL as we continue to expand the breadth of product offering of FOX SPORTS Australia and proselytize the virtues of Australian sports.","Before I turn things over to our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, it is worth reiterating that our first quarter was an auspicious way to begin a new fiscal year, with revenue growth and increased profitability across the company.","We saw the fruits of much labor to make this a more global and digital company, one increasingly defined by its growing digital real estate business and complemented by more recurring revenues from our cable and satellite businesses, and subscription media offerings.","We do have reason for optimism about the future of our premium mastheads in light of Google\u2019s reforms and our ongoing discussions with Facebook. And most importantly, because of the enduring quality of our journalism, across our properties, we believe in providence and assure that increasingly there will be a premium for the premium.","Over to you, Susan.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials, we delivered very strong operating results for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. We reported fiscal 2018 first quarter total revenues of around $2.1 billion, an increase of $93 million or 5% compared to the prior year. Of that increase, acquisitions and divestments accounted for $51 million and currency added $26 million, with the balance being operational, excluding those items adjusted revenues grew 1%.","Reported total segment EBITDA was $249 million, compared to $130 million in the prior year, up 92% versus the prior year. Reported results include a benefit of $46 million from the reversal of previously accrued net liabilities related to certain employment taxes in the U.K.","Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestments, foreign currency and the U.K. newspaper matters, adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew 46%. For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.12, compared to a loss of $0.03 in the prior year and adjusted earnings per share were $0.07, compared to a loss of $0.01 in the prior year.","Turning now to the individual operating segments, in News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year. The Wireless Group and the Australian Regional Media or ARM acquisitions contributed $54 million and FX contributed $14 million this quarter. Within segment revenues, advertising was flat and circulation and subscription revenues increased 3%.","News and Information Services reported segment EBITDA this quarter was $73 million or up 59% versus the prior year, led by an improvement at Dow Jones, ongoing cost initiatives, lower investment spending at Checkout 51 and the absence of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Wireless Group in the prior year.","I will now look at the performance for the quarter across our key operation divisions. At Dow Jones total revenues rose 2%. Within that advertising revenue declined 10% versus the prior year and saw a modest improvement from the fourth quarter decline due to a slight uplift in financial spending, while the business to consumer and technology categories remained challenging. Digital accounted for approximately 38% of Dow Jones advertising revenues this quarter, the highest percentage in its history, up from 33% in financial year \u201817.","Total subscriber volumes at The Wall Street Journal across all formats was over 2.2 million, a 13% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital only subscriptions, which rose approximately 36% versus the prior year to $1.3 million and represented 58% of the total subscribers versus 48% in the prior year. Year-over-year circulation revenue growth at Dow Jones was 11% for the quarter, driven by the digital volume gains and higher subscription pricing.","As mentioned by Robert, professional information business revenues grew 5% in the first quarter, continuing to accelerate from prior quarter levels led by risk and compliance, which grew 35% marking strongest year-over-year performance since 2014. In Q1, professional information business revenues represented slightly less than one-third of Dow Jones revenues.","The Wall Street Journal 2020 program, as previously discussed is not only about cost transformation but also focuses on The Wall Street Journal becoming a digital first organization, including more aggressively expanding our digital offerings internationally.","Over the past year, Wall Street Journal digital subscriptions have nearly doubled in Europe and have grown by almost 70% in Asia. Our international footprint is being further expanded by the global reach of our conferences, including the launch of the Tokyo CEO Council and the WSJ D.Live in Hong Kong.","At News Australia, total revenues rose 4%, helped by the integration of the ARM acquisition and foreign currency benefits. Advertising revenues for the quarter increased 3% or declined 1% in local currency, helped by the acquisition of ARM. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, advertising revenues declined approximately 10% in local currency, relatively similar to the prior quarter.","Circulation revenues at News Australia increased 6% or up 2% in local currency as the acquisition of ARM, cover price increases and higher paid digital subscriptions were partially offset by print volume declines in the sale of the Sunday Times last year.","Regarding our ongoing cost transformation, we remain particularly focused on News Australia, given its reliance on print and higher exposure to advertising revenues. While we are currently targeting at least AUD40 million in cost reductions this year.","The team in Australia are already pacing well ahead of that as they continue to be cost focused, together with continuing their review of the broader regional and community newspaper portfolio, following the acquisition of ARM. The team\u2019s focus in Australia is not just to remove legacy costs, but to ensure the cost structure is right-sized for the business moving forward.","Australia is also making steady progress in the digital conversion, with digital subscribers across the News Australia mastheads now reaching more than 375,000 paid subscribers, including the ARM properties, which is over 30% higher than the prior year.","At News U.K., total revenues were down 6%. Advertising revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate due to continued but moderating print advertising declines at The Times and The Sun, and an acceleration in digital advertising at The Sun, driven by higher audience and improved engagement. Circulation revenues at News U.K. were down 5% as volume declines at The Sun more than offset cover price increases.","Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 4% due to ongoing weakness in free-standing insert revenues, which had two fewer inserts versus the prior year.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $401 million and segment EBITDA increased to 4% to $50 million. Titles to highlight this quarter included Daniel Silva\u2019s House of Spies and Karin Slaughter\u2019s The Good Daughter, as well as carryover sales from J.D. Vance\u2019s Hillbilly Elegy. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 6% to represent 21% of consumer revenues, compared to 20% in the prior year, due to strength in downloadable audiobooks.","In Digital Real Estate Services, segment revenues increased 20% to $271 million and adjusted revenues increased 19%. Reported segment EBITDA was $95 million versus $67 million last year, up 42%.","REA Group revenues grew 22% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency, partially offset by the divestment of the European businesses last year.","Listing volume was stable this quarter, but importantly saw a pickup in New South Wales and Victoria. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.","Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $107 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong growth in lead volume, as well as improved pricing optimization in inventory management.","TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016, contributed $3 million of revenues in the prior period. Excluding that, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Average monthly unique users at Realtor.com grew to 55 million for the quarter, rising mid-single digits from the prior year.","In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $17 million or 13% to $145 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added $11 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter rose to $27 million from $14 million due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the rollout of the FOX LEAGUE Channel, a network dedicated to the NRL, which led to a benefit of approximately $10 million this quarter.","The results also reflect lower other sports programming rights costs, including impact from the absence of Australia versus Sri Lanka cricket tour in the prior year. With respect to equity losses earnings from affiliates, equity losses were $10 million this quarter, compared to $15 million in last quarter.","Foxtel revenues for the quarter rose 2% to $263 million, but declined 2% in local currency. EBITDA decreased 15% to $122 million and was down 18% in local currency due to planned increases in sports rights costs of approximately $24 million, primarily related to the new AFL contract, partially offset by lower transmission and sales and marketing costs.","Regarding its operating metrics, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.8 million subscribers, up 2% versus the fourth quarter driven by the rollout of Foxtel Now. In the first quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 12.7%, down from 15.5% last year. Cable and satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD86.","For the quarter, capital expenditures were $62 million, compared to $49 million in the prior year, with increases driven by higher IT spending. However, overall CapEx in fiscal 2018 should be in line with the prior year.","Looking forward to the second quarter, there are few points I would like to make. At News and Information Services, print advertising trading conditions remain challenging and visibility is limited. We expect ongoing print advertising headwinds and we will continue to focus on cost efficiencies accordingly.","In addition, News America Marketing will again have two less free-standing inserts in the quarter, similar to the first quarter. We expect FOX SPORTS Australia to face higher costs in the second quarter, a reversal from quarter one due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year.","We expect over AUD25 million in higher costs for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. For the full year, we continue to expect AUD30 million to AUD40 million in higher costs, mostly related to the NRL, much of which should be offset by higher affiliate revenues and production cost initiatives.","In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable with digital contribution rising modestly. As Robert mentioned, notable new releases this quarter include Ree Drummond\u2019s Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! and Capital Gaines from Chip Gaines, co-author of The Magnolia Story.","At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong growth of REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business and continued growth at Realtor.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take your first question from Entcho Raykovski from Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi, Robert. Hello, Susan. My question is around the digital subs within News and Info Services, and I mean, you\u2019re obviously seeing some very strong growth rates year-on-year, but there has been some slight slowdown in net digital ads for the quarter. Is there any seasonality not those numbers that\u2019s impacting those ads and if we look, say, a couple of years out, given you are still seeing strong year-on-year growth rates, where do you expect the digital subs to be for The Journal in Australia in particular?","Robert Thomson","Well, Entcho, generally, we\u2019re very confident about digital subs, and clearly, the changes that Google have made to First Click Free, are the abolition of it will itself create an environment, an ecosystem, which is itself more conducive to subscription, because the fact was that Google was punishing, banishing premium content by not indexing it and so the early signs are positive, but they are, of course, early.","But what you\u2019ll see over the next couple of months is that sites like The Wall Street Journal in Australia and The Times, and our other subscription offerings are properly indexed by Google, that the content is properly surfaced and the propensity for people to subscribe should increase.","Mike Florin","Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi. I was curious to hear, you\u2019ve done very strong performance at Realtor.com since you bought it a few years ago. Could you just tell us what you\u2019ve -- generally what you have done there to improve the operations there dramatically, frankly, versus the prior ownership?","Robert Thomson","Thank you for that question, Craig. What we envisaged when we took over Move as it\u2019s known, but Realtor.com as we prefer to refer to it, is that we would be able to use our media platforms to complement the Realtor platform to drive traffic, to increase engagement by improving news and analysis, and frankly, those things have happened. We\u2019re really copying the model that Lachlan Murdoch often envisaged with the initial investment in REA back many years ago.","And look, we\u2019re not complaining for a second, because while it\u2019s obviously strong growth there and you remember this time last year it was single-digit growth in revenue. It\u2019s now well into double digits. We are constantly reflecting on what we can do better, how we can serve realtors more efficiently, but also how we can drive revenue and EBITDA and growth for the benefit of all our shareholders.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Craig. Operator, we will take our next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Brian Han from Morningstar.","Brian Han","Oh! Hi. On the Foxtel, FOX SPORTS merger, have you done any work on areas where you can expect synergies and will M&A be a focus of the combined entity?","Robert Thomson","Well, as you know, the discussions are continuing with Telstra and we hoped that -- and we subject to regulatory approval, we hope that there will be agreement in the second half of the financial year.","But the three reasons for doing this deal, scale, which is increasingly important in a competitive media environment, the resident brands that the combined Foxtel and FOX SPORTS will have, and the great collection of sports and entertainment content that\u2019s inherent in the consolidation of the company.","That clearly there are going to be synergies, but not just synergies, there will be an ability for us to take advantage of changes in the digital marketplace. We\u2019re going to be digitally deft, not digitally daft, and for example, it\u2019s not OTT to expect OTT growth in Australia and we\u2019ll be able to prepare for that. Susan?","Susan Panuccio","Yes. Thanks, Robert. I think, Brian, one of the benefits of doing this combination will be the flexibility we have to launch new products, particularly when we move into consolidate its position where we can control it, particularly in the sports area. And of course, part of the exercise that we\u2019re looking at the moment is where we do exact synergies between the two companies, so that\u2019s going to be an important path going forward as well.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Brian. Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Raymond Tong from Evans and Partners.","Raymond Tong","Hi, Robert and Susan. Just a question for you, maybe Robert, just wondering whether you could provide an update on your discussions on putting The Wall Street Journal content on the Facebook platform and you made some comments a couple months ago, but can you maybe sort of just give us sense of where you are at with this, please?","Robert Thomson","Raymond, it\u2019s not opportune to reveal the details of those negotiations at the moment other than to say that they are ongoing at a very senior level. But it is reflective of a fundamental change in the approach to content, the content landscape, which clearly was not beneficial to producers of great journalism as we do across the world with our mastheads and has become more conducive to us being able to extract a reasonable price and increase elasticity for those mastheads.","So all I can say is that it\u2019s still early days, but it\u2019s also fair to say that there has been a fundamental change in the attitude to content by both Google and Facebook and we are still at an early phase of that evolution of the relationship between us and those companies.","Mike Florin","Thank you, Raymond. Operator, we will take our next, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take a follow-up from Brian Han from Morningstar.","Brian Han","Hello. Thanks for that. Susan, as you continued on your digitization journey, where do you think your D&A charge will sale at?","Susan Panuccio","That\u2019s a very good question. I mean, I don\u2019t think we expect actually to increase massively at the moment. We are looking to keep it relatively consistently going forward, as you can see our CapEx spend is going to be relatively in line for the full year, so we\u2019re not expecting to see significant changes in that line.","Brian Han","Thanks.","Mike Florin","Thank you. Operator, we will take our next question.","Operator","And at this time, we have no additional callers in the queue.","Mike Florin","Great. Well, thank you all very much for participating. Have a great day.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you all for your participation."],"15170":["News (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q1 2014 Earnings Call November 11, 2013  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Florin - Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Robert J.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal first quarter 2014 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at www.newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thompson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks from both Robert and Bedi, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and reconciliation of these measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert J. Thomson","Thank you, Mike, and welcome, all, to our first earnings call as the new News. There will certainly be time for questions after Bedi Singh elucidates the figures, but I thought it useful to provide some context to the fledgling company's operations and a sense of its trajectory.","We are confident about our prospects, given the market-leading brands in our midst, the talented executives servicing our companies and the focus that has come from concentrating minds and aggregating assets.","Among our comparative advantages are the following.","We have scale, meaning that we could influence the terms of trade for digital content businesses at a time of mass migration in mass media. There are dramatic shifts underway in the creation, delivery and consumption of content. The platform permutations are multiplying and so are the opportunities to profit.","Secondly, we are diverse globally and see clear opportunities to expand beyond our existing footprint. You will see evidence of those expansion plans in coming months, but it will be expansion based on extending our existing expertise. And we have a robust balance sheet that provides the company with genuine financial flexibility, allowing us to be agile in responding to emerging opportunities. But we also have our costs under vigilant watch, and there is no doubt that the focus of the new News has enabled us to identify inefficiencies and extract expense.","We have been public for a mere 4-or-so months, but the company has a remarkable prominence and a very proud history. We will be candid with you about the challenges, as we have been about the headwinds buffeting our Australian newspaper business. But we are confident that our emerging strategy will well serve our investors, our employees and our customers. Our aim is not just to transform the company but to transform its long-term prospects.","Bedi will provide you with the detailed figures, but the overall themes are as follows. Total segment EBITDA has risen significantly. Adjusted EBITDA is, however, down slightly. Margins in our largest segment, News and Information Services, have risen, even as revenues in Australia have been particularly soft. Free cash flow has improved by $145 million over the same period last year, although comparisons generally are made difficult by the fact that, technically, the company itself didn't exist at this time last year.","We collectively recognize the need to evolve. We must generate more advertising revenue, but overall, be less dependent on advertising and much more subscription-focused. And we must take advantage of the rise of mobile as a platform. Across our businesses, we are seeing exponential increases in the use of smartphones and tablets to access our content. Each platform has unique challenges and opportunities, but we will be among the pioneers on packaging and pricing and profiting in the emerging environment. Our initiatives will play an important role in that development, as we indicated at the Investor Day. Three projects have already been launched. In particular, a global programmatic advertising exchange; secondly, our excellent U.K team has created Sun+, their digital strategy for Britain's best-selling newspaper; and we have just launched BallBall our Asian digital football business, which focuses on upwardly mobile users, smartphones, the web and tablets.","Our advertising exchange, which has involved unprecedented cooperation among all of our media businesses, began trading just over a fortnight ago and has already attracted more than 10 major advertisers. We are able to leverage our leading global brands and our exclusive first-party data, thus allowing us much more leverage over yields and protecting the integrity of our audience.","We are discontinuing remaining arrangements with third-party ad networks, so that any advertiser who wants to reach our great content and premium audiences must do so directly. Some of you will be aware that we acquired exclusive Premier League near-live video clip rights in the U.K., highlighting goals and other monumental moments for subscribers and loyal readers of our British newspapers. But Sun+ is much more than soccer snippets, as the team in London have worked to improve the depths of our digital editorial for subscribers and provide them with retail, leisure and other discounts of at least GBP 200 a month. The purpose behind these subscriptions is to heighten affinity, which is of supreme importance to advertisers frustrated by audiences who have little loyalty and are digitally distracted. On our next call, we'll have firm figures for you as we are now early in the acquisition phase and developing durable metrics on elasticity and churn.","We told you at the Investor Day that we were underrepresented in Asia, where macroeconomic growth rates remain relatively high and smartphone penetration is increasing exponentially. For a modest sum, we acquired exclusive video clip rights for the Premier League and rights to other European soccer leagues for apps and websites for a company called BallBall in Indonesia, Vietnam and Japan. We have been repurposing content and statistics from our London papers, as well as utilizing the WSJ Digital Networks in Japan and Indonesia and the video expertise of FOX SPORTS Australia. Such creative collaboration is crucial to making us more than the sum of our parts. There is no doubt that important lessons from this digital-only venture will be adopted elsewhere in our company as the second screen becomes a first priority.","And within our core companies, the digital transformation continues apace. For example, at HarperCollins, ebooks rose from 15% to 22% of sales, while our margin improved from 11.4% to over 13% in the past year.","We spoke at the Investor Day about plans for e-expansion, and we have since announced a number of initiatives, including subscription deals with Oyster and Scribd. At the Wall Street Journal, where advertising revenue has been stable, it's worth highlighting that mobile usage rose 59% in September compared to the same month last year. Meanwhile, the development team has just completed work on the first phase of DJX, our new B2B product, which will be rolled out over coming months.","In Australia, at REA, of which we earn 61.6%, the management team is constantly seeking to innovate and connecting agents with customers. The revival of the Australian property market has certainly been a benefit, as you can see from today's numbers, and the market cap of the company since July 1 has risen from AUD 3.56 billion to AUD 5.3 billion. While the majority of REA revenues come from within Australia, the company is continuing to expand its international footprint.","At Amplify, Joel Klein and the team are focused on building our K-12 subject matter, which is the most significant segment of the company's 3 divisions. They aim to bring their product to market for the fall of 2014, and you'll be able to track our success as we compete to supply school districts with contemporary curriculum.","We will continue to be disciplined and to seek out opportunities we think will enhance the growth profile of News Corp and complement our existing strengths, but we will also continuously review our asset portfolio.","This quarter, we sold the Dow Jones Local Media Group and our Live Event business at HarperCollins. We concluded that these assets were non-core to News Corp's strategy.","Four months along in the life of the new News, we are even more convinced that the company will thrive as it becomes more digital and increasingly global. We will continue to balance heightened cost consciousness with a need for investment; all informed by the very clear goal of enhancing the value of shareholder returns.","Now let me usher in Bedi Singh, who will furnish you with the financials.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I'd like to share with you some high-level financial highlights, and then we will discuss each segment in further detail.","We reported fiscal 2014 first quarter total revenues of $2.07 billion, a 3% decrease versus the prior year period revenues of $2.13 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and adjusting for foreign exchange fluctuations, total revenue declined 4%. The earnings release, you will see, includes a reconciliation to reflect these adjustments.","Turning to EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $141 million, which was a 58% increase versus the prior year period, again excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, most notably FOX SPORTS Australia, which we acquired last November; and the Dow Jones Local Media Group, which we sold in September of this year. All costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, which were $17 million this quarter, and excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, total EBITDA declined this year by 5%.","Reported diluted EPS were a positive $0.05 versus negative $0.16 in the prior period. Excluding restructuring charges, the U.K. Newspaper Matters costs and other one-time items, adjusted EPS was $0.03, down from $0.06 in the prior period. But importantly, free cash flow available to News Corp improved by $145 million compared to the prior year.","Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues declined $171 million, or 10%, versus the prior year. Australia accounted for $121 million, or around 70% of the segment decline, of which almost half was due to foreign exchange.","Within segment revenues, total advertising declined 12%, of which FX was 4%. And looking at advertising performance across our key units, at News Corp Australia, newspaper advertising revenues declined around 25%, including a 10% negative impact from foreign currency.","News U.K. advertising declined 7%, with the majority of the decline being due to incremental Olympic spending last year.","Wall Street Journal advertising domestically was virtually flat with the prior year. And overall, Dow Jones advertising was down low single digits, impacted by some weakness in Asia and Europe.","We haven't seen, so far, any inflection points in advertising in either direction. Australia remains very challenged, while the U.K. and U.S. have been more stable, but we recognize that visibility is still somewhat limited.","Circulation and subscription revenues declined 6%, of which FX was 3%. We were hurt this quarter by lower print volumes, a decline in institutional sales at Dow Jones, which were partially offset by cover price increases in the U.K. and Australia and growth at The Wall Street Journal and WSJ.com.","As Robert mentioned, this past quarter, we launched Sun+, our paywall in the U.K., bundled with English Premier League highlight clips, and have put all of our major mastheads in Australia behind a paywall.","We have also relaunched the New York Post website, and we are also in the early phases of rolling out DJX, our bundled institutional offering at Dow Jones, and the conversion to this single product offering had a modest negative impact this quarter to revenues.","At News America Marketing, sales improved 3% versus last year, led by strong double-digit growth in the in-store business, consistent with our comments at the Investor Day. And importantly, we saw margin expansion there this quarter. We saw growth in Canada and growth in several food and drug categories.","Operating costs for News and Information Services were down 12% this quarter. That was due mainly to lower headcount, as we realized some savings from prior year restructurings, lower newsprint costs and production costs and lower marketing expenses.","Returning to News and Information Services EBITDA, this increased $7 million, or 6% versus last year. We saw strong profit contributions from News UK, News America Marketing and also benefited from the absence of losses from The Daily last year, partially offset by continued weakness in Australia and foreign currency impacts.","So if you look at EBITDA, excluding the sale of Local Media Group and foreign exchange fluctuations, segment revenues -- sorry, EBITDA increased 12% and segment revenues declined 6%. We do not believe this level of EBITDA growth or margin expansion is indicative of the next few quarters or a run rate. We have several initiatives, which we are in the early stages, including DJX at Dow Jones, Sun+ at News UK, and we are developing our digital assets in Australia.","In Cable Network Programming, segment revenues this quarter were $132 million, and segment EBITDA was $29 million. On a standalone basis, assuming we had owned FOX SPORTS Australia in the prior year quarter, revenues were flat and segment EBITDA declined 31%. However, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, revenues increased 14% and EBITDA declined 21%. Advertising improved strong double digits, thanks to solid audience gains and increased government spending around the elections. Subscription revenues grew approximately 8%, helped by an increase in digital platform subscribers.","The decline in Cable Network Programming EBITDA was driven primarily by timing of higher expenses associated with the airing of the National Rugby League rights contract, which began in March 2013. Operating expenses should be lower in Q2, which is seasonal, given our roster of sports rights.","In Digital Real Estate Services, REA revenues increased $9 million, or 11% compared to last year, reflecting increased revenues from listing depth penetration and new product growth.","Segment EBITDA increased $9 million, or 26%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the increased revenue. Margins were 48.9%, up from 43.2% in the prior year. Excluding foreign currency, revenue and EBITDA grew 23% and 43%, respectively.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues declined 7%, but EBITDA grew 8% versus the prior year. The top line this quarter was hurt by the sale of the Women of Faith live events business, the decision to exit the U.S. distribution business, a soft Christian publishing marketplace and foreign currency fluctuations.","Looking deeper at the results, we had a very strong performance this quarter in ebooks. Some key titles to call out were the Veronica Roth Divergent series in children's and Daniel Silva's English Girl in general books.","For the quarter, ebooks as a percentage of revenues improved to 22% from 15% in the prior period, and total ebook sales improved by over 30%. We're very excited by the pipeline of titles in Q2, led by Allegiant, the final chapter in the Divergent series, which debuted October 22 and has sold approximately 1.8 million copies to date. This should lead to an improved performance for Q2, even with some revenue headwinds from the sale of the Live Events business. And EBITDA margins advanced to 13.1% from 11.4%. The EBITDA growth and margin improvement was driven by higher ebook penetration and improved operating efficiencies.","In our Other segment, which includes Amplify, our corporate Strategy and Creative Group, corporate overhead and costs related to U.K. Newspaper Matters, segment EBITDA improved $4 million, primarily due to lower costs of approximately $44 million related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, partially offset by higher expenses of $29 million at Amplify; $6 million incurred by our corporate Strategy and Creative Group, including the launch of BallBall as mentioned by Robert; and increased corporate overhead expenses of $8 million compared to an allocated basis used for fiscal 2013.","In the quarter, we incurred $40 million related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, of which the net impact on total segment EBITDA was $17 million. That's net pre-tax costs after the indemnification from 21st Century Fox.","Now for the full year, we expect corporate overhead to be in the $140 million to $160 million range, consistent with our comments at the Investor Day. For our corporate Strategy and Creative Group, we will likely spend in the $35 million to $45 million range. This includes spending on our BallBall product offering, including small rights acquisition costs, our advertising exchange, as well as a few other key initiatives currently in development.","On Amplify, we expect operating losses to be higher than in fiscal '13. But in contrast to last year, costs are unlikely to ramp up from the first quarter as curriculum development is now well underway.","Turning to equity income, our earnings from affiliates were $13 million this quarter compared to $26 million last year. The lower contribution primarily reflects the absence of the 44% stake in SKY Network Television, which was sold in March 2013, and the consolidation of FOX SPORTS Australia in November 2012.","On the plus side, we had higher contribution from Foxtel, which benefited from an increased ownership to 50% from 25% in November 2012. Foxtel's EBITDA grew mid-teens this quarter in local currency.","Turning now to cash flow. For the quarter, cash flow from operations improved to positive $59 million compared to negative $87 million last year, and free cash flow available to News Corp improved to negative $10 million versus negative $155 million last year. This improvement was driven by lower restructuring payments, lower costs related to U.K. Newspaper Matters, lower tax payments and the inclusion of FOX SPORTS Australia, partially offset by the absence of cash distributions from SKY Network Television last year.","On our P&L statement, you can see that we recorded a tax benefit and a corresponding expense in Other of $483 million. This relates to a tax refund we received in October over past claims in a foreign jurisdiction which had been in dispute. This refund will be remitted to 21st Century Fox as part of a tax sharing and indemnification agreement. This item is a pass-through only and had no impact on net income, EPS or free cash flow.","And finally, a few additional items. We expect full year CapEx to be higher than fiscal '13 and more in line with levels seen in fiscal '12 of $375 million, as we had discussed at the Investor Day. We expect the majority of our capital investment to be continued to be focused on technology innovation, including the roll out of our common publishing system. CapEx this quarter was $67 million versus $64 million last year.","Restructuring costs were down significantly this quarter at $27 million, of which $23 million was related to the newspaper business, compared to $115 million in the prior year. Last year, restructuring costs totaled $293 million. We continue to expect this to come down this year. We continually review our portfolio of assets. This quarter, we realized $96 million in proceeds, mostly related to the sale of the Local Media Group and a few smaller transactions, including the HarperCollins Live Events business, which we viewed as non-core to News Corp.","On the U.K. Newspaper Matters, we have accrued approximately $78 million, of which $53 million will be indemnified by 21st Century Fox. This represents our best estimate of that liability for the claims that have been filed as of quarter end.","Cash on the balance sheet as of 30th of September was around $2.7 billion, which includes $230 million of cash in REA.","And lastly, we entered into a $650 million, 5-year revolving credit facility. There are no funds drawn on it at this time. We view the revolver as a financially prudent instrument, and consistent with most of our peers.","So in summary, expenses are on the right track, while the revenues remain under pressure. We have been candid about some of the headwinds we face, particularly in News and Information Services. We continue to view fiscal '14 as a transition year as we balance ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and focus on stabilizing top-line performance. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress throughout the year.","And with that, let me turn back to the operator for our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So cost controls within the news media segment are a theme I'm assuming you're going to be talking about for the next several years. But in the near term, can you talk about some of the cost-saving opportunities? Where are you going to invest? And is the net of those 2 a decline?","Bedi Ajay Singh","It's Bedi here. Thank you for your question. I mean, as you know, over the past 3 or 4 years, we have done significant amounts of restructurings across businesses, mainly on the newspaper side. I think the total over the last 4 years is something around $500 million. Clearly, we keep looking at operational efficiencies as we go forward. But you have to realize, a substantial amount of efficiencies have been taken out. I think we'll keep continuing to look at natural operating efficiencies as we roll out the common publishing system, but I don't think we have any particular targets or sort of slash-and-burn type of cost reductions in mind as we go forward.","Robert J. Thomson","John, it's Robert here, just to supplement Bedi's answer. I think what is clear is that we are imposing a fair amount of discipline on the companies. There really is heightened cost consciousness. And the ability that the new News has given us to focus both on our strengths and on expenses is allowing us to certainly extract cost. To your other question about investment, look, as we all know, there are 5 potential uses for capital. There's internal investment; there's acquisitions; there's debt, of which we have none; dividends; and buybacks. As you can see already, we are engaged in some internal investment design to generate revenue, and the programmatic ad exchange is a good example of that. And as we've made clear at the Investor Day -- look, we're interested in acquisitions, but these are going to be extensions and not eccentric. They must do more than just add to the sum.","Operator","Our next question will come from Justin Diddams with Citi.","Justin Diddams - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on the phasing of earnings across the quarters. When we look at the types of businesses you run, I'd expect there to be fairly consistent revenue and earnings by quarter. However, when we look at some of the pro forma numbers from '13 and even '12, first to second quarter, there does seem to be a big disparity in earnings contribution. I wonder if you could just give us a sense of what your expectations are for the phasing of earnings across the quarters, particularly is where -- we've got the inaugural sets of results today, and we're sort of paving the way here. So any color on that would be appreciated.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Justin, it's Bedi here. Thanks for dialing in from Australia. I think if you look at all of our different business segments, sort of the operating businesses do tend to have seasonality and sort of lumpiness. And for example, if you look at the cable programming segment, that's definitely lumpy, depending on the airing of sports rights. Our book business tends to have a very good big season around the holidays. If you look at newspaper advertising, even that is seasonal. So I think generally, it's hard to sort of generalize and say that it's -- these type of businesses are sort of constant across the fiscal year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jessica Reif-Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about Amplify, what the current investment is? And the peak losses or peak investment, is it fiscal '14? And the second question is on the use of cash. I know, Robert, you outlined what the 5 uses could be, but you mentioned in your initial comments that you would increase -- in terms of acquisitions, that you would soon maybe increase your footprint in existing businesses. I'm just wondering what region seem to be the highest interest to you.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Jessica, it's Bedi. I'll take the one on Amplify. So Amplify, for the quarter, we reported an operating loss of $57 million, and that included depreciation and amortization of around $6 million. So if you take that out, it's roughly around $51 million of sort of EBITDA loss. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we don't expect to ramp up from that number, because pretty much the curriculum development is in full swing in this quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we're heading for the year.","Robert J. Thomson","Jessica, it's Robert. I mean, I'm sure you don't expect me to be specific about likely acquisitions. But I think it's fair to say that the 2 themes that permeate our thinking are digital and global and, obviously, acquisitions that extend our expertise.","Operator","And the next question comes from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like both News Corp and Telstra seem to be on the same page now for potential triple-play offering. Can you comment on the strategy here, how long it would take to implement and why you think this could be a game-changer for Foxtel?","Robert J. Thomson","Look, we're not going to go into specifics on our negotiations with Telstra, who are great partners of ours at Foxtel. Clearly, it's in the interest of all involved to increase loyalty and also to increase the attractiveness of the Foxtel package and, through that, our revenues from Fox Sports. And anything that does do -- indeed do that, we're in favor of.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is just a follow-up on Amplify. Is there any more color you can give us on sort of the intermediate term outlook, understanding this is a longer term investment? But are there any milestones we can look to through -- over the next year or so, like new school districts up for bid, that could give us a sense of sort of how it's progressing? And I guess on that topic, any update on the suspension of tablets to Guilford Schools?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Alexia, it's Bedi here. Yes. I mean, I think curriculum development is going very well. I think if you","[Audio Gap]","and then in terms of your specific question about when we can expect to see specific metrics, I think we expect curriculum -- developed curriculum sales to be in sort of fiscal -- or sorry, calendar '14, in the fall of calendar '14. I think that's when you should look to see the first sort of sales into school districts for the curriculum products. With respect to Guilford, I think the tablets have been recalled because of the safety issue that was identified. But currently, there's an independent sort of consultant who is looking at the issues with these tablets. Clearly, we're not the manufacturer, so I think out of sort of abundance of caution and safety, we withdrew them. And I think as soon as we get the results back -- and we're in constant conversations with the Guilford authorities, and we expect to have tablets back there once this matter is behind us.","Robert J. Thomson","And just to supplement Bedi's answer, obviously, the core investment in Amplify is going into the curriculum. A school district here or school district there will be indicative of a certain amount of receptivity. But really, longer term, and I think you need to view Amplify longer term, the scale rollout of our curriculum will take place in the fall of 2014.","Operator","And the next question comes from Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to John's first question on the cost dynamics in the News and Information Service sector -- segment. It looked like, on a sequential basis, the costs really came down quite a bit. And so I'm wondering if you could just sort of elaborate on what caused such a big drop quarter-to-quarter. I know you mentioned some of the cost cuts you've done in the past are starting to come through. But is there anything unusual in this quarter? And then I think Alan has a follow-up.","Bedi Ajay Singh","So I think the -- well, unusual -- I think the only thing that's sort of a one-off probably is we shut down The Daily. So that had an impact on -- of about $6 million, I think, on costs. So that was sort of a onetime item. I think, generally, we expect to see this sort of level of cost reduction continuing to flow through in the following quarters. But again, you've got to sort of temper that with what I said, which is we're facing revenue headwinds. So I think -- I'm not sure we'll continue to see EBITDA margin expansion of the same amount in the quarters to come. But I think we certainly expect to see some of these costs flow through.","Operator","The next question will come from Adam Alexander with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Bedi, I was just interested in your comments that Foxtel EBITDA was up mid-teens for the quarter. Can you just give us any more color on what's driving that? And anything on, say, net adds, churn or ARPU that you've got handy?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Actually, we're not -- I think on the ARPU and churn, we're not really giving out numbers on the quarterly basis. I think we sort of tend to do that on an annual basis. The EBITDA improvement has been from the integration of Austar. I think they've realized a sort of nice number of synergies. So that's principally being the, I think, driving reason for the EBITDA improvement.","Operator","Next question comes from Samantha Carleton with Credit Suisse.","Fraser McLeish - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's actually Fraser McLeish here from Credit Suisse. Just a couple from me. Just on -- could you give us any idea of how the -- or how sizable the digital revenues are within your various news and information businesses now? That would be the first one. And just secondly, on Foxtel and Fox Sports, is there any purchase price amortization charges in those EBITDA numbers we're looking at?","Bedi Ajay Singh","On the EBITDA numbers, there's no amortization charges despite the definition. And then on digital revenues, we're actually not giving out right now the kind of splits of digital revenues in our segments. But I mean, we are seeing, as Robert mentioned, a nice pick up in some of our digital statistics. I think Robert mentioned mobile usage on Wall Street Journal is up almost 50%. So I think were seeing traction in all of our digital properties. Clearly, on ebooks, we're having -- as I gave the statistics, we had almost 31% in ebook sales growth.","Robert J. Thomson","Just to supplement Bedi's answer, it's a little too early, as we indicated, to give you meaningful metrics on Sun+. But certainly, what we're seeing at The Times is good growth in digital, and that translates into strong -- potentially strong growth in digital advertising. Because what you have there is a genuinely premium audience who are paying to access the content. And as I mentioned in my introductory statement, they have an affinity with The Times, which is material and meaningful, and that sort of affinity, we're finding through our programmatic exchange, is genuinely attractive to advertisers.","Operator","And moving on to Bill Bird with FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Could you talk a bit about how the digital subscription rollout is progressing in Australia?","Robert J. Thomson","Bill, it's very early days. As you know, we have a new management team in place in Australia, under the great leadership of Julian Clarke and Peter Tonagh, who came across from Foxtel; and Susan Panuccio, our new CFO. Julian is looking at that strategy at the moment. What we are able to do as a company is learn from each other. So there'll be lessons from The Wall Street Journal for Australia. There will be lessons from Sun+, and that genuinely is one of the advantages of the new News.","Operator","And the following question comes from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is around the NRL costs within Cable Network Programming. Are you able to provide more detail around the quantum of uplift in the current quarter and what sort of drop off you expect into the second quarter of the year? And then finally, heading into quarter 3 and 4, whether you expect those to be broadly, I guess, flat on the PCP, given it's cycling some of the increased costs already?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Yes. I mean, NRL right costs for this quarter, the impact was around $20 million. I don't think we're giving numbers for future quarters. But clearly, it's seasonal. So -- or the season is pretty much in this quarter.","Robert J. Thomson","Many companies talk about seasonality in results, but when you have football seasons, you have genuine seasonality.","Operator","And this next question comes from Mike Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael Morris","Two topics, if you could. First, I know you're not getting specific on digital revenue, but you talked about a pretty big mobile growth number at Wall Street Journal, that 50% to 60%, yet advertising still is flat at the Journal. So can you talk about -- is there some kind of growth in mobile that's being partially offset by traditional? Or is it still too early to have mobile impact? And if so, maybe kind of how long does it take? Or what's the gating factor there? And then also just on the Rugby League cost, could you educate us a little bit about the benefit of the contract? It hurts you in this quarter. What's the return profile on that type of investment? Does it drive subgrowth in the future? Does it -- why take the higher drag in the current quarter?","Robert J. Thomson","I'll take the first question, and Bedi the second. What we truly are seeing is mass migration in mass media. When you talk about a 59% increase in audience for a premium product like The Wall Street Journal, you're talking about both a significant trend and a significant opportunity. It's just a little early for us to quantify what that means in terms of long-term advertising trends. I think what you can see we've done is create the programmatic exchange, which enables us to sell across properties, but also to get our maximum yield for premium properties like the Journal on any platform, including mobile.","Bedi Ajay Singh","And just on the Rugby League, I think -- look, after AFL, it's sort of the most popular sport, and it's a must-have programming you have to have if you're into the sports programming business, underpins our current subscriber base. I think it's very helpful to have for the digital platform, where we are -- where Foxtel is currently putting out new offerings. But I think we sort of view it as must-have programming.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Huber with Huber Research.","Craig Huber","Can you give us some more clarity, please, within your Cable Network Programming on a year-over-year basis pro forma? How did the advertising revenues do there versus a year ago, and also, I guess, your speculation of the subscription revenues there please?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Well, I think on a pro forma basis, we had good growth in advertising. It was up almost 50%. And subscription, as I said, was up around 8%. Advertising currently is around 19% of total revenue, roughly.","Robert J. Thomson","I think, as Bedi mentioned, there has been a significant increase in advertising. And you'll recall that we mentioned at the Investor Day that, that was going to be one of our priorities, that in between sports events, the team there, under Patrick Delany, was improving the quality of the programming and, around that, building out an offering that was more attractive to advertisers. And quite frankly, that has come to pass.","Operator","And moving on to Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","My question is about the News and Information business, please. I think I missed a number that you may have given out about the performance in Australia. And I'm curious about your comment about how the first quarter is not indicative of the run rate for the next few quarters. Could you just give a little bit more color, please, on the revenues in Australia and what you're doing there? I know you've talked about it at your Investor Day, but what you're doing there and what we should expect in terms of margin for the rest of the year, please?","Bedi Ajay Singh","So I mean, Australia, the advertising revenue, I said, has declined around 25%, which included a 10% negative impact from foreign currency. And basically, in terms of the sort of cost side of the equation, we expect sort of cost savings to continue. But what I meant was if you look at revenues, and revenues being under pressure for News and Information Services, I think EBITDA margin expansion sort of continues to remain challenged when we look forward.","Operator","And the next question comes from Westcott Rochette with S&P Capital IQ.","Westcott Rochette - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Just a question back on the Cable. If we look at it kind of on an annual basis, the business was running kind of mid- to low-30s. EBITDA margin was down lower. I understand you have some contracts that kind of came up. But as you absorb those contracts and rebuild advertising, is it -- are you looking to get back to a 30% margin in that business? Or is it kind of more subgrowth kind of going forward?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Look, I think FOX SPORTS Australia obviously benefits when we have subscriber growth. I think that's one of the metrics that we look for. And clearly, as Robert mentioned, there's been improvement in advertising as well, without giving specific sort of EBITDA margin targets on any of these businesses. But we would certainly look to extract efficiencies and certainly look to maintain margins in the business.","Operator","And the next question comes from Samantha Carleton with Credit Suisse.","Samantha Elizab Carleton - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question around Dow Jones. Can you talk a little bit about the price [indiscernible] of the investment in the institutional business and when you expect revenue to kick in there?","Robert J. Thomson","Samantha, we're obviously in a very early phase of the development of DJX. The problems at Dow Jones in the B2B business are certainly well known to everybody on this call, and we were very candid about them on the Investor Day. It really goes back to that period of [indiscernible] trauma, where Dow Jones lost ground to its competitors. So this is a major restructuring of that business. The first iteration of DJX is just off the blocks, and so you'll have to give the Dow Jones team and us a little while before we can give you an accurate read on its market penetration. But this is a significant development for Dow Jones and, frankly, trying to improve the fortunes of -- part of the business is about 30% of the Dow Jones business, but trying to reverse the fortunes of a part of the business that is -- hasn't performed to its -- to our expectations or to its potential for really almost 2 decades.","Operator","And next question comes from Alan Gould with Evercore.","Alan Gould","I was just wondering what your thoughts are on your dividend policy going forward.","Bedi Ajay Singh","It's Bedi here. Clearly, as we've said in our filings, there is an expectation that we will be paying a dividend. I think the timing and the amount is going to be determined by the board. But again, as we said before at the Investor Day, I think right now, we're focused on sort of managing the operating businesses, stabilizing the revenues and, I think, internal investments. And as Robert said, this is one of the uses of capital we have. So clearly, it's something we said we would do. But I think at this point in time, it's too early to sort of speculate on how much and when.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions, sir.","Michael Florin","Okay.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. The media is invited to today\u2019s call on a listen-only basis. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Florin","Thank you very much, Noel. Hello everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s Fiscal Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago. It\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp.\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2015 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. News Corp is evolving rapidly into a more digital and increasingly global company with a diverse revenue mix that we resolutely believe will drive long-term growth in revenue, profits and shareholder returns. The quarter presented challenges with a still uncertain macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange volatility, but we believe in the enduring value of our prestigious brands and the sound logic of our digital strategy.","Revenues fell 4% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA declined 20% to $280 million. EBITDA for the quarter includes legal and transaction costs which Bedi will momentarily explain in detail. However, excluding the effects of forex fluctuations, revenues would actually have grown 2% versus the prior year as the successful integration of realtor.com and growth of REA contributed materially to our performance.","It is thus appropriate in examining the individual segments that we begin with Digital Real Estate Services in which, by most measures, we have become the world\u2019s largest player over the past 12 months. The position will be further enhanced by the imminent closing of REA\u2019s acquisition of iProperty, the preeminent digital property company in Southeast Asia. We are particularly pleased by the early returns of Move, which we acquired just over a year ago and whose realtor.com network has become the fastest-growing player in the still emerging U.S. digital real estate market.","For the quarter average monthly unique users increased by 37% year-over-year driven by a 57% surge in mobile users. For the month of January we recorded 50 million monthly uniques compared to 30 million in the month before we acquired realtor in late 2014.","We are significantly ahead of schedule in revenue growth and in the trajectory of EBITDA for Move. Even with the investment required to enhance the site, we firmly expect positive EBITDA for this fiscal year. That result will not come at the expense of investment in the product or the brand, and should be the harbinger of increasing EBITDA in coming years. For the most recent quarter alone, revenues at Move, the parent of realtor.com, expanded 35% year-over-year on a standalone basis, while user engagement continued to grow briskly with page views 34% higher at 1.1 billion views and minutes spent on the site increasing 47% year-over-year.","In December we launched a renovated realtor.com site which is more user and mobile friendly, and we expect to unveil several new products for realtors in coming months including enhanced listening and extra focus on delivering our cherished clients more and better quality bio leads. We also fashioned a partnership with CoStar that will add many thousands of rental listings and provide a new pipeline of customers who, ideally, will ultimately graduate to being home buyers.","Meanwhile in Australia, REA Group continues to thrive with revenues expanding by more than 20% excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks to the broader penetration of premium products. The REA audience in Australia is over twice the size of its nearest competitor in a market that is clearly at a different phase of growth to that of the U.S.","Importantly, we are now in a position to share learnings, mobile software, and display modules across our global digital property platforms to ensure that we optimize the experience of users and the revenue for our companies.","Elsewhere in Australia, Fox Sports was affected materially by currency movements which masked a strong underlying performance. The nature of the business is that the large audience is generated by showcase events, such as the Rugby World Cup, in which Australia\u2019s performance exceeded modest expectations, are accompanied by increased acquisition and production costs. However, advertising during the quarter rose almost 30% in local currency, far exceeding the level of most Australian broadcasters. Meanwhile, Foxtel, where there has been significant investment in marketing and product, reported a moderating at the rate of EBITDA decline and improving revenue growth in local currency.","Our stated aim is clear, to drive subscriber growth and to highlight to potential customers the superior value of the product selection compared to other SVOD competitors in Australia, like Netflix which has a markedly inferior offering to that of Foxtel. It\u2019s worth noting that churn hit a near record low level at Foxtel this quarter at just over 10%.","Sport is patently a crucial offering, particularly in Australia. And in the most recent quarter Foxtel and Fox Sports extended their rights to the National Rugby League, which along with Aussie Rules are the dominant sports in the country. Fox Sports will have specialist channels for both sports as we have now secured rights until 2022. We see these long-term rights as a robust foundation for the expansion of Foxtel and Fox Sports over the coming decade.","Foxtel also completed the acquisition of an approximately 14% equity stake in the Ten Network during the quarter. Ten\u2019s ad sales are being integrated into the MCN ad sales venture, creating a unified ad sales network across both freeware and subscription TV that is already gaining real traction. Ad agencies in Australia have strongly endorsed the MCN Ten model and Foxtel sees an ongoing opportunity to drive incremental advertising growth across these powerful platforms.","In our News and Information Services segment, Australian advertising remained challenged, but we have seen encouraging signs in subscriptions and a more balanced revenue mix. Circulation revenues are up against the quarter excluding currency, due in part to higher digital subs across our mastheads, nearly offsetting print volume declines.","We are actively focused on costs. In this past quarter, we implemented a cost reduction program across most of the businesses, which will begin to show benefits this quarter. News.com.au maintained its lead as the number one news portal in Australia. It has become a valuable platform to drive revenues, delivering around 52 million extra visits to our sites last year.","In the UK we are also assiduously reducing costs at our mastheads while renewing direct relationships with advertisers to maximize revenue. We are delighted with the integration of Unruly, the social and viral ad platform we recently acquired. It is working with our businesses around the world and particularly with our UK mastheads to deliver high-quality advertising to our properties and to reduce our reliance on third parties. Unruly\u2019s cutting edge metrics and contemporary culture are infusing energy and creativity into the broader business.","Digital transformation is well underway for Sun, where we recently removed the paywall and are relaunching the site in March, optimized for video and mobile, which is self-evidently growing in potency as a platform. We are also diversifying our revenue base and monetizing the valuable Sun brand. This past quarter, News UK signed two licensing bills, with Playtech for Sun Bingo and with Tabcorp for Sun Bets, to which higher margin revenue streams will begin flowing in May, just ahead of the European soccer championships in June and in good time for the next English soccer season.","The Times of London may have been founded in 1785, but it continues to prosper in 2016, gaining in market share and expanding its circulation revenues thanks to the continuing success of its digital offering, which will be able to expand internationally at little incremental cost.","That extended elite, as we have discovered with the Wall Street Journal, is an extremely desirable demographic that is difficult to reach on social media and has strong affinity for the Times and the Sunday Times.","At the Wall Street Journal, advertising year on year was softer. But the early signs for the current quarter are more positive. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the Real Estate category showed significant ad strength this quarter, primarily driven in Digital by the recent launch of Mansion Global and in print by the Mansion residential section, highlighting the value that News Corp brings to realtors and the efficacy of the relationship with realtor.com. We believe these complimentary platforms are clearly worth more than the sum of their parts.","Overall, Digital now accounts for nearly 50% of revenues at Dow Jones, with strong growth in the Risk and Compliance segment of our Professional Information business and healthy progress in the pursuit of three million subscriptions at WSJ and Barron\u2019s within three years.","Specifically at the Journal, there was an 18% year-on-year growth in digital-only subscriptions for the most recent reported quarter, reaching 819,000 subscribers. As well, ARPU is on the rise. So these are not deeply discounted inevitably promiscuous subscribers.","I would also point out that the Dow Jones financial site Market Watch set a new traffic record in January, with more than 23.3 million unique visitors. Market Watch also had 1.2 million video stars for the month, which is a more than 460% jump year-over-year, while total visits to the site were a record 60.1 million.","In other business, News America Marketing showed healthy domestic in-store and digital revenue growth, while experiencing declines in revenues due to challenges in the very competitive FSI business. Sluggish economic growth and a squeeze felt by many families around the country mean that there is a strong appetite for discounts, which explains our optimism for the prospects of Checkout 51, our recently acquired digital coupon company.","We began a fresh round of marketing for Checkout 51 in January and downloads of the app have risen sharply. The weekly rate of new memberships in the U.S. and Canada has tripled in the past month to 70,000, giving Checkout 51 more than five million members to date. We are using our powerful platforms, including realtor.com to drive adoption of the app. That larger audience will give us the scale to service better offers from consumer goods companies, which in turn will make the app stickier and more attractive for potential users who literally can upload their receipts and receive cash back.","At HarperCollins the integration of Harlequin continues apace, providing us with a global publishing platform including best-selling authors Karin Slaughter and Daniel Silva, we have successfully published almost 200 HarperCollins titles to date in foreign languages across more than 18 countries.","Comparisons with last year were naturally made more difficult because of the blockbuster success of the Divergent trilogy, which was also a powerful performer as an e-book given the genre, teen fiction over indexes digitally. Print sales actually rose during the period, but not enough to offset the decline in digital, a softness that other publishers have also reported and is an industry-wide issue.","In conclusion, while macroeconomic conditions and currency trends were inauspicious this quarter, we believe our core strategy to become a more deeply digital company with a particular emphasis on mobile is certainly on track. Our acquisitions are enhancing that capability, whether it be Storyful with mobile video or Unruly with its social sensibility or the imminent acquisition of iProperty with its digital property prowess in East Asia. We are particularly pleased that realtor.com has been transformed and through its success is transforming the character of News Corp. We have significant toil ahead, but we see a clearly defined pathway to a more digital future and increased profitability, which will be to the benefit of all investors.","With that I turn the floor and the rest of the room to our CFO, Bedi Singh, to explicate the numbers.","Bedi Singh","Thanks, Robert. First I\u2019d like to share some high level financial highlights for the second quarter, and then we\u2019ll go into each segment in further detail.","We reported fiscal 2016 second quarter total revenues of $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior-year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenue by $141 million or 6%.","Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisition and divestitures adjusted revenue declined only 1% compared to the prior year. We reported total segment EBITDA of $280 million compared to the prior-year period of $352 million, excluding the impact of Digital Education segment in both periods.","Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $25 million or 7%. Reported segment EBITDA this quarter includes $7 million of legal costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters net of indemnification as well as $5 million of one-time transaction costs related to the Unruly acquisition which closed on September 30, and is reflected in the News and Information Services segment.","For the quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.20 versus $0.30 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.15 compared to $0.27 in the prior year.","Now let\u2019s turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $123 million, down 8% versus the prior-year period. More than 70% of that declines was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 4%. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 12% or about 6% in local currency due to weakness in print, partially offset by strong digital ad growth across each business unit.","Circulation and Subscription revenues declined 5%, but was actually up 1% in local currency due to higher consumer circulation revenues in the U.S. and Australia combined with improvements at the Dow Jones Professional Information business. We saw a slight decline in the U.K. due to the removal of the Sun payroll in November.","Looking at performance across the key units, at Dow Jones domestic advertising at the Wall Street Journal declined 5% versus the prior-year quarter due in part to tougher year ago comparisons from the Financial category. Declines in print advertising were partially offset by solid growth in digital with strength in display, mobile and video. Digital accounted for approximately one-third of ad revenues this quarter, and overall advertising trends at the Wall Street Journal are relatively stable.","Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew mid-single digits this quarter due to higher subscription pricing, higher digital subscribers and relatively stable print volume. At Professional Information business we saw positive net installs and year-over-year revenue growth absent currency for the second consecutive quarter. We also saw strong growth in Risk and Compliance and continued stability at Factiva.","At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 26% or 11% of local currency consistent with the last quarter as the marketplace remains challenging across most categories. Print advertising declines were partially offset by strong growth in digital at both the metro mastheads and at news.com.au.","Circulation revenue saw a double-digit decline versus the prior year. But in local currency, revenue rose low single digits due to cover price increases and higher digital subs. Importantly, revenues from digital paid subscribers nearly offset print volume declines.","Digital paid subscribers grew over 30% year-over-year to 268,000 for newspapers and other publications as of the q end. Digital continues to increase its proportion of weekday circulation volume for all metro titles and for the Australian. And Digital now comprises over 40% of subscribers compared to the same period in the prior year.","As we noted last quarter, we are actively addressing the cost structure of News Australia. The benefits of the initiative implemented in the latter part of fiscal second quarter will begin to flow through from the beginning of the second half of this fiscal year and continue through fiscal 2017 to deliver a 5% annualized, fixed-cost reduction across most areas of the business.","At News UK, overall advertising revenue declined 12%, or 8% in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising, particularly at the Sun, led by the grocers and telecomm providers. The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance of the Sun, particularly its digital proposition. The Sun changed its digital strategy and removed its paywall on November 30. Based on internal metrics, Sun\u2019s December unique users were over 14 million, relatively similar to pre-paywall levels. We expect from the site relaunch, as Robert referenced, to see higher audience levels and improved revenues in the coming quarters.","In Q2, the Times and Sunday Times continued to gain market share with growth in circulation revenues and stable volume, including 172,000 digital-only subscribers as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of total paid subscribers. News UK also continues to look very closely at its cost base, focusing on corporate overhead costs and streamlining of their business processes.","At News America Marketing, revenues declined 3% versus the prior-year quarter, although a sequential improvement from Q1. FSI remains weak but was largely offset by growth in domestic in-store and in digital advertising. News America Marketing is focused on integrating Checkout 51, its recently acquired digital and mobile coupon company, and expanding its user base. Checkout 51 is a data-rich platform of transactions which have the potential to be leveraged across News Corp\u2019s portfolio of companies.","Outlook for the fiscal third quarter for the FSI business remains particularly challenging and we are also planning additional investments in Checkout 51 to drive membership. For the quarter User Information Services segment EBITDA declined 27% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 22%.","We experienced higher marketing and retail promotion expenses at News UK of around $17 million, primarily related to competitive cover pricing pressure but we expect that that should moderate materially next quarter. Reported segment EBITDA also includes $5 million for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Unruly, as I noted earlier, and $5 million of legal expenses at Views America marketing for ongoing litigations.","Turning to the book publishing segment, revenue decreased 5% and segment EBITDA declined 26% versus the prior year. Declines were due to lower e-book volume across the marketplace, similar to the first quarter and tougher year-ago Divergent comps and some FX headwinds. Titles to call out this quarter included Rhee Drummond\u2019s The Pioneer Woman Cooks, and Sarah Young\u2019s Jesus Calling.","Total digital revenues for the quarter were 16% of consumer revenues, down from 19% the prior year, partially due to the Divergent series which sold around 600,000 units this quarter versus approximately 1.5 million units in Q2 last year. It\u2019s also worth noting that for our fiscal third quarter we will continue to have tough comps against higher Divergent sales in the prior year of 2.3 million units and additionally around 2.7 million units of American Sniper.","In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $54 million or 35% to $208 million. Segment EBITDA was $73 million, up 28% compared to the prior-year period, as improving operating results at REA Group were partially offset by foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding foreign currency and reflecting the inclusion of half a quarter results of Move, adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 22% and 19% respectively.","REA\u2019s revenues grew 20% in local currency and EBITDA increased at a notably higher rate in local currency due to higher listing depth product penetration. The acquisition of the remaining shares of iProperty REA doubled already owned for approximately Australian $480 million or U.S. $340 million should close in mid-February. REA expects to incur roughly U.S. $5 million in transaction costs in the second half related to this acquisition.","iProperty will be consolidated into REA commencing this quarter and is expected to have no material impact on News Corp\u2019s EPS for the current fiscal year. REA will be reporting its half year results shortly after this call.","Reported segment results include $87 million in revenues from move. Move generated mid-single digits EBITDA, excluding stock-based compensation in the quarter. Results for Move also included around $4 million of legal expenses for our litigation against Zillow. And we remain on track with our expectations to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year. On a standalone basis, Moves revenues would have grown 35% versus the prior year quarter, the highest rate of growth since the acquisition last November, and two-and-a-half times the rate of growth seen in Q2 of last fiscal year.","The improvement was led again by the connections for core brokerage product, a near doubling of non-listing ad revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange, higher audience levels and higher CPMs.","We are also continuing to see healthy increases in our Agents and local customer numbers. Unique user growth remains strong, up 37% to 39 million average for fiscal second quarter, a bit lower than the prior quarter due to seasonality. And this has increased the 50 million in January which has been a record month. Page views and minutes both accelerated versus the prior quarter. We also saw year-over-year and sequential improvement in Move\u2019s Software and Services business led by increase in subscribers to its top producer CRM product.","In Cable Network Programming revenues decreased by $6 million or 5% compared to the prior-year quarter, but on a currency-adjusted basis revenues increased 10%. Subscription revenues were down 7% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds. Excluding currency, subscriber revenue grew around 7%, helped by mid-single digit subscriber growth.","Advertising revenues grew 7%, benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the Motorsport properties, combined with higher underlying market share. In local currency terms, advertising revenues grew 29%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 28% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and the expected higher programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup of around U.S. $11 million.","In December last year, News Corp Australia, in conjunction with Fox Sports Australia, announced that it had secured a new five-year deal with the National Rugby League for the 2018 through 2022 seasons. Fox Sports Australia also announced the extension of Rugby Union through 2020. These new contracts, combined with the recent extension of the AFL, means that Fox Sports and Foxtel have long-term visibility and security, the most important sports rights in Australia.","On the NRL, beginning with the 2016 season, Fox Sports will broadcast all games live, including three matches per week that will be simulcast with Nine Network . This will cost incremental approximately U.S. $10 million in the second half of this fiscal year. This additional cost though will be completely offset by cost savings from the lapping of the Asian Cup and the Cricket World Cup from last year.","With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subscribers increasing over 7% compared to the prior-year period, and higher Presto subs despite increasing competition from SVOD players.","In the quarter, cable and satellite share improved to 10.3% from 11.8% in the prior year. ARPU has remained relatively steady since the new pricing initiative, but as expected is down mid-single digits compared to the prior year. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 5%, an improvement from the prior quarter, and EBITDA declined at a sequentially lower rate of 7% mainly due to planned higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees, and an expected increase in costs associated with higher sales volume and the launch of Triple Play and continued marketing investment in Presto.","Turning to loss from discontinued operations, this quarter we incurred a net loss of $24 million, which includes $17 million in severance and lease termination costs as part of the sale of the Insight and Learning businesses. We expect very minimal costs going forward to maintain support for the Tablet business and expect these to conclude by the end of fiscal 2016.","So in summary, whilst we face challenges this quarter, notably at the News and Information Services segment and in Book Publishing compounded by continued currency headwinds, we continue to invest in digital products including the integration of Unruly and Checkout 51 as Robert mentioned. We are driving higher Digital subs and audience across our key mastheads and building our digital revenue streams.","We\u2019re actively addressing our cost base, particularly focused in Australia and the U.K. and we expect to see these benefits flow through from the second half onwards. We continue to aggressively focus on Digital Real Estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of profitability for the future.","We have extended our real estate reach and expertise to a small investment in India and through REA\u2019s investment in Southeast Asia magnified by its planned acquisition of high property. And we have also solidified our content portfolio at Fox Sports Australia and Foxtel and have long-term visibility with the most valuable domestic sports.","We believe that the steps we have been taking continue to position News Corp to drive long-term value per share. We are pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns.","And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from John Janedis with Jeffries.","John Janedis","Thank you. You talked about the macro headwinds and you\u2019ve also been focused on acquisitions over the past couple of years, and so with the mixed picture do you think this creates more opportunities to buy assets? And in the past you talked about a consistent return to capital program. Is this an opportunity to be more aggressive on the buyback front? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Well, John, I understand that you wouldn\u2019t expect me to reveal any details about any particular acquisitions we may or may not have in mind. You have your own prescience on that. The truth is that we\u2019re very happy with the mix of the portfolio that we have now. You can see how complimentary the assets are that we\u2019ve acquired. These haven\u2019t been random investments by any means and so any investment we would ever contemplate has to fit that picture where we genuinely believe it becomes more than the sum of the parts. And the way that we\u2019ve been able to use Realtor for example to increase the usage and the downloading of the at the Checkout 51, the way we\u2019ve been able to use MarketWatch to boost traffic to Realtor, and vice versa, has been an important part of the strategy. So that strategic imperative which we articulated at the time of the spend remains constant at the moment.","As for the use of capital, we want to be consistent in our messaging and consistent in our returns of capital. We have, as you know, instituted a semi-annual dividend and we want to be consistent about that, and we\u2019ve had a lot of buyback program. We want to be consistent about that as well. And so the principle of a certain amount of return is one that we\u2019ve established, and we will abide by that principle. But on the other day, should there be a strategic opportunity for investment, we remain attuned to that possibility.","Mike Florin","Thanks, John. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi, Robert. Hi, Bedi. My question is around the Australian Publishing operations and obviously we\u2019ve seen pretty severe declines in the market overall. How are you thinking about those operations going forward? Are they contingent on consolidation taking place? And I guess as part of that question, would any consolidation in the market, in your view, be contingent on media reform which has been speculated? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Entcho, there has been speculation about media reform. I\u2019m not going to speculate about the possible outcome other than to say that one, it should be holistic; and two, that it should reflect the reality of the contemporary digital age.","For Australian mastheads clearly, as both Bedi and I have articulated, it was a difficult quarter in advertising, and to that extent we\u2019ve clearly embarked on a cost cutting program at the mastheads. Now of course, a consequence is that cost cutting has a cost, a short term cost and a long term benefit, but we are not being defeatist about the power of those platforms. They are very powerful platforms. And so we will continue to invest in the digital development, and we continue to believe that our print has a future as a powerful platform.","For example, you look at all the angst over add blockers. You know what, add blockers don\u2019t work on newspapers, and you have 100% viewability. So the reality of power of print as a platform, as part of our portfolio, remains constant. And I think we are in a period of advertising experimentation, and some advertisers would be, I think, slightly surprised to find the sites that they find themselves associated with. They are not premium sites; they range from the ordinary to the tawdry. Our sights are premium sights, and that value is an enduring value.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Entcho. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. My one question is sort of related to the first one, which is on cash reallocation. I guess with the heavy cash balance, would it be fair to assume that when assets headwinds subside or the business gets a bit more stable that the Board may be likely to revisit being more aggressive on either the size of the dividend or the pace of the buyback? Or is it more likely that you\u2019ll keep a lot of dry powder because acquisitions will always remain a higher priority?","Bedi Singh","Alexia, I think Robert summarized very eloquently the answer to that question. I think we said in the past that when you look at cap returns you have to think of those in the context of our operating cash flows and the cash flows available to shareholders. And pretty much the balance of cash that we have is there to help us with investments, both internal and external. So I think we remain consistent with what we\u2019ve said before.","Robert Thomson","And I dare say when opportunities arise or are appropriate, we will be opportunistic.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Alexia. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","Thank you. We saw the New York Times report a strong pickup in digital subs today. And you mentioned some positive stats earlier for certain newspapers. Can you highlight in some more detail the gains you\u2019re making at some of your key newspapers? What\u2019s working and what you learned from the Sun?","Robert Thomson","Well certainly, it varies by geography and demography. But at the Wall Street Journal, we\u2019re seeing strong growth digitally. Not alone in numbers but also in circulation revenues. So the ARPU is strong. At the Sun, as both Bedi and I explained, we will be relaunching the site in March. And that, combined with the fact that it\u2019s obviously a changing of that model, we\u2019re confident in the power of that platform. Not only in the service it can provide for readers but also in the functionality for advertisers.","The Times of London is doing extremely well, behind a strict paywall. It is, I think by most measures, the most successful newspaper in the UK at the moment. It\u2019s gaining in market share, it\u2019s gaining in revenue. We have explained in the past that it has reached profitability, which is fair to say wasn\u2019t the case when I was the editor a few years ago.","Eric Katz","Thank you.","Mike Florin","Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim.","Michael Morris","Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. My question\u2019s really around the technology investment and something of a transformation I think you guys are making toward the more digital future you\u2019ve referenced. It seems like you\u2019ve invested in interesting technologies that have been complementary. But my question is are you getting to a point where you have a critical mass of technology expertise where you can really start identifying and developing your own solutions and maybe even selling those outside the company and what does it take to get there? Is it hiring more within the structures that you\u2019ve built or do you think you have to acquire more technological expertise going forward?","Robert Thomson","I think we have, it\u2019s fair to say a brilliant tech team. We\u2019re very happy with the pace of development internally. We\u2019re not arrogant about that, because it\u2019s a challenging environment and this is a tech team that\u2019s up for the challenge. In part, you have to ensure that when you acquire a wonderfully creative company like Storyful or Unruly that you\u2019re able to integrate them in a meaningful way. They can\u2019t become orphans. So that\u2019s as much a cultural challenge as a technological challenge. So we\u2019ve been very careful to introduce the leaders of those companies and tech engineers of those companies right across the News Corp network, and because you want them to be beacons of creativity and ingenuity institutionally, So they\u2019re performing that role that\u2019s difficult to define in a pure metric sense but is absolutely material to the future of the company.","Mike Florin","Thanks Mike. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi. Just wanted to further understand the cost savings plan going forward please in book publishing but also the newspaper area, it looked like in the last quarter if you adjust for currency or news and information cost were flat or maybe lightly down. Just talk a little bit further about your game plan to take out more cost there please. Thank you.","Bedi Singh","I think I referenced the cost savings that we have more on the newspaper side. I think on the book publishing side they are obviously taking costs out after the Harlequin acquisition; and I think for Harlequin we had said that there would be around $20 million of synergy savings. I think we are pretty much on track to get the majority of those in this fiscal year and obviously software flowed into the first half. With respect to the newspaper, in Australia we\u2019ve indicated that we\u2019re looking at like a 5% run rate sort of cost savings into the future. In terms of dollars that\u2019s around, in the first half it was around $40 million to $50 million, I think on an annualized basis we expect it to be in the $60 million to $70 million range of savings. News U.K. is aggressively looking at its cost structure. We haven\u2019t given specific numbers out on that.","But again, as I said in Q2, while reported sort of costs are down 5%, the head count \u2013 it\u2019s mainly through head count and most of that through Australia. We\u2019ve also renegotiated newsprint and ink deals. That\u2019s had a sort of significant impact. We\u2019ve closed printing facilities. We\u2019ve got rid of some of our loss-making activities. So I think generally all of those things are continuing and we\u2019d expect to see the benefits flowing through into the future.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Craig. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Doug Arthur","Yeah, just a point of clarification on your targets that move on the bottom line. The positive EBITDA by year-end, is that with or without stock comp?","Bedi Singh","Sorry, with or without?","Doug Arthur","Yeah, I mean in other words will you be...","Bedi Singh","Oh, stock comp. Yeah, we will be EBITDA-positive on both, with and without stock comp.","Doug Arthur","Okay. Thanks.","Bedi Singh","But clearly without stock comp the EBITDA numbers are a lot bigger. And of course just to sort of remember our competitors when they report, they report all their numbers before stock compensation expense whereas News Corp has traditionally included stock compensation expense in the numbers we report. So that\u2019s why I try and give both of those metrics. So you have a helpful comparison. So\u2026","Mike Florin","Thanks, Doug. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen","Hi, thanks. My question is on e-books. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever heard a publisher before say that their print business was up and their digital was down. I appreciate that there were some comp issues in the quarter that affected the digital sales. But I just wonder if you could explain a little bit more what\u2019s happening with E-books in general? It seems like a few years ago we would\u2019ve thought it would\u2019ve been a larger percentage of total book sales, now 16% as a percentage of total sales seems a bit small to me.","I know there\u2019s some differences between fiction versus nonfiction titles and print versus e-book, but anything you can say on pricing between the two, profitability between the two? And if you might even have to dial back some of these efforts in digital and go back to print? I know that sounds perhaps extreme but anything you could say on that, please?","Robert Thomson","Look it\u2019s a fascinating question and clearly what it shows is that purchasers make a discerning decision based on price. They are valuing a print book versus an e-book. And so you\u2019re quite right, it\u2019s not just the mix. Although clearly a \u2013 for example, a teen fiction book is heavily digital and a coffee table book is a coffee table book. But the longer term I think it\u2019s fair to presume that the digital ratio will increase and exactly what that ratio will be is a matter for the soothsayers. But you can see that as people are getting devices they aren\u2019t necessarily downloading as many digital books as they did previously. There is more competition on devices for the digital experience.","But our very, very astute team at HarperCollins is learning these lessons as we go. They are intelligent, they are creative, they understand also how people read digitally a little differently to say two years ago when early adopters had one pattern, and mature adopters had another. So we certainly see book publishing as an area of opportunity, both in print and in digital.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Tim. Noel, we will take our next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our next question from Sacha Krien with CLSA.","Sacha Krien","Hi, Robert. Hi, Bedi. I\u2019ve just got a question in relation to Foxtel and Fox Sports because I think you had previously guided toward EBITDA growth for the full year for Foxtel. Are we still on track for that outcome? And what\u2019s the assumptions that depend on in terms of subs growth? And then in relation to Fox Sports, Bedi, you mentioned the incremental costs renewal in the second half of 2016. To what extent can we see that being offset in FY 2017? You mentioned offsets in second half 2016. Are they any in FY 2017? Thanks.","Bedi Singh","So I think with respect to Foxtel you know we expect strong growth in Q3 and Q4. And I think we believe that we are in line for EBITDA growth as we said before for the full year. EBITDA improvement fuels the cyber revenue as I said going up, as well as there will be some additional cost savings in a business wide in programming, sales and marketing as it becomes ease with what the level of costs were in Q2. So I think we are on track with Foxtel.","Robert Thomson","There is a lot of competition in the market at the moment when you look at for example, Netflix and others. But what I think you need to understand is that Netflix in the U.S. is very different to Netflix in Australia. The Australian operation has quantitatively and qualitatively a far lesser offering, and you might puckishly call it not Netflix, but Notflix. And we believe that as people look closely at the offerings that the value that Foxtel can bring will become increasingly apparent.","Mike Florin","Okay. And there\u2019s a question on Fox Sports. Sasha, did you have a question on Fox Sports?","Sacha Krien","Yes. I was just wondering, Bedi, you mentioned that you would be able to offset the incremental costs in the NRL in the second half of 2016 given the cycle in the World Cup costs and also Soccer costs. Just wondering is there any offset in FY 2017 either at the cost line or via subscription cost increases.","Bedi Singh","I think clearly expect EPL will be affected. We will see continued revenue growth from subscriber build into fiscal 2017.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Sacha. Noel, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue. I\u2019ll actually turn it back to Mike Florin for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Florin","Great. Well, thank you, Noel. Thank you all for participating and have a great rest of the day.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Media is allowed to join today\u2019s conference in a listen-only mode. At this time, for opening marks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Florin, Head of Investor Relations at News Corp. Please go ahead.","Mike Florin","Thank you very much, Tom. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2016 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive, and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2016, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally please note that certain financial measures used in this call such a segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. In our pursuit of digital and particularly mobile growth, we continue to develop and to diversify the portfolio of our businesses and aggressively control our opening costs to free resources for further innovation and to expand margins across the company.","The third quarter results were materially affected by a $280 million pretax charge at News America Marketing to resolve a legacy lawsuit and related claims and continued currency headwinds, which impacted revenues by $72 million and EBITDA by $9 million. Excluding those factors and other special items, our revenues and total segment EBITDA declined 5% and 8%, respectively, which was disappointing. We believe, however, that the company is on track to see improvements in the fourth quarter with the expansion of our digital real estate business, foreign currency comparisons hopefully beginning to ease, and cost saving initiatives that confirm the root.","Our pursuit of digital growth continues apace and we enhanced our status as the world\u2019s largest digital property company with REA\u2019s completion of the iProperty acquisition in Southeast Asia, where we are now the most influential player. Meanwhile, traffic and revenue growth remained robust at REA and Realtor.com. We have focused on driving mobile revenue and are pleased with, but are not complacent about, the results at Realtor.com, where their mobile audience grew close to 50% this quarter and now represents 60% of page views and the majority of leads.","Despite the difficult conditions for advertising, we saw both Dow Jones and News Corp Australia contributing to segment EBITDA growth thanks to more digital subscriptions, digital advertising growth, and ongoing cost-reduction. While we believe in the strength of our print properties, we are investing energetically in the rapid pursuit of digital which is clearly evident in the transition at Dow Jones. At Dow Jones this quarter, digital accounted for more than 50% of total revenues, and digital only subscribers at the Wall Street Journal grew to 893,000, representing nearly 45% of the base.","We are building a strong digital platform on top of the WSJ print circulation, which today is double the size of its nearest rival. And 51% of the Wall Street Journal digital audience now comes from mobile, up six percentage points from a year ago. With the advertising market in the midst of upheaval, advertisers and agencies are understandably experimenting with their spend, but we firmly believe that premium brands and audiences are currently undervalued by advertising agencies, some of whom are more interested in fashion than function.","With Silicon Valley\u2019s demand for quality content more voracious than ever and advertisers rightly seeking greater digital accountability, we believe News Corp is ideally positioned to capitalize on these macro trends through the power of our global mastheads, businesses, and audiences. Bedi will shortly provide more granular detail in the numbers, but reported revenues fell 7% to $1.9 billion, and the reported total segment EBITDA loss was $122 million. Excluding the one-time pretax legal charge of $280 million at News America Marketing, total segment EBITDA would have been $158 million, a decline of 14%.","We are very focused on leveraging the key strength of our portfolio. As one example, we\u2019ve recently reached an agreement with a leading consumer packaged goods company that involves both News America Marketing and Realtor.com and we expect many more such deals, as advertisers appreciate the value of our brand and deep audience relationships. Let me review some of our lines of business, beginning with Digital Real Estate Services.","With the ongoing success of REA, the completion of REA\u2019s acquisition of iProperty, and the growth of Realtor.com, News Corp\u2019s digital real estate business is continuing its robust expansion. iProperty is the leading digital platform in Southeast Asia, complementing our existing businesses and allowing the further repurposing of software and of expertise.","News Corp Australia also completed the acquisition of Diakrit, a leading provider of 3D visualization for the real estate industry, which we plan to incorporate more broadly at REA and around the industry. This will help differentiate News Corp\u2019s digital real estate capabilities worldwide and provide a valuable service to realtors, vendors, and buyers.","For the most recent quarter revenues at Move, which operates Realtor.com expanded at 20% year-over-year, while user engagement at Realtor.com continue to grow briskly, with page views more than 25% higher to a record 1.5 billion views. And minutes spent on the site increasing nearly 30% year-over-year. We have momentum and the strongest engagement in the US housing market. A market that we believe is yet to fully recover from the financial crisis, and is still at a relatively early phase of its digital evolution.","Also in this quarter, average monthly unique users increased by 30% year-over-year, including strong growth in mobile. For the month of April, we recorded 55 million monthly uniques, and the average user of our mobile app accessed around 20 pages per visit, and that\u2019s not including photo galleries. We are continuing to improve our product line to enhance of the services for realtors and the efficacy for users.","We have number of new products coming to market at Realtor.com, including Turbo which will assist in the promotion of listings for agents and brokers. Early in FY17, we plan to roll out Showcase 2.0 to provide even more direct links to properties and leads for realtors, vendors, and buyers. We\u2019re also enhancing our software and services offerings for agents to improve the efficiency of their business and bolster the efficacy of leads and ROI. We continue to enhance the site experience to drive deeper engagement, personalization, and integrating more relevant content with robust, local neighborhood information.","In Australia, where digital real estate is at a more advanced stage of development, the REA Group had a solid quarter, with revenues expanding by 20% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign currency, thanks primarily to the broader penetration of premium products. REA in Australia has more than twice the traffic of its nearest competitor, and REA continues to work ever more closely with Realtor.com and other News Corp properties. One modest sign of our partnership was the successful launch this past week by the Australian newspaper of a glossy magazine, Mansion, based on the Wall Street Journal\u2019s well-known section and in conjunction with REA.","Overall, excluding currency and M&A costs, adjusted revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment grew 18% and adjusted EBITDA grew 23% year-over-year despite the higher legal costs at Move, which is involved in ongoing litigation in tandem with the National Association of Realtors against Zillow over the theft of corporate secrets and the destruction of evidence.","In Australia, Fox Sports posted strong EBITDA growth in part due to the absence of costs from the Cricket World Cup and Asia cup in the prior year. We are encouraged by the particularly robust ratings with the launch of the new season of Rugby League and Australian Rules Football. The NRL and AFL are both up low double digits over the prior year. We believe the strong early returns in both sports this year are positive indicators for subscriber growth and advertising and highlight the value of our deals to secure NRL and Aussie Rules rights until 2022. These key sports should provide a platform for the long-term growth of our franchise.","At Foxtel, we saw the appointment of Peter Tonagh as CEO, and expect that he will further develop the company, which we operate in partnership with Telstra in Australia. There have been several changes to the Foxtel executive team, and we are confident that the development of products, and crucially, the marketing of those products will be enhanced over the coming year. In a challenging marketplace, Foxtel grew subscribers to around 2.9 million subs, which included a roughly 6% increase in cable and satellite subs versus the prior year and higher Presto subscribers.","An Foxtel is announcing today an agreement with six top English Premier league clubs, launching three dedicated channels with all home and away matches for Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur, and most significantly and profoundly, Arsenal. These teams account for 75% of the EPL fan base in Australia.","This agreement is yet another strong sign of how Foxtel differentiates itself from the competition with its premier content, which we believe also includes Australia\u2019s best portfolio of films and other programs and a growing roster of homegrown dramas that are proven audience pleasers. We expect our new team will make that point to consumers tempted by lesser offerings from other providers who may have name recognition but a relatively limited flow of compelling content.","Foxtel, which has an approximate 14% equity stake in the Ten Network, is already seeing benefits from the MCN advertising joint venture. The partnership with MCN delivers a broadened sale platform and obvious operating efficiencies. It is worth noting that Ten was the only free-to-air network to gain market share in its fiscal first half.","While HarperCollins faced a challenging quarter, as we had foreshadowed due to tough comparisons with the strong sales of Divergent and American Sniper last year, the trends do appear to be improving. There is a stronger pipeline, including the paperback edition of Go Set a Watchman and the publication of Megyn Kelly\u2019s first book, scheduled to appear this November.","In the next fiscal year, we look forward to launching the latest books from Daniel Silva, Patricia Cornwell, and Veronica Roth, the author of the Divergent series, whose next novel, Carve The Mark, the first part of a duology to release in January. The books cover was released today to much acclaim by Veronica\u2019s many, many fans. As a result, we are encouraged by the outlook for the next fiscal year, and expect to see improved year-over-year comparisons in the current quarter. We also continued to strengthen our international operations to make most of hit books globally. For example, by having taken full control of our operations in Italy and France and expanding in India.","At News and Information Services, while the print ad market, particularly in the UK, remains somewhat challenging, and News America Marketing\u2019s FSI revenues were certainly under pressure, we are continuing to rightsize our cost structure while emphasizing the importance of high-quality content and providing creative products and quality audiences for our advertisers.","This quarter, segment EBITDA reflected positive growth at both Dow Jones and at News Corp Australia, thanks in part to the benefits of earlier efficiencies. Let me take a moment to discuss some of our cost initiatives in detail. At News Australia, we\u2019ve announced an initial goal of 5% in annualized fixed cost reductions across the business, and we are well on the way to achieving that target with AUD40 million of cost savings expected in the second half of this fiscal year.","These are savings range from lower production costs to the closure of lossmaking businesses and reduced headcount across the divisions. This, along with a moderation in print ad declines and acceleration in digital revenue has contributed to News Corp Australia\u2019s stronger quarter this quarter. As a way to demonstrate our scale, according to a new study by Nielsen and IAB, News Corp digital properties reached just under 16 million Australians above the age of 14 in each month, which is higher than Facebook.","At Dow Jones, expenses moderated thanks to a combination of lower sales and marketing spend and reduced newsprint expense. We continue to make strides in circulation, outpacing our peers, and as we\u2019ve communicated, we have ambitious goals for ongoing digital growth. In this quarter, we also relaunched the MarketWatch website and we have seen 20% revenue growth, with quarterly traffic exceeding 20 million unique users and page views of over 150 million, up high teens versus the second quarter.","At the professional information business, we rolled out customized newswires, created a new vertical targeted at financial regulation and launched Factiva Mobile, providing additional avenues of future growth and improving the service for our professional subscribers. Revenues at our risk and compliance business grew 30% year-over-year, and the tougher regulatory climate in many sectors, particularly in financial services, is clearly stimulating demand for our products.","At News UK, we still see challenges in the ad market. There was continued weakness in print demand, specifically from the supermarket sector, which itself is in the midst of upheaval. But variable and fixed operating costs are both declines, a trend which Bedi will detail momentarily. In addition, the cover price of the Sun rose 10P in March, and the Times cover price increased by 20P in April. We\u2019re looking forward to the launch of a redesigned Sun website in the coming weeks, which should attract more traffic and be a stronger ad platform.","We believe there is clearly room for significant growth in digital advertising of the Sun, given that the site itself has just emerged from behind a payable. Traffic is almost doubled to more than 35 million monthly unique visitors since October, after which the site was fully opened.","News America Marketing continues to face pressure on freestanding insert revenues, while domestic in-store display showed solid growth. Our key ambition is to complement the printed coupon business with a new mobile offering, which is why the team is focused on growth at Checkout 51. Leveraging our platforms at Dow Jones, the New York Post, and Realtor.com, NAM has accelerated expansion of Checkout 51 and it is now in the top 10 of all free shopping apps in the Apple Store.","As mentioned previously, we announced this quarter that News America Marketing has agreed to settle its legacy class action lawsuit with consumer packaged goods companies that was instigated by trial lawyers. We\u2019re pleased that we can continue to work with our long-term business partners without the unwelcome distraction of this case. In conclusion, we are focused on rapidly shifting News Corp into higher growth businesses while determinedly reducing our expenses at the news and information services segment to better reflect the changes in the advertising market. And we\u2019re pleased with the continuing progress in digital real estate, which has become a large and growing pillar for the company\u2019s future.","With that, I\u2019ll turn you to Bedi for further detail on the quarter\u2019s numbers.","Bedi Singh","Thanks, Robert. We reported FY16 third quarter total revenues of $1.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year period.","As Robert noted we were again impacted by currency headwinds, although lessening from the prior quarter, which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $72 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions, adjusted total revenues declined 5% compared to the prior year.","Reported total segment EBITDA loss of $122 million includes a one-time pretax charge of $280 million related to News America Marketing\u2019s settlement of the CPG class-action lawsuit and related claims. Excluding that cost, total segment EBITDA would\u2019ve been a positive $158 million. Currency fluctuations impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $9 million or 5%, and we also incurred transaction costs of $7 million related to REA\u2019s acquisition of iProperty and $3 million in legal costs related to the UK newspaper matters.","For the quarter, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.04 versus $0.09 in the prior year. Reported EPS from continuing operations, which includes the News America Marketing settlement charge net of tax, were negative $0.26 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.","Turning now to the individual operating segments. In news and information services revenues for the quarter declined $122 million, down 9% versus the prior year period. Adjusted segment revenue declined 6%. Within these segment revenues, advertising declined around 15%, or roughly 11% in local currency due to a weakness at the FSI business in News America Marketing and in print advertising, offset by strong digital ad growth at Dow Jones.","Circulation and subscription revenues declined 4%, but were overall flat in local currency. News and information services reported a segment EBITDA loss of $187 million. Excluding the News America Marketing settlement charge, segment EBITDA this quarter would\u2019ve been a positive $93 million, a decline of 18% compared to the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA was down 11%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate, with declines at News America Marketing partially offset by growth in our newspapers due to strong improvements at both Dow Jones and News Australia.","Looking at performance across our key units. At Dow Jones, domestic advertising at the Wall Street Journal declined 4% versus the prior-year quarter, a slight improvement from last quarter. Declines in print advertising were again partially offset by continued solid growth in digital, driven by strength in programmatic and custom content. And digital accounted for approximately one third of Dow Jones\u2019 ad revenues this quarter.","Wall Street Journal circulation revenues grew 5% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers, as print volume remained relatively stable. Digital only paid subscribers were 893,000 for the quarter, a strong double digit gain over the prior year. And at PIB, we saw positive net installs and stable revenues excluding currency, led principally by continued strength in the risk and compliance business.","At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 15% or 7% in local currency. The rate of decline in print advertising moderated due to sequential improvements in the national and retail categories, and we also saw an acceleration in digital advertising growth compared to last quarter, led by strength at News.com.au. Circulation revenues at News Australia were relatively stable in constant currency as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs, largely offsetting print volume declines.","We took a cover price increase for the weekday Metro newspapers of $0.10 during the quarter. Digital paid subscribers grew over 25% year-over-year to 273,000 for newspapers and other publications as of the quarter end. And as expected, we are seeing the benefit of the cost reduction program implemented at the end of Q2, and realized an estimated AUD17 million of cost savings in the quarter and are on track to meet the AUD40 million target for the second \u2013 fiscal second half. As a result, News Australia showed improvement both on reported and local currency basis compared to the prior year.","At News UK, advertising revenues declined 21%, or down mid teens in local currency, driven by weakness in print advertising at both the Sun and Times, reflecting a weakened marketplace from the prior quarter. Digital, while small as a percentage of revenues, accelerated led by the Sun. Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-single digits in local currency compared to the prior year, primarily due to news stand volume declines and the removal of the Sun\u2019s paywall, which were partially offset by subscription and cover price increases.","The key management focus at News UK is on improving the performance at the Sun, particularly its digital proposition. We will be relaunching the Sun\u2019s website imminently, which will be integrated with much more video and better aligned for mobile usage and monetization in conjunction with our video ad platform, Unruly.","In Q3, the Times continued to gain circulation market share and saw modest volume growth. The Times had 174,000 digital subs as of the quarter end, representing more than 40% of the total paid subscribers. Declines at News UK moderated from last quarter, primarily reflecting overhead and editorial saving initiatives, lower newsprint prices across our titles and cover price increases.","At News America Marketing, revenue declined 17% versus the prior year quarter. FSI weakened this quarter due to lower volumes and pricing pressure, as we had anticipated. Domestic in-store, however, rose slightly this quarter. News America Marketing also incurred higher investment spending at Checkout 51, its digital and mobile coupon company. Checkout 51 is a key part of the strategy to digitize News America Marketing, and the current focus, as Robert mentioned, is to drive app downloads and expand usage.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenue decreased 11% and segment EBITDA declined 36% versus the prior year. Declines were due to expected tougher year ago comps from the sales of the Divergent series and American Sniper, as we noted in the last earnings call, as well as lower e-book volume across the marketplace, similar to the second quarter. As a result, total digital revenues for the quarter were 21% of consumer revenues, down from 25% in the prior year.","Divergent sold less than 1 million units this quarter compared to 2.3 million units in Q3 last year, and HarperCollins also sold 2.7 million units of American sniper in the prior year. Combined, those two franchises accounted for the majority of the year-over-year revenue shortfall. Top-selling books this quarter include The Nest by Cynthia Sweeney, and Pretty Happy by Kate Hudson in general trade books, and the Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard in children\u2019s.","And Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $24 million, or 14% to $194 million, which includes the consolidation of iProperty and Diakrit, which closed in February and the lapping of the Move acquisition in November 2014. Segment EBITDA was $39 million, down from $42 million in the prior year. This reflects $7 million in one-time transaction costs for the iProperty acquisition, higher planned marketing expenses at REA Group, and $11 million higher legal expenses at Move related to the Zillow litigation.","Importantly, adjusted revenue and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 18% and 23% respectively, inclusive of the $11 million higher legal expenses at Move. As Robert noted, Move is currently in litigation with Zillow, and we would expect to incur some additional legal costs in the fourth quarter as we prepare for trial in early June. REA\u2019s revenues grew 9% or approximately 20% in local currency due to higher list depth product penetration, partially offset by an earlier Easter as compared to the prior year.","Move revenues rose 20% versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in the connection for core brokers product and higher non-listing media revenues, partially offset by reduced ad inventory as part of the site redesign. Unique user growth at Realtor remains strong, up 30% to 50 million average per month for fiscal Q3 and hitting a record 55 million users in April.","In cable network programming, revenues decreased by $9 million, or 8% compared to the prior year, but on a currency adjusted basis, revenues were flat. Subscription revenue declined 5% as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by FX headwinds.","Excluding currency, subscriber revenues grew around 3%. Advertising revenue declined 18% due to the absence of the Asian Cup and Cricket World Cup in the prior year and the local currency ad revenues declined around 12%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter, however, rose 26% on a reported basis and 33% adjusted for currency, due to lower acquisition costs from the absence of these two sporting events. With respect to earnings from affiliates, Fox 10 entered the quarter with approximately 2.9 million total subscribers, with cable and satellite subs increasing approximately 6% compared to the prior year period and higher Presto subs despite increased competitions from SVOD players.","Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% and EBITDA declined 4% in local currency due to higher programming costs and an increase in subscriber acquisition costs driven by new offers launched in January. Foxtel no longer expects to increase EBITDA over FY15 due to these factors and continued focus on sales and marketing. Foxtel posted record gross cable and satellite ads this quarter, driven by favorable consumer reception to offers in the market.","Churn in the quarter rose to 14.3% from 10.9%, which was largely driven by subscribers on no contract offers, and we expect churn to remain higher than normal in the short-term. However, year to date churn was relatively stable, and amongst longer tenured subscribers, remains near record low levels.","Heading into the fiscal fourth quarter, there are a few points to note. First, as we\u2019ve disclosed in our filings, this being a 53 weeks fiscal year for us, we have an extra week in fiscal fourth quarter, which should have a modest positive impact on revenue and EBITDA. We expect to see continued cost savings at NIS segment across each of our key mastheads and the flow-through of recent cost saving initiatives.","Book Publishing should benefit from the normalizing of comparables given the absence of Divergent comps and a strong pipeline this quarter, including the paperback release of Go Set A Watchman. We expect REA to benefit from the early Easter, which should be a positive on listing volume in Q4, and Move continuous to expect strong revenue growth off the back of increased audience. And finally, CapEx for continuing operations for the year is likely to be in the $240 million to $260 million range, below the $308 million from last year.","And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","There\u2019s been quite a bit of news around potential buyout of Telstra\u2019s stake in Foxtel, so I was just wondering if you could touch on some of the key positive and negative aspects you\u2019re mulling over for that potential acquisition? And maybe just your general thoughts in that business over the next few years and how it differs from Telstra, who looks like they want to exit? And I guess on top of that what\u2019s your appetite for leverage to make a deal of this size happen?","Robert Thomson","Eric, we\u2019re not going to speculate on idle speculation. What we can tell you is that the new team at Foxtel, led by Peter Tonagh, and at our partners in Foxtel Telstra are determined to improve the business.","We\u2019re investing in subscriber growth, and you saw today with the announcement of the acquisition of EPL, the premier league rights for the six most important clubs, that day after day, week after week, Peter and team are both improving the product and most crucially improving the projection, because we believe that there\u2019s no doubt that Foxtel has the best suite of programs.","There\u2019s no doubt that that portfolio is starting to resonate. It already is resonating with our long-term subscribers. There\u2019s obviously a little bit more churn when you have a lot of offers out there, but long-term we believe that the health of Foxtel is robust and that we have a full faith in the new executive team. And I think the cleverness of the deal that they\u2019ve done on premier league rights tells you that we\u2019re certainly going to look after our fans who like EPL, but we were never going to acquire EPL in a way that would hurt EPS.","Now you might want to watch a game in the middle of the night and pay a lot of money to do that. That\u2019s what Australians would call a nocturnal marsupial, but you\u2019re a rather sad and sultry person in the middle the night, or you can watch the game, frankly, with your family at lunchtime and cheer on your favorite players. And one other thing about the particularly interesting offering that Peter and the team have at Foxtel is that you\u2019ll also be able to see all the reserve games, the under 21 games, and so when well-known players like [indiscernible] or Jack Wilshire come back into the intermediate teams ahead of playing in the mountain, you\u2019ll be able to watch those games as well.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Eric. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Hello, Robert. Hello, Bedi. My question is around digital real estate services and Move specifically. Apologies if I missed this, but are you able to tell us what the EBITDA for Move was over the quarter, and then in light of the continued legal expenses which have been incurred, do you expect Move to be breakeven for the full-year?","Bedi Singh","So, we don\u2019t actually specific give out Move\u2019s EBITDA, but I can tell you that in Q3 there was positive EBITDA and this was despite the fact that we incurred the higher legal expenses in the Zillow litigation.","And we expect, clearly, given the audience growth we see at Move, we expect revenue growth going into Q4, and I would expect barring legal fees, which we don\u2019t know what the quantum of those could be in Q4. Barring legal fees to one side, we would expect to see EBITDA positive and EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter for Move.","Robert Thomson","Entcho, to supplement what Bedi said, and that includes our stock-based compensation, which some companies in the sector don\u2019t do. As Bedi said, we fully expect core EBITDA growth this quarter, and we fully expect even faster EBITDA growth in succeeding quarters. Were in the middle of what you might call home renovations at Realtor.com. You can see from what you might call a buy-side product, the co-broke where we have 45% revenue growth year on year.","That side of the business is doing well, and Ryan O\u2019Hara and the team at Move are now working on improving the sell side products. So that\u2019s one known as Turbo and another known as Showcase, and we expect over coming months and into the next fiscal for those also to have a positive impact.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Entcho. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","James Kopelman","Hi this is James Kopelman, in for Alexia. A question on the Journal and digital. Digital subs are obviously growing fast and you guys are reaching impressive levels. Can you talk about strategies for further growing digital subs, and maybe provide some color on what you\u2019re looking at, whether it\u2019s with regards to retention, perhaps lowering churn, or in terms of \u2013 on the product side, whether it\u2019s adding PDO, expanding into new verticals?","You mentioned MarketWatch earlier. I guess, where do you see the opportunities, and how are you exploiting them? And then as a follow-up, one of your publishing peers, I think when they were at a similar level of subs, within about a year they passed 1 million. So I guess any color on \u2013 if you could comment on what your own broad timeline is for hitting that key threshold of 1 million digital only subs? Thanks.","Robert Thomson","Well, we certainly are optimistic for the digital potential at Dow Jones and the Journal in particular. What we\u2019re doing obviously is emphasizing, as one must in the contemporary age of content, video, increasingly interactive engagement with this premium audience. But also developing new verticals. Virtuous verticals that give us more elasticity because they touch professionals in a way that, on a need to know basis, these are knowing audiences, but frankly they\u2019re also paying audiences.","I think you need to see the Dow Jones offering as essentially having three segments. The B2C and the B2B, both of which are well known, Factiva and newswires, venture capital related verticals are at the B2B side, but there\u2019s also a very strong B2P play between the consumer and the business. That\u2019s the business to professional, and we see that the team there, Will Lewis and the editorial team are constantly fashioning new products for the fast-growing B2P segment, which is obviously a more sophisticated product, frankly, at a more sophisticated price.","Mike Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Thank you. Robert, you talked about mastheads and audiences being undervalued by agencies, and I think you\u2019d say you have the scale and you felt that way for awhile. So how do you change that narrative and\/or inertia to realistically gain share of budget?","Robert Thomson","So that\u2019s a really good question. One way you change the narrative is to start talking about it, as we are. Secondly, we have to do a better job of selling the power of the platforms and the reach of the audiences. You look at our US digital platforms, and that\u2019s Realtor, the Post, Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch, that\u2019s around 160 million monthly uniques. And I\u2019ll tell you one story, which we use our own platforms to create new products and generate new audiences.","You may have noticed just over two weeks ago, we traded a packaged libertarian site called HeatStreet. HeatStreet has picked up 1 million uniques in just over two weeks. External marketing spend on Heat Street, $10,000. That is proof of the power of our platforms relative to external platforms.","We have to do a better job of explaining it, but quite frankly, I think advertisers need to challenge agencies. Because at times, the interest in the agency and the interest of the advertiser or not in alignment.","Mike Florin","Thanks, John. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Doug Arthur","Bedi, on book publishing, HarperCollins, just to be clear, are you expecting topline growth in the fourth quarter, or just improvement? Thanks.","Bedi Singh","Look, clearly it also depends on what the mix of books is, but at this stage when we look at where the last month and where we were entering this month, I would expect both topline growth and I would expect improvement at the bottom line.","Doug Arthur","Great. Thank you.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Doug. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber research.","Craig Huber","You guys threw out a lot of numbers on the new super ad revenues. I don\u2019t think I heard the UK ad revenue percent change in the core year over year without currency. And also, can you remind us, the Zillow lawsuit you talked about, what dollar amount are you guys going after there please?","Bedi Singh","On the UK, what I said was that ad revenues in the UK declined 21%, but in local currency they were down mid teens. And on the legal segment, I\u2019m not sure we are going to be saying a lot other than the fact that there is a trial date that\u2019s been set in early June and we are preparing to go to trial.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Craig. Operator, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Kass with BlueMountain Capital.","Michael Kass","Just a follow-up on one earlier question on Move. [indiscernible]. Did you disclose the revenue in the quarter for Move, you have generally done that?","Mike Florin","Mike, can you repeat the question, we just had trouble hearing you.","Michael Kass","I was wondering what the absolute revenue at Move in the quarter was?","Bedi Singh","We actually don\u2019t give out a separate number for actual revenue, we give out percentage increase.","Robert Thomson","It was up 20%, quarter on quarter. The unique users up 30% for the quarter itself, in April up 25%.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Thanks very much. Are you still incurring any cash flow losses on Amplify, even though you sold it? And also as a general question, what percentage of your newspaper cost space relates to newsprint now?","Bedi Singh","With respect to Amplify, we\u2019ve pretty much cleaned up most of the bits that were left over. In the quarter, there was a very immaterial loss, looking at the Q4. We have a very immaterial amount of cash flow to go, and we expect to be completely sheet cleaned up as of 30 of June.","Robert Thomson","And as for newsprint, newsprint is probably less than 10% of total cost for a masthead these days. What we have been able to do across our mastheads were the extra focus of the new news is whether it be software, the publishing systems, newsprint contracts, generally we are engaging a lot more collective cooperative bargaining of the company.","We are able to get costs down. Share experiences. Share expertise. De-dupe expenditure in a way that is having a tangible positive impact on all the cost bases.","Mike Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","We go next to Sacha Krien with CLSA.","Sacha Krien","Thanks, guys. In relation to News America Marketing legal costs, can you give us idea of the quantum of fees you\u2019ve incurred over the past quarter and perhaps over the past 12 months? And just to confirm that there aren\u2019t any legal fees rolled up in that charge? And then just a quick second question in relation to Foxtel. Is it churn that\u2019s the primary reason behind not hitting the previous guidance?","Bedi Singh","With respect to legal fees for NAM, we incurred $10 million roughly in the quarter, and the settlement that was for $280 million does not include these $10 million of legal fees, which went through separately.","Robert Thomson","As for Foxtel, as you know, we\u2019re in the midst of an intensive marketing drive. The churn will have an impact on revenues partly because, as Bedi mentioned, they are no contract offers. But you\u2019re still looking at ARPU in the high $80\u2019s which is significant. And you\u2019re looking at a low rate of churn for long-term customers. And you should note that Foxtel implemented a $1 price increase for the entertainment tier, which will have a benefit in the next quarter.","Mike Florin","Thanks. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please?","Operator","Next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen","Hi thanks. I\u2019m interested in the Sun, with you removing the paywall, and if I remember correctly, when you set up the paywall for the Times several years ago in the UK, your viewership dropped by a big number, 90% or something like that, which is understandable because you are getting people to pay.","So I just wonder if the Sun went through something similar, and now I think you said the unique\u2019s have \u2013 I think you said have doubled. I recognize it\u2019s relatively early, but it seems like there might be a lot more ground to recover, and I just wonder what might be different now versus the last time The Sun was basically free to all viewers. Thanks.","Robert Thomson","I think we have a lot of faith in the quality of content of the Sun. There\u2019s no doubt that the audience already has increased. We are relaunching the website itself in coming weeks, which we presume both obviously on desktop and crucially on mobile will have a profound impact.","The ad sales teams are gearing up for that opportunity and it\u2019s definitely an opportunity. The Sun will be a brand that resonates obviously particularly in the UK, but it\u2019s also a brand with a global halo. And so we see real potential there over coming quarters.","Mike Florin","Thanks Tim. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take a question from Michael Kass with BlueMountain Capital.","Michael Kass","Thanks for taking another question. I was just wondering, now that you\u2019ve settled at least on the CPG side, the NAM suit, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you see the value of that business quantitatively versus the pretty considerable settlement?","I guess from a market perspective, it\u2019s not clear that you\u2019re getting that much value from the ownership of NAM, and you don\u2019t disclose metrics, so why was it worth spending $300 million to settle this lawsuit?","Robert Thomson","As you can see, Marty and the team at NAM are investing significantly in the digital character of the company, because NAM has unique relationships with CPGs. It has unique relationships with retail. And what we\u2019re seeing with NAM coming closer to other parts of the organization, is those are complementary skills which are helping introduce, for example, Realtor and our other properties to advertisers who in the past may not have had a particularly close client relationship with us.","So the key thing over the next 12 months will be the development of digital. You always have to remember that NAM has significant free cash flow. That the in store business has been a growing strongly, even as the FSI business has been under pressure.","And in a very short period, Checkout 51 \u2013 and would advise you to check out Checkout 51, has become one of the top 10 shopping apps. And that means in terms of reach on the Apple App Store, it has more prominence that Walmart and Walgreens.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Mike. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take a question from Peter Stamoulis with Evans and Partners.","Peter Stamoulis","I was hoping you could provide a little visibility into programming costs back across Fox Sports Australia and Foxtel going forward of the next 12 months? Thanks.","Bedi Singh","In terms of Fox Sports, as you know, the simulcast of the NRL will be starting in the fourth-quarter. So we expect to incur some additional costs there. We will also have some additional costs related to a few more matches of Wimbledon and then the new Rugby Union contract also kicks in. So we\u2019ll see an increase in sports costs there.","But as you know, at Fox Sports costs tend to be lumpy, and so EBITDA tends to be a little lumpy. But overall we expect that in the fourth quarter, EBITDA should be improving slightly compared to the prior year.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Peter. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mr. Florin, there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","Mike Florin","Well, great. Thanks Tom, and thank you all for participating. Have a great rest of the day.

[Operator Instructions] Right now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2012 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. First, we'll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted net income, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating income, EPS, net income are included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David F. DeVoe","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you've seen in today's earnings release, we are quite pleased with our continued progress in fiscal 2012. We reported second quarter segment operating income of $1.5 billion, this is a 16% increase over last year. This improvement was led by a more than doubling of the contributions from of our Filmed Entertainment segment, as well as strong double-digit growth increases at our Cable Programming and Television segments. These increases more than offset declines at our Publishing and Other segments.","There are number of items in this year's second quarter worth highlighting for you. In the quarter, we recorded $87 million in costs related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom, which is reflected in the Other segment and significantly affected our operating income. We reported a $125 million pretax income in Other net line, which primarily reflects a non-cash gain related to the consolidation of Fox Pan American Sports. Additionally, equity earnings of affiliates includes a $44 million pretax gain from BSkyB's share repurchase program. And lastly, we took a $36 million restructuring charge primarily related to our international newspapers. ","Reported net income in the quarter was $1.06 billion, with reported earnings per share of $0.42 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.24. Excluding the net income effect in both years of onetime items consisting of the 4 items I just highlighted, as well as the comparable year ago charges, second quarter earnings per share this year of $0.39 compared with a year ago adjusted result of $0.29 and 34% earnings per share improvement. In addition to the operational achievements, the improved earnings per share result reflects $0.02 per share benefit from reduced shares outstanding as a result of the repurchases under our buyback program. ","With that, I'd like to provide some additional context on a few of our businesses. Let's start with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating nearly 60% of News Corporation segment operating income. Second quarter Cable segment operating income contributions increased 20% over last year's level to $882 million. This growth continues to be top line driven with segment revenues up 9%. Affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 11% over a year ago level, with domestic channel affiliate fees up 9% and international fees up 19%. ","Second quarter advertising revenues were up approximately 6% over last year at both the domestic, international cable channel businesses. And please note that the domestic channel ad trends includes an adverse impact at the Regional Sports Networks by the delay of the start of the NBA season. ","At our other domestic channels, advertising revenues were up 14% in the aggregate, driven by particular strength in FX. At our international channels, the Fox International Channels continued to report double-digit advertising revenue, while growth at STAR, its strong local currency advertising growth was more than offset --  was offset rather on a U.S. dollar reported basis due to the weakening of the Indian Rupee.","As noted in today's press release, the NBA lockout resulted in a net earnings benefit to the Cable segment in the quarter of approximately $55 million, with reduced rights and production cost more than offsetting the advertising and affiliate fee reductions. This benefit will reverse itself in the second half of our fiscal year as those NBA costs now shift to our third and fourth fiscal quarters, consistent with the timing of the games under the revised NBA schedule. ","At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $189 million increased 25% over the second quarter a year ago. This growth was driven by over 20% advertising increases at the broadcast network and higher retransmission fees that were partially offset by higher programming costs from our new fall series. Season to date, the Fox network 18-to-49 ratings were up 10% excluding the Super Bowl on the strength of such new shows as X Factor and New Girl, as well as strong ratings from the NFL. ","At the stations, advertiser revenues were below year-ago levels due to lower political spending. Excluding politicals, local station ad markets spending in the quarter was essentially in line with a year ago. ","At our Film segment, second quarter operating income was $393 million. This is more than double the $189 million we reported a year ago. And it reflects significantly reduced theatrical releasing cost. The second quarter also includes strong worldwide home entertainment performances of Rio, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and X-Men: First Class. Additionally, our Television production studio generated higher profit contributions led by the growth of digital distribution revenues from licensing library content to Netflix and Amazon. Year-to-date, we've recognized approximately $200 million in total from our Netflix and Amazon deals with the maturity falling in the second quarter.","Turning to SKY Italia, segment operating income in the quarter of $6 million improved $18 million from last year's reported loss of $12 million. This improvement primarily reflects slightly higher subscription and advertising revenues as well as lower programming cost and is a very good result given significant slowing of the Italian economy. ARPU of EUR 41 declined EUR 1 from a year ago, but increased EUR 1 sequentially for the first quarter this fiscal year, and this primarily reflects the pricing increase announced in December.","We had 23,000 net new subscribers during the quarter, with quarter ending subs totaling  -- just slightly more than 5 million. Insurance continues to run at an annual rate of about 12%. ","Just turning now to our Publishing segment. Operating income of $218 million declined 43% from a year ago. This $162 million decrease reflects lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers and Integrated Marketing Services business, as well as the impact from the closure of the News of the World in United Kingdom. Dow Jones earning contributions were up slightly, and Chase will provide more details of these businesses in a few minutes. And just to correct myself, the operating income was $218 million in the quarter. It didn\u2019t decline by that. ","And in our Other segment, we reported a second quarter segment operating loss of $191 million. This is $35 million higher than a year ago. This increased loss primarily reflects $87 million of cost related to the ongoing investigation initiated upon the closure of the News of the World that more than offset the absence of MySpace losses. These U.K. investigation charges are predominantly fees to outside lawyers and advisers working on various investigations and committee hearings in the United Kingdom. ","Before I turn to guidance, I'd like to update you on our $5 billion buyback program and through February 7, the company has spent nearly $2.7 billion repurchasing over 160 million shares, reducing News Corporation's total shares outstanding by 6.1% compared to the start of our fiscal year. And as we announced last July and confirmed in November, we fully intend to complete this program by the end of our fiscal year.","And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2011. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2011 the $125 million litigation charge resulting in the base of $4.975 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes. As we now look to our results for this year. The cost of the United Kingdom investigations are substantially higher than the amounts we're reflecting in our guidance at the end of the first quarter. ","Due to the fluid nature of the ongoing investigations, inquiries, hearings and judicial proceedings, we're unable to reliably forecast these costs for the full year. As a result, we are excluding such cost from our guidance for the full year. These costs which are predominantly fees to outside lawyers and advisers have totaled approximately $104 million through the first half of the year, including the $87 million reported in the second quarter, and we'll continue to report the amounts incurred on a quarterly basis. After excluding the full year effect of the United Kingdom investigation cost and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2012 to continue to be in the low to mid-teens range above the $4.975 billion fiscal 2011 segment operating income base level.","I think at first glance, this growth may appear rather conservative given the strong results generated in our first 6 months of fiscal 2012. However, there are a number of timing items worth highlighting for you. As mentioned previously, the approximately $55 million benefit realized in the second quarter from the NBA lockout reverse in the following 2 quarters. Additionally, the majority of the anticipated Netflix and Amazon revenue for this year have already been captured through the second quarter. And also note that Fox big animated release this summer, Ice Age 4: Continental Drift will be released July 13, with the majority of the releasing cost but no revenues hitting this year's fourth quarter. And this compares to a very strong second half of fiscal 2011 led by the profitable theatrical performance of Rio in last year's fourth quarter. And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments.","Chase Carey","Thanks, Dave, and welcome, everybody. The last quarter's been one of steady progress on our key strategic objectives. In our U.S. Cable and Broadcast business, our goals are to build unique and distinctive channels that can be market leaders in the competitive arenas. To invest intelligently in key content that can strengthen these channels, to be opportunistic about ways to grow new franchises, and to generate revenues that reflect the fair value of that content. ","We're executing pretty well on all these fronts. Our big channels like FOX, FX and FOX News continue to be leaders, distinguish themselves from our competitors. Emerging channels like FOX Soccer, FUEL and Fox Movies have added exciting new dimensions to the businesses. New long-term arrangements with the NFL, UFC and FIFA for the World Cup will anchor growth for both our Broadcast and Cable businesses. We continue to look for ways to grow new franchises like the X Factor on FOX and the new Charlie Sheen sitcom on FX.","We're building new properties like MundoFox to take advantage of unique partnership opportunity with RCN to tap in to the rapidly growing Latino market. And we continue to complete retransmission in affiliate agreements that recognize the value of our content. We see long-term growth opportunities through authentication and believe it is the right strategy for content owners, MBPDs [ph] and consumers. Much of it just needs to be executed better.","The advertising markets, while not quite as robust as they were 6-plus months ago, remain solid. In the March quarter, the broadcast network is still seeing scatter pricing at a premium to the strong upfront pricing and the stations excluding last year's Super Bowl are seeing a March quarter up around 5% on last year with the business getting stronger. We're also taking share from our competitors with Fox Television station setting market share records in the December quarter. ","The channel side is more varied with FX continuing to see strong double-digit growth while locals sports at the lower end are up mid-single digits. The International Cable Channels business, our strategy is much the same with a higher focus on growth to take advantage of both underlying market potential and opportunistic expansion. Competitively, our channels have never been stronger. ","From STAR in India to our group of Latin American channels, our market share and competitive position continues to improve. We're investing in key content on a global basis to further differentiate our channels. We set rating records with the launch of American Horror Story, and we look forward to the global premier of Kiefer Sutherland's Touch next month. We continue to add key new franchises to build on this strength. Most recently, in Latin America, we acquired control of Fox Pan American Sports, a leading Latin American sports business, and launched Fox Sports Brazil. We're working on some exciting new opportunities in Asia too.","These businesses continue to perform ahead of expectations with results from the developing markets of Asia and Latin America significantly offsetting a bit of softness in a few western European markets. ","At our distribution platform businesses, our goals are to grow market share through premium content, technology leadership and superior customer service wrapped around our unique brand offerings. In Italy, we successfully tackled the competitive challenge from our major industry competitor, as well as a challenging regulatory environment to regenerate growth and excitement in our business. We recently added a renewed key sports right to continue to expand initiatives like HD and DVRs. While this business is pretty resistant to economic headwinds, it's not immune. We do expect short-term growth to be impacted somewhat by Italy's macro issues, but we are extremely bullish on its long-term potential. ","In Germany, our growth has been even more dynamic. This growth strategy requires capital. We just entered into another capital support agreement, and while Germany is still a work in progress, the management team has done a great job the last year and has established real strength and growth to \u2013- in a business in Europe's dominant economy.","As a media company, we believe the explosion of consumer demand for digital content, driven by the upsurge in emerging platforms in international opportunities makes this a great time to be a content leader. However, we equally recognize this is a business driven by quality, i.e. hits, not quantity and we strive to find the right balance for success. It's also a business that requires discipline and expertise to navigate challenging economics. All these were complexities require a great management team and we have teams on both our film and TV production businesses that are second to none. These businesses have proved adept at managing the slowdown in transition in the home entertainment market, exploiting the digital market in a disciplined manner and maximizing international market opportunities.","In our Publishing segment this is clearly a tough year as we're seeing significant year-over-year declines in the U.K. papers, the Australian papers and our integrated marketing business. We expect fiscal 2012 full-year results for each of these businesses to be down around $100 million, actually we expect the U.K. to be down $150 million plus for the full year. ","In the U.K., the impact from the closure of The News of the World has been exacerbated by a very tough economy. But as we said many times, we're committed to making things right in the U.K. ","In Australia, the economy has also severely impacted our business. We have a new management team in place that is focused on restructuring this business to address the challenges and we tackle them from a position of strength through our world-leading franchises. At our integrated marketing business, our issues stem from the changing dynamics of the in-store side of our business. On the coupon side, business is operating on plan. To address these challenges, we're executing a strategy that includes expanding categories of stores, adding or significantly expanding our relationships with key customers like P&G and completing multiyear agreements to recapture some of the lost growth in this business.","The one Publishing segment that is up year-on-year is Dow Jones, although we believe we're just scratching the surface of the potential for this business in today's digital world. We just announced a new CEO who was already at work on plans to deliver on that potential.","I want to be clear, while these Publishing businesses face the challenges of a maturing print market, we believe there's a real opportunity for quality branded news, particularly if digital platforms continue to evolve. We are committed to being a leader in news and information and we remain confident in our ability to transition these businesses. Bottom line, we feel really good about the momentum to our business and believe we have a lot of upside over the next few years to our overall results. With that, I'll turn to questions.","Reed Nolte","Operator, we'd like to go to questions from the investment community now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to ask you about affiliate fees. Can you talk about the outlook? I know you have a new distributor deal in place for fiscal Q3. Can you give us any sense of the growth for the back half of the year? And on the international affiliate fee side, is that increase of subscriber growth? Are you seeing any increases in the per sub affiliate fees?","Chase Carey","I guess from the first -- I mean, the second half, I only get too part [ph] of the quarter-to-quarter. I think these are better looked at year to year. I mean the second half of the year will be higher growth than the first half. But as we said before, we feel pretty good that as we look out over the next couple of years, the type of growth we've had, that sort of 10%, 10%-plus growth in affiliate fees is something that we can sustain. And we obviously have an array of deals coming up. I think the most recent is DirecTV, which we'll give a little headwind to the -- give a little tailwind to the second half. But I think to get it into too quarter-to-quarter it gets too sensitive to the signers [ph] of timing of deals. But at aggregate, I think we believe we have a momentum. The momentum you've seen the last few years, is the momentum we believe  we can continue as you look out the next few years. In terms of International, I mean, it's certainly both. We're investing in those channels, we're building better channels. And there's a question, both subscriber growth and rate growth are very much at the heart of strategies we're employing as we build these businesses around the world.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can I just sneak in one other thing? You mentioned investing in things like the Spanish-language network. Can you just give us a sense of how that big investment spending will be over the next year or so?","Chase Carey","That's particularly because of the partnership with RCN. I expect that we really like to build [ph] and I think that's an investment in the tens of millions, multiple 10s. It's not 10 or 20 but it's 10s not 3-digit millions. We think we have a really unique partner that has really created a product for that marketplace that is distinct from what's there. We like the growth in that market, and we think it's real opportunity with a unique partner to build a really attractive business in an exciting segment of the marketplace.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Bank, RBC Capital.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones. The first is, Chase, could you give us a sense right now of what the average affiliate ONO retrans fee is across the group right now? And the second question is, we thank you for the clarity on the buyback commitment through the end of the year. Just to push a little further, could you kind of comment or reiterate on your overall capital plans in terms of your allocation for M&A? Any more you want to say that sort of goes beyond the year even generally for capital allocation?","Chase Carey","I mean I think it happened in the past and probably don't plan to get into what are the retransmission rates we're looking for. I will say we're on target with what we set out to do. And continuing to work both sides of both the ONO side and the affiliate side of it. And this is an area that we think is critical to us and I will say we think we are certainly making headway but still what we're getting would not reflect the value of our content competitively in the marketplace. But we're trying to be constructive and consistent. And to date, we're pretty much right on target with our plans. But we haven't really put the rates out there, and I don't think we plan to put the rates out there. In terms of capital, I don't think we're in that different place than, and I start to say what I said in the past I think continues to be sort of pretty much the same -- where we're at today. I mean we continue to have a -- and we recognize an overly liquid balance sheet. We recognize we still have an overly liquid the balance sheet when we finish this buyback. I think we are trying to work towards a place where we've got a appropriate level of leverage, enough cash in the balance sheet for flexibility but not excess liquidity we got now. We'd rather be building businesses than acquiring businesses, but I think if we can find businesses to acquire that -- or buy that meet our thresholds, and that's a threshold again to me that is sort of a mid-teens return. We think those are investments to make. I mean, take the, I guess the Latin American investment. It achieved 2 goals for us. One, we had a minority stake we'd like to -- and we said that before, we think that's a good opportunity to stake something we own a third of to, take full control and make it an operating business as opposed to an off balance sheet investment. I think we should be -- the businesses we're in, we should be striving to the ones we like to own. If it doesn't make sense, then go the other way. So that's a business that achieves that goal and we're very excited about the growth. I mean, it far exceeds any of the thresholds we have for return on that investment. We're very excited. Latin America has been a real area of growth for us in the Channels business. We think this adds a real dimension to that business. And we're very excited about the ability. And has with it the building of business. I mean, this is an early stage business in Latin -- brings with it the opportunity to build the sports channel in Brazil which we didn't have before. So I think if we can find opportunities like that, that bring those sorts of dimensions to it, we think that's the type of opportunity we're clearly looking to pursue.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up. I mean do you think it's fair to infer then, given the kind of numbers you are talking about for that opportunity, is it fair to infer that at this point we could be expecting the kind of intermediate term run rate of capital returns to shareholders that we're seeing right now? Or is that we just can't infer that?","Chase Carey","Look. I mean, we have -- I recognize I get asked question about sort of a buyback deal on this buyback. And as I said, we recognize -- we continue to have liquidity, excess liquidity. Our stock continues to be undervalued. I think another buyback is something we certainly probably think makes sense. We haven't made that decision at the board. We'll make that decision before we certainly get to the end of this buyback, which as Dave said, be no later than June. But I think this is one where I'd like to see sort of got a -- I think you can look to where you're going in terms of what liquidity, what's the leverage, what's the strategy in terms of -- of how you invest. And we'll make those decisions as we go along. And I guess we try to lay out that philosophy.","Operator","Comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Question also and I\u2019ll throw a clarification in there. The clarification first, you said FX was strong double digits in the March quarter. And I was just curious if it was a similar growth rate in the December quarter? Or a little bit lower? A little bit higher? Where, obviously, it's a good comparable to other groups that are out there. And then Chase, the question is, I think you said in your prepared remarks you felt execution on authentication needs to improve. I think everyone on the call probably has their own opinion on this, but I was curious to see if you would expand on your view relative to that comment.","Chase Carey","Sure. I mean what I really said, I meant FX is probably more scatter pricing. I mean sort of -- I think in FX today, you'd see -- we had strong upfront and we\u2019re probably seeing scatter pricing that is probably in the neighborhood of 20% up in the March quarter. What we have, if you look at the revenue in the quarter, probably the second quarter was a little stronger than the third, but FX is -- we're thrilled with the momentum behind FX and everything they've done. FX has been a great story for us.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was really trying to get to the overall ad marketplace where there was sort of similar in March to December or better or worse and FX is the proxy. So...","Chase Carey","I think actually if you took it in  aggregate, I think for the Cable group, it will be strong. It's -- on terms of authentication, I think it is the right solution. I think I guess my degree of, I don\u2019t know if you call it frustration,  with it is, we're talking about it when I was back at DirecTV over 2 years ago. So I mean I think in this world, you can't spend 3 or 4 years getting something going. So I think sort of all of us just have to do a better job of moving these things forward. And I think it just takes too much time -- I think it is the right solution and I think it is the solution that, again, I think serves everybody's purpose, including consumers, in bringing a much more exciting proposition to the marketplace. I think the product we provide, if we can continue to enhance it, actually is a great value for the consumer. But we've got to do our job and make sure we're delivering. Delivering great \u2013- [indiscernible] service, we got to create exciting content, we got to add new dimensions to it to excite them. I mean if we can add all those things, I think somebody  like Apple has proved it. Apple doesn't win by being cheap, Apple wins by creating a great experience. It gets fair value for it. And we've got to do our job, but we can't take the time we've taken to try and get this going. And as a secondary concern, it's a little bit, it's sort of historical objective to try to move this forward in a wall guard mode and I think for December, this world of technology is going to run over the wall, so I'd rather see a much more open architecture around authentication. But I want to -- I think it is -- I think TV Everywhere, authentication whatever you want to call it, is the right solution to the marketplace. But we've got to execute better.","Operator","Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson, Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for Dave on housekeeping and one for Chase on our sense. So Dave, everyone's called out the impact of the NBA so far on these conference calls. Can you give us a sense of what organic advertising and [indiscernible] growth would've been apples-to-apples with NBA in the numbers? Or kind of just give me apples-to-apples for the quarter?","David F. DeVoe","Yes, I thought I said it actually, 14%.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","14% for advertising, and affiliate fees?","David F. DeVoe","Slightly less than that. Yes, it's been probably about 9% apples-to-apples, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield, BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk to you education initiative? I think it remains a major source of concern for investors in terms of kind of what you're going to do with future spending in this category. I don't think anyone really knows much about your plans. Where is it going? Would you ever consider buying a company such as McGraw-Hill or Pearson to accelerate your strategy. Just anything you could tell us would be helpful. And then just a follow-up on the RSN side of the business. Time Warner Cable appears to be doing just fine without MSG, notwithstanding what they're trying to do with the new net in LA. How do you think about the sustainability of your RSN business?","Chase Carey","I guess in the Education business I'll start up by saying we're not buying -- we're not buying Pearson or McGraw-Hill. The Education business, we're very much in an early-stage building mode. It is a business I talked to you earlier on in different context about our desire to build businesses, not buy businesses, that's what we're doing here. And we are currently investing in the business. Sure hiring people and putting and investing really in people and technology. It is very much ramping up right now. I think as we look at this full year, we will probably invest or I guess realistically it\u2019ll sort of take a P&L loss, sort of $75 million plus probably for the year. The majority of that will be in the second half of the year. Because if that's where the ramp-up kind of phase of this is. We think it's the right way to build this. We don't have any legacies, we're not burdened by protecting any historical businesses. And we think building is a real opportunity to create value. We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to enormous business stuck decades in the past. And we think we put a team together. Joel Klein has hired a number of really world-recognized experts in this field. And we think we have a team that has a real vision for how they're going to capitalize on this. I think our plan for everybody there is probably -- in the next few months, probably before the next earnings call, would be to provide a bit more visibility to what those plans are, where we're going with that. Again, there's a lot going on today in that arena. And I think we will try and in coming months to provide better visibility to it. What was the second part, Richard?","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Just in terms of the RSNs,...","Chase Carey","I don't know what -- I really know what -- what's really happening in New York. I mean, first, New York\u2019s a pretty unique animal, I guess anybody who has been in a New York apartment goes trying to see how many choices you got for a provider. So it's not a typical market in terms of -- one of the consequences of not having key programming. I think we're pretty comfortable in the importance of sports, the value of sports and ultimately, as David always says, sports are tribal, which means local. So we look at the business. We feel very good about and continue to believe we can do exciting things.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And Chase, just a follow-up, when do you think would be the earliest we start to see actual revenues start to flow in from the Education side?","Chase Carey","Again, I think it's probably better -- they're moving pretty fast, but I think it's probably better to let -\u2013 rather than give piecemeal. [indiscernible] I think Joel is probably the right person to give you a better and a more complete understanding of it. He'll do that but I think just sort of do it piecemeal probably won\u2019t do justice to it.","Operator","It comes from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One question from your prepared remarks and then one follow-up. On the newspaper Publishing segment, Chase, I think you mentioned $150 million headwind this year at the U.K., $100 million on Australia and $100 million at inserts, so $350 million total, did I get that right for the year?","Chase Carey","For the year, yes, that's right.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then on the Netflix-Amazon number, I think you said $200 million fiscal year to date, most of which already been booked. Is that...","Chase Carey","That's revenue.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's revenue, right. Chase, what do you think happens to that business if you say over 2- to 3-year period, I don't know if you would define it as a business but at least the sort of new digital licensing revenues that the industry is generating. I think there's a lot of debate about the sustainability of those business models long-term. But I'd be curious just to hear your thoughts and if you think that business gets meaningfully larger for the revenue line for News Corp. over a sort of 3- to 4-year period as these initial contracts re-up.","Chase Carey","I mean, I don\u2019t see how the business doesn't get larger. I mean, it just seems every time you \u2013- we get somebody new talking about coming into the business, creating digital platform. Last year's Verizon and Redbox. I'm not sure I can figure out the partnership. But Verizon [indiscernible] digital distribution. So I think without question, I think that business gets much larger and I think even existing players. And sort of obviously Netflix went through a bit of a roller coaster, but they sort of seen to have, to their credit, re-found their footing. And we have long -- and one of the nice things is, essentially with the existing players when we booked it this year, we have recurring annual revenue because really we have structures that give up the ability to continue to renew and extend and put product in every year, to charges [ph]. And then as you get new players coming in, it gives us an ability to expand that market around new players. But I think this is an arena that has enormous growth. And as you think about sort of everybody including the big guys that are sort of, whether it's the Googles or what have you, that talk about the Googles, the Apples that all sort of \u2013- I think, not clear where they're going but ultimately I don't think anybody is sort of not saying that video isn't, video isn't a core part of the future. And which is why, I made the comments about I think the importance of value of content, our desire to invest in content, our desire to be a leader in content and make sure we have really unique, whether it's acquired or created. It's got to be both. But control as much content as possible to take advantage of it.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Would you expect someone to go out with a full sort of virtual cable product, live linear channels as well?","Chase Carey","I mean, there\u2019s some talk. I think there's a lot more complexities around that, whether it's capacity complexities or other dimensions. I mean, I think in some ways, I mean, so you hear some of the buzz -- in many ways, I think the greatest opportunities are always when somebody sort of figures out, develops something new for the market as opposed to just me toos. I'm not smart enough how to figure that out. I guess the guy who does will do well. But I think you'd like to sort of figure out how do you create new experiences that take advantage of these technologies, not just sort of me toos.","Operator","Comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just had a question about advertising. I'm trying to square away. It seem like if you back out the NBA lockout you talked about 14% growth. I take a step back and look at the TV station trends, I think you said last quarter was sequentially in line. So I'm interpreting that as flattish last quarter.","Chase Carey","Flat without politicals. With politicals in, it was actually down, more like -- I think like 12% or something. So think of flat and x political.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Right. So I guess my question is bigger picture, why -- it seems like the national cable TV advertising marketplace seems like it's pacing and trending a lot stronger than the TV station group. And in your mind, what are the biggest reasons why that is?","Chase Carey","Actually, I'm not sure I'd say -- again, we've take -- on TV side, Broadcast side, our scatter market, it used to be a solid scatter market. We just went through -- I see cancellations for -- the June quarter just came in at the low-end of what would be a historical number. On the station side, we're up 5%. Actually, if you take out -- if you really do an apples-to-apples in adjustments because there was an NBA, NFL game that fell in there, it's probably more like 7%. So you've got -- you got a solid business on the kind on the station side. So I think it may be a bit more [indiscernible] but I think for us, we clearly have some franchises on the Cable side, in the FOX News, it's going into a political cycle, so it'll have benefits of the political cycle, I talked about the strengths of FX and sort of -- and I think the success it's had and I think it benefits from that. And look, we're investing in more content there, so you expect to be delivering. Not that we aren\u2019t  investing in content on the Broadcast side too.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one quick follow-up, which is the answer to your question before about capital allocation. And I'm not sure if you mentioned dividend as part of your considerations there. If you look at other U.S. media companies, dividend yields are a bit higher. And I just wonder, is that -- is dividend growth or higher dividend yield a consideration at the board level when you go through the conversation?","Chase Carey","For sure. I mean I think dividend -- I think it did increase just a bit.","David F. DeVoe","We increased it last -- the increase was $0.15 to $0.17.","Chase Carey","I mean, it is, it should be. I guess I always have a little bit of a bias when your stock's undervalued to a buyback. But it should be worth a dialogue, and I think it very much is.","Operator","That comes from the line of John Janedis, UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you give a little more color on relative to $1 billion operating income goal. I mean realizing it gets only about 1\/3 of revenue from advertising, to what extent can maybe a weaker global macro environment impact will you see [ph] growth under the renewals? How does the global ad market look? And how many channels do you expect to launch this year?","David F. DeVoe","We just launched 4 or 3, I guess.","Chase Carey","It's tough to do a channel launch. There's a lot of \u2013- there\u2019s only so many countries, a lot of times  you're launching something regional or countries. So I think in general, in many ways, I think we're looking opportunities. I probably say the focus is a little more on quality as opposed to quantity. I mean I think we like but I think quality always wins out and you want to have big strong channels. And so I think it has a sort of bias and it's sort as both just the pure land grab of volume in channels. I mean, I think there are opportunities, like I said, that sports in Latin America is a truly unique one. And mention, we got a couple of things in Asia going on that I think are equally exciting for us. But I feel like good opportunities to add channels but in many ways I probably said right now the greater focus is on sort of continuing improved quality of those channels to drive that upside. Any time you try to get into global trying to predict global macroeconomics. [indiscernible] I wish I have that type of crystal ball. I mean most of our growth is coming out of places that are not -- that what everybody is  talking about. We're getting a little bit of -- within a few Western European countries. But even there, some of those are fine and certainly Asia and Latin America continue to be strong and are not -- and people talk of problems. And these are businesses that, again, what I said in the comments, they're not immune to economic challenges but they hold up pretty well against these stack-up industries and sort of what the impact on it. One of the great things about these subscription businesses, they're pretty resilient when it comes to large issues. Now obviously, if you had something truly sort of catastrophic, I don't know how anybody predicts what that means. But we feel pretty good about where these businesses are, what their future looks like.","Operator","Comes from the line of Alan Gould, Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Chase, you've just hired an executive from Bloomberg to run Dow Jones. How much of an opportunity is there to take Dow Jones more into the digital realm than it is more into the professional area? And will this require a major investment?","Chase Carey","No. First, I think and only just I touched on it. I think it\u2019s an enormous opportunity. This digital world is going to make quality information I think more valuable than ever. And if you want talk quality information, I mean The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones is the top of the heap. And I think to date, a lot of our focus has been on the journalist consumer product will sustain the other business but I think we really have not taken advantage of the opportunities to develop the broader digital franchises that can be grown out of -- and we've grown, so I'm not saying they haven't -- the people there have not undertaken initiatives. But I think there's a real set of opportunities for us to create products. And I guess you can certainly hit it the B2B, B2C. I'm not sure it's not sort of continuum. I mean in many let's say is a professional individual, a consumer or a business person? And I think that's sort of what we're going to create. What we need to create is products that have a continuum from sort of obviously [indiscernible] base and the ability to create products that tier up from that, whether they're targeted or deeper that take advantage digital technologies. And in many ways, a little bit like I talked about elsewhere, one of the great benefits we have in building these things is we can take advantage of the digital technological infrastructure that's been put in place. And we are not building with some of the legacy infrastructures that others may have. I think mostly it's taking advantage of what we got. And focusing the discipline, I don't think it's -- I mean, I know it\u2019s  going to be some decreases in investment. But I don't think it's a big investment that we're taking. It think it mostly focusing on the right opportunities.","Operator","And that comes from the line of Jolanta Masojada, Credit Suisse.","Jolanta Masojada - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Chase, just following up on an earlier question. Can you talk about in the first half of Film, how much of film profit is coming from digital rather than how much revenue is coming? And what's your view of the long-term potential for digital growth to compensate for DVD declines?","Chase Carey","You mean, how much of the home entertainment? I'm not sure I can do this. I mean, clearly it's more -- the DVD business is still the majority of it though the growth is certainly Blu-ray and electronic digital distribution. Our growth there if you look out at future. I mean DVDs are going to be around for a long time. People like them and people continue to have them. But I think, as you said, where is the business going longer-term? It's going to migrate towards form sort of digital distribution. So I think that is the longer-term future, but I don\u2019t want to imply that DVDs don't have real legs. I mean, actually, Blu-ray has been a pretty good growth driver and Blu-ray growth rate grew at sort of like 20% or something right now. So we're going to -- we're certainly not going to just -- we're going to continue to make sure we manage that business intelligently and make sure we focus on both long-term as obviously always we're driving towards but be intelligent about the short term. And I think the DVD business continues to have legs.","Reed Nolte","Operator, now we would like to go to questions from the press, if we could.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Edmund Lee, Bloomberg News.","Edmund Lee","Of the $104 million charge taken for cost related to the hacking issue, can you give us some sense of how much of that was for settlements? And how much you might have sort of set aside this coming year for pending settlements?","David F. DeVoe","I think it the vast majority for that number is, as I said, for professional fees. I would say more than 85% of the cost. Or said in another way, 15% of the cost related to the settlements.","Edmund Lee","Related to settlements. And then moving forward for this year, is there a sense of how much you set aside for settlements for this coming year?","David F. DeVoe","No.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Russell Adams, Wall Street Journal.","Russell Adams","Chase, can you give an update on what's the status of your talks on the Dodgers is? Are you engaged with any bidders?","Chase Carey","Yes, I'm not going to go too deep into it because it's a process in motion now. Right, they\u2019re probably engaged with a lot of bidders. We'd like to -- [indiscernible] said before, we're not looking to buy the team. We're looking to see if we can do something that makes sense in the media rights, we'd like to do it. And we're talking to a number of the bidders. I think timetable out there is pretty public, I think it's got a decently short timetable to come to move through the next few months. And we'll see if there's something that makes sense for us.","Operator","Comes from the line of Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, Financial Times.","Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson","Chase, I wonder if you can give us any more detail on that statement you made about expecting $150 million decline from the U.K. papers. Is that about circulation, advertising, restructuring, costs for a Sun on Sunday or  what is that?","Chase Carey","No, the vast majority of it is the impact of having closed the News of the World. I mean obviously that...","Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson","Just lost income?","Chase Carey","Revenue that we used to -- I mean we have large -- there's a big business there that has a lot of sort of fixed cost. But a big infrastructure in terms of sales and circulation and other overheads that supported multiple papers. And 1 of the 4 papers that it supported and generated revenue went away.

Not that we're not going to try and be intelligent about the costs. But our priority is to get on top of this and make things right. That's going to be our focus, and not going to -- it may be difficult to predict. I mean, we're working with authorities.

What's the process for these victims that appear to be coming forward?","Chase Carey","I don't probably have -- what is that -- I'm not the one managing it day-to-day.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Blake. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer.","We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take some questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-K for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used on this call, such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert J. Thomson","Thank you, Mike. We've now completed 1 full fiscal year as the new News Corp. And it's fair to say that the sensibility of a startup has characterized our pursuit of digital and global expansion for our distinctive portfolio of companies, a portfolio that is diverse in both revenue mix and geographic spread.","We will be building on the company's proud tradition and the progress attained over the past year, during which we made disciplined strategic acquisitions, targeted divestments and tactical investments in technological and international initiatives. The company is at the very center of the global debate over the value of content and the creation of platform permutations for the delivery of that content.","Throughout the year, we have also been disciplined on costs and aim to deliver value to our customers, advertisers and investors. One year into our existence, the real measure of our progress lies in the answer to this question. Are we better off, better positioned today than when the journey began? For News Corp, the answer is a resounding yes.","We said on Investor Day that we would become more digital and global, and we are. We have increased market share in a number of our business, most notably, REA and HarperCollins. We said that we would be acutely and astutely cost-conscious. And we have been, and we'll continue to be. Our costs this year are down, and we will assiduously search for additional savings.","We said that technology is the canvas for our content, and that has never been more true than it is today. We said that the percentage of our revenue that comes from nonadvertising sources will increase significantly over 5 years. And 1 year in, we can see that prediction being borne out. In fact, today, nonadvertising sources account for more than 50% of our revenues, and that has provided us added support in a sometimes challenging advertising marketplace and an uneven economic recovery.","For the year, revenues were $8.6 billion, a 4% decrease, while EBITDA improved 12% to $770 million. Most important, our free cash flow improved by more than $290 million to $365 million.","Let me be more specific about our acquisitions, cost consciousness, investments, digital and global initiatives and the challenges we faced.","Our acquisitions, and we're in an early phase of our expansion, have echoed our determination to grow digitally and globally and show that we will not be rushing na\u00efvely to overpay for underachieving companies. Just last week, we completed the acquisition of Harlequin, which will give HarperCollins a jumpstart on international digital expansion and a platform for future growth. We believe this was a prudent and disciplined move that will benefit HarperCollins and News Corp. This very day, our HarperCollins executives are in Canada, working constructively with the talented Harlequin team.","Our first acquisition was Storyful, the world's leading social media news agency, which has already launched FB Newswire with Facebook and last week, celebrated 1 billion views of its videos on YouTube. Now we are focusing on monetizing that traffic and using Storyful's unique authentication expertise for the benefit of our businesses and of our clients.","We also continue to recast our portfolio, consistent with our cost-conscious focus. And so we sold the Dow Jones Local Media Group and the Community Newspapers Group to focus on core branded properties in the U.S. And we sold the live events business at HarperCollins earlier this year, which we viewed as not core to our mission. We are resizing the cost base in News and Information Services with savings that are made more realizable by the extra focus and increased cooperation in the new News.","This has been achieved through a combination of operational and back-office initiatives including a wide range of contract negotiations and health and pension reforms, among many other steps. Bedi will elaborate on these efforts shortly.","We also expect to achieve natural efficiencies across our businesses as we migrate to digital, with consolidation of servers and software and the repurposing of platforms. This trend is evident at HarperCollins, which is well down the path of digital migration and which will certainly benefit from Harlequin's success and skills on line.","We have made smart targeted investments, including partnerships with real estate sites in China and Hong Kong through REA, a leading online real estate services company in Australia. The deals give us a connection with a still-maturing market in China and will bring Chinese investors closer to property opportunities in Australia and elsewhere.","And speaking of REA, I'd like to point out their robust numbers and the ongoing benefit from secular tailwinds, as agents are increasingly aware of the high ROI that REA can offer.","REA recently announced the purchase of a minority stake in iProperty for $100 million. iProperty has burgeoning online property, advertising operations in Southeast Asia and just reported revenue growth of over 40%. We are excited about potential global opportunities in this sector.","Also this year, we announced plans to add $50 million to our investment in SEEK Asia, a growing employment listings business, as we expand our presence in Southeast Asia, a region which we believe holds tremendous growth potential.","Last year, we launched BallBall, which offers exclusive soccer highlights from the 5 major European leagues to audiences in Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam through desktop, laptop, mobile and tablet platforms.","And also on the investment front, this past year, we successfully launched the global programmatic advertising exchange, which has helped us cut out third-party networks and allowed us to work directly with advertisers who want to reach our premium audiences.","Owning our data and protecting the privacy of our customers are imperatives. While still early, we are certainly pleased with the pricing improvement and extra revenue that we've generated. We remain firm believers in the power of print, but we are committed to using technology to make our content more accessible, mobile and profitable. And that is why we have been driving digital throughout News Corp. In the U.K, The Sun launched Sun+, the digital version of the country's most popular newspaper, and we are focused on enhancing engagement with the imminent launch of a new tablet app.","Our News UK publications have integrated innovative sports video clips and apps and expanded into online luxury shopping, catering to the needs of an extremely desirable demographic. In particular, we've been pleased with The Times, which grew in volume, revenue, pricing and market share, thanks to great journalism and sustained technological toil. A newspaper launched in 1785 has definitely made a successful transition into the digital age.","In Australia, we're pleased to show very strong digital growth for our paid digital subscriber base over the past year, now exceeding 200,000. And The Australian, which has just celebrated its 50th birthday, released a new iPad app. Today, The Australian has more paying customers than at any time in its history and a larger audience than ever, with more than 3 million readers each month.","We are planning to relaunch our paid digital mastheads in Australia with a simplified subscription offering. We'll also begin integrating these digital publications with a unique form of interactive advertising that will take advantage of the strengths of different formats.","No matter how esteemed the publication, our teams are working continuously to improve the experience for our readers and for our advertisers.","Also in Australia, Foxtel announced triple play bundling and launched Presto, its new online movie service, which is in its infancy. Foxtel is focused on monitoring market conditions to respond to competitors and to opportunities and on driving penetration to increase the value of this great asset.","Here in the U.S., Dow Jones released key enhancements to Factiva, and The Wall Street Journal bolstered its digital leadership through new video programming and the launch of WSJD, along with verticals focused on economics, marketing and Washington policy.","Also in the U.S., I'm particularly pleased to note that in-store advertising has shown impressive growth in News America Marketing. There is as much discussion about owning the point-of-sale. But the point-of-purchase is crucial and that is the strength of our in-store team.","Amplify launched its new digital curriculum in English Language Arts for grades 6 to 8, and we are excited about the quality of the offering as we engage with school districts around the country.","In publishing, e-book sales at HarperCollins this quarter were 23% higher versus the prior year, thanks in part to the success of the Divergent trilogy, which underscored the power of book blockbusters in a digital environment. And HarperCollins was at the forefront of the industry in forming partnerships with online e-book subscription services, Oyster and Scribd.","Of course, any kind of review of the year must include the challenges we have faced, including advertising headwinds in Australia and elsewhere. The ability to make confident forecasts is undermined by the erratic patterns that have characterized trading, particularly in print, which is seriously undervalued as a platform by advertisers. Print is a concentrated, intense reading experience with unique affinity in our digitally distracted age.","Our professional information business at Dow Jones is still in the process is being recast following a period of difficulty, about which we're being quite frank. Clients are responding favorably to the new product, pitch and pricing. But the development work is not yet done. The rate of decline has certainly eased, but we expect some softness for a quarter or 2.","In balancing the opportunities and challenges, we believe there's more upside in the opportunity than downside in the challenge. Our core message is untarnished and unvarnished. We promised that we would work with restless energy on behalf of investors, who understandably expect that creativity is balanced by physical discipline and that the expansion does not just mean an expanding cost base.","Despite headwinds, we still experienced significant growth in free cash flow and we showed stable profit margins, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our asset base. We remain focused on driving top line performance and generating sustained and sustainable revenue -- returns for our shareholders.","In summary, 1 year into our existence, News Corp is unified by our pursuit of premium content and the building of iconic brands, brands that are potent platforms in a digital age. We understand the deep affinity between those brands and our audiences. That affinity is the nexus of revenue and of profitability.","This is a company where calculated risks are taken, instincts followed and objectives pursued with passion, purpose and principle. We are, as our Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch said on Investor Day, an eclectic and an unconventional company in an age where such attributes hold great value. We remain fully aware of the challenges we face, whether the vagaries of the macroeconomic cycle in the countries where we work, the ebb and flow of advertising and readership rates and the mass media mass migration, which continues to unfold. Those challenges will be met with a focus on costs and on digital and global growth. We are intent upon fashioning an ever more rewarding future for our audiences, our employees and our investors.","Now I will turn it over to Bedi to discuss the financials in detail.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert mentioned, we made strong progress in our first year to further digitize our asset portfolio and improve our market share across several business units. We prudently reduced our cost base and held consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins relatively stable, despite continuing advertising headwinds. For the full year, we reported revenues of $8.6 billion, a 4% decrease versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were 1% lower than the prior year.","We reported full year total segment EBITDA of $770 million, which was a 12% increase versus the prior year. Reported results included costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification, which was $72 million for the year. Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA was down 2% versus the prior year, and would have being flat, excluding the dual rent costs for the London office.","Fiscal 2014 reported EPS were $0.41 versus $0.81 in the prior year, which included a significant nontaxable gain in Other net related to the CMH acquisition and the sale of our ownership interest in SKY Network Television, as well as impairment charges net of taxes.","Excluding the impact of all these and other items, our adjusted EPS were $0.46 compared to $0.62 in the prior year. Free cash flow available to News Corp was $365 million, an improvement of $293 million compared to last year.","For the fourth quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.2 billion, a 3% decrease versus the prior year period, and our adjusted revenue declined by 1%.","Fiscal fourth quarter total reported segment EBITDA was $127 million, a 2% decrease versus the prior year period. Reported results included $16 million related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification. Our adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter declined by 7%, but was slightly up excluding $13 million of dual rent and other facility costs, mainly related to our London office relocation.","With that as a brief overview, let's look at our fourth quarter performance for our key segments.","As you can see, we have now added a new reporting segment, Digital Education, to present Amplify separately, which was previously included in the Other segment.","In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $104 million or 6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted segment revenues were down by 5%.","Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 9% this quarter, similar to what we had seen in the third quarter. Looking at advertising performance across our key publishing units. At News Corp Australia, advertising revenue declined around 16% or 11% in constant currency for the quarter, a slight improvement from the prior quarter.","The biggest improvement came from national advertising, where we also saw some improvement, albeit a smaller magnitude, in retail.","At News UK, advertising revenue has declined around 1% or 11% in local currency, fairly similar to last quarter. Vastness [ph] was driven by retail, combined with the decline in broadband and mobile ad spending versus the prior year, partially offset by the late Easter this year.","And at The Wall Street Journal, advertising declined low-double digits this quarter, impacted by much tougher year-ago comps and weakness in a few categories, most notably telecom and finance.","Total circulation and subscription revenues for the quarter declined around 4%, driven primarily by continued softness in professional information business and Dow Jones, which had a negative $17 million impact to revenues this quarter. This was an improvement, however, versus the third quarter, as we continue to make progress to stabilize trends and retain existing Factiva customers.","Total newspaper circulation revenues showed modest growth in local currency, mostly driven by prior quarter subscription and cover price increases at a number of our mastheads. It's worth highlighting, as Robert mentioned, that this quarter we saw volume and revenue growth in local currency at The Times in the U.K. and at The Australian, further tangible evidence that our quality newspapers are benefiting from the migration to digital.","At News America Marketing, sales improved 4% versus the prior year period, led by double-digit growth in in-store advertising and modest growth from the FSI business.","Segment EBITDA decreased $80 million in the quarter or 38% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 34%. Included in segment EBITDA was $11 million related to the relocation of our London operations for dual rent and other facility costs. And we also incurred much higher expenses at News U.K. related to specific marketing initiatives, as I had discussed last quarter.","We also had higher severance costs in the U.K. this quarter.","In Cable Network Programming, revenue declined $10 million or 7% compared to the prior year quarter due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations. Subscription revenues, which account for over 80% of FOX SPORTS revenues, were flat but grew 6% in local currency, benefiting from higher digital platform subscribers and higher CPI-linked cable and satellite affiliate fees. Advertising revenues declined modestly and were fairly consistent with the prior quarter, impacted by a soft marketplace, combined with the absence of alliance to our rugby tournament in the year-ago quarter.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were down 2% and adjusted segment EBITDA improved by 11%.","In Digital Real Estate Services, revenues increased $22 million or 24% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting higher pricing and uptake of premium products. Segment EBITDA increased $16 million or 35% compared to the corresponding prior year quarter due to the increased revenue.","If you exclude adverse foreign currency impacts, adjusted revenue and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 33% and 41%, respectively.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 10% and segment EBITDA grew 50% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to see very strong performance from the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, which clearly got a boost from the theatrical release in March and have begun to spread overseas.","We sold globally an additional 3.6 million net units of the series this quarter and a total of over 19 million net units for the year.","Total e-book net sales for the quarter grew 23%, mainly due to the Divergent series, and accounted for 22% of HarperCollins' consumer revenue, up from 19% in the prior year period.","We have, as Robert mentioned, completed the acquisition of Harlequin Enterprises from Torstar Corporation for CAD 455 million. We expect, as we've indicated before, the deal to be accretive to earnings in fiscal 2015 and to improve our free cash flow.","We are just now beginning the integration work with Harlequin, and we will update you on our progress over the course of the year. On an annualized basis, we expect Harlequin will contribute revenues in the $320 million to $340 million range, excluding the joint ventures. We haven't yet factored any material synergies in the current fiscal year.","We do expect to incur nonrecurring transaction costs of approximately $5 million in fiscal '15.","At our Digital Education segment, revenues decreased $7 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower project-based consulting revenues at Amplify's legacy assessment business, as I had also noted on our last call. Segment EBITDA was negative $53 million and was fairly consistent with the prior year. For the full year, Digital Education EBITDA loss was $193 million.","Amplify remains on track to roll out the English Language Arts digital curriculum targeted to grade 6 through 8 for this coming fall. We expect to have approximately 10,000 students for our digital ELA curriculum and 20,000 for our digital math and science supplemental offerings signed up this year.","In addition, Amplify will have around 250,000 students signed up for the fall to use its digital hybrid K-5 program known as Core Knowledge Language Arts, which is viewed as a bridge to our broader digital product offerings.","And finally, our next-generation tablets, designed in collaboration with Intel, are also on track for a fall rollout with plans to deploy to at least 26,000 students.","In our Other segment, which primarily includes corporate overhead and our strategy and creative group, excluding U.K. Newspaper Matter costs, segment EBITDA was negative $49 million compared to negative $76 million allocated in the prior year. With respect to our earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the year with around 2.6 million total subscribers, up 6% versus the prior year, driven by higher digital platform subscribers. Cable and satellite churn improved to 12.5% compared to 14.2% in the prior year. Broadcast ARPU rose 1% for the full year, impacted by a February price increase. Foxtel revenues for the year were up 2% on a constant currency basis and EBITDA was up 8% similarly.","Turning now to cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations improved to $854 million compared to $501 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $365 million compared to $72 million in the prior year.","Just a few additional items to note. CapEx for fiscal '14 finished at $379 million, which was in line with our expectations. And included in that CapEx was around $100 million related to costs for the London office relocation and HarperCollins headquarters within Manhattan.","On our ongoing cost-savings initiatives. As I've mentioned in past quarters, we have been very focused on reducing the cost base. In the aggregate, we identified over $100 million in annualized cost reductions, most of which we'll realize in fiscal '14. The majority of savings are in distribution and production, including renegotiated paper and ink contracts, closing our divestitures of warehouses and printing plants, reduced software technology spend through aggressive procurement efforts and restructuring of healthcare and pension plans. And we will continue to look at further efficiencies in the coming year.","Let me now discuss a few drivers that we see for fiscal 2015. At News and Information Services, we'll be looking to enhance our paywall offerings with planned relaunches across all regions. We will still have the dual facility expenses related to the relocation of the London office in fiscal 2015 of around $25 million. While the professional information business at Dow Jones remains challenged, we do expect stabilization over the course of the year. Advertising remains relatively weak. But our ad sales teams are cautiously optimistic, and we hope for improvement.","We expected continued strong performance at News America Marketing, led by in-store advertising.","At Cable Networks, programming costs should be up only modestly given the few additional events this year, including the Asian Cup in January and the Cricket World Cup in February, March. And we have no major rights renewals coming up this year.","At Book Publishing, given the huge success of Divergent last year, at this point we do expect HarperCollins to face tougher comps, particularly in the second half of fiscal '15, before reflecting performance from the Harlequin acquisition.","At Digital Real Estate, we expect continued strong performance, benefiting from favorable secular trends and high ROI to the agents.","At Digital Education, the focus will remain to broaden its curriculum and drive further sales adoption. Given that the curriculum is now in the commercial rollout phase, we will begin capitalizing some of the content development costs.","We expect to capitalize $60 million in fiscal 2015 related to ELA, and that EBITDA will improve by at least this amount. We expect, however, our total cash investments spent at Amplify to be relatively similar in fiscal '15 as it was in fiscal '14.","Corporate overhead and creative and strategy group will likely spend similar levels to fiscal '14, in a range of $160 million to $180 million. Finally, CapEx for fiscal '15 should be around $400 million, including the additional $60 million capitalized software costs at Amplify, as well as around $70 million in the U.K. to complete the London office relocation.","So in summary, fiscal 2014 was a very busy year for News Corp, and we balanced ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and strategic acquisitions to expand our global footprint and digital offerings. We remain steadfast on stabilizing top line performance and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.","And with that, let me turn it back to the operator for Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from John Janedis at Jefferies.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bedi, now that you've been public for a year, can you give us your current views on return of capital given your free cash flow generation last year? And then on news segments, the decline in EBITDA, at least in the fourth quarter, was a bit more than what I would've expected. Are those marketing initiatives going to step down in the next quarter or 2? And are you starting to run out of leverage to pull on the cost front?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, John. Let me just start by addressing the fourth quarter. Clearly, as we had also mentioned in the third quarter, we expected to see additional marketing costs in London, which indeed did come through, and ones viewed [ph] that they will be beneficial to us in terms of revenue in the quarters to come. The London relocation, obviously, was also an extra expense in that quarter. And the professional information business at Dow Jones was also soft. So I think that gives you a sense of the kind of impact those things had in Q4. With respect to your earlier question, I think the way to think about it is we're still very focused on making sure that the business is stabilized, especially in News and Information Services. And we look to additional investments and smart, strategic and disciplined acquisitions, clearly with a view to generating long-term shareholder value per share, which remains kind of our mantra.","Operator","Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski at Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is around Amplify. And you've obviously provided some guidance there into fiscal '15. Is that contingent on targets being met throughout the year? Or are you feeling it's too early in the performance of the business necessarily to be setting targets?","Robert J. Thomson","It's Robert here. To be honest, it's little early in the business to be setting targets. But what we're focused on is the development of the curriculum. That's the key part of the investment that we've undertaken at Amplify. And we said to you 18 months ago, that in 18 months, we would have a much clearer indication of the trajectory of the business. And I think it's fair to say now that we are getting a sense of that. And we still hold ourselves to that deadline. And so as the business unfolds over the next 12 months, we'll be keeping you updated about sales, about sales patterns and about the substance of the business.","Bedi Ajay Singh","And if I can just add to that. Clearly, ELA was the sort of production effort and now it's gone to market. But we still have a lot of production effort behind math and science, which will continue in 2015. And sales for those products will start at the end of 2015.","Robert J. Thomson","It's a significant investment, but it's clearly a significant opportunity.","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And sorry, if I could just follow up. In the coming few months, so do you have specific student targets that you do need to reach? Are you prepared to disclose those?","Robert J. Thomson","Look, we don't have specific targets. This business, as you can understand, is evolving. It's in the early stage of the evolution. It's evolving quickly. And as we pass key metrics, we'll pass those metrics onto you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Diddams with Citi.","Justin Diddams - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on the News Information Services business. Given we enter FY '15 with what's potentially a continuation of these advertising declines, do you think there's scope again in FY '15 to cut the same amount of cost out of the cost base? Otherwise, we probably need to put in an EBITDA number much lower for this year if you're not able to cut those costs. I just wanted to clarify that it was $100 million spend from the office move in the U.K.?","Bedi Ajay Singh","So in terms of CapEx that we spent in the London building, that was -- in fiscal '14, it was $75 million of capital expenditure. And we expect somewhere in that sort of region in fiscal '15 as well, just to fit out the building completely. People have started moving in, but not all the floors are occupied.","Robert J. Thomson","Justin, under your question about cost and advertising trends. First of all, on costs, clearly, we're -- because of the concentration and new focus of the new News, we are finding opportunities to consolidate and to cut costs. And that, frankly, is not going to stop. And that's separate from trends in the advertising revenue, which clearly, the winds have been buffeting. But what we're seeing really are different circumstances in different regions. And it's -- at the moment, there are indications that the rate of decline has declined in Australia. There are green shoots on a nullable [ph] plane. And part of that is great work by our team in Australia. We focused on local advertising, and local advertising revenue trajectory has changed in Australia. The national market is different, but there'll be an increasing focus on that as well. And that's a great tribute to Julian Clarke and Peter Tonagh and our advertising team in Australia. At Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal, it clearly was a quarter of decline. But as we look forward a little bit, you'll see that, for example, WSJ magazine, which didn't exist when News Corp took over Dow Jones, in September it will have 2 issues. One of them a record amount of revenue. You can count the pages for yourself. Meanwhile in the U.K. in the last quarter, clearly there was some marketing spend. I know companies like to blame the World Cup for all sort of ailments, but it was clear that if England had progressed beyond the group stage in Brazil that advertising would've picked up. There would've been momentum. But it's also fair to say that the England team failed to exceed low expectations.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","With respect to The Wall Street Journal and the value of the content, the fact that I think it's must-have-access-to for most business professionals, could you talk a little bit about the pricing power there? How you look at pulling levers on pricing and the risk domestically? And also, when you look at that brand outside the U.S, where do you think you are in fully leveraging the brands and content and what's -- what can we be looking for there in the future?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, I think it's fair to say that we haven't fully leveraged the brand and that Will Lewis, who's been doing a marvelous job since he took the helm, is looking not only overseas opportunity, but what more, to your point, can be done to leverage and take advantage of the necessity that many people have to read Wall Street Journal content, but also looking at different platforms for delivery of that content. And over the period since the News Corp acquisition, we've been seeing strong year-after-year growth in circulation revenue. And there's no reason for that not to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani at JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you look at the Book Publishing business, which has clearly been an outperformer for some time here, and you look at the -- a book like Divergent, which is a multiple part -- there's several books in this series, how long does -- how long of a tail does that typically have? I mean, I know you mentioned more challenging comps in the back half of your fiscal year. But for the next couple of quarters, can we continue to benefit from this series or have we already played it through a bit?","Robert J. Thomson","Look, it's a little difficult to forecast. I need better [ph] soothsayers. And it is -- it's a blockbuster. Well for example, there are variables that may have an efficacious impact, such as the release of the second movie in the trilogy, which is scheduled for the spring. So it's a -- we're -- at the moment, it's fair to say that we're still seeing benefits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Arthur at Evercore.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Robert, you alluded to a sort of stepped-up or accelerated rollout of digital content in the News and Information group given the success of the Sun+. And I mean, that's not a new strategy. But in terms of this marketing spend, as you do similar efforts in Australia, perhaps more stepped up in the U.S., are we likely to see the marketing spend line go up as a result, in line with this effort?","Robert J. Thomson","To be honest, Doug, I wouldn't draw too many conclusions -- long-term conclusions from the last quarter. I think one of the advantages we have as a company now is that we learn from experiences in different places. The executives in London, Sydney and New York are constantly talking about efficient marketing spend. And so that focus is enabling us to, generally, over the longer term, keep the marketing spend to the minimum necessary.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners.","Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC","My first line of question, please. What was the cash level on your balance sheet at the end of the quarter? And also, what is holding you guys back from buying stock and\/or putting in place a quarterly dividend? I have a follow-on.","Bedi Ajay Singh","So our cash balance at the end of the quarter and, obviously, the fiscal year, was $3.1 billion. Anyway, in terms of how we think about deploying the cash, as we've said before, we're very focused on making sure that we are doing smart strategic acquisitions, that we make sure the top line is getting stabilized. We make internal investments in projects such as BallBall. So that's really the front line focus to make sure we build long-term shareholder value at the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Alexander at Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on Dow Jones' Institutional business. It's obviously been a drag for FY '14. You mentioned that you've seen some stabilization. I'm just wondering if you could give some color around what's the key area of customer pushback there and how you're going about addressing that?","Robert J. Thomson","To be frank, the key area of push back was in Factiva, where we had changed the offering in a way that, to be honest, some of the clients found unacceptable. And so what we've done, we've listened to our clients. We've perfected the product -- the pitch and the pricing, and we're starting to see some positive feedback there.","Operator","We'll take your next question from Eric Katz at Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With regard to the investment REA Group made in Southeast Asia, can you tell us a little bit more about that asset and if you think it can move the needle in the segment off already strong growth rates? And then secondly, foreign currency has been a big headwind for you in fiscal '14, but it seems like it could lapping some of those comps. So do you feel like you may have a bit of a tailwind now in fiscal '15 as you lap that?","Bedi Ajay Singh","It's hard to ensure predict on foreign currencies. But yes, I think, generally speaking, shouldn't be as unfavorable as we saw in 2014. Are you asking about the iProperty acquisition? Sorry, I didn't get the first part of the question.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Bedi Ajay Singh","So we've taken a small stake in iProperty. I think we've disclosed it's 17% or 17.5%. It's really REA that's done that. And I think it's part of their stated objective of expanding outside sort of Australia, but near to Australia in a sense, so that you have the ability to monitor what's going on in the region that's close by. We'll have a board seat on that company, for that investment. And I think we'll help them and encourage them to grow. There may be cross-platform opportunities with other things we're doing in the region, such as with SEEK Asia or with BallBall, which we haven't fully exploited yet.","Robert J. Thomson","I think it's fair to say at the Investor Day, we indicated that we would increase our presence in East Asia and frankly, in the U.S. We're keeping that promise. As Bedi said, it's a relatively small, at this stage, investment. But it's a small investment in a fast-growing region.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alice Bennett at CBA.","Alice Bennett - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division","Just -- I have a question around FOX SPORTS. Maybe just a bit of a clarification. So did you say that total local currency revenue was down 2% but subscription, up 6%? And if that's the case, what drags down? Was it just advertising or was there something else that drags the total revenue down to that negative territory?","Bedi Ajay Singh","I think the reported numbers were dragged down by foreign currency. But I think local currency, we were up.","Alice Bennett - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division","Okay. So is that the adjusted number in the...","Bedi Ajay Singh","Yes. Adjusted -- we've adjusted for -- sorry, yes, for currency.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.","Michael Florin","Okay. Well, thank you, all, for participating, and we look forward to sharing with you our progress throughout the year. Have a good night.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded and media is allowed to attend in a listen-only function. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2015, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert J. Thomson","Thank you, Mike. News Corp is well set on its trajectory for digital and global growth. While we faced headwinds this quarter with particularly blustery currency conditions, we remain on course for the goals articulated when the new News was christened almost 2 years ago. The company has remained true to its proud traditions and now has a firm foundation for the future.","In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, revenues were $2.1 billion and EBITDA was $163 million. Excluding currency fluctuations during this volatile period and certain other costs, our adjusted EBITDA was relatively stable. Bedi will provide greater granularity, but there are a few developments worthy of accentuation.","The integration of Move, Inc., acquired late last year, is ahead of schedule, with traffic on realtor.com accelerating at a record rate and healthy revenue growth and robust lead volume for realtors. Mortgage lending trends are heartening for the long-term health of the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins performed impressively thanks to a strong backlist and the addition of Harlequin's powerful international and digital distribution network.","Fox Sports Australia revenues expanded in local currency thanks in part to the country's success in the Asian Cup Football Tournament and Cricket World Cup, which drove audiences, advertising and a certain amount of adulation. Foxtel's necessary investment in long-term growth also produced an immediate increase in subscriptions, while churn remained at record low levels, indicating the inherent price elasticity in the offering. These returns highlight why Foxtel is such an integral part of News Corp's future.","At the same time, being a global company, we are subject to international trends, with foreign exchange variations negatively affecting revenue by around 6% and EBITDA by 7%. And regional variations in advertising currents, particularly in the U.S., resulted in ad sales at The Wall Street Journal below expectations and prior year. We did, however, see an improvement in April though the marketplace remains volatile and short term in orientation.","We have been candid from day 1 about print advertising trends globally, and we continue to innovate to deliver a suite of leading products that extend readership across multiple platforms and expand engagement throughout the day. In so doing, our print mastheads are becoming stronger branded assets in the digital age, and our audience relationship is itself a platform which we can leverage to benefit our real estate and other digital ventures.","And REA Group, part of our Digital Real Estate segment, had a lower rate of revenue growth than in the first half magnified by certain seasonal factors, 2 of which will obviously not be a factor in the fourth quarter: elections in 2 Australian states and a relatively early Easter. More broadly, with continued expansion of digital applications and associated revenues in our newspapers, we expect a more positive final quarter, and improved EBITDA versus the prior year. Bedi will elaborate expertly on that thing shortly.","In the meantime, I would like to emphasize the efficacy of our 2 major acquisitions as the new News, Harlequin and Move, better known to many as realtor.com. Each has complemented existing strengths and extended our expertise. Our profile and prowess as a book publisher in print and in digital have grown globally, allowing us to better leverage successful books at higher margins. And today, we are a global leader in real estate, with an influential presence on 4 continents including an expanded investment in India where we are linking a recently acquired personal finance site, BigDecisions, our news flow and our large minority stake in PropTiger to build a coherent, integrated identity in a country that is growing at a significant clip.","Let me begin with Move, which has given us for the first time a full quarter of performance in Q3. Revenues accelerated on a standalone basis in the third quarter, and we have seen real growth in the core business, realtor.com, which was up 34% in unique users in the quarter year-over-year. That growth has accelerated further in April, up another record 38% with 44 million monthly unique users. Importantly, consumer engagement, including page views, is improving markedly, and lead volume this quarter continues to outpace usage growth.","One early success, and we are clearly early in the site's evolution, is the enhancement of the News and Advice section. Traffic to this feature, now powered by property news from around News Corp, was up 600% in March compared to the same month last year. There is, of course, much toil ahead, but notably, mobile hit an impressive 71% unique user growth versus the prior year. Users of our mobile app are consuming about 16 pages per visit and that does not include photo galleries. So you can get a sense of the deep engagement, allowing us to harvest permissions, precious data, which can then be further leveraged.","According to third-party measurements, realtor.com surpassed Trulia in fiscal third quarter to become the second most popular real estate web site in America, and it became the fastest-growing of the leading sites. Overall, both March and April were record-breaking months in terms of traffic, and we expect to continue to drive and deepen engagement and monetization over the coming year. There is no doubt that realtor.com's audience growth is benefiting from News Corp's content and contacts.","Our relationships with New York realtors fashioned during the launch of Mansion at The Wall Street Journal have played an important role in building out realtor.com's fast-growing presence in the city. And the new sensibility that is inherent in the character of News Corp has allowed us to generate a stream of stories and alerts far more informative than the drivel and dross masquerading as news on many listing sites. The News Corp links mean more revenue, too, because we have integrated realtor.com into our global programmatic ad exchange, and we expect that to be a catalyst for CPM improvement.","You will certainly be hearing more about realtor.com in the coming weeks. We will be launching a fresh marketing campaign for the company, highlighting our crucial links to the industry, but also stressing the real value and real results that come from realtor in real time. We also believe the integration and other challenges being experienced by Zillow open the door even wider for realtor.com as a healthy and recharged competitor, particularly since realtor.com has strengthened its standing as the most accurate, up-to-date source of real estate listings in the country.","One modest launch worth mentioning is the unveiling last week of Mansion Global, a global luxury real estate site operated by Dow Jones. It will feature original content as well as news and information from our publications and websites around the world and has English, Spanish and Chinese language editions, reflecting the reality that property is an international asset class whose importance is burgeoning.","Harlequin. Harlequin continues to fulfill its promise of helping HarperCollins grow its global footprint, with the most recent step forward being the establishment of foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, the Nordic region and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter, all building on the impressive Harlequin infrastructure.","We also have, as predicted, expanded our international language offerings, including the announcement last month that we'd be publishing 5 authors in 15 languages, including the prolific and popular Daniel Silva. And for the first time, we announced the signing of an author for publication in both English and a dozen international languages, the best-selling novelist Karin Slaughter. Meanwhile, we have a fresh contract with the gifted Veronica Roth, author of one of the most successful series in recent years, the Divergent Trilogy. And there is much anticipation for the release of the monumental Go Set a Watchman, To Kill a Mockingbird's prequel\/sequel by Harper Lee. Having read the manuscript, I can say that I expect it to have a profound impact. So order early. HarperCollins is also publishing the title in Spanish, a feat that would've been beyond us without Harlequin.","Overall, we saw revenue growth of 14% in Book Publishing and EBITDA growth of 6%. Keep in mind that this growth came despite the obviously difficult Divergent comps, which we referenced at the last call. The latest Divergent film was a catalyst for further sales in Q3 when 2.3 million books were sold, while American Sniper had a strong quarter with 2.7 million books purchased. Speaking of which, American Wife by Taya Kyle, the widow of American Sniper author, Chris Kyle, has been released this week. As for Amazon, HarperCollins has reached agreement on extended terms meaning that there will be no disruption to the distribution of our works, digitally and traditionally.","At News and Information Services, we are pleased with the improvement in the professional information business at Dow Jones as we focus on product enhancement and customers. We've seen favorable trends in both risk and compliance and Factiva and expect that the company will benefit from the direct linking of professional products to The Wall Street Journal itself. More on that project in coming months.","At The Journal, despite a tough national ad marketplace, we saw an increase in circulation revenues thanks in part to Make Time, the first brand campaign in 4 years. WSJ+ also continues to have traction with less churn and a disciplined approach to pricing. In other words, no deleterious discounting. WSJ digital-only subs are now over 700,000 and that total should be bolstered given that we have just unveiled a more contemporary WSJ.com. Early results from that relaunch show a significant improvement in engagement, including page views, unique visitors and video plays.","At News UK, the team did a fine job of reducing costs and strategically raising both the cover price of The Sun on Saturday and Sunday and subscription pricing at The Times in a measured manner. The Times continues to grow volume and notably outperformed the market both in terms of ad market share and in circulation. In March, we announced the total subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times broke through the 400,000 mark, including 171,000 digital-only. At The Sun, while advertising revenues were soft, having just visited the team there last week, I know they are focused on diversifying the advertiser client base and on reinvesting in a new and improved website.","At News Corp Australia, advertising was reasonably stable and thanks to improved pricing, circulation revenues in the local currency accelerated. We're continuing to grow our paid digital subscribers at the mastheads, led by The Australian, where digital subs now account for 40% of its overall weekday volume.","At Foxtel, as referenced earlier, churn was a record low of less than 11%, and new subscriber volume is significantly higher and spin down to cheaper offerings has been lower than forecast as we build out the audience. As has been highlighted in the past, we are determined to increase our market penetration in Australia beyond the high 20s percentage points, and the early signs are indeed promising.","At Amplify, we continue to concentrate on scalability and profitability, counting on a strong sales network to make progress in this selling season, armed with a world-class digital curriculum. Let me be clear on this point. A review of progress thus far indicates that investment spend will be significantly reduced next fiscal year.","In conclusion, while Q3 had its challenges, we expect to finish fiscal 2015 with a stronger quarter and year-over-year growth in EBITDA. Our strategic trajectory is very much on track, and we are confident that all shareholders will benefit as we build on the base fortified over the past 2 years.","With that, we turn to Bedi Singh, our CFO, for a more textured exposition on our accounts.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thank you, Robert. First, I'd like to share with you some high-level financial highlights and then we'll discuss each segment in further detail.","We reported fiscal '15 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, almost flat with the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue declined 2% compared to the prior year. On EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $163 million compared to the prior year period of $175 million. This quarter includes $15 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding those costs plus the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuation, our adjusted total segment EBITDA was relatively flat with the prior year.","While we reported a decline in segment EBITDA this quarter, this was mainly driven by currency headwinds; onetime or nonrecurring items, including an acceleration of stock-based comp at Move; and additional legal costs at News America. We do not believe these results are reflective of any run rate and expect to see an improvement in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss shortly. And just as a reminder, for the first 9 months ended March 31, our reported and adjusted EBITDA increased 3% and 6%, respectively. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q3 total reported revenues by $119 million or 6% and total reported segment EBITDA by $13 million or 7%. Adjusted EPS were $0.05 versus $0.11 in the prior year, and this year's results include a higher effective tax rate, lower equity earnings and lower interest income.","Now let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $135 million or 9% versus the prior year period. Approximately 60% of the revenue decline was related to currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 3%. Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 54% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 12% or 7% in local currency, which is relatively similar to last quarter.","Looking at performance across our key units. At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 16%. However, the decline was only 4% in local currency, relatively stable versus the prior quarter, helped by further market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw continued improvement in yields, which was offset by weakness in a few categories including retail. National spending including tourism and energy were flat this quarter.","At The Wall Street Journal, advertising declined around 11% versus the prior year. We saw weakness in print advertising across the board, in telecom and to a lesser extent, in finance. That said, while the market remains volatile, we expect a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter driven by digital.","At News UK, advertising revenues remained soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 11% in local currency, but did show sequential improvement on a local currency basis. We were impacted by weakness in a few categories, including telecom, automotive and retail. As Robert noted, The Times performed well with ad revenues and local currency down only slightly, while The Sun remained soft this quarter.","At News America Marketing, revenue declined 7% versus the prior year quarter due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts and a decline in sales of in-store products this quarter. This was related to consumer packaged goods spending, which was impacted by lower commodity prices, timing of product launches and a very tough year-ago comp, which was up more than 20%.","Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 39% of segment revenues this quarter, declined 6% and were relatively flat in local currency. Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter or $6 million excluding foreign currencies, an improvement from the sequential prior quarter. We remain encouraged by the underlying trends and the pipeline. We again saw growth in consumer circulation revenues in local currency led by improvement at The Wall Street Journal, which rose nearly 7% and at News Australia, which rose around 4%, largely driven by cover and subscription price increases.","Segment EBITDA decreased $33 million in the quarter or 23% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 21%. Included in segment EBITDA was an $8 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for the ongoing litigations. And to date, in fiscal 2015, litigation expenses at News America Marketing have totaled around $24 million. This quarter also included roughly $5 million of additional marketing spend at Dow Jones for its currently running Make Time campaign. Total segment cost continued to decline due to the benefits of past restructurings and lower printing and distribution costs. News Corp Australia continues to benefit from cost savings and relatively stable revenues in local currency.","Turning now to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 14% and segment EBITDA grew 6% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed on August 1, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues fell 5% versus the prior year and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8% due to very tough comparisons from the Divergent series in the prior year period. While the Divergent series continued to sell well, this quarter totaling approximately 2.3 million net units, as expected, this was lower than the 8.5 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $44 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed well thanks to the strength of its backlist, most notably Chris Kyle's American Sniper, which sold 2.7 million net units this quarter. Other notable titles included Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, Amy Poehler's Yes Please, as well as continued demand for Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian publishing.","Total e-book sales for the quarter declined 3% and accounted for 22% of consumer revenues due to the Divergent year-ago comp combined with strong demand in nonfiction this quarter, which historically has had a lower conversion to e-books, which was partially offset by the inclusion of Harlequin. Regarding Harlequin, HarperCollins announced the rebranding of additional foreign language offices in the Netherlands, Japan, Nordic and Poland to add to the previously announced rebranding in Germany and Iberia this quarter. We remain on track with our cost synergy target of $20 million, most of which should be realized in our next fiscal year.","In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved by $3 million or 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 1%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers. Advertising revenues rose 13%, driven by viewership gains from major events, such as the Cricket World Cup and the Asian Cup, which we didn't have in the prior year period. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat despite higher cost and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues and EBITDA both increased by 15%.","In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $68 million or 67% and EBITDA declined 21% compared to the prior year period due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move results. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 9% and 7%, respectively, as higher depth penetration and pricing was partially offset by lower-listing volume across the Australian market, most notably in March impacted, as Robert said, by the earlier Easter break and elections in 2 states. Please also note that the reported numbers vary from REA's reported numbers due to foreign currency translation as well as differences between Australian IFRS and U.S. GAAP. REA will be issuing their 9 months results under Australian IFRS and in Australian dollars shortly after this call.","Reported segment results also include $73 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $9 million from Move. Move's EBITDA loss includes $11 million of stock-based compensation expense related to awards assumed in the acquisition, including acceleration of stock-based compensation resulting from the departures of senior executives. Excluding Move's stock-based comp, EBITDA would have been a positive $3 million this quarter. On a standalone basis, Move's revenue would've grown over 25% versus the prior year quarter led by Connection for Co-Brokerage [ph] product, which grew 130% versus the prior year.","As Robert noted, audience growth at realtor.com continues to accelerate. Average monthly unique users in the third quarter were 39 million, growing 34% versus the prior year including record traffic in April of 44 million unique users. Mobile continues to drive realtor.com traffic growth, up over 71% year-over-year in the quarter. We're very pleased with the product development at realtor.com, which has broadly been in line, if not ahead, of our expectations and are now starting to dial up brand marketing to drive further market share gains.","At Digital Education, revenues were flat with the prior year quarter and segment EBITDA improved $24 million to a loss of $21 million. About $12 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning product with the balance from lower operating expenses.","With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.8 million total subscribers, up 7% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Churn declined to a record low of 10.9% from 13.1% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 1% versus the prior year and EBITDA declined mid-teens due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula 1 rights, higher fees paid to Fox Sports Australia combined with higher investment in marketing and customer service related to the new pricing and packaging offerings.","Foxtel also incurred additional cost for triple play and Presto, Foxtel's SVOD product. However, these planned investments position Foxtel for sustainable growth, and we believe the results are very encouraging. Subscriber growth remains strong, with total subscribers up 182,000 year-over-year with growth of 85,000 in Q3. Year-to-date, new customer sales are up more than 50% [ph] over the prior period and spin-down volume remains below our expectations.","Turning now to free cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations for the 9 months was $702 million compared to $803 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp was $391 million compared to $496 million in the prior year. This decline was primarily due to the absence of net receipts related to the foreign tax refund of $73 million received last year, coupled with approximately $45 million of higher deferred compensation payments related to the acquisition of Wireless Generation. To note, foreign currency had a $15 million negative impact to year-to-date available free cash flow. The vast majority of our $2 billion cash on hand at the quarter end is in U.S. dollars.","Let me turn briefly to our current fiscal fourth quarter. While currency is likely to remain a headwind in the short term, we expect to see year-over-year EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter including, at News and Information Services, we expect to benefit from lower costs at News UK, which last year included severance costs, higher promotional spending around the World Cup and the London relocation. At Dow Jones, we anticipate a sequential improvement in advertising combined with ongoing operating efficiencies. At Book Publishing, the year-ago comp related to Divergent should ease significantly and should benefit from the Harlequin acquisition. Cable Network should benefit from higher subs, partially offset by modestly higher acquisition costs. And at Amplify, we expect to see continued operating expense declines in addition to the amounts capitalized.","So in summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. While the ad market has been uneven and currency a clear headwind, we believe the steps we've taken and we're taking, both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies, are positioning the company for long-term growth.","And with that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is just around Digital Real Estate Services, and you obviously mentioned that there was a slowdown in the March quarter within the REA Group. Are you able to give us an indication of what the trends were in the first 2 months if there was that sort of slowdown? Just looking to, I guess, extrapolate into the fourth quarter and what sort of price rates [ph] we can expect.","Robert J. Thomson","Entcho, look, I think the best thing to do quite honestly for more granularity on REA is to talk to the REA executive team. What I can say is really that it was an unusual quarter given the uncertainty that is inevitably created by elections. As you well know, there was one in New South Wales and in Queensland. And the relatively early Easter meant that there was a slowdown in listings and it's a, quite frankly, a very listing-dependent business, but we have a lot of confidence in REA's prospects.","Operator","We go next to John Janedis with Jefferies LLC.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you give us an update on your return on capital plan? And to what extent the investment you're making in Amplify impacts the plan or the timing of when you share it?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, John. So look, I think as we've said before when questions have come up on capital returns that our first priority is to remain focused on stabilizing the business, making sure that we're reinvesting smartly and also to look at acquisitions and you've seen the kinds of acquisitions we've done. I mean, having said that, we obviously focus on delivering shareholder value and per share growth. And when we came out of the gate a couple of years back, we did say that the company would expect to pay a dividend. And as you know, we still have our $500 million buyback authorization in place. And I think we can say that look, 2 years are almost coming to an end and we have said, and Robert has said that as well, that this is the time when we are going to be having, and indeed we are having, intensive discussions on our capital return policy. I think, look, the way we're kind of thinking about it, I would say, is that whatever we do, I think, would be reasonable and should be something that's sustainable. And as our business grows and our cash flow grows, we'd expect that to be growing. So I think that's kind of the way I'd frame it.","Robert J. Thomson","Just to supplement Bedi's observations, as he made clear, there are a couple of conditions that will very much inform what we do: continuity, consistency and sustainability.","Operator","We go next to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Earlier when you mentioned -- you said the investment spend in Amplify will be significantly reduced in fiscal '16, I guess any further color on sort of the magnitude of that reduction? And then just to follow up on News America, how we should think about the News America business longer term?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, what I said is what I said, which is there would be a significant reduction in investment, but then let me be very clear that, that's not in any way to suggest that we are reducing our commitment to education. What we have in Amplify is world-class digital curriculum. What we're seeing now out in the field is a great deal of acceptance in classrooms, in school districts, in states, and we're very pleased by that. And so -- but there's a natural moment in the investment cycle in any new business where you do get variation and the variation that's upcoming is that which I indicated to you. We are very much on a path to profitability, but we are very much committed to improving education, improving the quality of the curriculum, the service to students and to the profitability principle.","Michael Florin","And on NAM?","Robert J. Thomson","And on News America Marketing, we see it as a very important part of News Corp. What we've noticed, for example, with realtor.com is significant amount of cooperation between the 2 companies. So I won't go into too much detail now. That would be premature. But there are, clearly, things that can be done in a way that enhance and leverage the competence and skills of both companies. And what we've seen, as you no doubt know, is a fair amount of competition in the FSI business. We're looking at costs there, as one must. But longer term, we're very confident about not only the traditional businesses at NAM, but the digital opportunities and the opportunities that exist to further extend the expertise that NAM has into other parts of News Corp.","Operator","We go next to Bill Bird with FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You touched on better trends in April, The Wall Street Journal. I was just wondering if you could speak to just your overall, I guess, outlook on print advertising over coming months.","Robert J. Thomson","Look, it's always perilous to prognosticate too much. But I think what we were trying to indicate was that the currents of the last quarter, Q3, was not a harbinger of worst to come in the current quarter. But when you look at the advertising market, there's no doubt that there are short-term trends in place. We have seen, for example, a recovery in telco advertising or also an increase in device-related advertising with new products like the Samsung Galaxy 6. But more generally, there are shifts in the advertising market that I think longer term, we're confident will play out to our strengths. In particular, if you look where large companies are spending at least some of their money, there are too many meaningless placements on frivolous sites. And in the end, we're very confident about our mastheads. We're very confident about the power of print. We're also very confident about the halo effect of a masthead in digital formats. And in the end, advertisers will return to quality, which is why our advertising teams around the world, in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, are reaching out to clients to articulate the virtues of our platform relative to something that's cyber superficial.","Operator","We go next to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC","Yes, I want to focus on the cost within your -- on newspaper division. Can you give us a sense, please, how much the costs were down adjusting for foreign currency in Australia, the U.K. papers and then separately, The Wall Street Journal? I just want to get a sense there, please.","Bedi Ajay Singh","I mean, we don't actually break out sort of the cost by each of those individual units. But what I can tell you overall is that we've had meaningful declines, excluding legal expense, the onetime legal cost that I mentioned, across most of our operating units. Some of that is because of past restructurings that we've done, and I think some of that is because we've had, for example, better pricing on news print and we basically looked at backroom operations. There's been a lot of cost reduction, I would say, across all of the units. This is by no means to say we're done, and we're continually evaluating the cost base. But again, we want to be careful that we're not cutting into kind of our key competitive strengths on the content side.","Robert J. Thomson","Just to complement Bedi's answer, I think one of the things we emphasized at the time of the formation of the new News 2 years ago was that the extra focus would allow us to make comparisons between our businesses and see where there were costs and also to be very incisive about, for example, one area which in a digital age is going to be expensive, our technology investment. And what we're seeing is that the close relationships between our newspaper groups around the world are allowing us to see where there are areas where we can make cuts. But as Bedi emphasized, we will always invest in quality and we have tremendous faith in our newspapers, both in print and in digital.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go next to Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think it's been about 1.5 years since you guys shared with us the investments that you made in the exclusive soccer rights in the U.K. I'm curious if you can give us an update on how that's impacted the business, whether it's had the impact on the business that you hoped it would and also how much longer you have those rights for and whether that's something that you would look to continue at the current terms given that impact.","Robert J. Thomson","Well, what we have at The Sun is around 200,000 digital subscribers. We've also seen an increase in ARPU at The Sun with our digital subscriptions, and it has created both affinity and intensity that is of value to us, not just for circulation revenue but also for advertising revenue. We have those rights for another 12 months beyond the -- this Premier League season. As with any rights, we are certainly not going to overpay. We look at the monetization prospects. We believe for certain types of rights and certain types of countries that we're in a position to monetize better than others, but we will certainly not overpay.","Operator","We go next to Justin Diddams with Citi.","Justin Diddams - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question for me on Foxtel. Can you give us a sense of how much of the cost in the third quarter was nonrecurring or related to that upfront investment in marketing the new pricing plans and putting together Presto and triple play and what you expect the cost base growth profile to look like going forward?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, Justin. So I mean, look, basically obviously with the launch of the new pricing package and the launch of Presto, there was the sort of call it [ph] the marketing and customer service investment that's made. Clearly, the subscribers have come on, but the full impact of their revenue hasn't probably been felt in the quarter. So that will translate into better sort of profitability as we go forward. You'd expect to invest something more in marketing because you're still trying to grow subscribers, and you'd expect that some of the customer service costs, as your subscriber base grows, would increase a little bit. But basically, the unit economics of the business are unchanged, and we expect because the subscriber uptake so far has been very good, that we -- the prognosis is good for Foxtel.","Robert J. Thomson","Just to further Bedi's point, as you know, we've long indicated that we were unhappy with the level of penetration of Foxtel in Australia. We believe it's a great service that if people experience it, they'll like it. And so it's an important period of investment, and as Bedi indicated, the early signs are very good. New customer sales are up 52% year-to-date and since November to the end of March, they're up 75%.","Operator","We go next to Christian Guerra with Goldman Sachs.","Christian Guerra - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question for you on Foxtel. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about -- I mean, you've talked about the subscriber impact and in fact, you're seeing some good growth there in subscriber numbers. Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the impact on ARPU from the fairly dramatic cut in that base sort of package price?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, Christian. ARPU has actually been relatively stable. It's a little bit down, but it's been remarkably stable and sports penetration has been pretty much along the lines of what we were expecting.","Robert J. Thomson","I think, Christian, the question that we had was whether there would be much spin down, and I think it's fair to say that the spin down has been significantly less than forecast or feared.","Operator","We go next to Brian Han with Morningstar Research.","Brian Han - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I also have a question on Foxtel. Robert, you mentioned that you're confident of increasing pay-TV penetration in Australia, but it's been stuck around current levels for many years now. And with all these new streaming services coming on board, what gives you confidence that pay-TV penetration will increase going forward?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, certainly, we had to do something different. And so indeed, Richard Freudenstein and the team reduced prices at the -- for the essentials package and the sports package, down [ph] from 50 to 25 and 75 to 50. That was necessary as was clever marketing. Now I think it will benefit Foxtel and its portfolio, for there to be close scrutiny during a period of intense marketing. On the quality of the programming that Foxtel has, there is no doubt it's programming is preeminent and you have a period now of a certain amount of flux in the Australian market, and I think it's flux that should work to our benefit given the quality and the quantity of our programming compared to that of inferior competitors.","Operator","We go next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Douglas M. Arthur - Huber Research Partners, LLC","Bedi, just going back to News and Information Services for a second. Just trying to get a sense of the underlying growth in circulation and subscription revenues. If you adjust for currency and kind of sidebar professional information for a second, are you seeing underlying growth from price increases and\/or digital subscribers in revenues there?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Yes, so actually, currency adjusted, we're seeing growth on circulation in all of the markets. In Australia, circulation revenue was up 4%. In -- as I said, The Wall Street Journal was up 7% and then the U.K. was pretty much flat. So I think it's good revenue trends.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Sir, the floor is yours. Please go ahead.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, Steve. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to Twenty-First Century Fox's business and strategies. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended December 31, 2013, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements.

Nallen","Thanks, Reed, and good morning, everyone. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our financial results continue to reflect strong top line revenue growth. We reported second quarter fiscal 2014 revenues for the total company of $8.2 billion, which is up 15% compared to the second quarter a year ago. Approximately 40% of this growth is organic with the balance reflecting the inclusion of revenues from our newly consolidated businesses, namely, Sky Deutschland and our acquired cable sports channels. Total segment EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.54 billion, a 4% reduction compared to the $1.61 billion reported a year ago.","This year's results reflect solid underlying cable channel growth, continued strength in retransmission consent revenues and a strong TV production performance. These increases were more than offset by lower contributions from our Film business and weaker ratings for the X Factor, as well as the impact of the investments in our new cable channels and the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's EBITDA losses. In aggregate, the impact of acquisitions and new channel launches reduced our reported EBITDA growth by approximately 6%. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange movements reduced the growth by a further 1%.","From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $982 million as compared to the $1.06 billion reported in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding the net income effects in both years of amounts reflected in Other, net and our gains from participating in BSkyB's share repurchase program, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.33 this year versus $0.35 in the prior year.","Now let me provide some additional context on the performance of a few of our businesses, and let's start with the Cable Networks. Overall, total segment revenues in the second quarter increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 17% increase in affiliate revenues and 7% advertising growth. The 17% affiliate revenue growth was led by higher rates across our channels. Domestic affiliate fees increased 15%, primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX and Fox News, as well as our new channels, FS1 and FXX. Increased revenues related to the impact of last year's NHL lockout and the inclusion of SportsTime Ohio also contributed to the growth.","Our reported international affiliate fees were up 22%. Within this overall increase, affiliate fees at the nonsports channels at FIC and STAR grew 16% in local currency terms. The balance of the affiliate fee increase was from the international sports channel, which was partially offset by unfavorable currency movements.","Second quarter advertising revenue growth reflects domestic advertising increases of 7%, led by double-digit gains at the FX channels and the RSNs, which were partially offset by political-related advertising declines at Fox News. At the international channels, advertising revenue increased 9%. Within this overall increase, local currency advertising at the FIC and STAR nonsports channels grew at the same 9% rate. The increase generated by our sports channels was offset by the overall negative impact of foreign currency.","So total Cable segment EBITDA in the quarter was $1.04 billion, a 2% increase above prior year levels. Similar to our first quarter results, this quarter's strong underlying EBITDA growth, generated by the RSNs, FX and Fox International Channels, was largely absorbed by the impact of the planned investments in our new channel launches and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency comparisons. Combined, the new channels and currency negatively impacted the year-on-year Cable segment growth by 10% with the new channel launches, alone, representing a 7% impact to our growth.","Turning to our Television segment. EBITDA in the quarter of $218 million declined $27 million from last year. We had strong growth in retransmission consent revenues and improved network sports results, led by the revenue increases from solid ratings for the NFL regular season and the MLB postseason. These improvements were more than offset by substantially reduced political revenues at the stations, weaker X Factor ratings and higher programming and marketing costs at the FOX Network in support of our initiative to invest in the network.","At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $337 million, down 21% from a year ago. This decline primarily reflects lower theatrical revenues and higher releasing costs for this year's films, including The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Walking with Dinosaurs and The Counselor, as well as difficult comparisons to last year's results, which included the theatrical release of Taken 2 and a home entertainment release of Ice Age: Continental Drift. Revenues and EBITDA contributions at our television production units were up year-over-year, primarily due to this year's domestic syndication of Modern Family and higher SVOD revenues.","Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $30 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million in the prior year. These decrease reflects the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's negative EBITDA results, which more than offset a $25 million improvement in SKY Italia contributions, primarily from marketing and operating cost reductions.","Total revenues at the DBS segment increased by $605 million, principally from the inclusion of $565 million in Sky Deutschland revenue. Sky D this morning reported ARPU gains of 5.5% and a year-over-year direct subscriber increase of 304,000, yielding 3.67 million subs at quarter end. At SKY Italia, local currency revenues in the quarter were similar to a year ago as the slight ARPU increase was offset by lower average subs for the period. Quarter-end subscribers of 4.76 million were unchanged from the end of September.","Now before I turn to guidance, let me give you a quick update on our buyback activity and the delisting process. Since the date of the separation, we've been consistently repurchasing FOXA shares, resulting in approximately $2.3 billion of repurchases from July 1 through yesterday. So we're on track to complete the $4 billion buyback within the 12-month time frame we've previously announced.","Additionally, in the beginning of January, we announced our plans to delist from the Australian Stock Exchange. Yesterday, we filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC that includes detailed information about the delisting process and key dates. If approved, the effective date of this suspension in trading on the ASX will occur at the close of trading on May 1.","Finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014 total segment EBITDA growth. Since our last earnings call 3 months ago, we have updated our operational assumptions to reflect our first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. And while we have the usual pluses and minuses across most of our divisions that essentially offset, we are lowering our outlook in 2 areas: first, our Film division's results for the first 6 months have been below our plans, including the impact of our 3 theatrical film releases in the December quarter and this will impact our full year outlook; second, prime time ratings, and therefore advertising revenues, will be lower than anticipated at the Fox Broadcast network, largely due to the mixed performance of our shows, led by the lower-than-planned ratings on the X Factor and the early results of American Idol. Therefore, these network advertising revenue factors will also impact our full year outlook.","So primarily as a result of these film and network factors and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2014 will be in the mid- to high-single digit range, above the $6.26 billion total segment EBITDA base level of fiscal 2013. This outlook does not reflect the impact of consolidating the YES Network results, although this factor would not materially impact the 2014 growth rate. If that transaction closes when expected, we will consolidate the YES Network results beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter, including approximately $1.7 billion of their debt.","As we look out to our expected performance for the second half of the year, we anticipate that a majority of our overall annual growth will be realized in the fourth fiscal quarter as we expect very favorable film comparisons, led by this year's comparatively stronger releases, including Rio 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past. Additionally, results of the Cable segment are expected to be strong, driven by continued top line growth and a more moderate increase in costs, principally from sports rights.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Thank you, John, and good morning, everybody. This may sound like an unexpected opening line after John just took our guidance down a notch, but we've never been more excited about the future at Twenty-First Century Fox. I'd like to be clear that I'm not minimizing our disappointment in the adjusted guidance. However, that disappointment does not distract from the momentum that exists across our company and the confidence in our ability to achieve the overall 3-year goals we outlined last August. Structurally and strategically, we've never been stronger and better positioned. We continue to build the foundation that will enable us to deliver sustained long-term growth.","At our cable channels, that foundation begins with long-term affiliation agreements that drive stable top line growth and provide the base to build new channels like Fox Sports 1, FXX and our new sports international channels. We continue to conclude agreements around the world that meet or exceed our targets for both existing and new channels, which reflect our global strength. In the last few months, we concluded such agreements with 2 of the top 10 U.S. distributors, as well as leading distributors in Latin America and Asia.","We also continue to take advantage of opportunities to add new dimensions to our Cable business. Last month, we agreed to increase our ownership in YES to 80%. And we've recently rebranded multiple channels in Latin America and Europe, building a global lifestyle brand called FOX Life, which creates an additional international tentpole brand to go with FOX, FOX Sports and National Geographic.","Another foundation to drive our long-term growth is our unique brands, content and long-term rights that distinguish our business. Our U.S. channels continue to maximize these strengths and build on our market leadership positions. At FX, American Horror Story had a great run with its best ratings ever, while Sons of Anarchy finished its season as the highest rated series in FX history. We also look forward to FX's launch of season 2 of The Americans later this month and the premiere of new series like Tyrant from the creators of Homeland and The Strain, both of which will premier this summer.","Our RSNs continue to deliver on-target results and we're well positioned to rights discussions. Fox News is as dominant a ratings force as ever, although headwinds in the ad markets during this off-political cycle have been tougher than expected, leading to results that are up year-on-year but behind our target. Fortunately, we're headed back into another political cycle and recent programming moves are delivering even stronger ratings.","At Fox Business, we're excited to welcome Maria Bartiromo and look forward to ongoing growth and profits with new and improved distribution agreements on top of ongoing improvements at the channel. We're still investing at building Fox Sports 1 and FXX while going through some of the growing pains at building a programming lineup, but those channels are on course and will be a source of new profits for years to come.","An issue that has been a topic of recent debate is the impact of consolidation in the U.S. distribution industry. We honestly don't see any material consequences to our business. In fact, there may be some positive ones. First, unique content at scale in an expanding digital world has never held a stronger hand. Second, the new digital platforms and over-the-top players may grow even more quickly with a consolidated distribution industry.","Furthermore, the real issue is how many choices an individual home has, not how big is the distributor. We already deal successfully with large distributors. Cable consolidation will not change the number of choices. Consumer choices actually are likely to increase, not decrease, as over-the-top digital platforms emerge. Finally, consolidation may spur innovation and improve customer experience and new technologies like targeted ads as well as other enhancements that enlarge the pie for everyone.","Turning back to our channels business. Another foundation for our long-term growth is our international leadership position. Although we expect that the continued weakening of emerging market currencies will adversely impact this year's Cable results by an additional $50 million to $75 million from what we assume at the start of the fiscal year, our operational progress internationally, including at both Fox International Channels and STAR, continues to be a story of across-the-board strength while adding new dimensions to the business.","STAR recently launched the STAR Sports brand across its 6 sports channels, including STAR Sports 3, India's first 24\/7 Hindi sports channel and the digital site, starsports.com, substantially increasing the reach of sports and establishing a new foundation for growth in India. While the related investments are spending are short-term profits, this initiative should prove to be one of our largest drivers of growth 5 to 10 years from now.","On the broadcast side of our channels business, we've had mixed results. Sports have been a positive, particularly the NFL capped by Sunday's Super Bowl, delivering TV's largest audience ever. Retransmission is also an ongoing source of growth and we continue to conclude agreements at or above our targets. The one area that is delivering results significantly below expectations is the entertainment network.","While we had success with new series, Sleepy Hollow, and Golden Globe winner, BROOKLYN NINE-NINE, the combination of disappointing ratings from X Factor, larger programming write-ups than planned and a bit of extra programming and marketing costs leave us well behind our goal. We also expect American Idol, which is a much better show than it was a year ago, to deliver results below our targets. While these results are disappointing, we are quite bullish about the direction of the network as we break away from decades-old antiquated rules of broadcasting where 100 scripts in the fall become 20 pilots in the spring, leading to dozens of series being launched that September with each planned to deliver 22 episodes before the cycle begins again.","During the coming months, our new strategy for the network will start to evolve with events like 24 and COSMOS, as well as new series like Gracepoint and Hieroglyph, all launched at different times of the year, different series lengths and new programs ordered without pilots that go straight to the series. We will still rely on some of the historical industry practices where it makes sense. However, we can't be bound by rules established in a free network world. We need to execute with an opportunistic agility to maximize its value. Our broadcast network is the strongest distribution platform in the business and this new direction will enable us to build it to its full potential.","Our content business is also one with mixed results. Our television studio continues to be a powerhouse with 43 scripted shows on broadcast and cable this season and 17 new pilots for next season. We're more excited than ever about the increasingly robust digital market for our product. We just concluded a new agreement with Amazon granting exclusive SVOD rights to FX's hit shows The Americans, as well as SVOD distribution rights to other new and library series. More details will come from Amazon later today on that.","On the flip side, our film company has had a difficult first half of the year. I don't want try and put a silver lining on the results. We're disappointed. However, this business will always have its ups and downs and we are energized about a number of key releases over the next 6 months, including Rio 2, X-Men: Days of Future Past and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. These results won't have a big impact on fiscal 2014 due to timing, but we're optimistic that they will provide a great start to next fiscal year.","Finally our satellite platforms in the U.K., Germany, Italy and India continue to operate well and building their leadership positions. We're pleased with the recent subscriber additions of BSkyB and Sky Deutschland and have stabilized subscriber levels and profits in Italy.","So in aggregate, while we have some businesses that aren't delivering planned and short-term results, we feel good about the strategy and direction of all our operations. Overall, we have solid momentum, which gives us confidence in achieving our long-term targets.","With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Chase. Steve, now we'd like to move on to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mike Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","I have one for John and then one for Chase and James. John, can you just spend some time on Cable Networks? Expenses are up 22% in the first half. I'm wondering, when you look at this fiscal year, what expense growth will be for Cable Nets for the year. Maybe you could separate the growth rates for the year between domestic, international and expenses.","John P. Nallen","I'm not sure that I look at it that way, Michael, but I think the growth rate will be consistent as we go through it. On the sports side, internationally, probably consistent growth rate in expense as we go through. On the U.S. side, the growth rate will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, because the sports rights costs, particularly at FS1, are not as significant as they were or will be in the first 3 quarters. So there'll be a slight moderation in the fourth quarter. But I think the increase will be fairly consistent for the first 3 quarters of the year.","Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then for Chase and James. You talked a bit, Chase, about changes in the broadcast model and one of the things we hear a lot about is VOD. And because you guys own on a network and a studio, there's going to be tension about VOD rights in terms of getting people of MVPD stacking rights for a whole season. So how do you feel about possibly changing the model to give full season stacking rights versus what it does to the back end value of syndications? Or how are you guys feeling about that change to the model?","Chase Carey","Look, there's no question, increasingly, the value of these rights extends beyond the linear network and into the VOD world. And I think each of these businesses, which is what we're doing, needs to pursue a strategy that makes sense for them. So I think for our networks, that's capturing and controlling a wider set of rights so that they're able to deliver an experience to their consumers that enables people to watch what they want when they want and where they want.","I think in order to do that, the networks have to be aggressive about controlling and negotiating the rights they need. Negotiating those rights with our studios is really not that different than negotiating rights with third parties. I think, equally, on the studio, on the content side, we recognize those rights have value and we expect the content side to extract value for its rights in the marketplace. So yes, I think owning both sides enable us to have a strategic understanding of sort of the business as a whole. But I think the execution of that really comes down to each individual business pursuing what makes sense for it strategically, which, on the network side, is controlling a wider set of rights in the digital world; on the studio site, it's extracting appropriate value for its rights from distributors.","I think we have -- I think the benefit of visibility to both sides is that we hopefully make smart decisions about how much we'll invest in the networks to control those rights on the one hand and ensuring on the content side we're extracting fair and full value for those rights. So I think it has the benefit of strategic understanding of those but the actual execution really comes down to both businesses making smart decisions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of John Janedis of UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","John, there's been a lot focus, as you know, on X Factor and Idol. Now given the comments you made on the network and ad weakness from ratings, does this change your view on the size of investments on scripted programming relative to prior expectations?","John P. Nallen","I think Chase should probably address that.","Chase Carey","Yes -- no, I don't think. I mean, I think you're looking at great shows, and clearly, the scripted entertainment area for us, both the studio and the network, as I said. This year, we have 2 new shows we feel real great about, BROOKLYN NINE-NINE and Sleepy Hollow, so certainly that's a great area for us. But equally, we've had great success over the years with nonscripted entertainment and actually we have some -- we have a new executive in place to energize that area and actually he's got some great things coming later in the year. Look, I think it's important for us to continue to be opportunistic and open-minded and in some ways continue to try to find new programming in whatever format that excites people and energizes people. And we think there are opportunities across-the-board and I don't -- I think you've just got to continue to really try and find build that next franchise, whether it's scripted or nonscripted. But we certainly expect to be aggressive in both sides of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just wondering if the change in guidance has any bearing on your longer-term guidance targets, if you could just talk about that $9 billion EBITDA number? And then Chase, just love an update on your thoughts on Aereo as we go into Supreme Court ruling in June, July?","Chase Carey","Sure. No, I really don't, that's what I said upfront. I think, structurally, we feel good about where we're at. And again, I don't -- I want to be clear that I'm not trying to just gloss over the challenges we've got really in a couple of businesses. In the Film business, it is a business that has ups and downs. We feel good about the films we've got coming as we look forward. But it's not a structural. It's a film business, you still -- look, we've got a great management team that has proven its capability to be a market leader for years. It is a business that, again, has some ups and downs.","And the network, as well, I think, they're doing some really exciting things. And then as I look out from the shows I touched on coming, we feel great about where it's going. So I don't -- for us, there are challenges we've got this year, we take them seriously. But when I look at the structural underpinning of what gets us to that $9 billion target, those structural underpinnings are there and we continue to execute on them. We continue to conclude distribution agreements and that enables us to get there. We continue to build the array of business platforms, channels, really are putting the fundamentals in place that are important to reach those goals.","Our new channels, while we're investing in them, investments in FXX and FS1 are pretty much on target with what we expected to invest. So there's an investment going into it but we're still very excited about the future of those businesses. So as we look out, the fundamentals are really still in place. We need to execute better in a couple of businesses, but that's really the core of what we're dealing with here.","On Aereo, it is headed to the Supreme Court in the next 6 months. I think we're cautiously optimistic that that will hopefully bring up an end to the delivered illegal theft of our content. And I do want to be clear because you hear a lot about this. This case is about respecting copyrights. It's not about cloud computing. You hear a lot of scare mongering that this case threatens cloud computing. Nothing could be further from the truth.","Our content gets sold by Amazon, iTunes, others today that use cloud technology and we're a big fan and supporter of cloud technology. It simply needs to be done in a way that respects our copyrights, and we will pursue our rights. Right now, we're pursuing them legally. We're pursuing through the paths we've described before. But at the end of the day, we need to -- our business needs to have a dual-revenue model and needs to be in a place that we could be competitive in the marketplace. And hopefully, we can get those rights reaffirmed through this process.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Chase, do you think there's anything going on with cable news beyond just the normal news cycle? I just asked because it's really across all cable news networks we've seen weak ratings and I think disappointing advertising. And then, James, could you talk about Sky Deutschland and the outlook of there? They had a really bullish print today and outlook, but Netflix is coming to Germany. The market seems to be a bit spooked about what that could mean. How do you think that business is positioned in the face of a historically price-sensitive German consumer and an over-the-top new entrant?","Chase Carey","For us in Fox News, realistically, no. I mean, last year, they had -- at the end of last year, they had to deal with the off-political cycle and there's no question that the year-on-year comparisons were tough for a nonpolitical year against the political spending from the year before. But actually, news networks are doing great. I mean, I think its ratings in January were up year-on-year.","And I think I said in the last call, we've made a series of changes that are actually -- the morning show with new talent, reorganized the prime time lineup. I think Roger introduced a little while ago The Five at 5:00, which has been a great addition to the lineup. I think it put new energy in it. I think the audience is actually -- versus what it was recently, yes, for January, it's younger and bigger. So for us, we feel pretty good about where we're at.","And again, we have to fight through the cyclicality of political spending, which gets bigger and bigger to -- and many people chagrined in other arenas, but it becomes a bigger factor that creates cyclicality here. But for us, Fox News is realistically just a locomotive that keeps going. And with that, I do think that Fox Business is really beginning to hit its stride. I think it's got some great moves. I think Maria Bartiromo is going to add a great dimension to it.","We continue to strengthen the distribution agreements for Fox Business and I think that channel really has an increasingly exciting future as it really begins to carve out a space with a distribution platform finally fully in place and I think a lot of the rules Roger has made in the lineup is starting to get some traction.","James Rupert Murdoch","And Ben, just on Germany. I think -- I mean, obviously Brian and the team reported the results earlier today, or I guess, last -- I guess, very early this morning our time and so I don't want to add too much to that. But I'd say it's a very competitive marketplace. It's a marketplace that traditionally we've been competing with free satellite channels, as well as in cable and the IPTV services. But I think Sky Deutschland's positioned really, really well. I think the brand is increasingly established in a marketplace just after -- only after a few short years. The quality of the product is very high.","And really, Sky Deutschland's positioning where it's available over any infrastructure, be it cable, IPTV or satellite, as well as the very, very successful Sky Go TV Everywhere product and now the new stand-alone over-the-top product now. I think the company's positioned well. But Germany's a very big market. I think we've shown over the last few years that you can increase your revenue per customer there and you can attract new customers, which a lot of people didn't think was possible.","And the company has really a momentum to it and is on a trajectory that we think is very encouraging. So I think it's not a zero-sum game. I there's a lot of choice in the marketplace already. We already have Watchever there and other things like that. And it's going to continue to be dynamic and competitive. But as long as we can keep innovating and keep a good quality of products onscreen for our customers, I think the company's going to continue to do well.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mr. Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chase, I'm curious if there's an opportunity over time for BSkyB, Sky Deutschland and SKY Italia to work more closely together? Is there potential upside from that? And separately, either John or Chase, I think you implied, Chase, the company's still on track for $9 billion of EBITDA in fiscal '16. Any help that you can give us for the cadence in fiscal '15 growth versus fiscal '16 growth given the lower fiscal '14 base would be helpful.","Chase Carey","Yes, on -- in terms of the Skys, I think we do think there are -- the are truly -- there are clearly benefits of the Skys working together this year, technologies to share. But in the -- certainly, many of the operational fundamentals of the businesses they share across them. We went down the path to acquire BSkyB and part of that was a view that there were values on having those businesses more closely aligned. We're obviously not on that path today, so I think we're trying to do more and more of that and find ways we can capture the value by having those companies share things they've learned, share expertise, benefit from each other and win, win, win. And hopefully, we'll continue to try and exploit that.","But I think it's an opportunity, like we're aware there are opportunities to have those businesses learn and benefit from each other. And I think we'll continue to try and find ways to tackle that and given where we're at today structurally. I think in terms of guiding and looking at the years -- looking through the years, I mean, again, you take one of the 2, I mean, the issues in sort of '14, if you take the 2, one is film, which is sort of, I don't want to completely call it a one-off, but in many ways it was a result of films released during the last 6 months, they don't have much of an impact, and realistically, the issues that caused the shortfall the film business in '14 aren't going to really affect '15 at all. I mean, '15 will be affected by how our films will perform in the next 6 months. We feel good about them, but the film -- the flow-through of the films we've released to date is a fairly marginal issue in'15.","I think for the network, in many ways, it is again sort of that transition. I mean, we've gone through the network, in many ways it was a network that had this unique franchise, American Idol, it sort of transcended everything else in television. And it's gotten to a place today where actually it's a great show. It's a top hit show, we'd love the ratings from that on any other show, but it's not a show that sort of drives the whole network like it did in years past. And so we've been planning that adjustment knowing that the show is 13 years old. We hope it has 14, 15, 16, 17 years but they won't be years that look like years 5, 6 and 7.","So this transition of the network from having this sort of locomotive that sat there in the middle of it that generated unique profits we've known is coming to the end. It's sort of winding down to a place where it becomes just a great successful show. Again, hopefully, this year, we think it's a much better show. Hopefully, there's traction -- gets better traction as it goes through this season. We think it has the potential. We think they've done a really good job and it's a very entertaining show. But it's going to be a good show and what's happened is the ratings for that, as well as X Factor, fell faster than we hoped.","But directionally, it's not different. We didn't expect those. We haven't been planning on those to sort of all of a sudden have a rebirth. What we had hoped to do is manage them through this process. So it probably moves those to a slightly lower base, but it really isn't directionally different than what we would have been planning, which is those shows to be part of a lineup, but really part of a broader diversified lineups where increasingly what we're looking to develop is new hits to take them on. So again, I don't think it puts the network, yes, maybe a little bit, but not really materially in a different place. So I don't think those 2 items, film, really I wouldn't think it changed our view on '15 much at all. I think the network probably marginally.","And the rest of it, there are some issues that are tougher than we planned. The foreign exchange, we started off the year thinking we had $100 million hit from foreign exchange and now it's looking sort of well north of $150 million. So there's some of those issues and those we put in a jump, put in the ordinary course up and down. The upside in sports could absorb that, the hit on foreign exchange and other pros and cons. So I think those give and takes we'd assumed we can sort of manage through those gives and takes. So I don't think it would change our outlook on '15 that much.","Again, '15, we do expect it to be a big bounce-up in '16 and I think that's still true. I mean, we're still very much in a build process. I think we talked about the investment in the new channels and actually said the build is actually -- the investment in the new channels is actually a little higher in '15 than '14 and that's been planned. I mean, that's sort of due to the way the sports rights roll in. But again, it's a long-winded answer. If I look at it holistically, I don't think as you look at '15 and '16, we're really in that different a place. By the end of the year, we'll see. We'll have 6 more months and we'll know more than we do today. But I wouldn't say I feel that different about '15 and really don't feel different about '16 about where we'll be.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif-Cohen of Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One to James and one to Chase. James, now you that you control all of STAR Sports for roughly a year, can you just talk about what you've done differently and maybe you can provide some color about investments still needed and the ultimate growth trajectory for that business? And then Chase, on FXX, with The Simpsons coming in August, it just seems like such an amazing branding opportunity. Can you talk about how that show can drive the channel and how quickly you can monetize it?","James Rupert Murdoch","Thanks, Jessica. On STAR Sports, I think it's been a really exciting period for us since being able to take over ESPN's share and what we view as ESPN Star Sports and it's really been across Asia. Really, the creation of a FOX Sports brand in Southeast Asia, at East Asia and the STAR Sports suite of channels in India and just on STAR Sports, it's been very exciting.","As Chase mentioned, 6 STAR Sports channels were launched towards the end of last year. And some of the things that's exciting about it, for example, doing a 24-hour Hindi language coverage of Indian cricket would seem reasonably obvious and surprising that it hasn't been down before and that's proving very, very successful. From an investment perspective, it's a little bit lumpy. As you know, we had some additional cricket rights for an additional sports in the last quarter in India and some of those things will continue to be a little [indiscernible] years and things like that, particularly impacting the STAR Sports business over the next few years. But we think it adds really a fundamental new dimension to the Indian business.","We're a leader there in the general entertainment category in many, many of the regions and languages of India and have really built a #1 network across the country. Adding sports to that portfolio, we think, is very, very exciting. It gives us a whole new dimension from the standpoint of affiliate revenue growth and we can really cement our leadership. So we think it's a real component of getting that business.","As we've said in the past, to be the overall STAR business in the India should be $0.5 billion profit business within a reasonable horizon. But this investment in this year and next year and a bit of the next, given some of the rights costs that come through, is a big investment, but it's really a testament to our belief in what we can do in that region. And we think India is a marketplace that's going to be increasingly important for us and more we can really put even more distance between us and our nearest competitors.","Chase Carey","Yes, and on FXX, I mean, there's no question. Simpsons is a tremendously exciting and important event and sort of opportunity for us. And we do -- it is more than a show and I've said it before. In many ways, we look to use that -- when I turn it to Simpsons channel, but in many ways it'll be the face of the channel. It'll clearly be much more than just a series taking up a large block of hours. It will be a series that helps brand the channel, helps drive the channel. And we are doing -- working really hard on it. And we're also really excited that it has really gone up. In many ways, the breadth of rights we have there will enable us to do some really unique things in a digital sense.","So it's not just branding the channel from a linear perspective, but really starting to really create some precedents in terms of creating a digital experience aligned with that channel that adds a whole new dimension to it. In terms of monetizing it, it's always -- in the cable -- in this world, it's always a little complicated because you can monetize through 2 things: you monetize through affiliations and you monetize through advertising.","So the affiliation side is largely tied to -- have some affiliation grievance come up. I don't have it offhand. I think, fortunately, we're in a place, and part of it was the timing where a pretty big block of our affiliation agreements in the sort of 1 year-plus post. I think probably half of the universe comes up for renewal within 1 year, 1 year and change. I don't -- again, I didn't look at it so I don't have the exact dates off the top of my head from when The Simpsons roll in. So it'd be great if we can get momentum. Clearly, monetizing it through the affiliation side is obviously a big part of it.","I think from an advertising perspective, it's going to be dependent on our execution. I think FX has proved to be pretty good at sort of distinguishing themselves from everybody else out there. I think they're -- I mean, realistically, I think they're second to none. If you stack up FX up against the channels they compete with today, I think they have proven an ability to distinguish themselves from the pack and I think we feel really good about their ability to drive a level of interest into that that we could monetize through advertising that we feel really good about it. But I want to say that.","At the end of the day, we're building an asset. I mean, the question, I'm much more sort of focused on \"Where can you get this in 2 or 3 years and where can you get this to in 2 quarters?\" So it is -- this is an opportunity to build a franchise that can be a real tentpole for new growth in our business. And so I think it is, yes, we care about the short-term and want to do what we can to drive short term. But when you're building an asset like that and investing it, to us, I think, the real key issue is where can you get that business to in 2 or 3 years, not 2 to 3 months.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on Michael Nathanson's question. When you look at a show like The Simpsons, you've actually acquired all of the prior season rights to use for your applications. And so instead of selling that to a Netflix or Amazon, you're keeping all of that for yourself to drive traffic to your apps. Wondering when you look at shows like The Americans and any of your shows or content you're creating, why is it not the right decision for FOX to keep those rights in-house, to build your own direct-to-consumer applications versus selling them to third parties.","I realize there's a near-term cash infusion from selling them. But why is The Simpsons decision not the right decision for all of your content as you look forward? And then just a separate question on Formula One rights. There's been a lot of noise about Malone and Discovery possibly buying them. Is that something -- it seems like something that would fit very well with FOX globally. Why haven't -- or is that something of interest to you?","Chase Carey","Just on The Simpsons question, the rights question of why not keep all our rights in-house, I think it's important -- I think if you go back to Michael's question, and again, I think there's a real benefit to us being we believe that the vertical integration of our businesses is a real strength. I think the strength comes from having a strategic understanding of both sides of that, that are insights and ability to make, that's where they make sense. But I think when you get to a one-size-fits-all, I think that -- I don't think that's the right way to go.","And I think at a more granular level, you have to sort of look at decisions on one level holistically and on another level for each individual business. And those businesses have to make bets. And there are times when our distribution businesses have a unique ability to take advantage of a set of rights for us to make -- The Simpsons is the perfect example. We have a new channel that FX -- that Simpsons could help take to a whole new level, so it made sense for us to probably invest more than anybody else in The Simpsons because we can monetize it in terms of building a unique asset.","There are the other times when somebody else, for a piece of content we own, has a unique need that will end up meaning they're going to pay more than it's worth to our asset. And they just -- they know we're going to keep it, nonetheless, even if somebody else thinks it's because they have a need, worth a lot more than it is to us, I don't think that makes sense. And I think it's important that -- what we're not going to do is sort of undersell the content. We have participants, we have people in it, it's important that our content gets full and fair value. And therefore, if somebody in the market sees more value in that content than we do, but it's because of a need or just because of a belief, then there are places where it make sense to take advantage of that.","Conversely, I think we hopefully have a breadth of assets that will increasingly let us take advantage of assets, I mean, an example, FIC. I mean, Fox International Channels, there are a number of places where we've taken series and bought out the international rights to shows we had. A unique need, we had a unique franchise in Fox International Channels to take a show like The Americans or -- I can't remember, they've done a couple. They bought the global right, global distribution rights to that and used it as a dimension. But it was really based on the Fox International Channels having unique strategic need and building -- and their ability to build the value that enabled them to make a bet.","But again, there'll be places where third parties will see a value that exceeds what it's worth to us. And again that's the right way to maximize the business. Again, we have the benefit of the visibility to make intelligent decisions, so we think it's worth making a bet. We obviously have the ability to see the picture holistically and make those bets intelligently. But I do think that you have to look at it from a holistically, as well as from each individual business' perspective.","Reed Nolte","Formula One.","Chase Carey","And then Formula One. Yes, Formula One's great rights. I mean, at the end of the day, they're buying I guess -- I don't know what's going on in Formula One. I read the same paper you do. Like rights, they're taking about buying sports. I mean, I guess to what degree you can buy sports to get to rights, I mean, I think if you're buying it, you have to buy because you like the sports -- you believe the sport's a good investment, not -- there are a lot of things that go into the sport. And that Formula One is certainly, TV rights are a big part of it, but there are other big elements on the revenue side. And obviously, it's a big business that requires [indiscernible] management. But I think, very good business.","But I think you'd go into it -- if it's for TV rights, I don't think you buy the assets to buy -- to get access to the TV rights. I think you buy it because you think it's good business. And I think TV rights we license in the marketplace. And we obviously have a good relationship with Formula One and hopefully continue to build it. But I think to the degree there's investment at Formula One, anybody making that, whether it's us or anybody else, you'd have to make it on the merits of what you think about Formula One and how good an investment it is and what's the future of that.","James Rupert Murdoch","And Rich, this is James here. I'd just remind everyone we are -- we're a broadcaster of Formula One in almost every region of the world. We are a very large part of Formula One's audience. And in many places, we have very long-term rights agreement to Formula One and it delivers very well for our customers. Irrespective of whatever speculation is out there in the market, we think that's been a relationship that's great for both sides and is going to continue.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Chase, I was wondering if you could give us a trajectory that kind of benchmark over the next 12 to 36 months for viewership and ratings levels you expect to achieve at FS1. I also wonder if you could also talk about how you see the business mix with respect to affiliate fees and advertising revenues shaking out when you get closer to maturity 3 or 4 years out when your new programming has sort of been on for a while, like MLB, when you have no more speed legacy deals in place. Basically at maturity, how do you see the revenue split between advertising and affiliate?","Chase Carey","Yes, I mean, first, I don't think we probably would get to that level of granularity year-by-year sort of rate increase that's probably at the level of detail beyond what we sort of put out there -- put out there publicly. I think if you look out over time, I think the mix of affiliate and ad revenues, I think, particularly on the sports side probably tilts to the affiliate side of it. I think that's the nature of sports today. The importance of that product is, again, I think everybody recognizes, it is the most important product. It is the most powerful product. The product that, again, not everybody, but certainly for a large segment of consumers, it is a must-have product for a large segment of consumers. And therefore, I think that's what leads for it to get reflected, its value to get reflected in the affiliation side of it.","The advertising is certainly important. The live nature of the sports, we said before, makes it uniquely valuable to advertisers. I mean, you look at the NFL this year, I think it's certainly probably a good and recent testament as you could find anywhere of how valuable sports is to advertisers. So I don't mean to -- certainly not trying to minimize the importance of the advertising side of it, but I think in general, in the sports arena, the affiliate side will be the larger piece of the pie vis-a-vis advertising.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is that kind of a 50-50 mix or like a 70-30 mix or -- I'm sorry, just taking one more pass at it.","Chase Carey","We're not going to get into that type of granularity. It's, again, the affiliate side is the bigger piece of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just sort of staying on that sports theme. We keep seeing more evidence of the rising competition for these sports rights and obviously the rising costs of these franchises. Due to the revenues generated, it sounds like from the affiliate fees more than the advertising, the growing CPMs and audiences, I guess, do they make up for the higher programming costs? You got such great perspective from your expansive franchise and obviously the Super Bowl. I'm curious about the cost equation, how that delta may be changing going forward? Is it maybe for the better or for the worse? Any color there would be great.","Chase Carey","I'm not sure -- I mean, I'm not sure how to answer that. I guess, look, I guess what I'd say is our sports businesses we feel great about. And obviously, we are dealing with these costs. When we do affiliate deals, they're multi-year deals. So it's actually, you get a pretty good road map for a fair bit of it if the affiliate's the larger piece and you get deals that go out years, those rights agreement layer against that. You have to make some assumptions of rating and ad dollars, but that's the smaller part of the top line. So I think we feel like it's pretty good visibility given, again, the nature of long-term distribution agreements aligned with long-term rights agreements and the ability to keep those 2 things get balanced to have a really healthy business for us. And certainly, to date, we've done it.","And yes, there's pressure on rights that, I guess, again, as I said before, it's a double-edged nature of sports. It's the most important programming out there, probably gets more important as -- everything else fragments. It sort of continues to, in many ways, stand taller. And so that's the positive, the realities is it comes at a cost. I think we proved -- I think we've got a pretty good track there, proven the ability to build it, digest those costs and build real value.","I think we are helped by the fact, I think, buyers that have scale in that arena are probably best positioned because I think breadth and depth, I mean, it's one thing to sort of have a one-off. But I think to the degree you've got a broad array of sports for us, regional, national, global, domestic, you sort of got something for everybody and I think that really helps and I think gives it a bit of a 1 plus 1 is 3. So I do think scale is going to become an increasingly important dynamic in the ability to get full value, to maximize value for the rights you've got.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One, again for sports rights. When you look at this latest sports rights that you have right now for FS1, do you feel like you have enough in terms of what you're trying to accomplish over the next 3 or 4 years on the affiliate growth side? Or the next big contract to come up would be the NBA. How do you look at potentially bidding for and making an investment in the NBA relative to what your revenue objectives are? Is it important -- is it as important to kind of, from a competitive perspective, can you break away from other networks as it is to bolster your own network? And then also on the affiliate side, the 5% acceleration that you saw domestically, how much of that came from having NHL back on the air this fall? And can you give us any insight to what you think that pace is going to look like in the new calendar year?","John P. Nallen","I'll cover the second one for you. Of the 15% domestic growth we had in the quarter, about 5% of it is the impact of the NHL and SportsTime Ohio. So the underlying growth is about 10%. And we've said that we expect the double-digit gains in affiliate fees in the year and we're comfortable with that.","Chase Carey","In terms of the rights we have, I mean, simple answer is yes. We actually have the rights in place we need to execute the plan we've got. That doesn't mean we won't engage on new rights and I think we always want to be opportunistic. And if there's a dimension of rights, we're not going to buy everything. So I think that we are going to be selective. But it doesn't mean that there won't be -- there aren't opportunities to add something that we think we can, in turn, down the road, create incremental value. But the rights we have today, and then we've got a broad set of rights related to baseball, NASCAR, college football and basketball, UFC, soccer, Champions League, World Cup, golf, we've got a broad mix of rights, broad mix of rights spread across the year.","We feel great about where we're at. So certainly, we have the rights in place to execute the plans we've got. So I think we certainly will look at incremental rights and make a determination. Are they rights we could take on and create incremental value on them, I mean. And if not, we feel very good about where we're at.","I'm sorry, in terms of key -- I wouldn't take rights to keep them away from others. I mean, I think you build -- you focus on building your own the business, not spending money to -- if we can't make -- I think our sports channel will be strong enough. We're comfortable that we can -- and we've got enough breadth across the company that we can execute on delivering the value through our sports channel. I wouldn't invest -- we wouldn't invest in further rights unless they make sense for us. We wouldn't invest for the purpose of being -- to block others.","Reed Nolte","At this point, we'd like to conclude today's call. Thank you everybody for joining. If you have any further questions, please call me or Joe Dorrego here in New York.","Chase Carey","Thanks a lot.","John P. Nallen","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's panel, I'd like to thank you once again for your participation, and thank you for using AT&T. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect."],"15746":["News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call February  8, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Florin - SVP and Head, IR","Robert Thomson - CEO","Susan Panuccio - CFO","Analysts","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Brian Han - Morningstar","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo","Operator","Good day and welcome to News Corp 2Q FY 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Media is invited on a listen-only basis.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Mike Florin","Thank you very much, Justin. Hello everyone and welcome to News Corp's fiscal second quarter 2018 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. The robust results for the first half of this fiscal year highlight the virtue of our strategy to become increasingly digital and global, the discipline of our financial management, and our commitment to premium content and to high quality, high integrity news.","Second quarter revenues grew 3% to $2.2 billion and reported total segment EBITDA was up 1% to $329 million. First half revenues were up 4% and reported segment EBITDA rose 27%.","Clearly, there are profound changes taking place in the creation and the distribution of digital content. The big tech disruptors are in the midst of a particularly disruptive period commercially, socially, and politically.","We appreciate that Google has ended the prejudicial First Click Free and that Facebook is prioritizing provenance, but these are modest steps towards changing a digital environment that is dysfunctional and sometimes dystopian.","With the support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the clear backing of the News Corp Board, our company has long been the strongest international advocate of necessary changes to this mephitic landscape.","It is certainly in the interests of our shareholders that there be a digital reorientation towards quality and integrity and that more people are encouraged to pay for professional journalism.","There is a social and commercial value to journalism, but that value needs to be valued by the digital publishing platforms. The bot-infested badlands are hardly a safe space for advertisers, whose brands are being tarnished by association with the extreme, the violent, and the repulsive.","Now, let's get into the details of this quarter's results. I'll start with Digital Real Estate Services, which once again reported a strong quarter with 21% revenue growth and 25% EBITDA growth, solidifying its role as a significant engine of expansion at News Corp.","At Move, home of Realtor.com, revenues rose by 18% and core real estate revenues expanded by a healthy 22%. Realtors' connections for buyers' products continues to thrive, with accelerated traffic growth as well as a continued boost in customer and lead volume in the second quarter.","There is an ongoing drive to increase the profile of Realtor.com as we have the highest consumer engagement and highest ROI for agents and brokers based on our latest records.","We're also making a concerted push in the New York market with an emphasis on having the most extensive listings and always enlightening editorial. The Realtor.com road map includes enhancements to our software and services products, which we believe provide best-in-class leads for brokers and the most comprehensive suite of essential tools.","Realtor.com will also continue to focus on driving engagement with My Home, which extends usage beyond search and discovery and allows owners to claim their home online and provides data that will be the basis of added value adjacencies.","REA maintains a healthy lead over its stumbling competitor in Australia's digital real estate market with 24% revenue growth year-over-year. Since the launch of home loans, which is part of the company's broader expansion into financial services, REA had over 150,000 self-completed financial profiles by the end of January. Traffic continued to expand this quarter with REA maintaining a sizable lead over the number two player in the market.","We saw yet another strong quarter in Book Publishing with solid EBITDA growth at HarperCollins. There were vigorous sales from our children's backlist and for Bad Dad by the multitalented David Walliams in the U.K. Meanwhile, the success of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman Cooks recipe book was yet another indicator of the power of America's heartland [ph] audience.","We're excited by the early success of A. J. Finn's debut novel, The Woman in the Window, which came out in January and the ongoing success of The Subtle Art of Not Giving an expletive.","We continue to look for ways to leverage our unique titles and creativity. As announced during this past quarter, Amazon plans to license The Lord of the Rings rights for the creation of an original television series, underscoring the great value of our backlist. As J. R. R. Tolkien himself wrote, \"Still round the corner there may wait a new road or secret gate.\"","The performance of the News and Information Services segment was relatively stable, with notable improvements in profit contribution from the U.K. and Australia. At Dow Jones, circulation revenue growth remained robust with a 10% increase year-over-year. We are nearing the short-term goal of 3 million total subscribers, with 2.8 million subscribers to Dow Jones consumer products in the quarter.","The Wall Street Journal experienced an approximate 12% increase in circulation revenues year-over-year. Meanwhile, our Professional Information business is muscular, powered by risk and compliance, which grew over 40% this quarter. Companies simply must invest in reducing risk and enhancing compliance, and Dow Jones has the necessary tools in both of these imperative areas.","At the New York Post, digital ad growth was a robust 35% and represented 60% of total ad revenues for the quarter. This quarter, we launched News IQ, our premium digital advertising platform, which has authenticated audiences and the highest quality journalism and content in the U.S. There's keen interest in leveraging our first-party data and brand enhancing environments, which are in stark contrast to the tainted placements on so many digital platforms.","The power of News IQ also comes from concentrated collaboration across many of our business units, which will intensify as we drive our advertising business in the U.S. and pursue longer term plans of global expansion.","At News UK, we saw modest ad growth for the first time since 2011, driven by emerging digital ad revenue growth at The Sun where there were over 90 million global average monthly uniques in the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to see improved engagement in the U.K. audience, highlighted by higher page views and minutes per session, according to comScore data.","The increasingly popular Sun Savers program, which grew to more than 490,000 registrations as of this week, is expected to generate higher levels of engagement. It is also allowing us to gather permissioned data on readers, traditionally difficult for a paper with strong newsstand sales. Meanwhile, The Times and Sunday Times continue to gain market share and digital subscribers grew 20% versus the prior year.","At Wireless Group, we saw improvement in revenues at its stations -- as its stations extended their reach and listening hours. Wireless is now home to two of the U.K.'s fastest growing stations, led by Virgin Radio, which grew its reach by over 60% year-over-year based on the latest independent data and talkSPORT 2, up about 40% in reach during the same period.","It is worth noting that Unruly had its best quarter ever in terms of total revenue, led by particularly buoyant growth in the U.S. As announced last week, the astute and acute Norm Johnson is assuming the CEO role at Unruly, and Co-Founder Sarah Wood will become chair of the Unruly Board and continue to exercise a positive influence.","News Corp Australia remained the largest print and digital publisher with an audience of approximately 16 million per month. We saw an acceleration in digital advertising revenue growth, reflecting several changes in the sales structure that better aligned our teams with the evolving need of advertisers.","And we remain focused on cost management initiatives to improve operating efficiency, resulting in higher contribution to profitability. Susan, who has just returned from Australia, will shortly elaborate on these positive developments. The Australian continued to grow digital subscribers, crossing the 100,000 mark for the first time. Significantly more than 50% of its paid weekday volume is now digital.","On the proposed combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports, we received both ACCC and FIRB approvals and are in the process of finalizing what is a complex arrangement with Telstra. That focus has given us an opportunity to begin the reshaping of the two companies, and the first step was the appointment of a new Foxtel CEO, the excellent Patrick Delaney. We would like to thank his predecessor, Peter Tonagh, for his sterling contribution during a transitional period and to News Corp over many years.","Once again, this strong quarter showcased the benefits of News Corp's digital strategy, the value of being disciplined on cost and the efficacy of ever-increasing cooperation among our companies.","Before I turn the platform over to Susan to expand on our results, one final word about taxes. Passage of tax reform in the United States should be beneficial to our company and our people, our investors, and our customers.","At the founding of the new News, we had strong confidence in the potential for U.S. growth. We have invested significantly in U.S. Digital Real Estate and U.S. Book Publishing, for example, and expect to reap even greater rewards, thanks to the tax reform program, which will make the country a better place to do business and creates more opportunities for all Americans.","And now over to Susan.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials, we delivered another quarter of strong operating results. Fiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues were around $2.2 billion, an increase of $64 million or 3% compared to the prior year, led by our Digital Real Estate Services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $329 million, up from $325 million in the prior year.","For the quarter, earnings per share were a loss of $0.14 compared to a loss of $0.50 in the prior year. This quarter's results include a charge related to the remission of deferred tax asset due to the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate. I'll discuss in a few moments the expected impact from the U.S. tax reform going forward.","You may recall the prior year period included a pretax non-cash impairment charge of $310 million related to The Australian publishing division fixed assets and a $227 million pretax non-cash write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes both items and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, were $0.24 compared to $0.19 in the prior year.","Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, relatively flat with the prior year. The acquisition of Australian Regional Media or ARM and foreign exchange contributed $30 million and $33 million, respectively, this quarter.","Within segment revenues, advertising was down 6% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 6%. Within our core news businesses, Dow Jones revenues rose 1%, News U.K. grew by 7%, and News Australia grew by 4%. These increases were offset by a 16% decline at News America Marketing as we flagged during the last earnings call. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow.","Segment EBITDA this quarter was $140 million, down $2 million versus the prior year as year-over-year improvements at News U.K. and News Australia were more than offset by weaknesses at News America Marketing and higher marketing costs at Dow Jones.","A few highlights to mention from the segment. We saw digital subscription growth across our News businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, benefiting from 29 percentage points growth in WSJ digital-only subscribers and higher subscription ARPU.","Digital now accounts for over 50% of Dow Jones circulation revenue. We also saw strong digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 20% from Q2 2017 and at News Australia up 26%, including a contribution from ARM.","At Dow Jones, we are also building on the renewed momentum at our Professional Information business, which posted eight percentage points revenue growth, thanks to the continued strong performance from risk and compliance as Robert mentioned. We posted the highest revenue levels since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.","Advertising continues to be mixed across the respective divisions. Within the businesses, we saw advertising growth in the U.K. of 9% or 2% in local currency, the first increase in 27 quarters, driven by digital advertising growth from The Sun with a global audience that reached over 90 million monthly unique users in the second quarter as well as moderating print advertising decline.","While at News Australia, advertising revenues improved three percentage points, but still had an overall decline of 10% versus the prior year after excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions and divestitures, which was consistent with the previous quarter. And at Dow Jones, advertising was down mid-teens, a slight acceleration on the trend from the first quarter.","The closure of The Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million or four percentage points for the quarter. International expansion continues to be a strategic focus for Dow Jones. And despite the print closure, our total Wall Street Journal international subscriber base still grew 28% versus the prior year.","We continue to push very hard on our cost transformation program, notably in Australia with savings expected to be well ahead of the AUD40 million realized last year. The program extends across every area from overheads to advertising sales consolidation to newsprint and production and photography. This quarter, as Robert mentioned, News Australia's profitability improved and increased its contribution to segment EBITDA.","With the integration of ARM, we continue to actively look at optimizing the broader Australian portfolio with a focus on profitable growth. We had a similar story in the U.K. which also drove higher profitability this quarter.","Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues were impacted by ongoing weakness in free standing insert revenues, which had two fewer inserts versus the prior year and lower custom publishing as well as slightly lower revenues from in-store products, impacted by fewer new consumer product launches this year. Part of the decline was timing-related, and we should see a sequential improvement this coming quarter.","Turning to our Book Publishing segment, we posted a solid quarter despite facing a difficult prior year comparable quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 1% to $469 million and segment EBITDA increased 7% to $80 million.","Titles to highlight this quarter included Bad Dad by David Walliams in the U.K. and Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It! by Ree Drummond as well as strong performances from the children's backlist, including The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas and a few titles from Shel Silverstein, including The Giving Tree.","Christian Publishing revenues were lower than the prior year due to the absence of sales from the release of The Magnolia Story, which was amongst our most successful titles last year. Prior year revenues also benefited from Settle for More and Hillbilly Elegy.","Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 53% of revenues in the quarter, up from 49% last year. Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 2% and represented 16% of consumer revenue, in line with the prior year due to the strength in downloadable audiobooks.","In the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 21% to $292 million. Reported segment EBITDA was $119 million versus $95 million last year, up 25%.","REA Group revenues grew 24% due to very strong residential debt revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premiere All, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and modest benefit from currency.","In Australia, while total residential listings were marginally lower, listings grew in the key markets of Melbourne and Sydney. The results were also impacted by the sale of the European business last year. Please refer to REA's earnings release in their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.","Move revenues rose 18% to $110 million versus the prior year, driven by a very strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from strong lead growth -- from strong growth in lead volume as well as improving pricing optimization and inventory management.","The prior year included $2 million related to TigerLead, which was divested in November 2016. Average monthly unique users at Realtor.com were over 50 million for the quarter, rising mid-teens compared to the prior year.","In Cable Network Programming, revenues increased $16 million or 15% to $120 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the inclusion of Sky News, which added approximately $8 million to revenues and higher affiliate fees from Foxtel.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell to $33 million from $51 million, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization related to the NRL contract, which led to approximately $22 million of higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million related to the proposed combination of Foxtel-Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA.","With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses were $18 million this quarter compared to losses of $238 million last year, which included the write-down related to the adjustment of the carrying value of the company's investment in Foxtel.","Foxtel revenues for the second quarter declined 1% to $598 million and EBITDA decreased 19% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $23 million, primarily related to The Australian Football League rights, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs.","On operating metrics, Foxtel's total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of December 31st, 2017, which was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the shutdown of Presto.","In the second quarter, cable and satellite churn was 14.5%, down from 15.6% and broadcast ARPU was down 2%.","Regarding the pending transaction with Fox Sports, we were pleased with The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's and The Foreign Investment Review Board's decisions to approve the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company.","As Robert has mentioned, commercial negotiations with Telstra are ongoing, and the transaction remains on track to close, subject to Board approval in the first half of calendar 2018.","On the impact for the company from the recently approved U.S. tax reform package, I would like to make a few points. The $174 million charge in this quarter primarily reflects the remeasurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower statutory federal rate of 21% from 35%.","As we are on a June 30th fiscal year end, the impact of the lower corporate tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 28% for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 and a 21% U.S. statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. Our effective tax rate should be modestly higher, given our significant business operations in Australia where the corporate tax rate remains at 30%.","Looking forward to the third quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. At News and Information Services, at this point, advertising trends appear broadly in line with the second quarter, but visibility remains limited.","At Fox Sports Australia, we expect to face higher costs in the third quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year, similar to the impact in the second quarter.","We expect approximately AUD30 million in higher costs for the third quarter compared to the prior year, with the full year costs expected to increase by AUD30 million to AUD40 million as previously mentioned.","In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable. As Robert mentioned, we're very excited about A. J. Finn's The Woman in The Window, which is off to a great start. This quarter, we also have the release of Amy Krouse Rosenthal and her daughter, Paris Rosenthal's Dear Girl, another bestseller in its early weeks.","At Digital Real Estate Services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, including incremental revenues from the expansion into the mortgage brokerage business. However, as noted in its ASX announcement, REA expects to see higher cost growth in the third quarter and listings will be impacted by the timing of Easter, which will fall in the third quarter. We also expect to see higher investment spending at Move to support new products and to drive higher engagement.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question today comes from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi Robert, hi Susan. My question is around Foxtel and Fox Sports. And I just wanted to get your perspective on the combined entities appetite to bid for cricket rights in Australia, given they're coming up for tender very shortly. And is there any change in strategy for the entity under Patrick Delaney as CEO which, Robert, you've obviously spoken about?","Robert Thomson","Entcho thanks. For those of you who are not familiar with sport in Australia, cricket is, for many people, an interesting game. It's complicated. It has various forms, the five-day tests, one-days, Big Bash, 20-over games. And clearly, it's a part of the Australian summer and Australian viewing in the summer that we're interested in, but it will be fascinating over coming weeks to track the negotiations for cricket rights, but it's pretty fair to say that we aren't going to pay ridiculous prices for any rights anywhere in the world.","But what we do have for any sport is the best possible platform for engagement, both through broadcast and digital. And also, we have, as you just mentioned, Patrick Delaney, who has a background in Foxtel, did a marvelous job at Fox Sports and is now overseeing Foxtel, and he'll be very much involved in guiding us on what's the appropriate course of action with cricket.","And, no doubt, focusing in particular on the upcoming selling season for the winter sports, which is the most crucial sales period for us and Foxtel and, frankly, Fox Sports in the year because we have, in the autumn, the launch of the IFL season Aussie Rules and NRL, which is Rugby League, the two most watched sports in Australia.","Mike Florin","Thank you, Entcho. Justin we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. That question will come from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just what's the updated thoughts of you whether -- you have upwards of $2 billion of cash on your balance sheet. Just investors are always wondering what the plan is for that, please. Thanks.","Susan Panuccio","Hi Craig, Susan here. I think it's a good question and we've talked about this before. We continue to remain focused on investment with that cash and we would continue to look at opportunities that may arise. But we do remain flexible to having a look at any option that retains value for our shareholders.","Craig Huber","Thank you.","Mike Florin","And thank you, Craig. Justin we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Certainly. That question will come from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Thank you. In the News and Information segment, how much in cost reduction was banked in the second quarter results? And also how thick do you think the [Indiscernible] is there before it starts to impact on your product quality?","Susan Panuccio","So, I think the actual -- when you look at the numbers, it looks like the costs are relatively flat, but if you exclude M&A and currency, the costs are actually down 5% quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. So, I think we remain very pleased with the cost reduction work that those businesses are doing, particularly in Australia and across the U.K.","As far as focusing on whether it impacts on our product, we continue to look at back office, overheads, corporate functions. We look at platform consolidation, production and manufacturing, which we constantly can continue to find cost savings with as the businesses rationalize.","So, I think we remain very comfortable that we're getting the balance right between cost reduction and reinvestment in our digital properties and, in fact, our print properties going forward.","Mike Florin","Thank you, Brian. Justin we'll take our next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our next question will come from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","Thank you. You guys are seeing some nice growth in circulation and subscription revenue. But how should we think about the impact on advertising as more people migrate to digital? I assume that there's a different sort of economics around digital advertising versus print. So, any color would be helpful there. Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Well, we're still in the midst of obviously a transition from print. Print, which remains a strong platform, and we're seeing that with a new real estate magazine that we're launching in coming months, which is oversubscribed by advertisers. So, don't discount print.","But the digital market itself really is in the midst of our people where you have both advertisers and ad agencies reviewing their role in the market. A great deal of concern about the sort of environments in which famous prestigious advertisers find themselves.","And I think what we are gradually going to see, and I think we have little doubt about this, is that there will be a migration to premium and that's where we have a comparative advantage because titles around the world are the leading titles in their markets.","And to supplement that, we are creating News IQ, which is our own in-house based advertising platform, taking advantage of the great inventory we have and the authenticated audiences we have and being able to offer advertisers an opportunity to project their image and their wares in a space that won't be detrimental to their image, but brand enhancing.","Mike Florin","Thank you, Eric. Justin, we'll take our next question.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Florin","Great. Thank you, Justin and thank you for all participating. Have a great day.","Operator","Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation today."],"15752":["News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q4 2019 Results Conference Call August  8, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Mike Florin \u2013 Senior Vice President and Head-Investor Relations","Robert Thomson \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Susan Panuccio \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Entcho Raykovski \u2013 Credit Suisse","Kane Hannan \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners","Brian Han \u2013 Morningstar","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the News Corp Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Media is invited on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin. Please go ahead sir.","Mike Florin","Thank you very much, Karina. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer.","We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Mike. News Corp completed fiscal year 2019 in a strong position with revenues increasing 12% and profitability rising 16% against the prior year, reflecting not only the consolidation of Foxtel, but also the continued strength and development of core segments of the company, including Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, and substantial progress in the digital transformation of our News and Information Services businesses. The concerted focus on our primary revenue drivers, including the creation and distribution of premium content, was reflected in audience growth across News Corp's milestones and digital properties. We are also acutely focused on simplifying the structure of the company and making clear the full value of the sum of our parts.","To that end, we recently announced a strategic review of News America Marketing, including a potential sale of the business. We have received material interest and the process is progressing rather well. There is clearly a fundamental shift under way in the content landscape. And one consequence, other than intensifying regulatory scrutiny of big digital, is a gradual transference of value to content creators, who over the past decade have lost influence in revenue to their digital distributors with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s encouragement.","News Corp has been advocating vigorously on behalf of journalists, journalism and the protection of intellectual property and that intense, sometimes solidarities advocacy, has begun to pay dividends for journalism and importantly for our shareholders. We are still at a relatively early stage of this tectonic transformation, but there will surely be an ongoing transfer of value to creators in coming years, which should be a great benefit to News Corp and its investors. We have begun partnering with companies such as Apple and Twitter, which recognize the value of our content. And discussions are under way with other digital companies, though I am not at liberty at this moment to provide more detail.","What I can say is that the terms of trade and the tenor of our talks are now vastly different to even a year ago. In fiscal 2019, the News and Information Services segment posted higher profitability, which was spurred by the rapid rise of digital paid subscribers. The Wall Street Journal, the Times and Sunday Times and The Australian all grew subscriber volumes at a healthy rate with digital now accounting for the majority of their subscribers. There is an emerging subscription sensibility among consumers, which is obviously to our benefit, but we are also conscious of the need to provide ever better service to those subscribers, who rightly have high expectations for their digital experience.","Dow Jones is a media business that we believe had a distinctive ability to prosper in the digital age. The Wall Street Journal recorded 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers, who now account for over 69% of the total subscriber base of 2.6 million. Circulation revenue trends at Dow Jones remained robust, rising 7% for the year, well above the rates of the New York Times and others in the industry. Since separation in 2013, Dow Jones' consumer circulation revenues have grown more than 40%.","And within that category, digital revenues at the Wall Street Journal had expanded by almost 150%. Advertising trends improved in Q4 for The Wall Street Journal. And in July, both print and digital advertising revenue were higher than a year earlier. As we look to the future, we believe that Dow Jones could attract a significantly larger subscription base by directions, subscriptions and through content partnerships.","We have particular optimism about the international potential of Dow Jones given the relatively low non-U.S. share, 12% of subscribers today. We are also seeing the increasing ability of the Dow Jones team, deploying customized artificial intelligence to sell special Financial News and data products to professional and wealthy individual subscribers. The Dow Jones professional information business posted revenue growth for the second consecutive year after a period of transition, overcoming currency headwinds.","An important driver of that growth has been the Risk and Compliance business, which grew 24% for the full fiscal year to exceed $130 million of revenues at attractive margins. Impressively, that business has more than quadrupled in size since its separation six years ago. Obviously, companies around the world are focused on maximizing compliance and minimizing risk. So we are confident that there will be continuing growth in that sector.","In addition, Dow Jones will pass news coverage, and analysis is now aggregated on the Bloomberg terminal, significantly extending the reach and impact of Dow Jones' trusted high-quality journalism and analysis and enabling us to inform a larger total audience. Over the past fiscal year, along with other new partnership arrangements Dow Jones Newswires is now available on more than 300,000 additional terminals. These partnerships make our newswires the most widely available professional newswire services in the world. In the UK, in constant currency, The Times of London grew print advertising revenues for the second consecutive year.","Digital paid subscriptions at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 304,000, while regulatory approval was received this month for the sharing of resources by The Times and Sunday Times. Clearly, the change should result in operation efficiencies while we will be assiduous in protecting the unique identity of each of those iconic mastheads.","Wireless Group posted its highest ratings ever in the April to June period. Chris Evans, the legendary radio broadcaster who joined Wireless Group's Virgin Radio last year, reached 1.1 million listeners a week across the UK during that period. In fact, Virgin Radio continues to be the fastest growing station in the UK, both in reach and listening hours. Meanwhile, Fox Sports hold record audience speakers with 3.3 million weekly listeners across the network in the quarter.","Under Rebekah Brook's expert leadership, we are ensuring that the peerless broadcast skills of Wireless are being deployed to improve the quality of the audio products elsewhere in the UK to take advantage of rapidly increasing podcast amount.","In Australia, our focus on growth paid off through an improvement in profitability for the year, driven in part by an increase in digital subscriptions, which now exceed 517,000, up 24% year-on-year with The Australian, a notably strong performer. At the same time, news.com.au has remained the number one website for 20 consecutive months, well ahead of its rivals with its monthly unique visitor number topping 10 million and total visitors at over 91 million in June. News Australia is also benefiting from the acceleration in digital advertising, including expansion of News Xtend, the small to medium business solution and from its cost reduction efforts.","We are confident that Michael Miller and his talented team are well-positioned to extend their operational success into fiscal 2020. At the New York Post, the cover price was doubled to $2 in metropolitan markets, the first increase in seven years and one reason for improved financial results at The Post. And The Post digital network continues to be strong with audience numbers averaging more than 101 million unique users per month in the quarter, according to Google Analytics.","In the Subscription Video Services segment, the combination of Foxtel and FOX SPORTS was completed in April 2018. And throughout fiscal 2019, the new business has been focused on delivering premium content and experiences to customers and rapidly expanding our streaming services, which have grown markedly over the past year. Foxtel is underpinned by a large and loyal broadcast subscriber base and unique content across sports, entertainment, documentaries and news. As of the end of the fiscal year, Foxtel's total paid subscribers grew to over 3.1 million, led by the success of our new sports streaming product, Kayo, and continued expansion of Foxtel Now, where the number of its subscribers increased by 36% from the prior year to 446,000 at year end.","Kayo, which is launched in November 2018, showed a material acceleration in subscriber additions into the year end with over 330,000 paid subscribers as of June 30, a doubling since last quarter. Worth noting is Kayo's high level of audience engagement with 90% of subscribers using it each week, watching an average of 8.5 hours of sports content across an average of six different sports. In total, our streaming base in Australia has nearly doubled since calendar year end to approximately 777,000. It is notable that the growth in Kayo subscribers between the third and fourth quarter has actually been accompanied by a decline in average churn among sports tier subscribers to Foxtel broadcast over the same period.","We announced in July the integration of Netflix into Foxtel's iQ3 and iQ4 set-top boxes which, along with a new user interface, creates a unified content discovery experience for our customers and strengthens our position in the market as the preeminent creator and aggregator of the broadest range of programming.","At the same time, the consolidation of Foxtel and Fox Sports has obviously provided an opportunity to review our cost base without undermining the quality of service or programming. At Digital Real Estate Services, despite housing market headwinds, both REA and realtor.com strengthened their competitive position by continuing to innovate and expand audience.","Signs of improvement in the U.S. housing market are emerging with realtor.com traffic at record levels. Interest rates declining, buyer lead volumes on the rise and pending home sales rising 2.8% in June. Last November, Tracey Fellows was promoted to President of Global Digital Real Estate, underscoring our Company\u2019s increasing commitment to the sector, which has been an engine of growth since we separated in 2013. In fact, over that period, segment revenues have tripled through a combination of rapid growth in REA in Australia and acquisitions in the U.S. and Asia.","We are in the process of a major transformation of realtor.com, underscored by the recent acquisition of Opcity and guided by our goal of providing consumers with a superior home buying and selling experience. While that acquisition and the migration towards a performance-based model naturally had an impact in revenues and investment last year, it represents a commitment to future growth by increasing the quality of connections between consumers and real estate professionals and heightening our potential to maximize the value of those interactions.","We believe our focus on quality connections also increases our ability to generate additional revenue across the home buying and selling experience, from mortgage origination to the inevitable spending done by every family during the profoundly important process of moving home.","REA Group continued to significantly outperform the competition despite the soft listing environment in the second half of the year. For the year, REA extended its lead over, domain generating nearly 3 times as many total visits. The company is continuing to create products that provide genuine value for ambitious agents. A federal election in May in Australia obviously contributed to economic uncertainty, but the political situation has clearly stabilized and the government is taking measures that should stimulate the housing market.","We also made good progress in Asia through iProperty with healthy revenue growth despite fluctuating economic and political conditions. In Book Publishing, HarperCollins slide this year with new releases and a strong backlist, filling a 6% increase in EBITDA despite a tough comparison with 2018. We should benefited from a onetime lucrative licensing contract for J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings.","As Tolkien himself wrote, all\u2019s well that ends better. That is certainly true of the downloadable audiobooks, for which revenues rose 40% for the year. There is patently a fundamental shift in listening habits under way, and we expect double-digit growth to continue in the current year. Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team are finding new ways to make the most of our content and enhance the profile of our orders.","We have just announced a partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment in Hollywood and Elizabeth Gabler and her former Fox 2000 team to develop programming and films from the remarkable HarperCollins catalog. We have also announced an agreement through our Harlequin imprint with Bell Media in Canada to produce movies from Harlequin\u2019s extensive library of more than 30,000 titles. The most successful book of the year was a standout hits from our Christian division by best-selling author, Rachel Hollis, who is debut and follow-up books: Girl, Wash Your Face; and Girl, Stop Apologizing, together shipped more than 5 million units during the year.","We also saw great success with David Williams, including Ice Monster and World\u2019s Worst Teachers; and Mark Manson had continuing success with his sequel to The Subtle Art of Not Giving an Expletive, with Everything is Expletive.","With that book title, I will hand the call over to Susan for an unvarnished account of our fourth quarter and full year 2019.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Before I review this year\u2019s end quarter financial results, I wanted to highlight five themes from this past fiscal year where we\u2019ve made significant progress. Firstly, we\u2019re making notable progress in stabilizing the News and Information Services segment and entered our fiscal year on a positive note. Our digital paid subscriber base continues to grow while we continue to focus on streamlining our critical space and investing in new revenue streams.","Importantly, the segment posted a higher profitability this year with improvement across our key news publishing business units. The first time we\u2019ve seen this improvement since the Company\u2019s separated. We will remain focused on these areas in the coming year, and we are optimistic we can build on the current use of this. Secondly, the team at Foxtel have made steady progress on its over-the-top offering, including a successful launch of Kayo in November and further improvement to its premium broadcast product. Foxtel returned to volume growth, ending the year at the highest closing paid subscriber base since separation.","And now with the core platforms in hub, they are focused on improving a path to revenue and profit growth. The performance in our Book Publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content and the advantage of a global distribution network, posting record profitability even when facing a very challenging prior year comparable. Given the rapid rise of downloadable audiobooks and the explosion in demand for premium content globally, we continue to explore ways that HarperCollins can see the leverage its highly valued content into other media. As Robert mentioned, recent examples of these efforts are our announced partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment and also with media in Canada our Harlequin division.","These are deals with minimum capital outlay which have the potential to monetize content more broadly. Our businesses in the Digital Real Estate Services segment made strategic acquisitions, expanded their product offering and continue to capture audience share amid a challenging global healthy market. We feel positive about our pace of innovation and investment and believe this segment is well-positioned going into fiscal 2020. And finally, we continue to actively look at our portfolio. In June, we announced that News America Marketing is undergoing a strategic review, including actively exploring sale, and that process is ongoing.","With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results. For the full-year fiscal 2019, total revenues were $10.1 billion, a 12% increase compared to the prior year. Reported results for fiscal 2019 include the consolidation of Foxtel.","On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, significant currency headwinds and other items as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 1%. Total segment EBITDA for the year was $1.24 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year, a 16% increase over the prior-year period. Adjusted total segment EBITDA for the year rose 4%. Full-year dilution in earnings per share were $0.26 compared to a loss of $2.60 in the prior year, primarily driven by the absence of the non-cash impairment charges and writedowns of $1.2 billion recognized in fiscal 2018.","Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $0.46 versus $0.44 in the prior year. Free cash flow available to the company for the year were $213 million, which included a step up in capital expenditures related to the consolidation of Foxtel.","And now to the quarterly financial detail. We reported fiscal 2019 fourth quarter total revenues of approximately $2.5 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, due in part to the $105 million impact from continued currency headwind.","Adjusted revenues declined 5%. Total segment EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million compared to $314 million in the prior year, down 14%. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 8%. For the quarter, loss per share was $0.09 compared to a loss of $0.64 a year ago with the improvement mainly due to the absence of the write-off of the FOX SPORTS Australia channel distribution agreement last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.07 compared to $0.08 in the prior year.","Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.2 billion, down approximately 5% versus the prior year. Currency had a $40 million or 3% negative impact and was responsible for the majority of the decline. Digital revenues to Dow Jones and the newspaper markets represented 37% of combined revenue, approximately 33% of the segments revenue were digital, up from 30% in the prior year.","Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year with approximately $18 million or 2% due to negative currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues were flat versus the prior year despite $17 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $108 million, up 14% over the prior year and a very strong improvement from the last two quarters, primarily driven by News America Marketing, but also benefiting positive contribution from Dow Jones and News UK.","I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, the consumer circulation revenues in the fourth quarter remained robust, growing 7% for the fourth consecutive quarter, benefiting from 14% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to over 1.8 million as well a subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for over 69% of total subscriber of The Wall Street Journal, which is up from over 64% last year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Financial News in the UK, reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record level.","Of that, the digital-only subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to 2.2 million subscribers. Over the same period, Barron\u2019s expanded its total subscriber base to 579,000, a 16% year-over-year increase. Within the professional information business, Risk and Compliance grew 23% in the quarter compared to the prior year and as expected, exceeded $139 million in revenues this year. We continue to expect significant growth ahead as we expand our product range.","Overall, our professional information business grew 2% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarters was flat, a notable improvement from last quarter led by an improvement in digital advertising as we had anticipated. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for 40% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 39% last year. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were overall relatively stable with last quarter.","Advertising revenues at News Australia and News UK declined 8% and 7%, respectively, yet both were down only 1% in local currency compared to the prior year, benefiting from higher digital advertising revenues. Pleasingly, The Times in the UK grew fleet advertising revenue in local currency for the seventh consecutive quarter.","On circulation, our digital subscribers around the globe are growing at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% to 304,000 at The Times and the Sunday Times. And they also have approximately 5 million registered users, which is both a source of subscriber acquisitions and an advertising opportunity as we continue to leverage our increasing audience scale. At News Australia, paid digital subscribers rose over 24% year-over-year to more than 517,000, which include 146,000 digital and bundled subscribed at The Australian.","The increase in digital subscription along with cover price increases at News U.K. and News Australia allowed both markets to mitigate print volume decline and currency headwind. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 6% driven by continued weakness in free-standing insert products but partially offset by in-store product growth. Cost initiatives help NAM contribute high profitability in the quarter.","Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter was $536 million, down the 12% versus $610 million a year ago, of which $44 million or 7% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Foxtel Now and Kayo.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $85 million, down 12% with the prior year. From the fourth quarter, we are now comparing like-for-like as we completed the Foxtel consolidation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Turning to the KPIs, Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base rose to over 3.1 million as of June 30, with volume growing 12% versus the prior year.","Growth was driven by Kayo, strong adoption of Foxtel Now and the inclusion of commercial subscribers at Foxtel Australia. Of that subscriber base, approximately 2.4 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers and remain consistent of Kayo and Foxtel Now subscription. We are making steady progress in our OTT strategy, with Kayo claiming subscribers at 331,000 as of June 30, up by over 120,000 since our last update on May 8 and more than doubled since the third quarter, driven by the Cricket World Cup and the expansion of our distribution channel. Including trials, the total paid subscriber base reached approximately 382,000.","Pleasingly thus far, Kayo is not forming a material chain in Foxtel broadcast customer base with an estimated 5% of Foxtel disconnection since Kayo's launch being driven by customers moving to Kayo. Foxtel Now also performed strongly with total paying subscribers reaching over 446,000 as of June 30, up 36% from last year. While this is down from the May 8 update to due to the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, Foxtel has been focused on retention, and overall, the product has exceeded our expectations. In the aggregate, Foxtel had a strong and growing base of OTT subscribers, which in total reached 842,000 subscribers at June 30, of which approximately 777,000 were paying subscribers, accounting for 25% of Foxtel's total paying subscriber base and is reflective of Foxtel strategy to monetize existing rights of a multiple platform.","In the fourth quarter, broadcast churn was 14.7% versus 12.5% in the prior year, reflective of a 300 basis points improvement from the third quarter. The outcome in the fourth quarter reflects early successes from leveraging data and analytics to reduce churn despite the price increases. In addition, the team is focused on stabilizing broadcast ARPU, which is more than AUD78 in the fourth quarter, down 1% versus last year.","Capital expenditures related to Foxtel were approximately $300 million for fiscal 2019 which is lower than what we had anticipated, and we expect sizable declines in fiscal 2020. Approximately 65% of the CapEx was subscriber related. Finally, we issued Foxtel AUD200 million shareholder vote in May at a variable rate of approximately 9% as we continue to work with banks on refinancing upcoming maturity. At Book Publishing, as expected, we faced an unusually strong prior year comparison with the prior year including a one-time revenue contribution of $28 million for the Tolkien sublicense to Amazon and the release of Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines.","Revenues for the quarter decreased 14% to $419 million due to the fact that I just noted as well as approximately $18 million of negative impact from the new revenue recognition standard.","Segment EBITDA fell to $44 million from $72 million, with the biggest factor impacting profitability being the absence of the Tolkien deal from the prior year. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter results, HarperCollins have had a very strong year and outperformed our expectations. HarperCollins posted high digital revenues for the quarter and a fiscal year lead by the continued expansion of downloadable audio, which accounts for approximately 1\/3 of digital sales today. They will also move to fairly capitalize our momentum and the depth of their backlist to generate longer-term incremental revenues as they have done via the new deals with Sony and Bell Media.","At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 5% to $283 million, primarily related to currency headwinds of $13 million. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. REA Group\u2019s revenues were down 6% and up 1% in local currency as higher yield and increased debt penetration was offset by an overall 19% year-over-year decline in the existing volume during the quarter, which was notably weaker than the third quarter and full year rate of 9% and 8% declines respectively. Please refer to REA's earnings release and the conference call following this call for additional detail and comments on the outlook.","News revenues rose 3% to $123 million versus the prior year with real estate revenues growing 8%. The increase in real estate revenues, which represents 77% of total revenue, reflect higher yield per lease, a slight improvement in buyer lead volume and the acquisition of Opcity. While lead volumes remain subdued, the business did see an improvement in run rates in June, which should build momentum to this coming fiscal year. As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing of performance-based early model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact on scalability of this platform.","Early results have been promising, with improvements in engagement and leasing rates, which we expect to drive higher conversion rates. During fiscal 2020, we will continue to allocate lead flow to Opcity, although we expect that in most markets, we will be offering both our existing connection SaaS products along with the Opcity concierge model. We have, as mentioned last quarter, began to reallocate resources within the realtor.com team to better position and streamline the business to this year and beyond. On audience, we saw an acceleration versus the third quarter growth rate and average monthly unique users at realtor.com to a record 72 million for the quarter, rising 14% versus the prior year together with notable pickup in engagement.","Segment EBITDA fell 15% to $84 million similar to the third quarter rate. The decline was driven by higher investment in Opcity and the $5 million negative impact from currency. On an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA decreased 7%.","I would now like to mention a few things to the fiscal 2020 here.","At News and Information Services, while advertising visibility remains limited, the revenue mix is becoming less dependent on print, and we are encouraged by the pace of global uptake of paid digital subscribers. In fact, excluding NAM, the majority of segment's revenue will be circulation and subscription revenues. So far, the advertising trends are similar to slightly better in the current quarter, and we continue to remain digital while reinvesting in our digital offerings.","Overall, our expectation is a show further stability in this segment and it is pleasing that we finish the year with some strength. We do note the first quarter will face a challenging comparisons due to the $48 million benefit in the prior year related to News U.K.'s exit of the gaining partnership with Tabcorp.","In Subscription Video Services, overall cost increases should be modest in fiscal 2020 absent currency fluctuation. We will have one additional quarter of domestic Cricket rights approximately $20 million before locking the rights and some additional OTT expenses as we drive further penetration.","This will be in conjunction with our continued efforts to seek cost efficiencies. We also expect a non cash impact of approximately $30 million to $35 million in fiscal 2020 related to a change in amortization methodologies the sports and entertainment programming. We expect CapEx in the Foxtel to decline by approximately 20% compared to fiscal 2019 and overall expect higher cash generation from the business.","In Book Publishing, we will face tougher comparison to the fiscal year given the outperformance in fiscal 2019. However, we are confident with our slice of tussle, which will be headlined a new releases from Regent Raymond, Ajay Sims, Daniel Silver and David Dwellings in the UK among others, along with expected continued growth in downloadable audiobooks.","Fiscal third quarter releases include Daniel Silva's The New Girl and Ann Patchett\u2019s The Dutch House as well as the tie-in edition of Garth Stein's The Art of Racing in the Rain, which will hit the movie theaters this weekend. At Digital Real Estate Services, despite a challenging housing market in Australia, REA should benefit from higher debt penetration and higher pricing.","Please refer to REA's call for a more detailed outlook. At realtor's fiscal 2020, we anticipate both higher revenue and higher profit contribution by further expanding the Opcity concierge model, returning the non-listing base advertising back to growth and leveraging the recent cost initiatives.","With that, let me hand it over to your operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] And we'll take our first question from Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. A couple of brief questions for me. First one is around costs within news and insight services. So in the quarter, you had the same market, pretty good cost performance given that the EBITDA grow on revenues. Can you talk to the extent to which that was cost reductions within News America Marketing as opposed to the other segment within news and insight services? I'm just interested particularly in extent to which of those cost reductions can continue into FY 2020. And then on News America Marketing, you've given us a brief update on the sale process. Can you give us an indication of likely timing that you're looking at? And are you looking at mainly tied to financial bias?","Susan Panuccio","Hi, Entcho, it\u2019s Susan here. Maybe I'll take the first question and hand over to Robert for the second question. Just in relation to the cost, they declined 7%, but down 4% on an adjusted basis. So cost distribution, Dow Jones cost are up but we would expect that to be up given the subscriber growth and the investments that we have in the PIB business in Risk and Compliance.","Across the other businesses in the UK and Australia posted decline, and within them clearly cost declined by around 12% year-on-year. We are expecting to see cost continue to increase across the UK and Australia. We have been quite vocal about that over the past couple of years. The teams across the UK and Australia are very focused on cost reduction and continue to look at ways that they can innovate and drive costs, particularly out of the back office and some of the distribution chain. And we would also expect to see Dow Jones investing in that business going forward. But I would say that overall, we do balance the cost reductions with investment even within the UK and Australia because it's important that we can support that digital growth coming through in the businesses.","Robert Thomson","Entcho, obviously at this moment it is a little difficult to be absently specific about the identity of the bidders other than to say there's quite a few. But more broadly, we understand when it comes to the new score, that this is complex, it's not properly valued. And so we have begun a process of simplification that will be ongoing. The first, most tangible sign of that is the sale process at NAM.","That company itself would change characters over the past few years and become more value because there was in-store and digital growth and a little less relevant into News Corp's core business. So it made sense to do that strategic review and that is materially interesting becoming.","Mike Florin","Thank you. And so Karina will take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next hear from Kane Hannan with global \u2013 I'm sorry, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Kane Hannan","Good morning, guys. Just on the Foxtel OTT strategy, I think in the past, you've said you would only launch an entertainment SVOD if you're happy with Kayo's performance. But first, just given that growth you reported in the quarter, can you give us a bit of an update on around your plans if they exist for an entertainment SVOD? And just on the NAM business, can you give us a sense of both the EBITDA and margin that business makes? Or how you're thinking about any potential for that transaction?","Robert Thomson","Kane, again a little difficult to be specific, but the fundamental principle applies that if we thought Kayo was successful, then we would proceed with the new products. What we are seeing is Kayo is success, and fundamentally what we're seeing is a real growth in a number of Australians prepared to pay for premium programming. And there is little more premium than exclusive sports runs. So the old story about Foxtel was it had maxed out on subscribers that they were strictly limited number of Australians prepared to pay for content, and we heard that limit.","Frankly, that's clearly not the case, and the doubling of Kayo subscribers has actually been accompanied by a fall during the same period by the rate of churn among sports users, subscribers on broadcast. That is a significant trend and an indication of the","success of Kayo.","Susan Panuccio","And Kane, just in relation to News America Marketing, we don't disclose the margins in relation to that business. What I can say is we do disclose the revenues and that is obviously in the release. At this stage, we are obviously exploring the options as Robert said, in relation to the strategic review, and that will including exploring the sale. But we're not going to comment further biggest that process is being concluded that's what we may do with the cash proceeds.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Kane. Karine, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear next from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Craig Huber","Yes. Hi. Thank you. I guess two quick questions. Robert, Susan, what's changing your mind and your Board's mind to actually potentially put News America Marketing for sale now? I mean why now for that? And also, Susan, can you give us more clarity about how we should think about the cost for Foxtel for fiscal 2020 above and beyond what you've already said? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Craig, as I said a little earlier, we understand that the company is complex and that the valuation that we get, really a remarkable collection of asset is not fully realized in the share price. And so we have begun this process of simplification and that the most obvious outcome at this stage of that is the decision to conduct the strategic review of NAM, and that is well under way.","Susan Panuccio","I think Craig, I'll just also add to that, that one of the things that we've been thinking about is how to allow greater focus on News Corp's primary pillars including the creation and distribution of premium content in the digital segment. So just in addition to the comments that Robert said. Just in relation to your second question, in relation to Foxtel cost base, in relation to next year, clearly the current year, fiscal 2019 is the investment year for Foxtel. We are very clear about that and transparent particularly in relation to the Cricket rights.","If we cast our lines forward to the next financial year, we would expect to have a one additional quarter of Cricket right so that. US$20 million, we will, no doubt, have some continued investment in OTT as we scale this product and depending on the marketing activities around that. But more importantly as I mentioned in my comment, we'll have this non-cash impact related to the programming amortization change, which is about $30 million to $35 million. So that will impact on the result.","Outside of that, we expect that cost base will be relatively notwithstanding the variable nature of it due to subscribers.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Craig. Karine, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll next hear from Brian Han with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Brian Han","Hi, Robert, I have one question for you. I noticed that Fox recently invested in an online lending company called Credible, I think. And it looks like something that perhaps News Corp could also have been interested in as part of your digital \u2013 digitalization strategy. So my question is has there been situations where News Corp and Fox compete for an acquisition? And if so, how do you guys decide who's going to take the first dibs and who is going to back off?","Robert Thomson","Brian, we look after News Corp. [indiscernible] saying about that Fox acquisition is that clearly, the Fox news and Fox Business news, great plasticizers of products. And that particular company has a very broad range of financial products aimed at consumers. So I wouldn't be surprised at all that it was a Fox acquisition. But we are separate companies and we ourselves are always reviewing our portfolio. Operator, we\u2019ll \u2013 any more questions, Karina.","Operator","[Operator instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Florin for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Florin","Great. Thank you, Karina, and thank you for all participating. We look forward talking to you soon. Have a great rest of the day. Take care.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect your phone line."],"15747":["News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call May 10, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael Florin - IR","Robert Thomson - CEO","Susan Panuccio - CFO","Analysts","Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan","Kane Hannan - Goldman Sachs","John Janedis - Jefferies","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Brian Han - Morningstar","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to News Corp Third Quarter Fiscal \u201818 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Sophie. Hello everyone and welcome to News Corp's fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we again saw strong results across the company with revenue growth in every segment. In fact, we experienced higher growth in the third quarter than in any quarter since our rebirth as the new News in 2013. The company continues to deliver on its strategic mission to become increasingly global and digital with an ever greater focus on collaboration and innovation and that focus is evident from this quarter's results.","We are particularly pleased with the progress in digital real estate where revenues grew 27% and we fortified the business for future growth. Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Total segment EBITDA for Q3 was $182 million, a 15% decline from last year, a result that was impacted by certain singular items, which Susan will momentarily detail.","It is worth highlighting that for the first nine months, reported revenues were 6.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year and total segment EBITDA was $760 million, up 13% on the equivalent period last year. Reported earnings in the third quarter were affected by non-cash write downs of 998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As was previously disclosed in March, non-cash impairment charges of $165 million related to News America marketing.","Starting with the fourth quarter, the combination of the digital real estate services and cable TV businesses is expected to account for significantly more than half of our profits. The Foxtel, Fox Sports Australia consolidation is also expected to make circulation and subscription revenues, the biggest revenue stream for News Corp for the first time. This should give us more protection against the vicissitudes of a volatile advertising market.","The social and political debate over the digital platforms and their influence has intensified in recent months as is certainly appropriate. For many years, News Corps, under the leadership of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch has highlighted the deleterious effect the platforms have had on journalism. The outcome of this debate will have a profound impact on our business and on the societies in which we operate.","The end of Google's prejudicial first click free policy, which punished high quality journalism, has already benefited our masters and we appreciate the work of Sundar Pichai in particular. It is however just a first step on the pathway to prominence. We and other publishers are also in discussion with Facebook, which certainly [indiscernible] about virtue and veracity. Well, authenticated professional news may represent a minority of the content on Facebook, there is no doubt that the company needs trusted publishers to enhance and experience what has been polluted by fake news and ubiquitous ill-informed, sometimes malicious gossip. ","The sheer amount of personal data collected by Facebook, Google and Amazon means that governments are rightly considering the establishment of an algorithm review board, which, if properly conceived, would provide the necessary transparency for individuals, clients and competitors concerned about algorithmic abuse. These algorithms are already potent, but they are destined to be much more formidable and there are abundance potential to skew news and skewer customers\u2019 needs to be better understood and monitored. ","And an algorithm review board or ARB would be particularly useful in the oversight of companies which have horizontal dominance and use that leverage to dominate a vertical, such as Amazon with audiobooks and potentially Facebook with dating. We are confident that a renewed focus on provenance and on integrity will benefit our masters, our journalism and our advertising clients. We are learning more each day about the potential dangers of digital. Challenging these dominant digital platforms is important for our businesses but also meaningful for the societies in which we operate.","Now, let's examine in more detail this quarter\u2019s results. I'll start with digital real estate services, which continued to fulfill its promise as a core and increasingly important revenue and profit driver. REA Group had an impressive quarter and Tracey Fellows and her team are continuing to provide valuable services to our clients, while being restlessly determined to enhance the experience on the side. REA maintains a very healthy lead over its competitor and solidified its position with 35% revenue growth year-over-year, helped in part by emerging financial services business. ","REA gained traction with its home mortgage operations and as of the end of March, had more than a quarter of million self-completed financial profiles. Given the concern about the financial services industry in Australia, the team perceived an opening for business to truly focus on customer's needs and aspirations. Meanwhile REA saw a strong traffic growth in Southeast Asia with signs of improving revenue trends from the previous quarter in a market that is still in the early days of its digital evolution. Last week, REA announced the acquisition of Hometrack Australia, a provider of innovative, property data to the financial services sector. This will allow REA to deliver an increasing flow of insightful intelligence to customers and consumers and should further strengthen its position at the heart of the Australian property market. ","At Move, there was 15% revenue growth overall, a healthy 19% coming from its core real estate business. It was a robust performance in the lead based connections for buyers\u2019 product as well as strong audience growth and more intense engagement. In the next few months, realtor.com will be launching real suite, a mobile based system, which will enable advertisers to provide the best possible service to their clients, increasing responsiveness, highlighting meaningful leads and providing consumers with a level of service they expect throughout the transaction process. Meanwhile, we note with much interest that Zillow is expanding its Instant Offers program. Understandably, agents and brokers are eyeing this move with legitimate concern, as we believe Zillow\u2019s focus on house flipping is indicative of its long term intent. Having a very close relationship with agents and brokers is even more valuable today as we work with the industry to drive high quality lead volume and provide sophisticated market intelligence to sellers and buyers.","At News and Information Services, while print advertising remains challenging, we saw an overall improvement in advertising trends in the third quarter. News UK reported the second consecutive quarter of ad revenue growth for the first time in seven years and under Rebekah Brooks\u2019 leadership, all our UK mastheads gained market share in circulation. Also in the UK, Wallace Group experienced strong listenership and improved revenues compared to the prior year with standout performances at Virgin Radio and Talkradio. Wireless\u2019 audience growth has outpaced UK radio market in general based on the latest RAJAR data. ","Talksport is also looking forward expectantly to its coverage of the World Cup this June. Clearly, audience interest will in part depend on England's on field exploits. Let us hope that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Unruly had another strong quarter, driven by growth in the US, UK and Japan, as programmatic continues to burgeon. Unruly\u2019s consistent innovation in the ad distribution market and its provision of authenticated audiences make it particularly valuable at time when advertisers are questioning value and veracity. ","At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal's digital only subscriber growth was 24% year-over-year. Circulation revenues at Jones again increased 10%, as our publications served a growing public demand for timely and reliable news. Total subscribers across Dow Jones recently passed the 3 million target based on preliminary internal metrics and we expect continued growth in coming quarters. Revenue to the professional information business expanded 9%, led by the sterling performance of risk and compliance, with 45% year-over-year growth and its revenues. Reducing risk and ensuring compliance are clearly imperatives for our corporate clients. ","While advertising declined overall, it did so at a slower right compared to Q2, driven by low teens digital ad growth. The New York Post had strong advertising and audience numbers with 87 million uniques in March, a 72% year over year spike. In Australia, we made progress in reviewing our original papers and continue to focus on core metro titles and News Australia, streamlining the business and improving operating efficiencies. Digital Paid subscribers News Corp Australia grew 23% and we also saw robust digital ad revenue growth.","One final note for the news and information services segment. Taken together, our premium publications, the Journal, the Times, and Sunday Times and The Australian experienced an average growth in digital subscriptions for Q3 of more than 20%, a testament to the success of the digital transformation of these masters.","In book publishing, we experienced a strong quarter with robust revenue and profitability at HarperCollins. This success was driven in part by best-selling US titles such as AJ Finn, The Woman in the Window, the only debut work of fiction in the past 12 years to immediately reach number one and the continuing strength of Mark Manson's the Subtle Art of Not Giving an expletive. ","Notably, our Christian publishing arm performed well with one of the year's best performing titles Kathie Lee Gifford\u2019s, The Rock, the Road and the Rabbi and renewed interest in the works of Billy Graham. Bryan Murray\u2019s team continues to look for ways to leverage our global platform, including an important pact with bestselling author Daniel Silva, acquiring the world rights to six more of his books, starting with the Other Woman in July 2018.","We have finalized a licensing deal with Amazon to create an original television series based on the Lord of The Rings by JRR Tolkien, underscoring the power of our backlist. We expect to generate incremental revenue in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year as a result of this deal. We are excited about the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, giving News Corp 65% of the business and our partners at Telstra 35%. This agreement creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and comes at a time when over the top is becoming a significant part of our consumer portfolio. ","We believe Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia together will provide consumers a compelling offering with incomparable sports programming and a tangibly improved user experience. Cricket is core to Australian culture and we've secured prime rights for six years with Cricket Australia. Fox Sports has plans to launch a dedicated cricket channel in the coming months to make the most of those rights. For the first time, fans will be able to watch the game without interruption where and when they want. ","Fox Sports will simulcast all cricket matches, both in linear and digital formats and will have valuable exclusivity for a number of crucial encounters. The cricket contract also means that we are now able to boast strong sports programming year round, given our core NRL and IFL rights and we are optimistic that a more complete sports offering will minimize churn. The coming year is obviously of vital importance and we expect the repositioning to be followed by a renaissance at the company.","In summary, we are pleased with revenue growth we've seen across every segment of our business. We cherish the strength of digital scoops subscriptions at mastheads, the vigor of our digital real estate and global book publishing businesses and the promise of a significant transformation of News Corp with the consolidation of Foxtel in the current quarter. The character of our company will be enhanced and our reported revenue and EBITDA will be boosted significantly.","With that, I turn the call over to our CFO, Susan Panuccio.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials, fiscal 2018 third quarter total revenues were $2.1 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year with revenue gains across the portfolio led by our digital real estate services segment. Reported total segment EBITDA was $182 million, down from $215 million in the prior year. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $1.94 compared to a loss of $1 in the prior year. The loss was primarily driven by the pretax non-cash write downs of $998 million related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia. As we communicated in March, an impairment related to News America Marketing, which totaled $165 million.","On an adjusted basis which excludes those and the other items shown in the press release reconciliation table, earnings per share was $0.06 compared to $0.07 in the prior year. As Robert mentioned, we close the Foxtel transaction at the beginning of the fourth quarter and those results will be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during quarter four which I will discuss in a few moments. ","Twenty now to the individual operating segments. In news and information services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, up 2% versus the prior year, slightly improved rate over the previous quarter. Foreign exchange contributed $50 million this quarter to revenues. Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 3% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 7% with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 3% and circulation and subscription revenues by 5%.","Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 4%, News UK rose 10%, News Australia declined 3% and News American marketing fell 5%. More revenue details will be provided in the 10-Q filing tomorrow. News and information segment EBITDA this quarter was $85 million, down 31% versus the prior year. You may also recall that last year's results included a $12 million benefit related to an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly. We also had higher expenses this quarter at News UK, much of which was timing related.","There are also a few highlights that I would like to mention from the segment. We again saw digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 10%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth, benefiting from strong growth in the Wall Street Journal digital only subscribers, which are up 24% year-over-year and up 7% or 101,000 versus our fiscal second quarter.","Pleasingly, we also saw an increase in subscriber ARPU at Down Jones. In addition, we again saw strong year-over-year digital subscription growth at the Time, and Sunday Times, up 24% and at News Australia, up 23%. At Dow Jones, we saw further revenue acceleration in the professional information business, which contributes to overall quarter of the Dow Jones revenues. This past quarter, the professional information business posted 9% revenue growth, led by risk and compliance which grew 45% and is on pace to exceed $100 million in total sales this year.","Advertising continues to be mixed across our news portfolio, but overall, showed slightly better performance from last quarter. The UK was again a solid performer with advertising up 16% versus the prior year or 3% in local currency, similar to its Q2 performance, led by digital advertising growth and moderating print advertising declines, particularly at the Sun. News Australia declined 5% versus the prior year or 9% in local currency, a slight improvement versus the second quarter rate.","Dow Jones advertising was down low double digits, improving on the trend from the second quarter, led by a strong performance in digital advertising. The closure of the Wall Street Journal international print edition impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $6 million, which represented about half of the decline this quarter. Our cost initiatives have been centered around Australia, given the reliance on print advertising in that market. We have already significantly exceeded last year's AUD40 million in cost savings during the first nine months of the year and continue to look for additional efficiencies.","We're also continuing to review our portfolio in Australia as we focus on improving our profitability. And globally as we have done in the UK, we are in discussions with industry participants about potentially sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies.","Finally, at News America Marketing, overall result were lower, but saw a sequential improvement from the second quarter, benefiting from one additional insertion and higher digital growth as we expected in communication on the last earnings call. ","Turning to our book publishing segment, we posted a very solid quarter led by strong front list and back list performance. Revenue for the quarter increased approximately 6% to $398 million and segment EBITDA increased 16% to $43 million. Strong results from General books and Christian publishing drove overall performance this quarter. As Robert mentioned, this quarter benefited from the continued performance of the Woman in the Window by AJ Finn and strong performances from the backlist. ","Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 58% of revenues in the quarter, up from 52% last year, helping to drive higher margins. Total digital revenue for the quarter grew 5% and represented 22% of consumer revenues, in line with the prior year, due to the strength in the downloadable audiobooks, which now comprises 25% of digital revenues.","In the digital real estate services segment, revenues increased 27% to $279 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 17% to $88 million. REA group revenues grew 35% due to very strong residential revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for premium all. The integration of the smart line acquisition and benefit from currency. While listing volumes were down modestly, partly due to an early start, we saw relatively stable trends in both Melbourne and Sydney.","Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call, which will commence shortly after this call for additional details. News revenue rose 15% to $115 million versus the prior year, driven by a strong performance from connection suppliers, which is benefiting from higher customer flow and higher yield. While core real estate revenues grew at a notably higher right from the base growth rate, we saw slower growth in non-listing advertising revenues this quarter. Part of the plan to test reducing advertising loads in select markets to drive engagement and lead volume with early results encouraging.","Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 61 million for the quarter, rising 10% versus the prior year and reached 65 million in April. News operating expenses were higher this quarter, driven by planned incremental marketing to drive revenue growth and partly to increase traction in New York. We are also rebranding our core fleet of professional services and tools ahead of a commercial launch in the next few months.","In cable network programming, revenue increased $7 million or 6% to $129 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter soured $16 million from $34 million in the prior year, primarily due to the phasing of programming amortization and higher programming costs related to the NRL, which led to approximately $22 million higher costs this quarter. We also incurred approximately $2 million of expenditure related to the proposed combination of Foxtel, Fox Sports, which was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. The bulk of the transaction cost will be recorded in the fourth quarter.","With respect to equity losses from affiliates, equity losses of affiliates of $974 million reflects the $957 million non-cash write down of the carrying value of Foxtel in the quarter, as we had previously disclosed in March. This compares with negative $23 million in the prior year period. Foxtel revenues for the third quarter declined 1% to $587 million, and EBITDA decreased 21% due to planned increases in sports programming costs of $18 million, primarily related to the Australian Football League rights and carriage fees of Fox Sports Australia as well as lower revenues.","On operating metrics, Foxtel\u2019s total closing subscribers were approximately 2.8 million as of March 31, up nearly 1% versus the prior year, driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions, which were offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of TV box subscribers as part of the planned wind down in the quarter. In the third quarter, cable and satellite churn was 15.4%, down from 16.1% and ARPU was down 1%.","In early April, we completed the transaction with Telstra to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports into a new company, in which News Corp now owns 65%. The Foxtel results will be consolidated with Fox Sports Australia during the fourth quarter and it will also include approximately $1.7 billion of debt. As a consequence of the transaction, there will be some initial reinvestments required to improve the earnings and subscriber trajectory.","To that end, one big step as Robert highlighted was securing long term domestic cricket rights, which will now materially improve Fox Sports\u2019 offering, focusing on both subscriber volume and churn. On the core broadcast business, our goal will be to maintain the subscriber base and manage churn effectively. We are progressing with the rollout of IQ3, which is showing promising signs on churn reduction and ARPU lift and today has been deployed to approximately one quarter of our broadcast base.","We expect to continue to expand penetration of new set top boxes and also to develop a next generation box, including half customer features. Over the top will be a key growth initiative. This past fiscal year, our product development was focused on launching an IP version of our broadcast offering, which has helped to extend our reach and capture more of the affordable segment. Our goal in fiscal \u201919 is to launch new sports and non-sports products, built on an IP only platform, targeted at specific demographics.","With new management in the business, we are reviewing the cost base, looking across content operations to deal further efficiencies and to ensure the business is right sized to deliver the new initiatives. Looking to the fourth quarter, there are a few comments I would like to make. News and information services, advertising trends so far appear broadly in line with the third quarter, however, we do expect slightly higher marketing costs in the fourth quarter at Dow Jones, mostly related to driving higher digital paid subscriber growth.","At Fox Sports and Foxtel, we will consolidate Foxtel in the fourth quarter, which will be reflected in newly formed segment called subscription video services, which will also include the Australian news channel operator, Sky News. Overall, we expect subscriber trends at Foxtel to be relatively similar to the prior quarter, but do expect some additional OTT investment.","Results in the segment are also expected to include transaction cost in the $10 million to $15 million range. In book publishing, we expect to realize over $20 million in additional revenues in the fourth quarter from the agreement with Amazon to license the Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien for a TV series. At digital real estate services, we expect continued strong revenue growth at REA, which should show some improvement in listing volumes, helped by the absence of Easter and like the third quarter, we anticipate hiring investment spending it move to drive traffic and support new products.","While we are in the process of completing our purchase price allocation of Foxtel and evaluating the related impact from a profit and loss, there are a few items below the line worth mentioning, regarding the Foxtel consolidation. Foxtel standalone depreciation and amortization for the first nine months totaled $187 million, including $69 million for the quarter. In addition, we have also advertised an additional $49 million and $17 million for the first nine months and the quarter respectively related to the excess cost of our 50% share of the business that we acquired by the CMH acquisition in 2012.","Foxtel results will be removed from the equity income and the 35% stake Telstra owns at the combined company will be reflected in minority interest going forward. We will also consolidate Foxtel\u2019s interest expense, which will reflect the $1.7 billion in debt that we will include on our balance sheet.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","I was curious, if given all the changes in sort of the broader media industry, specifically, the M&A amongst many of the other media peers, has it influenced your longer term strategic outlook for your business? Do you think you are in the right size, right asset mix? I know you've got a lot of different things planned at different parts of your business, but it's sort of a bigger picture question.","Robert Thomson","Well, Alexia, we're constantly reviewing our situation and opportunities that may or may not arise. What we certainly won\u2019t be doing is paying silly money for overpriced, overhyped targets. As you can see with the investments we\u2019ve made thus far with realtor, with Harlequin, we've been able to use our existing assets to transform their value and that has been of benefit obviously to the company, but most importantly, to shareholders and we'll certainly always have shareholders in mind when contemplating any potential investments.","Operator","Next question comes from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.","Kane Hannan","Can you just update us on the progress you\u2019ve been making, pushing to the New York market and then whether that was the main driver of the increased customers you called out in the release?","Robert Thomson","Certainly, we\u2019re rare making genuine inroads it into New York where historically realtor.com hasn't had a particularly powerful presence and overall, the audience at realtor in the quarter was 61 million monthly. That was up 10% in April. 65 million. So we're still seeing a continued growth, not only in New York, but around the country. And there's much discussion at the moment about the general health of the housing market in the US. So listing volumes down about 7.2% year-on-year at present. But when you look at the broader trends in the US economy, we're clearly going through a phase or at least I would argue on route to significantly more liquidity. ","The March seasonally adjusted annualized figures for sales around 5.6 million, the median sales price was up 5.8% to around 250,400. And significantly, the number of homes in the US seriously underwater in Q2 2012, that was 28.6 of US homes seriously underwater, that's down to 9.5% of homes. And given the issue with the market at the moment is not a problem of the demand, but a problem with supply and a compounding factor in the past has been a lack of job security, what -- with the strength in the US job market, you will see more people more confident about moving homes to a better job, job really means mobility, mobility means people moving and that will be good for business.","Operator","Next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail on digital subscription growth at the journal, where you\u2019re incrementally more promotional during the quarter to drive subs, where are you sourcing them from and bigger picture, you have obviously been vocal on Google and Facebook, any thoughts there on movement in terms of monetization of news content on digital platforms?","Robert Thomson","John, entitled digital paid subscribers at the journal were up 24%, so they're now 62% of overall subs. We're seeing a broad based interest in the journal, obviously, it's a business oriented publication, but also one with general appeal for a certain demographic and that is quite broad. The other thing to bear in mind with those subscriptions is that each of them is an opportunity to upsell to higher priced, higher yielding professional information. ","From a broader perspective, our concern has not just been for publications, which of course is our prime concern, but also for an ecosystem, which was digitally dysfunctional, one in which premium content was actually diminished in stature by the very fact that in Google searches, you won\u2019t basically able to find it. That has changed and we applaud that measure by Google, but as I mentioned, that's really step one on the pathway to prominence. So we're engaged and thankfully these days, unlike the past, many more publishers are engaged, not only in the US, but globally and also more governments are engaged in the debate over what the digital landscape should like. And with more focus on that ecosystem, more focus on prominence, there should be more opportunity for us for more profits.","Susan Panuccio","I think I\u2019d just also add to your question as well, we are obviously looking to expand the offering internationally in the education with students as well, but what is pleasing is the ARPU is holding up so I think that's important even as we go to this broader base. I think the other part to your question was about our office and I think it's important to note that we haven't changed our intro office in the US. So I have to remain consistent with starting that obviously that digital growth and the ARPU growth.","Operator","The next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","My question is around the new subscription video services segment. Could you give us some idea on the expectations for cost growth within the segment, given in FY19, so looking beyond the current year, particularly given the acquisition of the cricket rights? And I know you've obviously spoken about using over the top products in a dedicated cricket channel but just interested in whether you think you can regroup those costs?","Robert Thomson","Clearly, a problem for Foxtel and Fox Sports has been the sum allowed where they wanting the compelling sports offering, which is why we acquired the cricket rights for six years and one, cost of that sum alone a lot has been significant churn. And with churn comes cost. So we are very confident that the team will put together a compelling summer package that will make Foxtel a year round experience. It\u2019s a little early for us to give you details -- meaningful details about the level of investment in the coming, year as Susan mentioned, we will be focusing on the development of OTT and frankly addressing issues that in the past have been problematic at Foxtel around the user interface, we want a user interface that is not in your face. And there is a real opportunity, given the new structure at Foxtel, the clearer management lines and the new team under the leadership of Patrick Delaney to take advantage of what is a peerless portfolio of sports and entertainment rights.","Susan Panuccio","And I think I\u2019ll sort of just add, our key priorities, whilst we don\u2019t give out guidance obviously on cost going forward and what that may look like, is to stabilize the broadcast proposition and cricket is clearly going to be an important of that as Robert mentioned, particularly over the summer months to have a look at churn and the portfolio going forward. We are looking to expand the rollout of the [indiscernible] and invest in the new box going forward and so that will be something that you will see going forward and we're also looking to improve the customer service obviously to get more customers in. We\u2019ve also mention that we're looking to expand the OTT propositions and we want to look at sports as well as non-sports genre, but we also are right sizing the cost base. So, there's been a lot of cost work actually done today, so even before the merger happened and the pain down there is still heavily focused on looking at getting costs out, so they can balance that up with the reinvestment that we're looking at. So, there's going to be lots of activity obviously that's going to happen going forward, but it always in the quest to drive subscribers at a higher value going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Q - Eric Katz","You mentioned earlier potentially reviewing the portfolio in Australia. Have you identified assets at this point? Can you size it? What's the timeline and why now?","Susan Panuccio","I think we generally don't comment on obviously forward-looking acquisitions or divestments and I think that's a practice that we\u2019ll stick to, but what we have said in the past is that we are always looking at our asset portfolio. We have been very clear that we're looking to simplify the portfolio and drive profitable growth. And to that end, we obviously will look at any opportunities that come our way in relation to the assets that we have down there.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","I guess a similar question. What was the circulation revenue for Wall Street Journal Australia and UK with or without turns on a year over year basis? And then separately Susan, if I could ask housekeeping question, you gave a lot of D&A numbers, but is the quarterly D&A number starting here in the June quarter going to be roughly about 170 million where is that going to fall out, is it about 100 last quarter.","Susan Panuccio","Thanks, Craig. I think so in relation to your first question, in relation to the circulation, so in local currency, we are expecting Dow Jones to be up about 12%, Wall Street Journal up about 12%. We\u2019re expecting local currency to be down 5% and these, we're expecting to be relatively stable. In relation -- what was your question in relation to the D&A sorry?","Craig Huber","What was the D&A for the upcoming quarter for the whole companies, including Foxtel, is that 170 million or something.","Susan Panuccio","We don't comment on obviously Craig, on the forward looking projections, but obviously as they become clearer, we will communicate those.","Craig Huber","What would they ask for March quarter if you had it all already in there Foxtel?","Susan Panuccio","We have that in the prepared comments actually. We read that out. We had D&A for the first nine months totaled 187 million, including 69 million for the quarter and then we also amortized an additional 49 million year to date, or 17 million for the quarter in relation to the CMH acquisition.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Just out of interest, does Mr. Rupert Murdoch still spend much time thinking and talking about News Corp businesses or do you think he's increasingly more preoccupied with what's going on in Fox.","Robert Thomson","Well, I can only speak for our experience which is that Rupert is very much engaged in the company, actively so, as Executive Chairman. He is across all the businesses and his level of interest remains intense.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Raymond Tong with Evans and Partners.","Unidentified Analyst","Robin in. Susan, you mentioned that you have passed the 40 million sort of cost out Target this year for News Corp Australia, can you maybe talk about sort of further cost out opportunities in also, you mentioned exploring sort of potentially sharing printing costs with Fairfax, can you maybe just discuss that a little bit please.","Susan Panuccio","So the team in Australia continue to remain focused on how they can drive those efficiencies down and they have been looking right across the business, whether it's back office functions and organizational redesign and there's been some announcements that have come out in the market out there, anyway over the previous couple of months. In relation to the industry solutions, I think as I said globally we\u2019re actively looking at whether they are opportunities from a press side facility as well as the distribution facilities and we will continue to explore those options. ","Obviously, they need to make sense for both book parties and they can be quite detailed and join our commercial negotiations, but we have had tremendous success with those negotiations over in the UK and we\u2019ve had much success and we have no reason to believe that we can't draw similar conclusions in other markets that we're having a look at. So the team do continue to remain focused on replacing legacy systems, removing antiquated practices and draw I think efficiencies by those means and we believe that there's still opportunities where they can continue to get cost out going forward.","Operator","And there are no further phone questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Florin for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Thank you for all participating. Thank you for your help Sophie. Have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Good day, and welcome to the News Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Media is invited in a listen-only basis. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation\u2019s Form 10-K with 12 months ended June 30, 2015, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. And welcome to you all from Sydney. We have completed our first two years as the new News Corp with a strong finish in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, without being particularly Panglossian, I\u2019m confident in asserting that the company is financially stronger and strategically better positioned, than when we started our journey. We have aggressively shifted to digital across our businesses through smart and disciplined investments that also expanded outreach globally.","Our acquisition of realtor.com signaled a major expansion of our expertise in digital real estate, making us a global leader in the field that we believe has tremendous growth potential in the years ahead.","We have reduced operating costs where appropriate and we\u2019ll continue to be vigilant in that area. We returned capital with the declaration of a dividend, and we have been executing on our repurchase program, and we have rigorously reviewed our asset portfolio. You will see from today\u2019s press release that we are very advanced in a strategic review of Amplify, our digital education business. We will update you on our progress, but our goal is to drive value per share for News Corp shareholders and to ensure our portfolio is a powerful platform for future growth.","First, let me address the financials, on which Bedi will elaborate in a few minutes. For the year revenues were $8.6 billion, a 1% increase; while total segment EBITDA was $852 million, up 11% on the prior year. These results come despite global and financial instability. Quite obviously, currency headwinds buffeted the business, and in particular our revenues and EBITDA were affected by 4% and 6% respectively.","Even though our company was not unique in being impacted by these macro trends, we were able to deliver free cash flow available to News Corp of $368 million and we expect healthy free cash flow going forward. We were optimistic that we would grow segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter, and in fact reported EBITDA rose by 50% versus the prior year, and over 60% on an adjusted basis.","Let me be more specific about some key things. The reality is that the media landscape is undergoing profound change. The traditional ways of creating and distributing news and information are changing. We are not treading water in the roiling sea of change. We are increasingly determined to gather high-quality data to ensure that our users have the best possible experience, while our advertisers can be confident that our readers have connection to our content that is particularly strong in its intensity and its affinity. Both of which are distinctive in an age of digital promiscuity and digital disloyalty.","We are not simply a collection of unique powerful assets. We are a company with complementary platforms. And what makes our businesses, so complementary, is how much they have in common; namely, the uncommon power of the news and content and their data, data about customers, businesses and markets that is global in scale and precise in its targeting. In the coming year, we will be enhancing our ability to deliver customized offerings to our readers, clients, and advertisers. Some existing examples indicate the future ahead.","realtor.com has experienced industry-leading growth, in part because of the quality of our real estate news and analysis, which are an important service to anyone in the U.S. contemplating the purchase or the sale of a property.","The moment of moving is a particularly opportune time to influence purchasing decisions. News America Marketing is benefiting from the precise demographic data that we are able to gather from realtor.com. Our clients know that we are able to identify when families are moving and that\u2019s when they\u2019ll need a new television, cable contract or a car for the garage.","Checkout 51, the digital coupon company we acquired last month, provides precious information is about broad consumer habits, but also about specific purchases. While social media companies attempt to identify the intention of shoppers, we have detailed data about actual actions, We will get purchase from purchases. News Australia launched just last week News Connect powered by Quantium, which will combine News Corp Australia scale touching 7.2 million people each day with a huge database of transaction information to offer customized audiences based on specific flying behavior.","On our acquisition strategy, during the first two years, we\u2019ve had a clear plan to extend our expertise, build and create powerful platforms for our content, and our clients. Our first acquisition as the new News was Storyful, the world\u2019s first social media news agency. Since that time, this online video pioneer has partnered with Facebook, VICE, YouTube, and many others to authenticate and to distribute compelling video content that has gone hundreds of millions of years.","We expect to see increased integration of Storyful across our masters, as we build out and distribute native content solutions. It is also a powerful marketing tool for brands and businesses. In early fiscal 2015, we acquired Harlequin, which became part of one of the world\u2019s preeminent publishing companies, HarperCollins.","Harlequin\u2019s global expertise has helped HarperCollins extend its international footprint, and provides a platform for growth in many lands and many languages. The virtue of that capability became clear when we run the global Spanish rights, the Harper Lee\u2019s second novel, Go Set a Watchman, whose publication in the U.S. was [indiscernible] the book event of the year.","We completed the acquisition of Move, which operates realtor.com. We had forecast that the mastheads of News Corp would be powerful platforms in driving digital traffic realtor.com and that has patently being the case. The site rose from being third place to a clear second, and became the fastest growing in the sector. We expect that realtor.com will become an increasingly important platform and profit center for News Corp. To give you a sense of the scale of the site, we had over 48 million monthly unique visitors in July, each of whom viewed an average of 25 pages.","As we\u2019ve promised at the time of the acquisition, the digital networks of News Corp helped turbocharge traffic, which is gaining market share and its position to be a core pillar of News Corp\u2019s future profitability. In fact, we expect to see positive EBITDA this year, and further growth in coming years. We ended July with traffic up 43% versus the prior year and more than 70% into our acquisition in November 2014.","News Corp has also invested thoughtfully in other businesses to extend our reach. The REA Group in which we have a 61.6% stake, or an increase its own stake in the southeast Asian online property business by a property. We made moves in India acquiring a stake in Elara Technologies, which owns PropTiger.com, a leading digital real estate marketing platform. We also acquired VCCircle, a top digital data, information, training and conferences network and BigDecisions.com, which helps Indian consumers make informed financial decisions. These are companies to complement each other and our global businesses.","Some key business highlights. At Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal is the premier player in financial news. Today, we have over 700,000 digital only subscribers and we obviously expect that number to rise. Digital is one-third of our paid subscriber base, at present. We acknowledge that the journal is underpriced, and we\u2019ve taken steps to address that through a combination of new rates and flexible packaging. This quarter, circulation revenues at the Journal grew 7%, an impressive rate of growth in this marketplace.","Our ad revenues at the Journal showed strong sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, and early signs for the first quarter of the current year are particularly promising. This trend highlights the increasing importance of our marquee brand and a desirable demographic in a cluttered, confusing, and sometimes confounding advertising market. We launched WSJ+ this year, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s customer loyalty program and it\u2019s showing traction with nearly 200,000 active members, thus increasing engagement and lowering churn. We have incorporated similar programs across our markets in Australia and the UK. We announced new global print editions, a journal to grow our audience and advertising revenues internationally, as we focus on key financial hubs and using digital to extend our reach more efficiently in smaller markets. Our team at Dow Jones is continuing to innovate. Having just launched Mansion Global, a new website, which leverages our unique customer base to create a premier international and digital luxury real estate platform in English, Chinese, and Spanish.","We saw improvement in the Professional Information business, including favorable trends in risk and compliance, where growth has been particularly strong as financial institutions and other companies adapt to tougher regulatory ratings, and we expect continued stability in fiscal 2016. We need to more aggressively push video and mobile products and expand the engagement with consumers throughout the day. We\u2019re empowering video journalist with better tools and integrating the video team with the rest of the news group.","We\u2019re now implementing the new systems to better and more effectively monetize this valuable inventory. HarperCollins publishers has successfully integrated its acquisition of Harlequin, reducing costs, consolidating and opening international offices, and launching more than a dozen authors in multiple languages in countries. The company was able to take advantage for the unexpected surge in interest in American Sniper after the release of the eponymous film, as well as the ongoing popularity of the Divergent trilogy. Capping to fiscal year was the announcement of Go Set a Watchman, which sold a record number of copies in its first week and also boosted the sales of the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird.","In Australia, Fox Sports has successfully monetized its first class rosters sports ride. It\u2019s gaining advertising market share and benefiting from Foxtel\u2019s new pricing and packaging strategy to drive subscriber growth. At Foxtel, we saw very strong improvement in cable and satellite subscribers. And we also expect the rollout of triple play and improved content offerings at Presto, its subscription video on demand product to be accretive to growth. Foxtel also announced plans to acquire approximately 58% stake in 10 network holdings, subject to regulatory approval.","REA continued robust growth in revenue and EBITDA, despite some earlier softness investing volume. It is worth noting that early prospects of fiscal 2016 are encouraging. Growth, again, accelerated in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re confident in the long-term trajectory as REA extends its footprint, expanded into adjacencies and drives premium penetrations. At News Australia, a particular note was the improved EBITDA in local currency this year. Thanks in part to measured increases in both cover price and subscription rates, innovative digital offerings, and the efforts by the sales team to stabilize advertising trends.","Now, leadership team in Australia is continuing to develop our markets, which have powerful platforms for advertisers in print and in digital. They have launched new apps for our papers aroundcountry and continue the development of new.com.au, which is the country\u2019s leading news website.","News Corp Australia also launched sync, its own programmatic ad exchange, which we believe will have the most scale with the highest quality content in the marketplace. And we will continue to invest in products that play to that commercial opportunity. For example, the Australian launched the Australian business review and a premium benefits program to readers the Australian clients.","In the UK, the times gained market share and revenues through innovative products and new pricing. One of the world\u2019s oldest existing newspapers continues to show great strength in the digital age, thanks to high quality journalism and constant innovation. Advertising remains challenging for a number of our businesses, particularly, The Sun in the UK. We\u2019re clearly taking steps to address this issue, including the new products to encourage engagement and to help drive higher traffic. We plan a deeper role for our programmatic ad exchange and increase monetization of video and mobile, which we believe are drivers of future growth.","As it\u2019s the case for all companies with extensive global operations, there has been a significant impact from currency fluctuations. And there will no doubt be more volatility in the macroeconomic environment in the current year. Our clear aim, currencies aside, is to pursue our core digital and global strategy, develop our businesses, and prudently cut costs to ensure that there is a long-term and meaningful return for our investors.","In conclusion, News Corp has clearly evolved from our launch two years ago. We are the custodians of a proud tradition and we are also fashioning a profitable future in an era of profound change. We have had a strategy that is consistent with our message to investors at the time of our separation. We are more digital and more global. And we have begun to execute on our buyback program and announced a semiannual cash dividend of $.10 a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, but payment in the second quarter.","The decision by the board to pay a dividend is a sign of confidence in the state of our business and faith in our prospects for the future. We plan to continue our strategy of balancing capital returns with prudent re-investments, so that we realize our goal of long-term growth and value creation. With stable revenues, EBITDA growth and robust free cash flow in fiscal 2015 we have real reason to be optimistic about the year ahead, building on our success for the benefit of all our customers, employees and shareholders.","As always, we thank you for your support as we continue this journey together.","Now, we turn to Bedi for the details of our fourth quarter earnings and some insights into fiscal 2016. Thank you.","Bedi Singh","Thank you, Robert. News Corp clearly made strong progress in our second full year. We further digitized our asset portfolio, streamlined costs and began to return capital to shareholders. We finished the quarter with strong EBITDA growth, and we believe we are well-positioned to build on that success in the year ahead.","Just some key financial highlights of the year, and these included the seamless integration of the Move and Harlequin acquisitions, moderating EBITDA declines at our News and Information Services segments, including stabilization at the Dow Jones professional information business and growing consumer circulation revenues. Further penetration of our masthead digital subscriptions and improved pricing; continued advertising market share gains at Fox Sports, Australia; successful subscriber growth at Foxtel, due to its re-pricing and repackaging strategy and product offering expansion; and initiating a capital return program, including the declaration of a semiannual cash dividend and the conventional share repurchases.","Turning to the financial results, for the full year we reported revenues of $8.6 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue is 1% lower than the prior year. We reported full year total segment EBITDA of $852 million, which was 11% increase versus the prior year. Reported results included the costs related to the UK Newspaper Matters net of indemnification, which were $50 million for the year.","Excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, costs related to UK Newspaper Matters and foreign exchange fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA was up 15% versus the prior year. As Robert mentioned, we were impacted by currency headwinds throughout the year, primarily due to the weaker Australian dollar.","Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted full year reported revenues by $319 million or 4%, and total reported segment EBITDA by $49 million or 6%. Fiscal 2015 reported EPS were a loss of $0.26, which includes an impairment charge in Amplify in Fiscal 2015, and restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of these and other items, our adjusted EPS was $0.47, compared to $0.46 last year.","And free cash flow available to News Corp was $368 million, modestly higher than the prior year. Turning to the fourth quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.14 billion, a 2% decrease versus the prior year period. And our adjusted revenues declined by 1%, similar to the full-year rate.","Fiscal fourth quarter total segment EBITDA was $191 million, a 50% increase versus the prior year. Reported results includes $8 million related to the UK Newspaper Matters net of indemnification. Our adjusted total segment EBITDA this quarter grew by 62%. Adjusted EPS were $0.07, compared to $0.01 in the prior year. Currency headwind negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by $168 million, or 8%, and total reported segment EBITDA by $23 million, or 19%.","With that as a brief overview, let\u2019s look at our fourth quarter performance for our key segment. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $154 million, or 10% versus the prior year period. More than 17% of the revenue decline was related to foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenues declined 2%, an improvement from the prior quarter rate.","Within segment revenues, advertising, which was 55% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13%, or 7% in local currency, a similar rate to both the quarter and the full year. At The Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising was slightly higher versus the prior year quarter, a notable sequential improvement, as we had expected. We saw improvement in technology, finance, and luxury goods categories.","At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 33%, but only 8% in local currency as the market was a bit weaker in the prior two quarters. And we saw weakness in several categories, including retail, financial, and auto this quarter.","At News UK, advertising revenue remained soft this quarter, relatively similar to last quarter and the year. We saw year-over-year declines across most segments, particularly retail, IT and telecom, utilities and automotive. But some remain the challenge, as they are continuing to look at additional ways to better monetize our digital offerings and broaden our advertiser base.","At News America Marketing, revenues declined 9% versus the prior year quarter, due to continued weakness in freestanding inserts, partially offset by growth in in-store advertisements. Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 38% of segment revenues this quarter declined 5%, but was up 2% in local currency.","Dow Jones professional information business had a negative $7 million impact to revenues this quarter, but was down only $3 million excluding foreign currency impact, a significant improvement from the prior quarter. We continue to see growth in consumer circulation revenues led again by The Wall Street Journal, which grew 7% this quarter, thanks to new pricing and packages.","Segment EBITDA increased $38 million in the quarter, or 29% as compared to the prior year period, and adjusted segment EBITDA was up 34%. We benefited this quarter from a combination of increased operating efficiencies at Dow Jones and at News America Marketing, combined with higher prior year costs at News UK, which had included severance and the World Cup marketing. One item to note in the UK results, the quarter included $11 million one-time charge related to termination of a distribution contract as part of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues increased 8% and segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 9% versus the prior year and adjusted segment EBITDA fell 18%, primarily due to difficult year ago comparisons which had higher Divergent sales. Total digital revenues for the quarter was 23% of consumer revenues, down from 24% in the prior year, again, primarily due to the Divergent year ago comparison, which impacted total revenues by almost $23 million this quarter.","In Digital Real Estate Services, total segment revenues increased $76 million, or 67%, and EBITDA declined $17 million, or 27% compared to the prior year periods, due to foreign currency and the inclusion of Move results. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA\u2019s adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 15% and 18% respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter, driven by higher debt penetration, even though listing volumes for the market remained below prior year levels. That said, listing volume has improved in June and July.","Reported segment results include $81 million in revenues and an EBITDA loss of $15 million from Move, which includes $5 million of stock-based compensation and $7 million in legal fees and litigation against Zillow. For the full-year, excluding stock-based comp and legal fees, Move was EBITDA net positive. On a standalone basis, Move\u2019s revenue would have grown 32% versus the prior year quarter, which is an acceleration from the March quarter. The improvement was led by the CoBroke [ph] product and non-listing media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones problematic exchange and higher audience levels.","In Cable Network Programming, revenue decreased by $3 million, or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 3%, benefiting from higher affiliate fees and increased subscribers, which was more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Advertising revenues were flat, but up slightly in local currency. Segment EBITDA in the quarter grew 16% despite higher cost and negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenue grew by 15%, and adjusted EBITDA by 37%.","At Digital Education, revenues rose compared to the prior year quarter due in part to higher early grade print hybrid sales and segment EBITDA improved due to development costs reductions.","As Robert mentioned, we are in the advanced stages of reviewing strategic alternatives for Amplify. The recent selling season for the new school year for our digital ELA curriculum overall has been disappointing and the marketplace for digital curriculum has been much slower to develop than we initially expected. Additionally, we are no longer accepting new tablet customers and will only be providing service and support through existing customers. We have reduced our long range outlook at Amplify, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $371 million this quarter. And we will keep you updated on further developments.","With respect to earnings and affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with over $2.8 million total subscribers, up 9% versus the prior year, driven by cable and satellite subscribers. Churn improved to 9.9% from 12% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 2% versus the prior year, and EBITDA declined 16%, due to higher sports programming costs related to the acquisition of V8 Supercars and Formula 1 rights, higher subscriber fees paid to Fox Sports Australia combined with higher support costs related to the new pricing and packaging strategy and triple-play.","Subscriber growth remains strong with total subscribers around 230,000 year-over-year and growth of 94,000 in Q4. We will be including full Foxtel financials in our 10-K, which we expect to file shortly. Overall, while it\u2019s towards the year of reinvestment, we expect Foxtel to return to EBITDA growth in fiscal 2016 in local currency.","Turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow available to News Corporation in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, was $368 million, compared to $365 million in the prior year. It\u2019s worth nothing that foreign currency had approximately $30 million negative impact to our available free cash flow in 2015.","Turning now to a few themes for fiscal 2016. At News and Information Services, advertising remains volatile and visibility is limited. Ad spending in the U.S. is up versus the prior year, while trends of Australia and the UK remain soft. We hope to see more stability in the segment, driven by prior year cost initiatives, increased penetration of digital subscribers, and continued stabilization of the Dow Jones professional information business.","At Book Publishing, we are very excited about our pipeline for fiscal 2016, which was highlighted by the release in July of Harper Lee\u2019s, Go Set a Watchman, including as Robert noted, the Spanish rights for Watchman. However, unlike Divergent, Watchman was skewed heavily towards for physical books. And given the higher marketing costs and author advance it will result in more modest profitability.","Regarding Harlequin, we remain on track with our cost synergy targets of $20 million and expect the bulk of the savings to be realized in fiscal 2016. At Move, we are very pleased with the progress at realtor.com. While there\u2019s still work to be done and we expect to reinvest in marketing and in product development in fiscal 2016 to further drive market share, we expect Move to be modestly accretive to reported segment EBITDA in fiscal 2016 and expect to further ramp in fiscal 2017, driven by strong audience gains, lead volumes and improved ad inventory monetization.","REA Group as mentioned on the earnings call yesterday, listing volume has improved in June and we expect another year of solid growth.","At Cable Network, we expect continued solid performance in local currency, driven by subscriber revenue growth. In the first-half of fiscal 2016, programming costs are expected to be higher though due to the inclusion of the Rugby World Cup in September and October. And for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar, we would expect currency headwinds relatively similar to fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.","Last year, the Australian dollar rate was $0.93 for the first quarter, roughly $0.20 million higher than the current rate. To help frame the currency impact, our 10-K will be disclosing that the impact of a one-side change in the U.S. dollar versus the Australian dollar impacted fiscal 2015 annual revenues by approximately $31 million and total segment EBITDA by approximately $6 million.","CapEx for fiscal 2015 was approximately $380 million, which was in line with our expectations. And we expect CapEx to be at a reduced level for fiscal 2016. And lastly on capital returns, in August 2015, the company declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 per share for Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This dividend is payable on October 21, 2015 with a record date for determining dividend entitlements of September 16, 2015.","To date, we\u2019ve repurchased about $3 million shares for $45 million, and have approximately $455 million remaining under our share purchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as opportunistic.","So in summary, fiscal 2015 was a very busy year for News Corp as we balanced ongoing operational efficiencies with prudent investments and strategic acquisitions to expand our global footprint and digital offerings. We initiated a capital return program and we are in the advanced stages of reviewing our strategic alternatives at Amplify. Overall, we ended the year with stable revenues, EBITDA growth and significant free cash flow. And we expect that to continue next year.","With that, let me turn back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Hi, thank you. Can you give us a little bit color on Amplify? I assume to some extent you\u2019re reviewing Amplify\u2019s Access products at the same time as the rest of the business. So, can you help us think about a timeline? How much is the savings from Access? And are you further scaling back investments in the remaining digital business for 2016? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","John, it\u2019s Robert here. First of all, I would like to say that the Amplify team has obviously done much innovative work and it is a very able team. But you can take from our messaging today that we are in the final phase of negotiation with a potential acquirer, and we\u2019re in an advanced stage of negotiation. And we have done a fair amount of institutional introspection, and the role that Amplify will play at News Corp is really different, apart from me saying that, that\u2019s inappropriate at this stage to go further.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Certainly, that question comes from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Good morning. My question is around realtor.com, and obviously, goods creating traffic that you see in there. Just in terms of the growth, what are the key drivers? Is the marketing which you spent within the business or are you benefiting from the Zillow-Trulia merger that\u2019s taking place at the moment? And just - or that last point is, given that Zillow is moving to a new pricing structure in this quarter, do you expect to benefit from that as well?","Robert Thomson","We prefer to focus on what we\u2019re doing rather than the complexity of the consolidation of Zillow and Trulia. What we particularly noticed is that, really what we expected to be the case, not in a cocky way, but in a confident way that the powerful platforms that News Corporation has would enable us to judge traffic.","What\u2019s particularly gratifying apart from the great work that Ryan O\u2019Hara and the team are doing at realtor is that the audience growth rate is continuing to increase. And so, if you look at our mobile audience, which is clearly key in the contemporary environment, in June that was up 79% year-on-year; so quarter-after-quarter, month-after-month, we are seeing increases in both audience and revenue. And we\u2019re very optimistic about the future.","Michael Florin","Thanks. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","And that question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you. My question is just on your commentary on The Wall Street Journal advertising trend. I think you mentioned that, they\u2019ve improved particularly coming into July. Can you talk about, I guess, how much of that do you think is sort of general industry trends versus some your internal efforts at The Journal? And, I guess, any specifics or any color on that front would be great. Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Well, it\u2019s certainly true that the trend has improved with The Journal. We started to see some improvements in Q4. What\u2019s particularly notable is tech advertising, which of itself tells you that, that those working in the digital world see the value of print as a platform, as well as the complementary of The Journal\u2019s print and digital products.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. That will come from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","Thank you. I just wanted to quickly close the loop on Amplify. Just for my learning purposes, is it fair to assume at this stage that somewhere in the range of $75 million to $100 million of expenses fall of the books now? And then, secondly on Move, you mentioned some profitably this year and more ahead. Can you just give us a little more detail in the magnitude and cadence of the ramp? Thank you.","Bedi Singh","I\u2019ll take the one on Amplify. I mean, clearly, look, as Robert said, we are in advanced stages of the strategic alternative process. We\u2019ve also previously said that we expect and Robert said that quite clearly, a meaningful reduction in sort of cash expenditures. But beyond that, we\u2019re not giving our numbers. It clearly would also depend on where we end up at the end of the strategic alternative process.","Robert Thomson","As far with revenue with realtor, and look at the little videos to make medium-term forecast. Frankly, specifically, given the current growth rate - that we identified in both traffic and revenue, in the fourth quarter revenue was up 32%. What was particularly gratifying and particularly distinct for the long-term performance of the company is that the areas that we focused on which is CoBroke and media advertising, which had not been a priority in the past are both growing at a higher rate than that 32%.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","And, moving on to Bill Bird with FBR.","William Bird","Hey, good evening. What\u2019s your perspective on realizing the full value of some your other assets like The Wall Street Journal, particularly given the recent sale of the FT for a very high multiple?","Robert Thomson","Well, I think, we\u2019ve always had great faith in the value of The Wall Street Journal. But, look, I\u2019ll let you do the math there. If the Financial Times is worth what the Nikkei Group paid, and The Wall Street Journal is a far larger, far more successful, far more profitable masthead, what\u2019s The Wall Street Journal worth.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","And that question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, I have a two part question, please. For the UK advertising, what was the percent change down in the quarter year-over-year with or without currency? And also just want to better understand, with the roughly $2 billion in net cash in the balance sheet, should investors most likely assume we\u2019ll be using that for acquisitions going forward. And then, that your free cash flow, much of that or part of that would go to capital returns? Thank you.","Bedi Singh","Hey, Craig. So in terms of the UK, I think - you should think about it within the context of sort of double-digit declines on advertising in local currency. I mean, we haven\u2019t given out the specific percentage, but that\u2019s what will feel consistent throughout the year, in the quarter, and we\u2019re kind of seeing that continuing into the new fiscal year.","And, with respect to sort of a cash balance and then the sort of annual cash flow, I think we said in the past that the way to think about cap returns within the context of our annual cash flow, and really the money that\u2019s on the balance sheet is for internal investments, acquisitions and other opportunistic things that we would want to do.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. That comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research Partners.","Douglas Middleton Arthur","Bedi, can you just review the programming sports right costs trends that you sort of see flowing. In fiscal 2016, you mentioned, so I thought it was the Rugby World Cup you mentioned - is there anything out there that could impact the year? Thanks.","Bedi Singh","For the year, in the first-half, they\u2019ll be playing the Rugby World Cup in September, October. So that\u2019s something different from what happened in fiscal 2015. Other than that, there is nothing else that\u2019s significant in terms of sports rights costs that\u2019s going to affect fiscal 2016.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","And next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for your time. Can you please provide some more color on how you are able to work the cost base so hard in the news and information division in the fourth quarter?","Bedi Singh","Well, I think if you look at the fourth quarter, we benefitted from two or three things. The first one was we\u2019ve been restructuring as you\u2019ve seen over the years, and so - the benefits of those restructurings have now started to flow through. So that was one piece of it. The other one was, in the UK last year we had mentioned that there was higher marketing expenses so there was a lapping improvement in the quarter with those two things.","And I think, generally, if you look at our sort of headcount across the businesses, that\u2019s been coming down and that benefit has also flowed through.","Robert Thomson","If I could just supplement Bedi\u2019s answer, when we spun the company off two years ago, we made clear that the extra focus and the shared benefits of that focus would - we expected reduced costs in our news division. So we are reducing duplication of technological platforms. We are reducing duplication of software investment and this is at time, of course, when you need a fair amount of software investment to remain contemporary and to take advantage of emerging platforms. But that extra focus has enabled our very able teams to do that without increasing the cost base in a way that bruises the business.","Michael Florin","Right. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi. I have a follow-up question, please. Can you just quickly review for us some, the opportunity to run realtor.com better than it was run before you bought it, please? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","It\u2019s clear that the new team at realtor.com has made a significant impact. We look it as just the start, but the early returns are certainly auspicious. We are continuing to work on driving traffic. We\u2019re continuing to work on driving revenue. And what is fair to say is that the returns thus far have exceeded our expectations, but also given as confidence in the future that realtor.com will become an important pillar of profitability for News Corp.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","And that question comes from Alice Bennett with CBA.","Alice Bennett","Hi, good morning. Just a clarifying question, I think for both Foxtel and for Move, you mentioned potentially being EBITDA breakeven in FY 2016. I just wanted to clarify, are you talking sort of run rate at the back end of the year or across the full-year talking EBITDA breakeven for those businesses?","Bedi Singh","Generally, we\u2019re not giving a sort of quarterly breakout. But, I would say, for Move, we are going to be EBITDA positive for the full-year. And Foxtel is going to see the improvement in its EBITDA growth compared to fiscal 2015.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Bill Bird with FBR.","William Bird","I was wondering and just back to Digital Real Estate, do you see a pathway to number one in U.S. Digital Real Estate like REA in Australia, just given the competitive dynamics and disruption at Zillow and Trulia? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","We certainly see a pathway. At the moment realtor.com is the fastest growing of the sites. As you know, it\u2019s moved from three to two, it was a year-ago, the slowest growing of the three sites. So the market is already being transformed. Secondly, the broader characteristics of U.S. real estate market are themselves auspicious. You\u2019re seeing from last year where there were about 5 million units in volume in property turnover in the states. That rate, the annual rate now is close to 5.5 million. You will have noticed the National Association of Realtors, our partner at realtor.com released some research earlier this week that in Q2, the vast majority of U.S. cities are seeing increases in property prices. So it\u2019s no longer just a lead markets of New York and San Francisco, LA and bits of Miami, it\u2019s a broader secular change in the property market itself, which indeed helps realtor.com.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","And next questions is from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Just follow-up for me around Fox Sports Australia, particularly, given that the deal was announced earlier this week around the purchase of the NRL rights, non-network. How do you see that positioning Fox Sports and the sort of uplift that we saw in the pricing, do you think that would be indicative for the next time you have to bid for those rights?","Robert Thomson","Entcho, as you well know, football rights are a context for themselves, and the match for NRL rights is probably at around half time and far from over. Really, all I can say more about football rights is that I personally an AFL tragic, for those needing translation that\u2019s Australia Rules aficionado. And the specific outcome that I want to see is this Saturday and that would be an Essendon victory.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Okay. That question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis","Yes. Just one clarification, since it sounds like Amplify is for sale, does that mean, it goes into disc ops, or would that not happen until a formal announcement?","Bedi Singh","John, I mean it\u2019s - all we can say is, we\u2019re looking at alternatives and it depends on where we end up at the end of that process.","Michael Florin","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Florin, for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Great. Well, thank you all for participating and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for your participation today."],"15600":["News Corp.

First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference. As a reminder today\u2019s presentation is being recorded. Members of the media are invited on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2015 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer.","We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take some questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp.\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp.\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2014 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call may include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used on this call, such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. As the results you\u2019re seeing today reflect we are off to a resounding start in our second fiscal year as the new News Corp. Our revenues, Segment EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings per share were all up from the prior year. Our broader goal of globalization and digitization is proceeding at pace with passion and purpose, as is the ongoing transition of our newspapers in the U.S., UK, and Australia.","Meanwhile, we are deepening our diverse portfolio with strategic acquisitions with significance. First, we closed the acquisition of Harlequin on August 1. The integration since the closing has been rapid and efficacious. We\u2019re expanding HarperCollins\u2019 reach and that of our authors across Europe, Latin America and Asia. We are finally focused on driving cost savings with the goal to improve efficiency, while delivering higher quality content across multiple platforms and markets. And we are taking steps to leverage and monetize the extensive Harlequin backed catalog.","Second, we announced along with REA Group in Australia plans to acquire Move, home of Realtor.com, expanding our real estate footprint in the large but still nascent U.S. digital property marketplace. This is a transforming acquisition of the new News. One that we expect will have significant benefits for years to come and that clearly complements our existing platforms.","I will expand on this theme later on my prologue. Meanwhile, we continue to enhance and refresh our digital offerings across the globe, including the launch of the new Wall Street Journal app, the development of Sun+ in the UK and the refreshing of our metro mastheads in Australia. There is increased collaboration across divisions, resulting in a more coherent digital strategy, more creative products and more compelling offerings for our customers.","Looking now at the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, some general observations, the advertising headwinds in Australia have dissipated. The results for our businesses there showed real and hard won improvement in revenues and in EBITDA, the green shoots appear to have taken root. But we will continue to invest in our sales teams and cherish our unique content.","HarperCollins and REA again showed considerable strength, contributing much to both our top and bottom line, providing even more evidence that we can build a profitable future on these core pillars. We are seeing sequential improvements at the Dow Jones professional information business, and are confident that we are on the right track. Advertising at The Wall Street Journal has been robust in recent weeks, with October showing solid gains versus the prior year, driven largely by print advertising.","Long term trends remain difficult to predict but we are happy with the contemporary trend. We will, however, never allow ourselves the sin of complacency. News America Marketing continues to show strength in the in-store category, highlighting the importance of point-of-purchase, which we believe has only become more valuable in a fragmenting media world. Free-standing inserts have been softer in recent weeks and will be a focus of particular attention in coming months.","And Amplify has shown some gains, as the business has started moving from the development stage to the all-important sales stage. The coming school season will be crucial for the company as the sales cycle intensifies.","In general, progress is solid because we\u2019ve had a cogent and consistent plan for News Corp. We are purposefully executing on that strategy and continue to be diligent in confronting costs. Integral to that digital and global strategy has been the diversity and complementarity of our portfolio, which was distinctive from day one and has since been enhanced. This powerful portfolio has provided the opportunity for growth even with the ad-market somewhat uncertain and visibility obscured.","We have clearly come far over the past 15 months. The acquisitions of Storyful, Harlequin and we expect eminently Move; the retooling of Dow Jones professional information business; the launch of the new curriculum at Amplify; the growth of REA in Australia and its expanding reach in Asia. However, these initiatives have not blurred our focus on driving improved operating efficiencies around the company and the world. We believe we are uniquely positioned for growth, particularly as technology advances our platform capabilities and stimulates the appetite for and access to the kind of premium compelling content we create and distribute.","As for the quarter, the positive results underscore while we are humbly confident in executing our long term plan. Today\u2019s numbers show the power of our provenance and our prospects. While newspapers are part of the foundation of the company and always will be, we are not just a newspaper publisher. We are a content-and-technology company with unique but complementary assets, and a balanced revenue mix.","Some high level numbers on which Bedi will elaborate eloquently. For the quarter our reported revenues grew 4% to $2.2 billion, a notable improvement since last quarter. And reported total segment EBITDA grew by 21%, importantly our adjusted EBITDA grew 18% and free cash flow available to News Corp. grew by $83 million. Among the highlights of the first quarter was book publishing.","HarperCollins\u2019 adjusted segment EBITDA which excludes Harlequin and certain other items grew over 20% this quarter. As the Divergent series continue to pay dividends and show the undoubted virtue of our blockbuster book.","Meanwhile, we have never been more excited about digital real estate and REA\u2019s success this quarter helps to explain why. Revenue growth was 24% and segment EBITDA increased 30%. The company\u2019s vast trove of expertise will be critical to the future growth of realtor.com in the U.S. and our other online properties. While we have been candid about the challenges facing our newspapers we are seeing more encouraging trends in advertising and circulation revenue. We remain conscious that the sector is in transition but believe that we have the scale and the skills to succeed.","To focus on a few brands, The Times in the UK is delivering both volume and higher revenue per subscriber. Digital which already accounts for nearly one-third of paid sales has been growing at a double-digit rate. At the Sun we launched our tablet app integrated with sports clips and marketed with the Dream Team Fantasy League. And while it\u2019s still early, we are pleased with the progress and the number of Sun+ members has increased remarkedly. We are still monitoring churn and will have formal metrics for you later this month.","At The Wall Street Journal we are now seeing momentum restored. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve launched a new iPad app and added a subscriber membership program through WSJ+, inspired by our success in London with The Times. Our team at the journal under Will Lewis is working hard to grow subscriptions with simplified pricing, new products and enhancements and international expansion. We just launched digitally Barrons Asia and expanded the burgeoning WSJ magazine to Latin America.","At News Australia, we\u2019ve launched our next generation tablet apps for the metro mastheads and are advertisers a seamless cross-platform product. We will as one must continue to iterate and improve the offerings. We are capitalizing on the strength of The Australian by publishing a new business section to attract advertisers and readers, and leveraging some content from The Wall Street Journal, in another example of cross-border cross-fertilization.","Turning to Digital Education, we had a solid quarter, led by our early grade hybrid product offerings. Feedback from the launch of our Digital ELA curriculum and math offerings has been positive. And we believe they position Amplify strongly for the upcoming sales cycle.","Before I conclude and turn things over to Bedi for more statistical specifics, let me return briefly to the subject of Move. We are even more excited about its potential then when we announced plans to the acquisition in September. It is increasingly clear that the U.S. online real estate market is fragmented and at a rather really stage of its evolution compared to markets elsewhere in the world. Move has the freshest, most accurate listings and a strong relationship with realtors.","These assets will soon be complemented by the powerful media platforms at the heart of News Corp., including The Wall Street Journal and News America Marketing. We will have compelling content and unique brand-building potency and technological savvy. All of which are crucial ingredients in the sprint to success.","And we\u2019ll have the great advantage of involvement by REA, our majority owned Australian online property company, whose own success is legend and which will be able to share valuable learning and lessons with Move. An estimated $14 billion will be spent on the marketing of properties this year by real estate agents and brokers in the United States.","And that figure does not include rentals on mortgage financing. We expect the recent relaxation of mortgage lending restrictions will also help stimulate the housing market, which has yet to recover full health after the financial crisis. The combination of the shift to Digital Marketing and the broader economic trends are certainly auspicious. Realtor.com will allow us to gather important data of value to our other properties. When a purchaser indentifies an interest in a home in Tribeca or Tous [ph] they are potential Wall Street Journal subscribers. We will be able to repurpose that permission data for our other partners and clients.","We anticipate that it will be a rich source of monetizable intelligence about a desirable demographic, while there is much hard work ahead we believe the rewards of Realtor.com will be real for all of our shareholders. We remain committed to a balanced long-term approach to capital allocation among organic investment, strategic M&A, and the return of capital. As evidenced by the Move deal, our strategy is to pursue new opportunities where we can use our global platform and scale, opportunities which inherently complement and extend our expertise.","Now, let me turn it over to Bedi, who\u2019ll provide background detail on the positive results we\u2019re announcing today.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks Robert. First, I would like to share with you some high level financial highlights, and then we will discuss each segment in further detail.","We reported fiscal 2015 first quarter total revenue of $2.2 billion, a 4% increase versus a prior year period revenues of $2.1 billion. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were up 1% compared to the prior year.","Turning to EBITDA, we reported total Segment EBITDA of $170 million, which was a 21% increase versus the prior year period. Results this quarter include $14 million of costs related to the UK Newspaper Matters, net of indemnification. Excluding that cost and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, our adjusted total Segment EBITDA grew by 18% versus the prior year.","Reported EPS were $0.11 versus $0.05, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, UK Newspaper Matters costs and other one-time items, adjusted EPS were $0.09 versus $0.03 in the prior year. Free cash flow available to News Corporation improved by $83 million from negative $10 million in the prior year to positive $73 million in the first quarter.","As Robert noted, the results demonstrate both the breadth of our portfolio and our diversification, across geographies, lines of business and revenue mix. We significantly grew our EBITDA and our free cash flow amid a still challenging ad-market albeit we saw lower declines in Australian and at The Wall Street Journal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The results today are the product of prudent reinvestment, improved market share and ongoing operating efficiencies.","Just to highlight a few themes. We\u2019ve been diligent on costs and we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to drive further efficiencies. We\u2019re going to reinvest in Digital but that should lead to a more profitable company. Of note, within our News and Information Services segment we grew EBITDA at News Australia this quarter, thanks to cost management, lower advertising declines and higher pricing across many of our metro mastheads. While we have been candid about some of the challenges at our News and Information Services segment, our hope is to show stabilization this year. And I think we\u2019re off to an encouraging start.","We are also strengthening two of our core pillars, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing. Those of which contributed significantly to our strong top and bottom line results this quarter. We believe adding Move to our platform will be another leg to growth, and another significant step towards further digitalization of News. We anticipate the Move deal to close in the current quarter and we\u2019ll have more to talk on this next quarter. We\u2019re also very pleased with the integration of Harlequin, as we focus both on cost savings and leveraging the foreign language footprint.","We also remained very focused on free cash flow and despite the impact on capital spending related to the companies London Relocation, as well as continued investment spending and Amplify. We still significantly improved our free cash flow versus the prior year period. Our goal remains to reshape the growth profile of News Corp. through prudent investment and cost discipline, and we think that the results today are a testament to that.","With that as a brief overview, let\u2019s look at the first quarter performance for each of the key segments.","In News and Information Services revenues for the quarter declined $44 million, or 3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted segment revenues also declined 3%. Within these segment revenues, advertising declined around 7% this quarter, a consecutive improvement from the 9% decline in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.","Looking at advertising across our key publishing units, at News Corp. Australia, ad revenues declined around 5% or 6% in local currency for the quarter and showed particular strength in September. This is a consecutive improvement compared to a decline of 16% or 11% in local currency in the fourth quarter of 2014. We saw strong improvements in the national real estate and auto categories.","At News UK, advertising revenues declined around 6% or 13% in local currency, relatively consistent with fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 impacted by weakness in retail, telecom and finance. News UK advertising continued to remain challenged through October as a result of general market softness.","And at The Wall Street Journal, advertising declined high-single digits this quarter, impacted by tougher year-ago comparisons, but we saw an improvement from fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, and gained momentum through the quarter led by our digital offerings. Whilst it is early and booking cycles remained short, The Wall Street Journal has shown strong improvement in October driven by two categories, finance and technology.","At News America Marketing, in-store advertising improved 10% but this was offset by declines in free-standing inserts, which had been under pressure in the quarter and continued into October. Total circulation and subscription revenues for the quarter declined 1%, driven primarily by continued softness in professional information business at Dow Jones, which had a negative $13 million impact to revenues this quarter. However again, this was an improvement versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, as we continued to make progress to stabilize and retain existing Factiva customers.","Total newspaper circulation revenues showed modest growth, mostly driven by subscription and cover price increases across a number of our mastheads to offset print volume declines, although as Robert mentioned we did see print volume growth at The Times in the UK. We continued to evaluate our pricing across all our mastheads with an eye on both competition and most importantly consumer value. And to that point and it\u2019s worth highlighting that we have recently restructured the subscription pricing for The Wall Street Journal in early October for new customers, which raises the price to the print digital bundle to $32.99, and for digital only to $28.99, representing a $4 per month increase for both offerings.","We've also eliminated the historical discount with digital versus print, taking a page from the success of the times in the UK as Robert noted. Segment EBITDA decreased $28 million in the quarter, or 21% as compared to the prior-year period, and Adjusted Segment EBITDA was down 19%. Included in segment EBITDA was $14 million related to the relocation of our London operations with dual rent another facility costs, which accounted for half of the year-over-year percentage decline. Our second fiscal quarter should be the last quarter of the dual rent P&L impact.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues improved 24% and Segment EBITDA grew 28% versus the prior year quarter. Reported EBITDA this quarter includes approximately $5 million of Harlequin-related transaction fees. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed on August 1, and the related transaction fees, the impact from the divestiture of the live events business last year, and foreign currency fluctuations, Adjusted Revenues grew by 6% and Adjusted Segment EBITDA by 23%.","Total e-book net sales for the quarter grew 28%, and accounted for 22% of consumer revenues. Excluding Harlequin, e-book revenue growth was 8%. The Divergent series continues to sell very well this quarter, totaling over $3.5 million net units, modestly above last quarter, and includes the impact from a new title for a Divergent Collection. We also have solid contributions in general books, and Steve Harvey\u2019s Act Like a Success, and Daniel Silva\u2019s The Heist, and carryover demand in Christian publishing from Sarah Young\u2019s Jesus Calling.","This week we announced plans to close our HarperCollins Canada warehouse and consolidated distribution in North America. This is part of our long-term strategy to streamline distribution operations, which will lead to significant cost savings. While it\u2019s early in the integration with Harlequin, we've been very pleased with the progress to-date. We are actively looking for cost saving opportunities in a number of overlapping territories. At this point we would expect aggregate cost savings to approximate those at Thomas Nelson, which was over $20 million.","Although, it will take some time as we exit contractual commitments and renegotiate manufacturing terms to realize the (inaudible). We are also beginning to tap into the Harlequin network with the recently announced expansion of our public (inaudible) program in Germany, with additional markets planned in the future, and we also announced a foreign language deal with top author Daniel Silva other than the pipeline.","Finally, we announced a subscription offering for Harlequin with Scribd for backlist titles as we look to further monetize its valuable catalog and leverage HarperCollins existing digital distribution relationships. As I mentioned last quarter, core HarperCollins does face tough comps this year due to the success of the Divergent series last year. The majority of the Divergent units having been sold in fiscal second quarter and third quarter of the prior year.","In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved $7 million, or 5% compared to the prior year. Subscription revenues grew 9% benefiting primarily from higher affiliate fees from Foxtel and increased subscribers. Advertising revenues declined modestly impacted by a soft marketplace and a tough prior year comparison related to election spending and the absence of two major events a bit later this year, namely the Lions Rugby Tour and the Ashes Cricket Series.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was up 10% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, Adjusted Revenues increased 4% and Adjusted Segment EBITDA improved by 10%. In Digital Real Estate Services, revenues increased $22 million, or 24% compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting higher pricing and uptake of premium products.","Segment EBITDA increased $13 million, or 30% this quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the increased revenue. Reported results also include roughly $2 million in fees incurred at the end of September for the proposed acquisition of Move. Excluding adverse foreign currency impact and the Move transaction costs, Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Segment EBITDA grew 23% and 32% respectively.","At Digital Education, revenues increased $15 million compared to the prior year, or 56%, driven by the adoption of our K-5 print, digital hybrid learning products and from higher tablet sales. Segment EBITDA improved $27 million to a loss of $24 million, about $15 million of that was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA product and the balance from improved top line.","In our others segment, excluding the UK Newspaper Matter costs, Adjusted Segment EBITDA was relatively flat at negative $41 million compared to negative $40 million in the prior year. With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.6 million total subscribers, up 5% versus the prior year driven by higher digital platform subscribers.","Cable and satellite churn improved to 10.9% compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Foxtel revenues for the quarter grew 1% due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and growth in subscriber revenues. And EBITDA increased around 2% versus the prior year quarter due to the subscriber revenue growth offset by increased operating expenses resulting from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.","Foxtel launched its new revamped pricing and packaging on Monday November 3, with an expectation of improvement in cable and satellite subscriber penetration over the course of the year. We'll provide an update on progress in next quarter.","Turning now to cash flow, News Corp's cash flow from operations improved to $183 million, compared to $59 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp. improved to $73 million, compared to negative $10 million in the prior year. We continue to expect full-year CapEx to be relatively similar to the prior year at approximately $400 million. This includes around $70 million to complete the London relocation and $60 million related to capitalized software Amplify.","Our corporate overhead and strategy group costs are expected to be at a similar level with that in fiscal 2014. And at Digital Education, we continue to expect our total cash investment spend to be relatively similar in fiscal 2015 at over $200 million, including approximately $60 million of capitalized content development costs. EBITDA for fiscal 2015 though is expected to improve by, at least, the amount capitalized.","So just to summarize, we believe this quarter demonstrates that News Corp. is on the right track and we are confident the steps we've taken both investments and cost discipline are positioning the company for long-term growth and equally important higher value per share.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Robert, can you give us more color on what you are seeing in print advertising at the journal, with some of the weakness in national advertising in TV and cable, it\u2019s a bit of a surprise. And so I guess, was the tech money broad, that it\u2019d support a particular launch, does it have legs in Australia how are current print trends looking there? Thanks.","Robert Thomson","John, look, obviously we are not pretending to be soothsayers, so we are not giving you long-term forecasts. But what we did see in particular at the journal and both in print, but particularly in print, but also in digital was their recovery in finance and tech advertising, and that is encouraging. And it\u2019s so far so good this quarter and we are talking in terms of year-on-year guidance.","In Australia, the team under Julian Clarke, have done a sterling job in retooling the business. And I think partly there the improvement in trading conditions is today in large part together focused again on the local advertising. The team is dedicated in its pursuit of clients and its servicing of clients, and so that has absolutely contributed to the improvement we are seeing there.","And in essence, what you\u2019ve got in Australia now if you wanted to typify it topographically with topographically is that, the Mary River had silted up, and that river is now flowing again.","Michael Florin","Okay. Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Yes, I want to ask about your Amplify division, you mentioned that you are heading into an active selling season. We are a good couple of months into the fall semester with a lot of common core sales for schools now underway. Just wondered, if you could comment on what you have done, and what you think the timeframe is of upcoming Amplify sales please?","Robert Thomson","Well, we're seeing sales across five states and range of districts from Seminole County in Florida to Spokane in Washington. The sale season for us, quite frankly will get more intense later in the fiscal year. And as the product is rolled out, you like us in these very public contracts will have a sense of how we\u2019re fairing.","Michael Florin","Okay. Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to Doug Arthur with Evercore.","Douglas Arthur \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Yes, Bedi, you talked about the dual rent in London dissipating next quarter, what can you add in terms of sort of the underlying cost trends in news and information for the balance of the years?","Bedi Ajay Singh","I think, we've been pleased with these operating efficiencies we see in news and information services, particularly in Australia, where they have been taking out quite a bit of cost, and the sort of backroom operations. And I think, we would expect that sort of pace to sort of continue for the remainder of the year. The London building this quarter was double rental $14 million, I think, it will be similar for next quarter and then we're done. So that would obviously dissipate for quarters three and four, so there will be improvement just as a result of that.","Michael Florin","","Okay. Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.","Alexia Quadrani \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Thank you. My question is on your acquisition strategy, you\u2019ve made two very different acquisitions recently, Harlequin and then Move, one publishing and one an online real estate. I guess, my \u2013 you did talk a little bit about what your priorities are in terms of when you look for these deals and able to leverage your global franchise when you bring them under your fold. But if you could give us any more color in terms of, are there certain segments of the markets that you are more focused on versus others, I guess, is there any other priorities you take into consideration?","Robert Thomson","Alexia, I think we made clear at the very first Investor Day that we were particularly interested in digital acquisitions. We would focus on the U.S. and global expansion and not so much Europe, a little more Asia, for example, but in particular, they have to be assets to complement our existing assets. They have to be extensions of our expertise, and we have to be able to use our existing platforms in a way to ensure that the new companies become platforms in profitability.","And that\u2019s very much the case with Harlequin, and it\u2019s clearly the case with Move, where in each case, we have an existing skill set. We see, yes, synergies there, but we also see the potential for growth that is wheel, and it\u2019s the potential for growth based upon experience and expertise in the company as it exist. So these are not eccentric purchases, these are extensions of that expertise.","Michael Florin","","Okay. Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","We'll go to Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael Morris \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Thanks, guys. With respect to the price changes at The Wall Street Journal, I apologies if I didn\u2019t hear this, but when did those price changes take place or when do they take place. And then also I know, you\u2019ve been sensitive about the impact to subscriber numbers of changing price, what was the pattern that you saw at the times when you made a similar change there? Thanks.","Bedi Ajay Singh","So the new pricing as I said the full package is $32.99, that came into effect just now in October, and it\u2019s the new customers. So that\u2019s what we've done for the full package, the print and web and mobile is $28.99.","Michael Florin","","Okay. Operator, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Adam Alexander.","Adam Alexander \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Good afternoon. Just touching on the Foxtel process, they were launched this week in Australia with a 50% cut on the base package, just wondering relatively, if you could give us a bit of a data on what sort of spin-down we might see, and whether or not that\u2019ll have a top line impact on Foxtel revenue in the coming quarters?","Robert Thomson","Adam, it\u2019s a little early for us to give you any forecast along those lines. I think, what we can say is that, process is being in operation for a week. Apart from offering discounts from new subscribers, what we are offering in our premium packages to existing subscribers and look out the early inquiring that we have is at the call center activity has been encouraging. But I think it\u2019s better for us to wait till the next quarter to give you more fully formed some figures.","Michael Florin","Okay. Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners, LLC","","Yes, I am just curious, your Move acquisition Realtor.com, what you\u2019re going to do on the management front there with REA? Are they going to \u2013 are you going to lean heavily on the REA management to run this thing or are you going to use people in-house of your existing company or are you going to keep the current management in place or how is that all going to work, please?","Robert Thomson","","Look, clearly REA\u2019s expertise will be a benefit to Move, but we\u2019re not going to use that work expertise to an extent that it would damage REA itself and we are very, very conscious of that. I think, what you have to understand about Move is that, we\u2019re extremely confident that we can accelerate growth in traffic and revenue without excessive investment, given the resources we have at our disposal and they\u2019re not just REA resources, but when you think about at The Wall Street Journal Digital Network, where you\u2019re getting a half-a-billion page views a month, complementing the large number of page views and traffic that you get at realtor.com.","And so and when you look at what typical real state advertising website need, you need a media platform, we have that; you need compelling content, we have that; and you need a tech and software expertise, we have that. And we have those things without having to excessively invest.","Craig Huber \u2013 Huber Research Partners, LLC.","Thank you.","Michael Florin","Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to Andrew Levy with Macquarie Securities.","Andrew Levy \u2013 Macquarie Securities Ltd.","Thank you. My question was just on the FOX SPORTS, presumably Foxtel is going to get a pickup in subscribers from the price changes you put through. I\u2019m just wondering if FOX SPORTS gets a full carry-through from any additional subscriber growth or whether the deal with Foxtel is being re-cut to accommodate the price changes that they have put through.","Bedi Ajay Singh","","To the extent Foxtel picks up a new subscriber who opts for the sports package, they will be a full flow-through into FOX SPORTS.","Robert Thomson","Just to further it out, about \u2013 and look on past patterns, about 80% of Foxtel subscribers pick up the FOX SPORTS package, or\u2026","Andrew Levy \u2013 Macquarie Securities Ltd.","And have you \u2013 sorry about that. I was just going to say, the view historically been the same for all Foxtel subscribers or just the sports package subscribers in the FOX SPORTS?","Michael Florin","","Andrew, can you repeat that question?","Andrew Levy \u2013 Macquarie Securities Ltd.","Yes, the question was, historically, did FOX SPORTS receive a payment on total Foxtel subscribers or just on Foxtel subscribers who took the sports package?","Bedi Ajay Singh","People who took the sports package.","Andrew Levy \u2013 Macquarie Securities Ltd.","Okay, thank you.","Michael Florin","","Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Justin Diddams with Citi.","Justin Diddams \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","","Morning, guys. Thanks for your time, a question for me is on using information services, given the trends you\u2019re seeing in each of the businesses do you think it\u2019s acceptable to expect that we can see revenue growth in the back-end of the year in each business?","Robert Thomson","It\u2019s probably not reasonable, Justin, to expect us to give you a forecast along those lines. What we can say is that the trends last quarter in particular in Australia, the advertising trends with the journal in October in recent weeks, these have been positive trends relative to last year. But we\u2019re also very frank with you, it is difficult for us to see long-term trends at the moment given that the power of the spot market. And therefore in predictive terms spottiness of the statistics we have at our disposal.","So what we do have been in London, in Australia and at Dow Jones, are teams who are working very, very hard to get the most out of their businesses. They\u2019ve been very institutionally perspective on costs. They\u2019re asking all the right existential expense questions and we\u2019re very proud of the effort that those teams are making.","Michael Florin","Thanks, Justin. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go to Fraser McLeish with Credit Suisse.","Fraser McLeish \u2013 Credit Suisse Ltd.","Thanks. And I just like to follow-up on the question that Andrew asked on FOX SPORTS, can you just confirm has there been any change in the amount you get per FOX SPORTS subscriber as a result of the overall pricing changes or is that still the same as it was before? Thanks.","Bedi Ajay Singh","So we\u2019re not disclosing specific pricing, but generally you can take it that, it\u2019s along the same sort of lines that we had before.","Fraser McLeish \u2013 Credit Suisse Ltd.","All right, thank you.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Thanks, Fraser. Operator, we will take our next question.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han \u2013 Morningstar Australasia Pty Ltd.","Hi, thanks. As we think about the Move acquisition going forward and Robert, you\u2019ve already mentioned the brand building potency of News Corp. itself. But, do you have any special marketing relationship with Fox Media properties or is that all on an arm\u2019s length basis?","Robert Thomson","Clearly, we\u2019ll be involved in negotiations with our friends at Fox, but we look \u2013 we\u2019ve got News America Marketing and the free-standing insert business. We have the National Association of Realtors, which this year has invested around $30 million in marketing and we intend to strengthen our relationship to ensure that the complementarity of the marketing at our marketing. So combined the sum of those parts will be a very, very powerful platform, because we\u2019re conscious quite obviously that marketing can be expensive. But when we calculated the benefits of buying Move, clearly we have a comparative advantage, when it comes to brand building and traffic driving.","Michael Florin","","Operator, are there any additional questions?","Operator","This time there are no further questions in the queue.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Media will be on a listen-only basis.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Aaron. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2019 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Mike. News Corp reported increased profitability and revenue growth during the first-half of fiscal 2019, highlighting the power of premium content and authenticated audiences in a fact-challenged world that craves credibility.","For the second quarter, the company saw 21% revenue growth and a 13% rise in total segment EBITDA, reflecting the consolidation of Foxtel and a healthy expansion of revenues at HarperCollins, Dow Jones and REA Group.","More generally, at News and Information Services, we saw a continuation of positive trends in paid digital subscriptions and digital advertising in Australia and the U.S., where growth mitigated declines in print revenue. Even though, our teams have been diligent in pursuing revenue opportunities, the digital world remains somewhat dysfunctional and subject to intensifying scrutiny.","We are in a world of exponential evolution, in which dominant players have the potential to manipulate markets for data, products, advertising, news and ideas. There is no doubt that some of these companies are arbitraging algorithmic ambiguity and hoping that regulators do not fully appreciate or define their dominance in certain sectors.","When one company controls much of the U.S. consumer audiobook market and has its own products in that market and can tweak its algorithm at will, the potential for abuse is almost limitless. It is clear that there has been a regulatory awakening and the time has come for a regulatory reckoning.","Turning now to our own businesses, which are certainly conscious of their responsibilities as custodians of customer data. It is clear that the ongoing digital transformation of Dow Jones is efficacious. Many traditional media companies are ailing, but that is certainly not the case of The Wall Street Journal, where paid digital subscribers grew 23% to over $1.7 million.","Dow Jones overall has approximately 3.2 million total subscribers, 13% higher year-over-year. Elsewhere in the Dow Jones family, MarketWatch saw strong gains this quarter, with visits up 45% year-over-year according to [indiscernible], while Barron\u2019s grew its total subscribers 27% year-over-year.","The Professional Information business at Dow Jones also continues to show progress, with risk and compliance reporting a 26% increase in revenues. There has now been in excess of 25% year-over-year revenue growth for seven consecutive quarters.","At the times in the UK, print advertising revenues rose for the fifth consecutive quarter. The Times and Sunday Times saw solid growth in digital subscribers, while the Sun continues as the UK\u2019s number one news brand across print and digital combined according to the latest PAMCO survey.","Last month, we made an application to the UK government to allow sensible sharing resources and cost reduction across The Times and The Sunday Times. The editorial independence and uniqueness of these PLS publications will be protected, but there are clearly areas of cost duplication and we want to ensure the very best use of our financial and of our journalistic resources.","Chris Evans, the gifted legendary radio broadcaster joined Wireless Group\u2019s Virgin Radio last month and the audience growth has been remarkable. To put the impact and the potential in perspective, during the first day of Chris\u2019 show, Virgin Radio saw more up downloads with digital listening than in all of 2018.","The breakfast program also deployed unique sponsorship partnership with Sky, so that the flow was not disrupted by conventional ad breaks. That model has already proven its worth and is likely to be replicated elsewhere on the radio roster.","At News Australia, profitability improved. Thanks to continued digital advertising growth and cost efficiencies. news.com.au. was again the number one news website, significantly ahead of its competitors, reaching almost 10 million unique users in the month of December according to Nielsen.","Meanwhile, The Australian, where digital paid subscriptions account for more than half of the total subscriber base, we saw strong digital subscription growth this quarter, up 23% year-over-year.","Since we brought together Foxtel and FOX SPORTS Australia, we have made extensive changes in management, enhanced the sports and entertainment portfolio and upgraded the technology. Average audiences across FOX SPORTS Australia channels are up over 70% year-over-year, with the addition of live cricket boosting viewership during the summer, traditionally a relatively quiet period for customer acquisition.","Our new sports streaming product, Kayo, has certainly changed the traditional trend. As of February 5, Kayo had attracted over 115,000 users, of which approximately 100,000 were paid. And we expect that number to increase markedly as we head into the peak selling season for the more popular winter sports, Australian football and rugby league. It is clear in a competitive world of content that the passion for sport drives subscription growth and Foxtel has by far the best collection of that cherished content.","In our Digital Real Estate Services segment, REA Group in Australia continues to outperform the competition, posting robust results, despite a challenging listings environment, driven by strong residential growth and the inclusion of the data services business, which was not in the prior comparative period.","The continued success of REA would not have been possible without the leadership of Tracey Fellows. She will be driving global expansion and seeking new opportunities for our fastest revenue-growing segment in her new role as President of Global Digital Real Estate at News Corp.","Since the creation of the new News Corp in 2013, Digital Real Estate Service revenues have more than tripled and segment EBITDA has more than doubled. The appointment of Tracey underscores our increasing commitment to the sector. We are particularly pleased that Owen Wilson has become the new Chief Executive of REA, where he is overseeing strategy, M&A and operations, all of which have thrived.","Turning to U.S. real estate, our long-term optimism is undiminished, even as shorter-term trading in the property market has been somewhat sluggish. As evidence of the enduring strength of our business, real estate revenues at the operator realtor.com, Moving, we\u2019re up 23% this quarter, with total revenues up 11%. This includes Opcity, the acquisition of which we successfully closed in October. Its strategic importance is evident in the higher-quality value-added leads it provides with brokers about potential clients.","Unlike a certain other company in the sector, we are not in the business of flagrantly flipping houses or covertly competing with our clients. Our aim is to provide the best possible service to buyers, sellers and realtors.","In Book Publishing, HarperCollins delivered another outstanding performance this quarter. Fostered by bestselling titles, such as Homebody by Joanna Gaines, and Girl Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, both of whom are set to publish new titles in the current quarter. And in the UK, also very successful with The Ice Monster by the irrepressible David Walliams. Digital sales also grew 12% in the prior year, driven by a 58% increase in the sales of audiobooks.","Our results this quarter and for the first-half of the fiscal year demonstrate the power of our premium products and reflect our ongoing digital transformation, which is building a muscular platform for the future and for our investors.","Now Susan will provide incisive insights into the finer details of our accounts.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2019 second quarter total revenues were over $2.6 billion, up 21% versus the prior year and total segment EBITDA was $370 million, up 13% versus the prior year. Results reflect the impact of the consolidation of Foxtel.","On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues increased 3% and EBITDA increased 2%.","For the quarter, earnings per share were $0.16, as compared to a loss of $0.14 in the prior year, which included a charge related to the U.S. tax reform. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.18 in the quarter versus $0.24 in the prior year.","Turning now to the Individual Operating segment. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion, down 3% versus the prior year. Currency had a $34 million negative impact accounting for more than half the decline.","Within the segment, reported revenues at Dow Jones rose to 4%; News UK declined 10%; News Australia declined 5%, although it was relatively stable in local currency; and News America Marketing fell 7%. Approximately 32% of the segment\u2019s revenues were digital, up from 29% in the prior year.","Moving on to the segment highlights. Advertising revenues accounted for 50% of segment revenues and were down 5% versus the prior year, with approximately $18 million, or 2% being due to currency fluctuations. Second quarter advertising trends across our new businesses improved modestly from the prior quarter ratio.","At Dow Jones, advertising revenues were flat with the prior year. Digital advertising revenues improved significantly, both year-over-year and sequentially, offsetting print declines. The improvement was driven by strong programmatic growth, resulting from audience going to MarketWatch.","At News Australia, advertising declined 7%, but down just 1% in local currency, again, showing moderating declines versus the prior quarter, with improvements in the rate of print declines and strong year-over-year gains in digital. On the digital front, we saw further expansion of news.com.au, a national news portal and news extend a small to medium business offering.","News UK advertising fell 8% versus the prior year, or down 4% in local currency, due mostly to soft print trends at the Sun, which had challenging prior year comparisons. We saw modestly higher print advertising revenues at the time.","Finally, at News America Marketing, advertising revenues fell 7% due to weak home delivered revenues, which included FSI products and lower install advertising revenues, which were partly impacted by the timing of product campaigns.","Turning now to circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 42% of segment revenues. We saw an increase of 1%, with foreign currency negatively impacting these revenues by $12 million, or 2%.","We are continuing to see very healthy digital paid subscriber growth, which has been a core strategic focus and key to improved performance. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 7%, benefiting from strong pay digital-only subscriber growth at The Wall Street Journal, which were up 23% year-over-year to over $1.7 million, and an increase of 125,000 subscribers from the first quarter. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 67% of total subscribers at The Wall Street Journal, up from 60% last year.","In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscriber growth at The Times and The Sunday Times, up 22% to 269,000 and at News Australia, up 18% to over 460,000. In Australia, cover price increases and rising digital sales offset print volume declines, while circulation revenues were down modestly in the UK.","Turning to segment EBITDA. News and Information Services segment EBITDA was $120 million, down 15%, mainly driven by the clients in the UK from lower revenues, including the exit of Sun Bets and higher expenses related to newsprint prices. However, we again had increased contribution at both Dow Jones and News Australia.","Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues were $562 million versus $120 million a year ago. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $84 million versus $33 million in the prior year.","On a pro forma basis, reflecting the Foxtel transaction, segment revenues in the quarter decreased $69 million, or 11% compared with the prior year, an improvement from the first quarter decrease of 17%. $39 million of the decline, or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations.","Broadcast trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base, higher ARPU costs and mix shift to lower. The subscription revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in Foxtel Now revenues.","Broadcast ARPU was A$78, down about 3% versus the prior year, reflecting a 2% negative impact from the new revenue standard. Compared to the first quarter, broadcast ARPU was up over 2%, reflecting a price increase implemented on October 1.","Pro forma segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $71 million, or 46% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decline reflects the lower revenues, higher sports programming and production costs, including approximately $26 million of costs related to Cricket Australia and about $9 million for marketing related to the commercial launch of Kayo Sports. This level of reinvestment was consistent with our expectations, as we focus on better positioning Foxtel for future growth.","On operating metrics, Foxtel\u2019s total closing subscribers were approximately 2.9 million as of December 31, up 4% against the prior year, driven by higher Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports subscriptions and the inclusion of commercial subscribers of Fox Sports Australia.","In terms of the subscriber mix, about 2.5 million subscribers were broadcast and commercial, the remainder were Foxtel Now and Kayo Sports subscribers. We launched Kayo Sports in late November and are very pleased with the early adoption.","As Robert mentioned, we had 115,000 subscribers as of February 5, of which approximately 100,000 were paid subscribers and expect to see it scale into the important winter sports selling season.","Pleasingly, the Kayo Sports user base is engaged with average viewing time per active user currently at 69 minutes per day, with over 70% watching live video and smartphone being the primary device.","In the second quarter, broadcast churn was 15.6% versus 14.5% in the prior year, which was mainly impacted by the October price rise. Churn management is a major focus for the team in Australia, and we\u2019re investing to better utilize data and advanced analytics to predict churn going forward in order for the business to be much more proactive with customized solution through attention and win back. Capital expenditures related to new Foxtel was $139 million in the first-half, which would have been down modestly had we consolidated Foxtel in the prior year.","At Book Publishing, we posted another very solid quarter, driven by strong sales in general books with the release of Joanna Gaines Homebody and The Next Person You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom; as well as Rachel Hollis, Girl, Wash Your Face in Christian publishing.","Revenues for the quarter increased 6% to $496 million and segment EBITDA increased 13% to $88 million, and both achieved record levels for HarperCollins. This growth came despite recent tighter supply conditions of both paper and bookbinding across the industry.","Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, consistent with the previous quarter, and represented 17% of consumer revenues, up from 16% last year. Downloadable audio again grew over 50%.","At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues increased 7% to $311 million, which was driven by strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds. Acquisitions contributed $7 million to revenues, while currency had $13 million offset. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 10%.","REA Group revenues grew 6%, or 13% in local currency, due to residential debt revenue growth in Australia, reflecting higher penetration for premium all and increased yield and modest contribution from the Hometrack acquisition.","We also saw an improvement in developer revenues. Revenue growth was partially offset by an overall 2% decline in new listing volume, which included a more pronounced decline in Sydney and lower media revenues. Please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release and their conference call, following this call for additional details and comments on their outlook.","Move revenues rose 11% to $122 million versus the prior year, helped by growth of its connection plus product and the inclusion of the Opcity acquisition. Real estate revenues increased 23%, including Opcity. Revenue growth was partially offset by reduced display advertising to drive user experience and engagements, similar to last quarter.","We also saw moderating growth in connection plus lead volume, partly impacted by the transferring of leads to Opcity, as well as a more challenging U.S. housing market, including declines in existing home sales in the second quarter.","Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 53 million for the quarter, rising 6% versus the prior year. On Opcity, we are very pleased with how the integration is going. The team at realtor is focused on leveraging their extensive industry relationships to expand adoption of the new platform.","We are using advanced AI machine learning and algorithms to better match consumers with agents. We are taking advantage of the Opcity platform to monetize consumer leads that in the past have gone unsold or underutilized.","Segment EBITDA rose 2% to $121 million. The quarter reflected additional cost move related to the Opcity acquisition, including deferred compensation combined with continued reinvestment in product development. And on an adjusted basis, segment EBITDA grew 12%.","I would now like to mention a few things for the fiscal third quarter. At News and Information Services, we expect higher cost at Dow Jones in the third quarter to drive execution growth initiatives, including expansion into live events. In addition, we expect continued challenges at News America Marketing, mostly related to the FSI advertising. We will continue to seek cost efficiency to streamline the business.","In Subscription Video Services, similar to the second quarter, when comparing with the prior year, we will have additional costs related to cricket of US$25 million to US$30 million, an incremental marketing for Kayo Sports of US$10 million to US$15 million.","In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable and we are encouraged by our upcoming releases together with the ongoing strong performance of our backlist. Some key titles this quarter includes Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis, On the Come Up by Angie Thomas and We Are the Gardeners by Joanna Gaines.","At Digital Real Estate Services, similar to Q2, we expect continued reinvestment to drive revenue growth at realtor.com and Opcity, including high marketing and product development.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Alexia. Thank you for taking our question. And just New York Times reported another strong quarter of digital subscriber growth yesterday. And from your numbers, The Wall Street Journal is also growing really nicely. Do you believe that longer-term, both The Wall Street Journal and New York Times can grow at this pace? And that \u2013 is there room for two meaningful paid digital properties longer-term?","Robert Thomson","Well, listen, I can\u2019t speak for the New York Times. In fact, I can speak for the prime meaningful newspaper, which is, of course, The Wall Street Journal. At Dow Jones, the subscription business is performing well and obviously, has much potential for growth. And if you look closely, you\u2019ll see the wsj.com, circulation revenues were up 15%. That\u2019s not crosswords or couscous recipes, not \u2013 low rent up is we\u2019re seeing elsewhere in the sector.","As for professional content in a clustered world, companies want to incorporate Dow Jones content network and that is happening at pace. To be honest, advertising needed work. We have a new ad team at Dow Jones and that team is certainly making a positive difference. Digital ads at Dow Jones were up 15%. And as for risk and compliance, the fastest growing business at Dow Jones, if any of you out there want to minimize risk and maximize compliance, then you simply must have a Dow Jones contract. If not, feel free when the regulator comes out knocking.","Michael Florin","Aaron, we\u2019ll\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thank you very much.","Michael Florin","Thanks. Aaron, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. And the next question comes from Entcho Raykovski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. My question is around Subscription Video Services and particularly Kayo Sports given you\u2019ve launched over the quarter, very useful that you provided us some stats around the subscribers. Just interesting whether you expect the sort of right of net adds to continue over the next couple of quarters? And where do you view the addressable market to be suffering, just interestingly high-level thoughts there?","And then more broadly, if we\u2019re looking at the churn rate we just stepped up and I pointed to the higher pricing, but do you think there\u2019s a level of cannibalization taking place as well, given you\u2019ve watched Kayo? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","Entcho, Kayo was in the early innings. In cricket, I would say, it was in the first of four innings or in baseball the second of nine innings. One can definitively say is that, we have 115,000 customers, around 100,000 paying and that number has indeed been rising week after week in two months since we launched.","And indeed, we are on the cusp of the peak sports selling season, which is Aussie Rules and Rugby League, as you know. It is beyond clear that sports events are crucially important in an age of confected, concocted content. And we have the events that matter in Australia for the next four or so years. That\u2019s an incontrovertible fact and an extraordinary asset.","So you can be in platform agnostic, but you can\u2019t be content ideastick [ph]. Of course, there is more churn when you increase prices, as we did late last year. But what we\u2019re absolutely not seeing is massive spin down to Kayo from premium subscribers. The fact is that the earlier versions of the IQ Box were inadequate, and the current version is much more sophisticated and satisfying. The iQ4 really does go to show that the higher the iQ, the better.","Susan Panuccio","I think, Entcho, I\u2019d also add. Just in relation to your question on the addressable market, obviously, our penetration has been sort of sub-30% for some years and there\u2019s old past audience out there within Australia, the other 70% that we haven\u2019t managed to reach that our research has been very clear are open to paying for proposition if it\u2019s at the right price point. So that would be the addressable market that we\u2019re having a look at.","And just in relation to churn, I did mention it in the release. But the team in Australia are very focused on churn management and they are \u2013 and we are investing a lot of money in data capabilities in order to effectively manage that churn going forward. And as Robert said, we really have seen very little spin down as a consequence of Kayo, but it is early days and we will continue to focus on that metric as we move forward.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Entcho. Aaron, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Kane Hannan","Good morning, Robert and Susan. Just be [indiscernible] that comment made around Tracey and taking new opportunities following that appointment. Could you just elaborate on what you meant by that comment? And then just a couple of brief comments around the only traction of the opportunity model and what you\u2019re seeing on the ground following that completion?","Robert Thomson","Well, Tracey has just settled into the job and it\u2019s a task obviously to increase the corporation among our various properties around the world, and that will be the first priority. Beyond that one, of course, can\u2019t speculate. It\u2019s interesting, the U.S. real estate market is a tad sluggish. And obviously, listings are down in Australia and yet digital property revenue growth remains real.","You could indeed say that these are testing times and model and investment is definitely passing that test. And it shows the value of the Opcity purchase, because we\u2019re providing a higher level of market intelligence and analysis and value-added services, in the case of Opcity. And that is appreciated by our clients who know that there are both quantity leads and quality leads and quality leads mean revenue for our customers.","Susan Panuccio","And I think, Kane, just to add on the Opcity, sort of the way that we look at this is the conversion of the leads into revenue will continually evolve as we move forward and we reported best-in-class [indiscernible] company, which will enable realtor to better monetize their leads by offering higher quality leads that will enable a better closed rate for the agents, which will provide higher revenue.","It also gives us access to high-quality data as a consequence of bedding the leads, which we can use to branch out into other adjacencies be it mortgage type of insurance, moving, et cetera, which is what we\u2019re currently looking at building out now. So I think the combination of those comments is what we think will drive the results with the Opcity and realtor.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Kane. Aaron, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research. Your line is now open.","Craig Huber","Great. Thank you. I have some quick housekeeping questions. What should we expect for CapEx for Foxtel for the full fiscal year and also for the entire company? And also curious if you could just tell us how the circulation of revenues did with or without currency in the UK and Australia in the quarter?","And my last one, if I could, give a comment on how you think the Australian economy is doing, given all your media assets down there? Do you think it\u2019s about stable, or you think it\u2019s getting worse, [indiscernible] I\u2019m asking? Thank you.","Susan Panuccio","So just in relation to your first question on CapEx, I think, we\u2019ve given guidance on this before. So $285 million was the number for last year, U.S. dollars that we quoted for Foxtel and we\u2019re expecting it to be $15 million higher. We haven\u2019t changed our expectations in relation to that, but obviously we continue to monitor that CapEx as we progress through the year.","I think, your next question was in relation to circulation in local currency. So I think, from a Dow Jones perspective, circulation revenues were up 7%; from News UK, circulation revenues were down 1%; and News Australia, circulation revenues were up 3%. [What was the third part in your question?] [ph]","Craig Huber","Yes, CapEx for the whole company, please, and also Australian economy comment?","Susan Panuccio","We haven\u2019t given that out before, Craig. But what I can say is, we\u2019re broadly expecting it, excluding Subscription Video Services to be roughly in line with last year.","Robert Thomson","Craig, for the macro economics, it\u2019s obviously a little difficult to tell, there are two events upcoming as state election in New South Wales and federal election locked [ph] to be held in May in Australia. Both of those events could have some impact on business activity. But the underlying macro trends in Australia are positive. There has been something of the decline in the housing market.","But that \u2013 in some respects, welcome, because it means that the rapid increases in property prices, which many analysts were unsustainable have indeed come to an end. And as in many countries, ensuring that there is enough excessively priced property is not just an economic issue, but a political issue, and one which is generating a lot of debate.","So that trend of itself is efficacious. And News Australia and the team, led by Mike Miller, is performing very well. EBITDA is growing, the digital transformation of the company is continuing at pace and we\u2019re particularly optimistic about the potential for the business.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Craig. Aaron, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","Certainly. And our next question comes from Brian Han with Morningstar. Your line is open.","Brian Han","Hypothetically, if you had strong buyer interest for Wall Street Journal, is that a master that you and the Board would consider selling or is the journal an absolutely integral part of your digitization strategy across the Board?","Robert Thomson","Hypothetically, you shouldn\u2019t answer hypothetical questions. But The Wall Street Journal not only is a powerful platform for us. That the network effect that you have, for example, and the relationship between realtor and The Wall Street Journal, the ability to cross promote for us increasingly to get sophisticated permission data on those platforms and right around to HarperCollins and the New York Post Digital Network. It is truly more than some of the pause at the very center, but is The Wall Street Journal.","Brian Han","Okay.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Aaron, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.","Operator","At this time, there are no additional questions. I\u2019d like to turn the program back over to the presenters for any additional comments.","Michael Florin","Great. Aaron, thank you very much. Thank you all for participating. And have a great day, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s program.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President Investor Relations, News Corporation.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.","First we'll give prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted earnings per share are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David F. DeVoe","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all seen in today's earnings release, we are quite pleased with the continued growth we are delivering at our Cable Networks, Filmed Entertainment and Television segments so far in fiscal 2013 with double-digit segment operating income increases at all 3 segments, although much of this growth is offset by anticipated declines in SKY Italia and our Publishing businesses. The current quarter operating income results also include a $67 million charge related to the ongoing investigations initiated upon closure of The News of the World in the United Kingdom as compared to $17 million in the first quarter a year ago. Excluding these charges from both years and a $5 million charge related to the post separation of the company's Entertainment and Publishing businesses, first quarter adjusted total segment operating income of $1.45 billion increased 3% from the year ago adjusted result of $1.4 billion.","First quarter reported revenues were up 2%, driven by strong Cable Network reported revenue increases of 16%. These increases were largely offset by currency-related decline at many of our divisions led by SKY Italia. It's important to note that a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted the company's financial performance this quarter. In constant currency terms, total company revenues and adjusted total segment operating income both grew 5% over last year.","Our share reported results from our equity earnings of affiliates were up $69 million in the quarter, with this increase primarily reflecting this quarter's gain for participation in BSkyB's share repurchase program. Also included in this quarter's result is $1.38 billion of income in Other, primarily related to a gain on the company's sale of NDS, partially offset by $152 million of pretax impairment and restructuring charges.","Reported net income in the quarter was $2.2 billion with reported earnings per share of $0.94 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.28. Excluding the net income effects in both years of one-time items, principally consisting of the items I just highlighted, first quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.43 compared with the year ago adjusted result of $0.32, a 34% earnings per share improvement. Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts.","The reduction of shares outstanding versus last year from our buyback accounted for $0.04 per share to the adjusted EPS this quarter.","Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance of few of our businesses, and let's begin with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating over 2\/3 of News Corporation's total segment operating income. First quarter Cable segment operating income contributions increased 23% over year ago levels to $953 million with double-digit earnings growth at the RSNs, Fox News and in FX, partially due to the timing of original programming and marketing cost at FX. This strong domestic channel growth is partially offset by higher sports cost at STAR India, reflecting the inaugural broadcast of the new BCCI cricket matches and the strengthened U.S. dollar that more than offset local currency profit growth at the Fox International Channels.","Cable Network growth continues to be top line-driven, with segment revenues up 16%. Reported affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 18% over year-ago levels, with domestic channel affiliate fees up 16% and international fees up 25%. And about 2\/3 of the international affiliate revenue increase reflects strong local currency organic growth at FX -- or excuse me, at the Fox International Channels and at STAR in India. The balance of our growth was from the inclusion of FOX Pan American sports business partially offset by the impacts of foreign currencies.","First quarter advertising revenues for this segment were up 5% over year-ago levels, led by a domestic ad growth of 8%. And at the international channel, local currency organic growth was in the high-single-digit range. However, after reflecting the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollars, these revenues declined by 1%.","At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $156 million increased 17% versus the first quarter a year ago due to a more than doubling of retransmission revenues and higher political advertising, which more than offset a lower base market affected by Olympics and the economy. Political advertising is generally coming in as expected, with approximately $40 million of political ad revenue received in the quarter.","At our Film segment, first quarter operating income was $400 million, 15% higher than a year ago. This growth primarily reflects higher Television production contribution that include the increased digital distribution revenue. The quarter result also includes the successful theatrical release of Ice Age: Continental Drift, which grossed over $850 million in worldwide box office received to date.","Turning to SKY Italia, segment operating income in the quarter of $23 million declined $96 million from a year ago. This anticipated decline was driven by higher program expenses, including nearly $70 million of costs related to this year's broadcast of the Olympics. The timing of this additional premium programming was not ideal given the current challenge in economic environment in Italy, which is directly impacting gross subscriber additions and churn. SKY reported 4.86 million subs at quarter end and net loss of 40,000 in the quarter.","Local currency revenues increased 1% over year-ago levels on higher subscription revenues, although U.S. dollar reported results reflected more than 10% negative impact from the weakening of the euro.","In our Publishing segment, operating income of $57 million declined 48% compared to a year ago. This decrease largely reflects lower advertising revenues across all newspaper divisions led by declines of the Australian and U.S. Publishing businesses. These declines were partially offset by contributions from the launch of the Sunday edition of The Sun and higher revenues at HarperCollins principally from the acquisition of Thomas Nelson.","And at our Other segment, we reported a first quarter segment operating loss of $211 million versus $99 million in the same period a year ago. This quarter result included $67 million of costs related to the ongoing investigations initiated upon the closure of The News of the World and $5 million of costs related to the proposed separation. Additionally, this quarter reflects higher development cost at the company's education business. Joel Klein is scheduled to give you considerably -- considerable insight into our planned strategies for this business at the upcoming UBS Investor Conference in early December, which is held here in New York City.","Before I turn to guidance, I'd like to update you on our $10 billion buyback program. Through November 5, the company spent almost $5.8 billion repurchasing over 308 million shares and has reduced News Corporation's total average shares outstanding in the first quarter by over 9% compared to the first quarter a year ago. As indicated previously, we're fully committed to completing the full $10 billion of authorized buyback, and we're targeting to repurchase shares at a $3 billion to $4 billion annual pace as we work through the details of the separation process. Our objective is to buy back our shares in a disciplined manner without artificially pushing our share price up during periods of low trading volume.","And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013 total segment operating income. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2012 the $224 million of charges related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom, resulting in a base of $5.6 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.","After excluding the full year effect of the U.K. investigation cost and separation cost, and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projection, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2012 to continue to be in the high-single to low-double-digit range above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base level that we outlined for you 3 months ago. And while this guidance now includes the estimated consolidated contribution from the acquisitions of CMH in Australia and ESS in Asia, those contributions are essentially offset by the inclusion of the first year's timing effect of the marketing cost from the initial releases under our new DreamWorks Animation distribution deal.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Thanks, Dave. Before I comment on our business, I want to recognize that many of you live in the New York New, Jersey area and hope you and your family and friends are managing the recovery from Hurricane Sandy.","At the company, we've done our best to help the relief efforts both through donations and also by working directly with the FEMA to raise awareness of federal disaster relief initiatives through various media across News Corporation. We know it's been a difficult time for many of you, so please note that we wish all of you the best as our entire community works to make a full recovery.","Now let's look at the quarter. Our first quarter has provided us with a solid start to fiscal year as we continue to meet our growth targets and drive our businesses forward. While we're facing some significant challenges due to economic headwinds, particularly in a couple of businesses, we're confident in our standing from both a financial and strategic perspective and continue to believe we're positioned for growth in both the short and long term.","As Dave noted, our results continue to be driven by our cable channels business, which delivered almost $1 billion in operating income in Q1. In the U.S., our strength in this segment was pretty much across the board. Fox News continued its strong performance, ranking #1 in total day in primetime viewers for the 43rd consecutive quarter. At FX, American Horror Story and Sons of Anarchy had spectacular season premieres, laying the groundwork for solid seasons ahead.","Our U.S. sports channel has also had a solid first quarter. More importantly, we've finalized key agreements with Major League Baseball and NASCAR that will collectively serve as the foundation for both our Cable and Broadcast businesses for years to come. In a world of increasing fragmentation and growing digital technologies, we believe key must-have content is more important than ever.","Equally, I want to emphasize that we only make financial commitments like this for we're confident we can create real, incremental value. We're very excited about the long-term growth potential of the broad and diverse mix of the must-have leading channels we're building.","Internationally, our channels are on target and continue to execute well in spite of the economic woes in Europe and the adverse consequences of the strong dollar on our results. At STAR in India, our results are in line with our expectations, although down from a year ago, as we ramp up the sports business discussed last quarter and as we feel the impact of a weak rupee. We continue to be very excited about the long-term growth potential for international businesses and believe they're stronger competitively than ever before.","Our creative businesses continue to develop award-winning films and television shows across every genre, posting exceptional box office and ratings numbers and building loyal fan bases around the world. In fact, our TV Studio recently won both the best drama and comedy Emmys for Homeland and Modern Family, respectively. With those series, as well as traditional stalwarts like Sons of Anarchy and Glee plus new franchises like New Girl and American Horror Story, we continue to have a great pipeline of product for traditional syndication and cable outlets, as well as the ever-growing collection of digital distribution outlets. The digital market, both in the U.S. and abroad, continues to be a real area of growth, particularly for unique hit content.","Our film studio is also well positioned. In the first quarter, Ice Age: Continental Drift was a worldwide box office hit and a testament to the growing strength of our Blue Sky Studio, which has become a clear leader of the growing animation segment. We're now gearing up for a great one with Taken 2, having grossed more than $300 million, and the critically acclaimed Lincoln and Life of Pi waiting in the wings.","We also continue to build into digital distribution opportunities for feature films. Our recent groundbreaking Digital HD initiative for advanced electronic sell-through of Prometheus was a success and bodes well for more innovative opportunities to re-energize the Home Entertainment segment over the next few years.","At our Broadcast business, our results have been mixed this fall. On the positive side, we continue to be on track with our goal of building a dual revenue stream business through both retransmission and reverse compensation with our affiliates. Our stations continue to do a great job maximizing margins and market share. However, our home entertainment launches have been below our expectations, and the 4 Game World Series was clearly not what we had hoped for. Nonetheless, we're focused on initiatives to build on some of our key franchises and look forward to the return of a refreshed American Idol in January and dynamic upcoming new series like The Following starring Kevin Bacon.","The advertising market have also been mixed. Political spending has exceeded expectations, while the base local ad markets were a bit softer in the first quarter with trends down in the mid single digits excluding political ads. Q1 was also adversely impacted by the Olympics. Second quarter looks a bit better, with postelection results tracking up in the mid single digits from a year ago.","Nationally, we're still seeing broadcast scatter at a modest premium to upfront pricing, and national cable is a bit stronger than national broadcast. It is still clearly, however, a mark with very limited visibility.","Two businesses where we're clearly feeling the impacts of economic woes are SKY Italia and Australian publishing. In Italy, a decline in subscribers coupled with weak euro and the one-time cost of the London Olympics made this a uniquely challenging quarter. And we assume the economic challenges are going to continue. Therefore, our plan is to stabilize profits in the short term by focusing on quality subscribers to limit churn and reduce programming and operating costs to the level appropriate for our current subscriber base. Our competitive position continues to strengthen as others struggle in the market, so we remain bullish in the long-term potential for this business. And when the market improves, we will be well positioned for growth from a streamlined base.","In Australian publishing, the decline in displaying classified advertising has clearly hit these businesses. As I discussed previously, we have major plans already being undertaken by our management team to address these shifts.","Most of our other businesses are pretty much on target. In the U.K., we're recognizing the benefits of the Sunday edition of The Sun, while at HarperCollins, we're realizing expected gains from the Thomas Nelson acquisition. That said, these businesses continue to face challenges stemming from lower advertising revenues as readers continue to migrate to digital platforms.","In closing, I'd like to emphasize that despite the challenges I outlined, News Corporation is in a unique position to face challenging macroeconomic issues head-on and to continue growing our core businesses while taking advantage of new opportunities wherever possible. We continue -- we will continue to address off balance sheet assets as illustrated by our recent CMH agreement, and we'll also continue to address our capital structures through initiatives like buybacks and strategic investments to strengthen our core businesses. If the company progresses towards its planned separation, we are convinced that our businesses are ideally positioned as leaders in providing the best in news and entertainment to our customers while delivering the greatest possible returns to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Dave and Chase. Operator, now we'd like to take questions from the financial community, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question -- our first question will come from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions, I guess one for Dave and one for Chase. If I look at your Other segment, even if I add back the one-time items that you talked about in the release, the $67 million, the $5 million and $15 million, there's still operating income loss of $120 million, and that did widen year-over-year. So I'm just wondering if we could just take a step back and maybe remind us what's in that Other segment? Is it same losses that continue? And what can you guys do to try to bring that segment to breakeven over time? And then second question is a bigger picture for Chase. I'm wondering if you could update us on sports globally. You guys have been successful on your strategy of acquiring sports rights in different countries and leveraging those rights for higher affiliate fees internationally. Just wondering if you could update us on your efforts in that way and what we should expect from that strategy moving forward.","David F. DeVoe","Yes, Anthony, I'll deal with the Other. What's in Other, Anthony, is principally, it's our head office, it's our education business, which I mentioned. And it includes our executive comp. And our executive comp is slightly different from some others is that any of the related compensation that's related to our stock is mark-to-market such to the extent that we have increase in our stock price, that compensation is mark-to-market. In this case, our stock has improved significantly. So we've got a bit of a hit in the current quarter for that.","Chase Carey","And I guess in terms of sports, I mean, obviously some of the recent deal they talked about, we've just signed really the like the -- in the U.S., the baseball and NASCAR deals are new and just implemented. But I think the U.S. really, for us, we're pretty much on track where we want to be. We think sports, as I said in the opening comments, are an increasingly important part of -- particularly building a real dual revenue business. And in a world that gets more and more choices and more and more technologies, we think sports become ever increasingly valuable. And so it gives us an opportunity really to build all our businesses across the channels and really to have a breadth of strength. Same theme is really true internationally. Most of the international initiatives, other than ones tied to the SKY platforms, are pretty new. We're probably less than a year into Latin America, that's ahead of plan. In Asia, we're really just -- we're just launching. It was just the first quarter in India. I think we're just closing now the ESPN STAR transaction, so I don't -- so we really haven't even -- I don't actually think we've closed it yet. So that is closing. I think the initial results of India, we feel good about. We're very much in line with our expectations. Sports in Europe and the SKY platforms continue to be a critical part of that business. In places like Germany, we launched the sports news channel a year ago. That's been a real success for us, the key rights we've acquired have certainly been an important part of building a platform like that. And I think as we look at the SKY businesses, we think those sports have been critical to their growth and continue to really deliver what we expect. And I think we look for new opportunities. I think we announced the deal to take the Dutch football rights, that deal is still awaiting approval. But again, I think it's a transaction that would give us an ability to take those sports rights, including a broad package of programming and really drive all our channels forward. Where we've had a chance to execute on that around the world, it's certainly, I think is very much delivering what we expected or more, again a place like Latin America is probably the one that at least has a year under its belt. The other -- the SKY platforms have actually been at it for a while, and certainly it's been critical to their success and growth in the U.K., in Germany, in Italy.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a couple of quick ones. When you think about the profits for FIC, given the increase in sports, which is a very clear strategy, and the FX headwinds, have you changed your outlook at all for your -- the goal that you've outlined, the $1 billion in profits?","David F. DeVoe","Yes. I mean I think if -- where the majority of that is, it's certainly in some of them like Latin America because we're a year into it. It will be increment -- that would probably be on top of the $1 billion. In some of the other places, you'll probably have a couple of years of building cost. Right now, India will be a process where we're investing in building that sports business for a couple of years and really the gains come a couple of years down the road. So, I think it's -- I mean we haven't take -- we haven't even started in Asia yet. We don't take possession of that probably until the end of the year. So in a couple of years, we'll still be in the early stages of it. So clearly a change in the perspective. I think if you look 2 years from now, you'll have some places that are mature enough to really be an incremental addition to it. You'll probably have others where we're still in the building process and building those sports franchises.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, Chase, I'd love to get your point of view of like what do you think is happening with viewers overall? I mean, some of the -- some networks have very strong ratings, many, many are down. I mean it really does seem like the appointment viewing is a thing of the past. What are you -- how are you guys thinking about it in terms of how you capture these viewers? What are the discussion like with Nielsen?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, I think there is no question that you are seeing a sort of an ongoing change in how people view this content. I think it makes -- I think the content viewership is actually stronger than it's ever been. In some ways, it\u2019s stronger than it's ever been. And I think the ability to access content when you want, where you want, multiple platforms, out of the home, in the home, makes this content more valuable. But the fact of the matter is people are watching in a lot of different places, not just linear networks. Linear networks, I still think, are going to be tremendously important launching pads for the product, but people are watching it on DVRs and digital platforms and on VOD on -- inside the home, as I said outside the home. And I think we need to continue to work with Nielsen and others to figure out how do we first measure that viewership. Clearly, parts of it like VOD after 3 days or mobile platforms aren't being measured. We need to get it measured. We need to make sure we continue to find ways to make sure we're getting I think the dual revenue stream obviously becomes increasingly important. TV Everywhere becomes a part of that to make sure you've got business, you've got abilities to get rewarded for that viewership wherever it is. Some of it's going be through subscription-based payments, some of it's going to be through [indiscernible] advertising. We need to do both. We need to make sure we find ways to continue to maximize the value of that through things like dynamic ad insertion, to make advertising more valuable. I think all of these are really opportunities for us to continue to make -- to continue to grow this business. Again, I think this actually is a real opportunity, if this content gets more valuable, more popular, more important. But we need to make sure we continue to grow the business model that enable us to get rewarded for creating and distributing great content.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. And then just, Dave, one quick one. Just on the split, can you give us any color on what the balance sheets of the 2 companies will look like? Have you given it any more thought?","David F. DeVoe","No. We'll give you more information as we get closer to the end of the calendar year. My job is then to say that we're still on plan. We believe we're going to be finished by the end of June. That's what we're working for, working towards rather.","Operator","That comes from Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 for Dave on guidance. Can you talk a bit about what your expectations for Fox Networks through the rest of the year? Within your guidance, do you assume it gets better in terms of ratings or are we assuming this is the kind of rates that will play out the entire fiscal year?","David F. DeVoe","I think as we look at the ratings -- or look at the guidance, we're off to a really good start in both Cable and the Film business. We've got some ups and downs across all the businesses, but we feel pretty very good about where the guidance are -- is rather we have the -- obviously, we know where we are after where the ratings have been and we know where we are after the World Series. And I think that's pretty much all we're going to really say about that.","Chase Carey","No, I think we take a realistic view of what we think will happen. As I said, we recognize we're below our expectations certainly in the fall, both through entertainment and the World Series. I think we're realistic about that. We've got some things coming, but I think it's a realistic set of assumptions about where we'll be.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, then let me ask one more follow-up on the DreamWorks impact. Is there anything else besides just P&A expense that you're highlighting? Is there any other costs or is that where you're calling out the effects of P&A in the second half?","David F. DeVoe","That's the effects -- the timing effects of the P&A.","Chase Carey","Yes, it just happens the first -- not the first film, I think it's the second film, but it's like released early July so you got all the P&A in front and you got the release right behind it where we capture everything on a first dollar basis. So it's just the reality the way the accounting in our year end works.","Operator","It comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Was just hoping couple of questions, one on film to follow up. You made obviously some changes in the studio management team. I was wondering if you could talk to kind of strategically why and how to think about what that -- how directionally you may change with the changes? And related to that, kind of why DreamWorks Animation? What really drove that deal in your mind? What was so important about that deal for you? And then just there's been a -- Rupert has been tweeting about Penguin. The presses said you're a buyer of Tribune, the L.A. Times. I guess just anything you could comment on in terms of your ambitions to grow acquisition-wise on the Publishing side would be helpful.","Chase Carey","Okay. Long ago, I learned not to comment on Rupert's tweets but -- yes, on the Film business, there isn't a shift in -- there's not a shift in strategy and direction. You don\u2019t say a lot about change, but I think these businesses at times, it's stuff -- for both sides, it's the right thing to sort give it some fresh perspectives and I think change. Stability's good and as times change, it's good for both. And -- but I think it's really continuing where we've been. For DreamWorks, we can see -- we think that product is great event product and great worldwide product. We clearly have -- we think a uniquely strong global distribution operation, it enables us to create incremental value out of that. And I think this is a business that really benefits from having a broad set of hit products, and we can make some money off it. So it's not -- I don't think it's not that -- it's not rocket science. I think why we -- what we look to get out of it is make some real profits and have some hit films that we think can really strengthen our business. And we value the relationship with DreamWorks and look forward to working with them. I'm not going to get too deep into all the rumors on what we're buying or what we're looking at. We always seem to be the topic of the day when it comes to rumor of some transaction. We were quite clear on a couple of them of where we are. I think that -- I think those comments on some of the label -- one of the ones you mentioned speaks for itself. The reality is, a lot of times what we're associated with just as true, they\u2019re sometimes kicking the tires on things. Obviously, we should look at some things. But I am not going to get into commenting transaction by transaction, rumor by rumor.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","And in terms just from the Publishing business, is there -- looking at Rupert's comment that you would expect, I think you said on the call, maybe Dave said it that you thought you'd be relatively similar in profitability year-over-year in fiscal '13. Is that still accurate despite what happened in Q1?","David F. DeVoe","No, I would say that our overall Publishing segment would be down year-over-year.","Operator","That comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The [indiscernible] -- it seems like we get a daily email speculating News Corp's going to buy something. Any update on the left [indiscernible] M&A upside that management has right now, especially given the ongoing split process? Then I have a follow-up for Chase.","Chase Carey","No. I mean, there's really not a lot to add to what I just said. We're not -- yes, I agree with you, we are -- there is a daily rumor. And I don't think we're really practically commenting on the daily rumors. So as I said, a lot of them are not true. They're a lot -- the places where we think we should kick the tires on things, and like our places where we think we can add something that makes sense for us. But our focus is really on building or growing our businesses.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Sorry if I missed that if you already answered to that. So, Chase, maybe this question is a bit unfair, but can you talk -- in answer to Jessica's question about how the TV business seems to change to capture monetization of usage of the most -- more from iBroadcast down demand streams. And we've been hearing this from sort of all media managements for a couple of years now. Why is it so hard to change TV business, and how big a priority is it for News Corp. right now? Is that this year's problem? Next year's problem? Any sort of context around the pace of change would be helpful.","Chase Carey","Well, I mean, I do think business has changed. I mean, I guess, look, one of the things I cited that is important to deal with the world we're in is making sure you're building dual revenue businesses that are not solely dependent on advertising. They have the other leg of subscription revenues. And certainly, our growth of retransmission speaks to it. So I think there are aspects to it. We actually today are monetizing our digital viewership in ways we weren't a year ago, so we're doing some of that. We are working with Nielsen, as you said, to continue to expand the measurement tools. Things like TV Everywhere, as our transactions come up, I think are ways for us to create, and we're putting that I've said before and we're probably still say -- we're somewhat frustrated by the speed or the lack thereof of growth and implementation and execution of TV Everywhere. But certainly it's moving forward, and I think that's important as a business model. Hulu, we're taking, we're taking Hulu Plus, which is a way to monetize and sort of create revenues for accessing content to mobile platforms. So I actually do think we're doing things. We're not -- we've got a lot more to do and clearly a lot of opportunities that we still have to develop. But -- and we're not where we should be on some things like TV Everywhere. So I'll acknowledge it's -- there's work to do. But I think we've got a lot going on, and I think we've made real headway on a number of fronts.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So dynamic ad insertions sort of have to follow TV Everywhere, right? You have to get those deals done and then maybe that starts to become the conversation?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean obviously, dynamic ad insertions, we certainly see -- we can't do alone. You need -- I think everybody recognizes the opportunity inherent in it. There certainly are efforts trying -- in place to try to start to develop it, and I think everybody, again, would like to see it evolve. Yes, it's part of a broader set of discussions, but everything's sort of intertwined. And I think that one, that one I think is a win-win for all. And hopefully, we can help find ways to move it forward.","Operator","It comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You -- I guess I got 1.5 questions. Until you close the quarter with about $12 billion of cash on the balance sheet, I think, [indiscernible]","[Audio Gap]","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","It comes from the line of Michael Morris with Davenport & Company.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, on retransmission agreements and the length of the contracts there. Some of your peers that have entered into long-term sports rights agreements, they also have entered into long-term retransmission or cable affiliate agreements as long as 10 years. I guess my question is when you look at the deals that you've done on the sports side, would you also like to enter into those long-term type agreements or do you think that limits your flexibility too much going forward? And then second, just over on Latin American sports. There's a couple of big events coming up over the next 4 years between the World Cup and the Olympics. Will you participate in those events, and how will you -- how does that help your business?","Chase Carey","In terms of retransmission, our goal and our -- what we've done to date is to try to keep agreements shorter rather than longer, they're all about a year agreements, obviously. But we would prefer and we've strived to keep the agreements short. We believe content is increasingly important, and we'd rather be able to continue to have the flexibility to get rewarded for being successful in creating great content or franchises of brands. So that's -- directionally, that's where we've tried to go and that's where we look to go and that's where we've been successful to date going. Compared to the Latin America, I'm not going to probably -- or I don't think it's ever the right thing to say, speculate on individual franchises before they're there. I think we evaluate an array of them. Yes, I think the backbones to those -- the backbones to those channels have been probably more regular season sporting events. But I think if we can strike the right deals and right places, we'd certainly look at it. But we don't have a deal -- we don't have any arrangement with the Olympics today down there. And that's -- again, we'll see where the world takes us. But we like the properties we've got in Latin America. We're ahead of -- we're significantly ahead of our plans, and I think we'll continue to focus on the path we're on. But not how do I get down the road and speculate on individual rights we don't have today.","Michael C. Morris - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just back on the first question, on retransmission. Is it safe to assume then that you feel that the increase that you should get overtime for retrans, the value of your network should increase at a greater rate than the increases that are in these long-term sports contracts that you're entering into?","Chase Carey","Yes, look, I think it's -- and I've said it before, so I mean again, I mean I -- we have -- we feel good about the retransmission revenue stream we've built. But the reality is I don't think on any competitive basis, if you look at all the other channels out there, there's no question we're not getting rewarded comparatively for the value of the FOX Network. And I think we've taken a real step forward. We said we're looking to get what we think is something the market could manage and moves us in the right direction. But it certainly is not competitively comparable to what other channels get given the breadth and importance of the programming that exists on the FOX Network.","Operator","Okay, and we do have Mr. Juenger back online.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I had 1.5 questions, if I could. So about the cash. You ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash in the balance sheet, some of that's in NDS and I think a new note you issued. I know, Chase -- I believe you said before that you'd -- I think you need about $3 billion sort of liquidity at steady state. So I don't know if there's any of the blanks you can fill in between the $12 billion and the $3 billion that you might help us sort of round that out. And the half of question that I'd like to accompany those, just if you could be so kind as to talk about the rule of the dividend in that answer. I think if yielding less than 1% now and, I know you have a preference for buybacks at the share price. But there seems like you could argue you could have room for both and still love to hear your thoughts on that.","Chase Carey","Yes. I guess that, a couple of comments, one, we're in the process of completing just the acquisition in Australia, that alone is a $2 billion acquisition. So that is obviously on the short term.","David F. DeVoe","[indiscernible] close the deals.","Chase Carey","So we have some things we've...","David F. DeVoe","And we have a continuation of some of our buyback over the course of the year.","Chase Carey","Yes. And so we've got events in place. That being said, I think we said before, we recognize to get us to where I said, which was $2 billion to $3 billion of cash and up to 2.5x leverage. So I'm saying again clearly, there are events that are on the short term, very short-term horizon against that $12 million. I don't want to get to -- I mean, again, more recently, what we said with the split coming, we don't want to -- I don't want to get too far down the road ahead of having those 2 companies in place, the balance sheet establishes in place for each that enables each to come out with an appropriate picture. Obviously, we're splitting the businesses because they're going to be business with different profiles and different needs. And I think until we get there, I think it's probably better for us to describe where we go from there once those things are achieved. And I think that would include dividend statement. I mean I think the dividends should be a part of the mix of our discussions. They have been with buybacks. I think we've said with our stock and our value, I think had flipped at buybacks is a better path to returning cash to shareholders than dividends. But they should be a part of the conversation. But I think before we -- but I think that with the split becoming more and more imminent, I think it's more preferable for us to get the split and have the discipline to get the split on and then address where we go from there with the 2 separate balance sheets.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. It sounds like basically the answer is, other than the identified items, yes, like we've got those, that more become clear after the split.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Adam Alexander, Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty Ltd, Research Division","Just a quick question on FOX Business. It seems to be getting some traction during the September quarter. Wondering whether, Chase, you can give us an update there and whether you have any plans for more extensive use of the Wall Street Journal content in the cable space next year?","Chase Carey","Yes, actually, FOX Business Channel has made nice strides. I mean it'll -- we still have some distribution issues we have to deal with it. It's not distributed as widely as we'd like it, so we have to deal with that. It made some nice strides in ratings. I mean it's got -- just looking at it the other day, it's -- it was, yes, Lou Dobbs, I think beat his counterpart of CNBC in his time period. So I think it has some nice momentum to that business. Business Channel will be profitable this year, this fiscal year, so we're -- it's on a good track. We've got to continue to build -- fill out the distribution. We've got good distribution, but not the full distribution we need. But we think we have paths to addressing that in the reasonable short term, in the next year or 2. So it's on a good track, and we feel very good about it and feel very good about the progress we've made there and the opportunity to continue to build that business. And look, we've got a great team leading the Fox News group. The results they've got speak for themselves. And we have tremendous confidence in their ability that they -- as they did with building Fox News to really continue to distinguish the FOX business as a really exciting sister channel to the Fox News One. What's your second question?","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just on the Wall Street Journal content, next year I think you're agreement ends up.","Chase Carey","No, I think our agreement -- I don't know the exact time. It's reasonably soon. It's not over yet, but it's reasonably soon, and I think we'd look for opportunities to do things that make sense. So we've had discussions, and I think we'd look to be opportunistic.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen, Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to track back on the issue of advertising, please, in the most recent quarter and in the current quarter. Could you give us a view again please, stripping out all the political and Olympic impacts, why do you think advertising was soft in the quarter just completed? And why do you think it might get better now in calendar Q4 year fiscal Q2, please? And I'm talking both Broadcast and Cable, please.","Chase Carey","Well, strip out the Olympics, I mean, it's sort of I can strip out -- it's easier to identify political. So I do think for calendar Q3, clearly the Olympic, I mean stripping out politicals, the Olympics, a lot of the money in that period got stuffed into the Olympics. Again, that would be a more subjective valuation, and I probably not do it, but it's just a fact. I think in looking at calendar Q4, yes, I mean we're halfway through calendar. So as we start looking at what we're seeing today, it's not -- this is not a sort of, yes, some of it's assumptions on what will happen. As I said, you got a pretty short-term time horizons towards this. But we get reasonably -- certainly, we have a level of visibility to a quarter that we're close to the middle of where they are. And I'm not saying that this quarter is rocking and rolling. I mean I think the quarter's a bit better than it was last quarter. I mean I think but underlying it, I think you have an economy that clearly has limited visibility. I think a lot of -- I think there is some degree of people waiting for the election year-end sort of what happens as you go by, as you go through some of the events, the fiscal cliff and the like. And so, I think you've got a market that is pretty reserved at this point and pretty cautious and limited visibility. So yes, I think if you try to take the Olympics out of it, I wouldn't say it's a dramatic difference between Q3 and Q4, I'd say Q4 is a bit better. But I think the market\u2019s overall are okay, not great and not bad. But are okay, but with -- I think a fairly cautious view of the world in a pretty short-term view of things.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","Okay. And what was your comment on the scatter market? In the current quarter, you said something. I just missed it, please.","Chase Carey","No, as I said on the scatter market, we're still getting modest. And on the broadcast side, we're getting a modest premium to the upfront pricing. So -- and again, that continues to be okay. We felt good about the upfront, so we're getting a modest premium. And we're probably getting a better premium in the national cable side, that the mix of channels. But they're channels we're getting double-digit scatter premiums with channels there. So the national cable's a bit stronger than the broadcast -- I mean, national scatter is a bit stronger than the -- national cable scatter's a bit stronger than the broadcast -- national broadcast scatter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with Susquehanna Financial.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","My question is about your comments on SKY Italia in the prepared section. If I understood correctly, we're talking about rightsizing the cost structure and to reflect the revenue opportunity there now. And if I'm correct, what kind of margin do you have on mind? If my model is correct, I think the peak margin was around 11%, 12% for SKY Italia?","Chase Carey","Yes. I'm really not going to get into that type of precision on margin. I mean your general assumption is right. I mean look, we assumes -- we are on track to have a higher subscriber count than we do today, basically affected the top line. I think we assume the subscriber -- net subscriber -- subscriber growth will be reasonably -- our subscriber level will be reasonably flat for this year. I think with that in place, we need to -- we want to move to deal with both our operating costs and programming costs. Unfortunately there, most of them at programming side agreements are not very long-term and rarely get the cost reset to the revenue base, so we've got a lean business that as the market improves, we can take advantage of it. And I think in some ways, we can take advantage of the fact that while the market is impacting everybody, I think I do really believe our competitive position continues to improve and, in some ways, it's the strongest player in a market where a lot of people are struggling. There should be opportunities for us to take advantage of that intelligently while continuing to improve our financial position.","Vasily Karasyov - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So would it be fair to say that your current contract, programming contract, and so on, they would allow you to see cost rationalization by next fiscal year already?","Chase Carey","No. I mean, obviously we have a lot of programming contracts. They're not -- it's not all one. They're certainly ones that go past next year. They're not -- we have multiyear contracts. We don't have -- we're on long-term contracts. The nature of the business is like the agreement that start earlier in the years. On the soccer rights is we're in the first of 3 years, so there's some that go for a couple of years. There's some that are shorter than that. There aren't a lot of long-term contracts there. But we can certainly make -- I think we can make strides this year, make strides next year.","Operator","And the last question will come from James Dix with Wedbush.","James G. Dix - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I guess, Chase, you've commented more than once about how your broadcast retransmission fees still to have a lot of upside compared to what the broadcast networks offer the consumer. I wanted to just look more broadly across all of your cable networks and see are there other networks where you see particularly large opportunity? And in particular, I'm interested in comments regarding the RSNs and the upside that they might have compared to comparable properties if there are any in their markets?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, we have a large group of channels, and I probably usually put them in a couple of -- in a couple of buckets. I think they're channels that are uniquely strong within -- uniquely strong or with a unique programming. And I think unique programming becomes more important than ever. Again, it's in a fragmented world. And certainly something like Fox News, as we've said before, we've made real headway but I think Fox News continues to be a channel that is as important as any to a segment out there in the marketplace. And we should get fair value for the importance that Fox News has. Sports, we think, becomes increasingly important, and it's important for us to get -- to continue to generate fair value for those sports rights. I think the channels like National Geographic where I think the opportunity for us is really to tap into some things that we've got new management in place. They actually had an event that did really well on Sunday night. But tap into an opportunity to really build that channel to what it can be. And I don't think we have done that. I think we've got some national sports channels that really have been sort below the radar screen, and I think we can -- I think we've got enough breadth and the right franchises to really build them into something that can be special for us. So I think we've got properties. I think we got -- identified strong franchises where we've got to continue to get value, we've got room to do that. We've got channels that aren't taking advantage of -- aren't really probably achieving what we think they can achieve. We've got some channels that we probably have strategically focused on, and we're going to do some things to get value there. And I think channels like FX just continue to get stronger with more distinct program than anybody else in that sector. So, yes, I think it's about a -- it's a matter of getting fair value for unique content. I think we've got great content, great unique content. And probably in many ways, equally citing a number of franchises that haven't really been developed to anything close to their full potential. So that's where the growth comes from.","Reed Nolte","Thank you. At this point, we're out of time. Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. The media is invited to today's call on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's fiscal first quarter 2016 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago. It's now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2015 identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used on this call such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson with some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. News Corp is on track in its transition to a more digital and increasingly global future, having integrated several recent acquisitions and built a powerful platform for sustained growth. We have focused on driving the long-term expansion of revenue and profit, and leveraging the potency of our brands, while diligently confronting costs to maximize long-term returns for all investors.","During the last quarter, foreign exchange fluctuations obviously negatively affected revenue and EBITDA in our international operations, but this should not obscure the real progress made at many of our businesses. In fact, News Corp's revenues, excluding the effects of currency, grew 4% in the last quarter, underscoring the value of our shift to higher growth businesses and our prudent reinvestment strategy.","We believe the global economy is still in relatively unchartered territory, with U.S. interest rate rise pending and emerging markets still subject to political and economic volatility. From a macro perspective, our core markets are growing, but not at an optimum level.","We are particularly pleased with the progress at realtor.com, which is significantly ahead of schedule on key metrics. We are now by some reckoning the world's largest digital property listings company.","Our majority-owned REA has just announced plans to acquire iProperty Group, the leading digital real estate operator in Southeast Asia. We also see a bright future in the U.S., where the national real estate market is still gradually returning to health, with recent increases in the volume of units sold and the potential for further expansion.","The company's digital expertise and ability to harvest commissioned data has been enhanced by the addition of Unruly, Storyful and Checkout 51, all of which will have a positive impact across our businesses and around the world. We are already seeing significant new contracts and business opportunity, because of Storyful's and Unruly's unique skills in measuring the social and viral penetration of advertising campaigns.","And Checkout 51, acquired by News America Marketing, will provide us with real-time information about consumers' buying choices. In the areas of data and advertise, we believe markets are on the cusp of significant upheaval.","Contemporary advertising has been distorted by trash traffic, invisible impressions and mockable metrics to the detriment of advertisers, large and small. Needless to say, and thus worth reinforcing, all newspaper ads are a 100% viewable. Respected brands and quality journalism will have a particularly profound value at a time when so many so-called audiences are artificial.","While musing on the value of the genuine and verifiable, it is worth noting the healthy multiples for financial news brands with some, but limited global reach. There is no business news brand with the authority, the credibility or the reach of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones. Will Lewis and our team at the company are striving to make the most of a brand, a content set and an audience that are uniquely valuable.","Bedi will provide further depth and detail on our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, where our reported revenues were $2.01 billion compared to $2.11 billion in the previous year. Clearly, currency fluctuations had a negative impact.","Income from continuing operations was $143 million compared to $109 million, while total segment EBITDA was $165 million compared to $194 million, again reflecting the significance of currency movements. Reported earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.22 compared to $0.15 in the prior year.","As I signaled, our expanding digital real estate operations are a powerful source of growth and reason for optimism. REA revenues and EBITDA accelerated versus the fourth quarter, with a notable improvement in lifting volume in Australia and a higher uptake of premium listing passages.","realtor.com continued to benefit from its integration into the broader News Corp family, and is reporting robust revenue growth with a 33% increase year-on-year, significantly higher than our competition. Traffic continue to expand rapidly in the most recent quarter, with average monthly unique users of 46 million, a 43% increase year-over-year, while mobile users rose by 64%.","Engagement at realtor.com is also strong, with our enhanced editorial coverage seeing a more than 200% increase in traffic year-over-year, and reflecting a crucial role that the company's traditional skills can play in the contemporary marketplace.","Extra attention is being devoted to our software and service business, which today accounts for approximately 20% of Move's revenues, to ensure that we provide realtors and vendors and purchasers with the freshest and most accurate listings information, and to improve lead generation and conversion. With realtor.com gaining market share and momentum, we continue to expect Move to be EBITDA-positive this year and that number should ramp up in fiscal 2017.","We are also heartened by the performance of both WSJ advertising and the professional information business at Dow Jones. Advertising at the Wall Street Journal rose against the comparable period, both for print and for digital, with the technology sector being a significant contributor to revenue. It is perhaps not surprising that those whose trade is purely digital should appreciate the power of the print platform, which is in essence a succession of prominent daily billboards for an influential, affluent self-selecting audience.","Meanwhile, circulation revenue at the Journal grew mid-single digits. Thanks to a new pricing schedule and healthy volumes. Keep in mind that circulation revenue at Dow Jones has grown every quarter since News Corporation acquired it in 2007. The professional information business grew, adjusting for currency vicissitudes, for the first time in more than two years and certainly appears to be headed in a positive direction.","Our risk and compliance business is striving at a time of intensified regulation and government scrutiny, and we are launching a suite of WSJ Pro products aimed at professionals, who require a sector-specific briefing about changes, opportunities and threats in their areas of expertise. That higher level of business intelligence obviously demands a higher price.","Speaking of launches, just this week, the Journal released its new WSJ City app, bringing the best business news to people who are in or care about the City of London. This is but one example, along with the new global editions of the Journal of the potential growth internationally. I'd also like to point out the success at Barron's, who's experienced growth in circulation and advertising revenue, both in digital and print in the U.S. and internationally, especially with the launch of a digital edition in Asia.","FOX Sports in Australia performed admirably in the first quarter in local currency. Advertising grew significantly and continued to gain market share, as advertisers recognized the loyalty of the viewer base, the quality of the sports rights and the work done to create compelling programming between sports events.","A digital presence has increased through FOX Sports Now and the large audiences for the Rugby World Cup, despite the time difference with London. We are also excited by the expanded and extended relationship with Australian rules football, with the agreement that FOX Sports will broadcast matches through 2022. We are confident that FOX Sports has the most valuable rights for Australian sports, which generate by far the highest ratings.","Foxtel continue to expand its cable and satellite subscriber base, and penetration has certainly been improving. The situation is very different to that of the U.S., where the vast majority of households already have cable or satellite contracts.","In Australia, the figure is a relatively modest 30% penetration. Meanwhile, we are pleased that the ACCC has approved the Foxtel investment in the 10 Network, and we expect to benefit from use of the multi-channel network joint venture for advertising, sales and services.","As previously indicated, we completed the sale of the Amplify Insight and Learning businesses. And our decision to exit from the digital education business should begin to show earnings and free cash flow improvement.","We are proud of the work done by the Amplify team in creating a unique curriculum for the contemporary classroom and have no doubt that the new owners will continue to develop this remarkable resource. From our perspective, the departure from digital education is consistent with our increasing focus on free cash flow and the imperative to drive higher value for shareholders.","HarperCollins was, as expected, partly a victim of its previous year's success with the Divergent Trilogy, which has inevitably reached its maturity. Though its backlist value, will endure for many years to come. Go Set A Watchman, the sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird, became the fastest selling book in the company's history, having sold more than 3 million units during the period. But that success was balanced by a general softness in the e-book market, a trend evident to all publishers and one we are watching closely.","Our news and information services segment declined this quarter, primarily due to advertising softness in Australia and currency weakness. News U.K. faced some advertising challenges, but was vigilant in controlling expenses. And the rate of advertising decline improved modestly versus the fourth quarter in local currency.","Given this advertising weakness, in both countries there were renewed efforts to establish direct relationships with advertisers and to provide them with improved reach and return. Our new executive team in the U.K. is much energized and News U.K. is also leading in digital expansion, having overseen with our tech team in New York, the acquisition of Unruly, now being leveraged by our businesses around the world.","At a time when some are struggling to discern the difference between ad tech and fad tech, Unruly is able to instruct clients on the relative virality and sharing potential of their advertisements, given its sophisticated algorithmic metrics, which can track consumer penetration. The value of its market intelligence is certainly clear to our own properties in the U.S., Australia and U.K.","Creative commercial collaboration is intensifying around the company. We expect to use the powerful distribution channels that are MarketWatch and The New York Post to help drive downloads of Checkout 51 at News America Marketing. At the same time, we expect Checkout 51 will be a valuable source of sophisticated consumer metrics that will benefit many external clients of News Corp and can also help us target internal marketing with greater accuracy and effectiveness.","There is certainly no shortage of data in the world, but much of it is ill-defined and superficial. We are aiming to create a data network effect among our businesses, with companies like News America Marketing, the Wall Street Journal, realtor.com and others, all providing leads to one another in a virtuous data circle.","And within the real estate sector itself, we are already sharing expertise in software and content. We expect to be able to repurpose techniques and tactics across that network, which now stretches from Texas to Thailand and from Indiana to Italy.","In conclusion, while we have experienced understandable challenges in a couple of our businesses this quarter, we remain confident in our overall plans for digital and global expansion. And we are certainly pleased by the growth potential of the increasingly powerful platform that is our digital real estate business.","With that, I turn things over to our CFO, Bedi Singh, to expound on the financial details.","Bedi Singh","Thanks, Robert. During the first quarter, we approved a plan to dispose of the company's digital education business, and we completed the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight businesses on September 30. Results for that segment are now reflected as discontinued operations. For comparability, this call will focus on continuing operations, excluding the impact from the digital education segment in both periods.","We reported fiscal 2016 first quarter total revenues of $2 billion, down 4% from the prior-year period. As Robert noted, we were again impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the weaker Australian dollar, which declined over 20% versus the prior year and negatively impacted Q1 total reported revenues by $188 million or 8%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted revenue declined less than 1% compared to the prior year.","We reported total segment EBITDA of $165 million compared to the prior-year period of $194 million. Currency fluctuations, again, primarily the weaker Australian dollar impacted total reported segment EBITDA by $29 million or 15%. This quarter also includes $5 million of costs related to the U.K. newspaper matters, net of indemnification. Excluding these, as well as acquisitions and divestitures, our total adjusted segment EBITDA was down 7% compared to the prior year.","Reported EPS from continuing operations were $0.22 versus $0.15 in the prior year. The current quarter EPS includes a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to the planned exit of the digital education business, which resulted in increased expected utilizations of the NOLs that we acquired from the purchase of Move. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.05 versus $0.13 in the prior year.","Now, let's turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $161 million or 11% versus the prior-year period. More than two-thirds of that decline was related to the impact of foreign currency. Adjusted segment revenue declined 3%.","Within the segment revenues, advertising, which was 53% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 13%, or about 5% in local currency, which is a modest sequential improvement from last quarter. Looking at advertising performance across our key units, at the Wall Street Journal, domestic advertising improved 3% versus the prior-year quarter and an acceleration versus the Q4 rate with both print and digital ad revenue up versus the prior year. We saw strength in technology, particularly in print. We also had solid gains in luxury goods and professional services.","At News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 30% or 11% in local currency, as the marketplace was weaker than the prior-year quarter. We again saw softness in several categories including retail, employment, finance, and auto with the real estate category showing modest year-over-year growth. We are actively examining the cost structure at News Australia and looking for additional operating efficiencies in the near-term.","At News U.K., overall advertising revenue declined mid-single digits in local currency, a slight sequential improvement from last quarter. We saw some improvements in the real estate category, like in Australia, but more than offset by continued weakness in retail, most notably the grocers. The Times and Sunday Times outperformed the market, down low-single digits this quarter, while the Sun remained weak, down low-double digit.","As Robert mentioned, we made several management changes in September, including appointing Rebekah Brooks as Chief Executive, and the key focus is on improving the performance at the Sun, particularly its digital proposition. We expect to leverage the capabilities of the recently acquired Unruly to help achieve this. We announced last week that the Sun's digital content will be transitioning to a largely free model by the end of November. And we would expect the increase in audience to drive improved revenue and EBITDA. News U.K. also continues to look very closely at its cost base.","At News America Marketing, revenues declined 5% versus the prior-year quarter due to continued weakness in FSI, impacted by weaker industry pricing. Domestic in-store advertising grew modestly this quarter. Total circulation and subscription revenues, which accounted for 41% of segment revenues, declined 6%, but were up 2% in local currency.","Dow Jones professional information business excluding currency grew modestly this quarter, the first increase in 10 quarters, led by strength in risk and compliance and stability at Factiva. In consumer, we saw mid-single-digit growth again at the Wall Street Journal and at News Australia in local currency, driven by subscription and cover price increases and higher digital paid sales.","Segment EBITDA decreased $22 million in the quarter or 21% as compared to the prior-year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 15%. While we benefited from strong performance at Dow Jones, results were more than offset by weakness at News Australia and the impact of currency this quarter. Also included in segment EBITDA was an incremental $5 million negative impact related to higher legal expenses at News America Marketing for ongoing litigations.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues increased 1% and segment EBITDA declined 24% versus the prior year. Adjusted revenues fell 2% versus the prior year. And adjusted segment EBITDA fell 33%, primarily due to the difficult year-ago comparison, which had higher Divergent sales and weaker e-book sales in Q1, consistent with industry trends.","Total digital revenue for the quarter were 20% of consumer revenues, down from 23% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher e-book skewing Divergent year-ago comparison, which impacted total revenues by $23 million this quarter. Divergent sold around 400,000 units this quarter versus approximately 3.7 million units in Q1 last year. The release of Go Set A Watchman in July, which shipped around 3.4 million units, with the vast majority in physical copies, had only a modest uplift to profits, as we expected.","In digital real estate services, total segment revenues increased $79 million or 71%, driven by the inclusion of Move results. Segment EBITDA was flat compared to the prior-year period, as operating results improvement at REA Group were more than offset by foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 21% and 31% respectively, an improvement from the prior-year quarter driven by higher listing volume in Australia and increased depth penetration.","As you may have seen, earlier this week REA announced plans to acquire the balance of iProperty it doesn't already own for AUD4 per share. The total cost for the acquisition is expected to be approximately AUD500 million or approximately $350 million, which REA plans to fund primarily through new debt facilities. The deal is subject to court and shareholder approval and will likely close in the Q1 calendar quarter of 2016.","iProperty, as Robert mentioned, has leading portals in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong and a strong presence in Singapore. The deal is consistent with REA and News Corp's plans to expand geographically and invest in high growth regions. Southeast Asia is particularly attractive, given favorable macroeconomic backdrop, increasing property transactions, and low online share of real estate advertising.","Reported segment results include $85 million in revenue and an EBITDA loss of $4 million from Move, including approximately $4 million of stock compensation expense. Excluding this stock-based comp expense, Move would have been breakeven this quarter, and we continue to expect it to be EBITDA positive for this fiscal year.","On a standalone basis, Move's revenues would have grown 33% versus the prior-year quarter. The improvement was led again by the connections for co-brokerage product and non-listing media revenues, benefiting from the successful integration into the Dow Jones programmatic exchange and higher audience levels. We also saw a year-over-year and sequential improvement in the software and services segment, led by an increase in subscribers to its Top Producer CRM product.","In cable network programming, revenue decreased by $15 million or 11% compared to the prior-year quarter. Subscription revenues fell 12%, as higher affiliate fees and subscriber gains were more than offset by foreign exchange headwinds.","Advertising revenues were down 8%, impacted by negative foreign currency fluctuations, but up strongly in local currency, benefiting from the Rugby World Cup and the new V8 and Formula One Motorsport properties combined with higher underlying market share.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter fell 13% due to negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations and expected higher programming rights costs related to the Rugby World Cup. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues grew by 10% and adjusted EBITDA grew by 9%.","With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with over 2.9 million total subscribers, with the majority of growth from cable and satellite subscribers, which increased 8% compared to the prior-year period. In the quarter, cable and satellite churn improved to 10.1% from 10.9% in the prior year. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were up 3% versus the prior year. And EBITDA was down 21% due to expected higher programming costs, primarily sports rights and fees, and an expected increase in costs associated with higher sales volume and the public launch of Triple Play.","Last week, 10 Network received ACCC and ACMA approvals for Foxtel's 15% investment for a total contribution of AUD77 million, subject to confirmation from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board. 10 will also hold roughly a 25% stake in the multi-channel network ad sales venture with Foxtel and FOX Sports.","Included within income lost from discontinued operations, in the first quarter of fiscal '16, the company recognized a pre-tax noncash impairment charge of $76 million, reflecting a write-down of the digital education business to its fair value. As I noted, the sale of Amplify's Learning and Insight business was completed on September 30. The gross proceeds from the sale of Amplify Learning and Insight will more than offset any exit costs relating to these businesses, including severance. And importantly, we recognize a tax benefit of $151 million as a result of the plan to dispose of the digital education business.","We will continue to maintain support for the Amplify Access Tablet business. We expect future costs to be minimal, and these will be reflected in discontinued operations as Access is classified as an asset held for sale. We expect the full free cash flow and earnings benefit from the exit of the digital education business from fiscal [ph] '27 onward.","In summary, we remain focused on driving long-term growth and believe News Corp is on the right track. We're always examining our asset portfolio and willing to make changes that maximize value per share on long-term growth. Our decision to exit digital education reflects our view that free cash flow is a priority for News Corp and that the ongoing investment spend at Amplify was better suited within a different structure.","We have aggressively shifted our focus to digital real estate, and we believe that Move and REA Group will be core pillars of our profitability [technical difficulty]. We have extended our real estate reach and expertise through investments in India and through REA's investment in Southeast Asia, which should be magnified by its planned buy-in of iProperty.","While book publishing faced some tough comparables this quarter, we are very pleased with the successful integration of our past acquisitions. We continue to leverage Harlequin's international distribution network and our annualized cost synergies from the Harlequin acquisition are on target at $20 million.","While the News and Information Services segment remains volatile with advertising trends geographically uneven, we're investing in digital products, actively addressing our cost base, and using different levels to drive growth and circulation revenues.","As we shift more steadily to digital and towards a more balanced revenue mix, our mastheads are evolving into unique platforms that provide valuable audiences which we can leverage across our properties, as is evident with the success of realtor.com and at REA in Australia, we believe the steps we've been taking have put News Corp in a better position to drive long-term value per share. We're pivoting the company into faster growth segments and will continue to reinvest and be balanced with capital returns.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","My question is around Foxtel, where obviously getting revenue growth, but there has been a significant step up in the costs. How do you think about those costs going forward? Do you view the costs now providing effectively a base or is there -- are there some one-off costs in this quarter, which you're likely cycle out of in subsequent quarters?","Bedi Singh","In the quarter obviously some of the costs are related to programming. So we had costs for the motor sports and so I think those to the extent we have sports-related costs, you'd expect them to recur. In terms of marketing costs, we're still actively marketing the new packages and I think there will be some continuing costs for that. But we should see those tapering down in the second half of the year. Obviously, with triple-play, there will be customer support and installation costs that will continue, but we should see those tapering down.","Robert Thomson","To add to Bedi's answer, obviously in sales in Q1 were up 38%. Total subs were up 10% to $2.9 million. It's a very dynamic market in Australia at the moment, as you're well aware. There is some competition, for example, from Netflix, but what you have to realize is the offering at Netflix is certainly inferior to that of Foxtel and indeed inferior to that of Netflix in the U.S.","Bedi Singh","And just to add to that, obviously, the full impact of the new subscribers that we've added hasn't yet flown through, because the additions were in the second half of last fiscal year. You should see that flowing through as well as the year goes on.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Fraser McLeish with Credit Suisse.","Fraser McLeish","I've got a Foxtel related question as well. Just quickly, I think for the full-year, you said you expected Foxtel EBITDA to grow in FY '16. I'm wondering, if you're still expecting that given the first quarter? And also, it was helpful breaking out the cable and satellite growth. But I was just wondering, are you able to give us the number of Presto subscribers that are actually included in that base?","Bedi Singh","I think we still expect Foxtel to show EBITDA improvement as the year goes on. Again, it's a factor of what Robert and I both mentioned in response to the previous question, which is you'll see the effect of revenues for the new subscribers going all the way through and some tapering down of the costs. We're not actually breaking out I think the Presto numbers, but needless to say, most of the growth that we saw came from cable and satellite subscribers.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alice Bennett with CBA.","Alice Bennett","I'm sorry, I've got another Foxtel question. I just was wondering if you could give us a sense where ARPU has come through relative to the $93 you talked about in FY '15, but also just a sense of whether you're seeing any stabilization from the pricing gap, but also presumably some tiering down as Netflix penetration picks up in Australia. Just whether you're seeing those ARPU numbers start to base out or do you think there's still further downside to come?","Bedi Singh","So I think with the new pricing packages, what we're seeing is that ARPU has come down a little bit. I would say sort of mid-single digits. We haven't actually given out the actual ARPU number, but what's happening I think with that is we're seeing churn has actually improved. And in terms of spin-down, I think it's sort of on plan is the best way to put it. So we haven't seen anything significantly worrying with respect to spin-down.","Robert Thomson","Just to supplement Bedi, on the point of churn, it's down from 10.5% to 10.1%. Obviously, it's a very competitive market, but we believe we have a very competitive product.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","James Copeland","Hi, this is James Copeland in for Alexia. I just wanted to ask you a question about the journal and video and mobile advertising. I'm just curious, if you can provide any insight on how mobile and video are progressing and particularly given how rapidly mobile is growing at a couple of your peers. Could you say anything about adding new marketers maybe that are already advertising in other platforms that you might be bringing onto mobile for the first time?","Robert Thomson","It's a very good question. We are seeing obviously significant growth in the mobile audience and generally speaking in recent years, that growth in audience hasn't been reflected in a similar growth in mobile advertising. What we have done by acquiring companies like Unruly and Storyful is to bring real mobile video expertise into musical voice and not just at the Wall Street Journal, but across the company. And so that is enabling us to derive higher returns and set us on a track for longer-term exploitation of obviously what is going to be a commercially crucial canvas.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll move next to Doug Arthur with Huber Research.","Doug Arthur","Just a question on HarperCollins and book publishing. You've had a number of tough comp quarters here with Divergent. How do you see the pipeline in comps going forward?","Bedi Singh","I think with Divergent, the next quarter we should see some easing of the comps, even though Divergent was still pretty big for Q2. So I think that's probably the way to look at it. Obviously, the mix of books, any quarter compared to the prior quarter, it sort of like depends on what happened. So I think it is one of those businesses where we will continue to go quarter-by-quarter. But generally we're very pleased with the way the book business is developing. I think, obviously, we'll see how the Christmas selling season pans out.","Robert Thomson","Just to be more specific, clearly we had a great hit with the American Sniper at this time last year and into the new year, but just to give you a range of figures that highlight the difficulty of comparison, which is a great challenge for the team at HarperCollins. Last year in the first quarter, Divergent generated about $25 million in revenue off of about 3.7 million units. In the just completed quarter, it was $2 million off 400,000 net units. And also don't forget about 40% of those units were e-books, which are a higher margin. So that gives you a sense of why the comps were so complicated.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Justin Diddams with Citi.","Justin Diddams","Just a question on Move. Impressive revenue growth for the quarter. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little on where that growth is coming from, whether it's sort of increased volume and usage through the platform, whether you put price increases through on the CoBroke product and how you are driving that revenue growth, that would be really useful.","Robert Thomson","Well, its two things I think to highlight. First of all, it's not only an increase in the quantity of traffic, its very high quality traffic. And that's leading to, in particular in the CoBroke area, an increase in revenue that's quite significant. I think overall, the revenue rose 33%. You might have noticed earlier this week a company that starts with the final letter of the alphabet, Zee that is, Zed elsewhere, was up 13%. And one other important component was a media advertising, which is where not only in the editorial content, but also in the approach to media advertising we saw a significant increase, that was up 60% year on year and so both of those components have made material improvement.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Levy with Macquarie.","Andrew Levy","Just a question on the book segment. You mentioned that the industry trends were a weaker for e-book sales. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what might have been driving that, whether it was related to releases or you think there's some of the industry issue at play at the moment?","Bedi Singh","It is sort of hard to tell in precise detail, but I think it's obviously a mix of books will affect that. I think pricing can be a factor in that. I think there's a number of things at play, but generally, if you read the other book companies and what they have been publishing in terms of their results, I think there seems to be a general weakness in e-books.","Robert Thomson","And to add to Bedi's point, which is obviously correct, it's made particularly so in our case because of the Divergent effect and its pronounced e-book component.","Michael Florin","Operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Huber with Huber Research.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi. Curious how much thought you guys have given and your Board of Directors has given to potentially breaking up the company by either spinning off your news and information segment to a separate standalone public company or taking your entire Australian assets and spinning those off into separate Australian equity?","Robert Thomson","Craig, I think one thing you'll have noticed from the results is how the complimentary of our assets has created a powerful platform that it makes News Corp as it is far more than the sum of the parts. We couldn't have done what the team have done at Realtor without the newspaper assets. We couldn't have done what the team have done at REA without those newspaper assets.","And you're seeing that compliment of entirety play out in other ways. And as we get more and more data across the businesses, whether they be the newspaper businesses, the News America Marketing or the real estate companies, we'll be able to share important demographic data. And I think that does give us a real comparative advantage.","And what you're seeing at the moment in the ad market, as I mentioned in my preamble, at the moment there is a lot of tension between advertisers and agencies, and that's both in, for example, freestanding inserts area, right across the newspaper advertising, and we genuinely believe that the asset mix we have has created a platform for the future, for the company and obviously for shareholders.","Michael Florin","Thanks, Craig. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Hahn","Bedi, can you confirm, did you say the earnings and cash flow benefits of divesting Amplify won't come through until fiscal '17? And how much did Amplify cost News Corp in cash burn in '15?","Bedi Singh","So in '15 the cash burn was roughly about $200 million. There will be some benefit in fiscal '16. But what I meant was that the full effect will be felt from fiscal '17 onwards.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alice Bennett with CBA.","Alice Bennett","I just had a question about data, which you're referencing quite a lot. Just wondering whether you're close to the point where data is becoming monetizable, I guess. One of your competitors in Australia has talked recently about programmatic finally turning positive, the yields for the online display revenues, because of their data and what they are doing with it. Are you at the point where you're close to monetizing it or is it more just sharing it with other parts of your business?","Robert Thomson","Alice, we're certainly monetizing it. Obviously, there is data and there's high quality and there is low grade. And you look, for example, one of the Checkout 51's benefits for the company and its efficacy is clear, is that instead of intentions or context through the uploading receipts, you're seeing buying actions.","That tells you a lot about not only the purchase, but the purchaser. So for example, if somebody goes to a home improvement store and buys 15 tins of paint, some siding for the house, that person may be preparing that particular home for sale. That lead is invaluable to a realtor.","And so at the same time, if that person is moving into an area or leaving an area that's what you might call a typical cashman area for a Wall Street Journal reader, it's an opportunity to attract a new subscriber. That's internally our ability to optimize that data and clearly we'll get more sophisticated, as the months progress. And we're also able to use that data for our clients, our advertisers and our partners.","Michael Florin","Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll move next to Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","So I assume you're consolidating high property into your financials in calendar Q1, as you mentioned. Can you tell us the size? How much revenue and EBITDA does that business generate?","Bedi Singh","We will be consolidating -- the REA will be consolidating our property. And obviously since we consolidate REA, it will flow upwards into our consolidation. EBITDA from that business is sort of marginal and revenues are sort of in the $50 million range.","Michael Florin","Thanks, Eric. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alice Bennett with CBA.","Alice Bennett","Just one more question. Just with subscription revenues around the world, it provided a bit of a buffer to your newspaper revenues, the last couple of years. Just wondering with the cover price increases that have been fairly aggressive, whether you see that kind of tapering out over the next year or so or you still see further scope for those to continue to rise?","Robert Thomson","Alice, I think I wouldn't agree with your phrase aggressive. I think we've been conscious of our different markets and the elasticity that different products have. And if you're talking about the Wall Street Journal or Times of London, that's very different to the daily telegraph. But at the same time, we believe that these are beacon brands that they have the best journalism in the world, and there remains a certain elasticity, which varies by segment.","Michael Florin","Thanks, Alice. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Just a follow-up question around cable network programming, and obviously there was news earlier this week that the EPL contract has been lost to another provider. I just wanted to understand, how do you think now internally about a potential loss of subscribers, given that contract is gone? And do you intend to backfill perhaps that spot with either direct agreements with the clubs or other spots?","Robert Thomson","Entcho, obviously you can buy any route as long as you're prepared to pay any price. But sometimes, by our reckoning, any price is not appropriate for us or our shareholders. And as you say, there are some EPL fans in Australia, there's no doubt about that, but we're certainly not talking about prime time. The 3:00 PM kickoff in U.K. is 2:00 AM in Australia.","So as you know, hard-core fans of anything in Australia are called tragics. So the sweet spot for EPL at 2:00 in the morning, our tragics are insomniacs. And the other thing you might have noticed yesterday, Bayern Munich beat Arsenal 5-1 in the Champions League, which maybe itself an indictment of the value of the Premier League.","Michael Florin","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Peter Stamoulis with Evans & Partners.","Peter Stamoulis","I was just interested in your thoughts around this ad blocking technology and how it may impact your traditional mastheads, and in particular advertising revenues going forward, and how I suppose you mitigate those risks?","Robert Thomson","Look, it's much talked about and less seen, to be honest, in our businesses. The truth is that, for example, Unruly will give us expertise around ads and insight into the use of ads that is valuable to our clients and as well as to our products. But the role of ad blockers is much more pronounced in what you might call commodity content sites. Sites that have more noise than news and that's certainly not ours.","End of Q&A","Michael Florin","Well, thank you all for participating. And have a great day. And we'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","That does conclude tonight's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"15601":["News (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q2 2015 Earnings Call February  5, 2015  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Michael Florin - Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations","Robert J.

Today's call is being recorded. Please be advised media is invited on a listen-only basis. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal Second Quarter of 2015 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago. It's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended December 31, 2014, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert J. Thomson","Thank you, Mike. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we continued to pursue the long-term development of the company as well as delivering positive results in the here and now with reported revenues of $2.3 billion, up 2%; stable EBITDA of $328 million; and a rather healthy free cash flow. Importantly, excluding currency fluctuations during a patently volatile period in the ForEx market, acquisitions and other nonoperating costs, our adjusted EBITDA grew by a robust 4%. That makes 2 successive quarters of improving revenues year-over-year, signaling that the transformation is on track and that most of our core businesses are delivering solid results. At the heart of the metamorphosis of a company with a proud provenance, a very proud provenance, is our promise to become more digital and increasingly global, and both of those characteristics are clear in the numbers today.","It is also worth noting that these achievements come despite a very uneven global advertising market. Advertising remains distinctly short term, making prognostication difficult, but the diversity and the depth of our portfolio have provided a solid buffer. This quarter marks the first time partial results from Move are included. Although we don't yet have a full quarter of performance, it is fair to say that the expansion of our Digital Real Estate portfolio should provide a firm foundation for future growth, and our confidence has only increased post-closing.","For example, average unique users at realtor.com grew at a record rate of approximately 33% in January to 37 million. Total visits to the site rose 46% on a year earlier, and importantly, total mobile visits rose 79%. While there is much toil ahead, there's also much reason for optimism.","Our other major acquisition to date, Harlequin, has continued to benefit our Book Publishing business hoping to usher in a new era of international and digital expansion at HarperCollins. Harlequin has access to over 100 markets and publishes in 34 languages, which is a far broader base for us, and we have already begun using that reach to take more advantage of successful titles.","Here are a few top line observations about our Q2 performance. With Harlequin integrated into its stable of brands and solid results in other divisions, HarperCollins continues to show great strengths. Sales of the Divergent series have exceeded our expectations again with 1.5 million units sold in the second quarter, and we are keenly looking forward to the second film in the Divergent series, Insurgent, scheduled for release next month.","We have also benefited significantly from the release of the film American Sniper, which has obviously stimulated sales of the eponymous book, now atop bestseller charts in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. The tome had strong momentum in the month of January when it sold 1.2 million units. To date, Chris Kyle's American Sniper has sold 3.9 million copies, and that title is rising rapidly.","HarperCollins announced this week the acquisition of the North American rights to the newly discovered novel by Harper Lee, the author of the monumental To Kill a Mockingbird. The novel Go Set a Watchman will be published on July 14 this year and gives HarperCollins a head start for next fiscal year. If the overwhelming interest in the announcement is reflected in book sales, we can expect robust performance this summer and beyond.","During the quarter, we also saw increased monetization of the backlist by Brian Murray's team at HarperCollins through dynamic pricing and subscription offerings, demonstrating how digital drives value for titles. Going forward, we are optimistic about the rich scene that is our back catalog.","The net effect of the developments this quarter at our Book Publishing segment, revenues improved by 20% and EBITDA by a healthy 13% versus the prior period.","The Dow Jones continues to make progress at the professional information business, but we were particularly pleased that advertising at The Wall Street Journal was higher than in the prior year. One reason was an increase in advertising by technology and finance companies in the print edition of The Journal. It is certainly meaningful that tech companies see the value and power of print as a platform and its desirable demographic.","At News Australia, we again saw sequential year-over-year improvement with advertising declining only 3% in local currency and EBITDA again up versus the prior year. Our digital subscriptions are now approaching 250,000, almost 30% higher versus the prior year, but it is still early days in our digital development. We've been revamping the product offerings, including the launch of new apps at our metro mastheads, and we have reduced costs, including the closing of our Gold Coast printing site, while we have successfully raised newsstand pricing and subscription rates to drive circulation revenues.","For News UK, it's worth noting progress at Sun+, The Sun's digital offering, which reported a total 225,000 paid subscriptions in late November. This was double the prior year figure, representing over 10% of the masthead's overall circulation and helped to offset print volume declines. There is no precedent or template for this project in the popular masthead market, so we are still learning about churn, loyalty and seasonality. What we do know is that the advertising climate in the U.K. remains very difficult, but we are renewing our efforts on digital ad sales and assiduously cultivating core clients.","The Times has distinguished itself by being the only U.K. newspaper to show an increase in print circulation in the most recent audited reports and been the best-performing national newspaper for 7 consecutive months. We've seen both print and digital volume growth, and ARPU continues to increase year-over-year. At a time of media transformation with a flood of low-grade listicles and cheesy charticles, it is clear that high-quality journalism attracts high-quality revenue and reader engagement across all platforms. Importantly, as we highlighted last month, The Times reported an increase in profitability in the last fiscal year, thanks to the success of its digital strategy and higher print sales.","Turning to News America Marketing. It is operating in a challenging environment, particularly with respect to its FSI products, where the competition is particularly intense. The in-store sector showed growth but is a smaller proportion of overall revenue in the sector. We are exploring partnerships to digitize the insert business and leverage our strategic relationships with retailers and consumer packaged goods companies.","In Australia, we are pleased with the early results of the new pricing strategy at Foxtel. The company's market penetration had stalled for several years, and so we agreed with our partner, Telstra, to lower the entry price and market this uniquely rich service with extra vigor. Early results are encouraging with an increase of just over 80% in new sales volume and a lower-than-envisaged percentage of existing clients taking cheaper packages. Bedi will furnish more details in a few moments, but these early numbers, and they are early numbers, are a tribute to the efforts of Richard Freudenstein and his team. Foxtel also announced this week the commercial launch of its triple-play bundle and shortly will unveil its advanced iQ3 set-top boxes, broadening its product offerings with a view to solidifying its leadership in the market.","Fox Sports Australia celebrated the success of the national sports teams in recent weeks with Australia winning the Asian Cup at the weekend, which itself will further stimulate interest in soccer. We should benefit as we hold the rights to local soccer matches as well as to the increasingly popular English Premier League matches. Meanwhile, the Australian team is also favored to win the Cricket World Cup, which begins in coming days. Cricket, while a mystery to some in the outside world, is an important component of the offering in Australia.","Also in Australia, REA had a very good quarter not only demonstrating growth but an improvement from the fiscal first quarter in revenues and profitability in local currency. It continues to extend its position as the market leader and has expanded its international footprint, raising its stake in iProperty, the East Asian digital site, to around 20% and acquiring a strategic 20% stake in Move.","At Move, Ryan O'Hara has just taken over as CEO, and there is already a profound difference in the metrics as the company is being integrated into the broader News Corp platforms. Those of you who access WSJ.com or the New York Post online will see search boxes for realtor.com, and you will increasingly see sophisticated targeted subscription ads for The Journal and the New York Post on realtor.com, as we leverage unique data to drive precisely targeted offerings.","While realtor.com's core business is real estate, we believe its audience can be monetized in many other creative ways given the vast array of demographically desirable data we will derive from home buyers. At realtor.com, we have also begun layering in content from Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch and the New York Post. We're improving engagement, driving more impressions, particularly on mobile, as the dramatic increase in traffic in January attests, and this improvement comes largely from organic improvements, not from increased marketing expense. We launched a new homepage with improved user experience and search functionality, and we are working to incorporate realtor.com into the News Corp programmatic ad exchange, which is well-positioned to drive higher CPMs.","We are also making a concerted push in the New York City market, which had not been well served in the past. We are leveraging the audience at The Post and The Journal and our partnership with the leading real estate companies. We expect a stronger presence in New York to increase the flow of prestige properties but also to raise the profile of realtor.com on Madison Avenue and elsewhere and create a more lucrative digital advertising platform.","Let us be very clear. We are at the earliest of stages with the development of realtor.com, and the U.S. market itself is at an early stage of development. But having looked more closely at the company since the acquisition, we are even more excited about its potential both for the group and as a business in one of the fastest growing digital sectors. Macro conditions are also more auspicious as mortgage lending restrictions have been relaxed, housing starts are on the rise and the real estate runes in the U.S. market generally are positive.","We have been candid with you about the importance of the seasonal selling season at Amplify. There is no doubt that the digital curriculum is the most advanced of its kind, and we have a remarkable, creative and committed team under Joel Klein's astute leadership.","Furthermore, we are very realistic about the exigencies of the marketplace and the importance of a robust sales network. Our focus is to drive both scalability and profitability, and we expect a meaningful reduction in investment spend next year.","Taken together, the second quarter of fiscal 2015 tells a compelling story of News Corp's evolution as a business. We are definitely more digital and global, thanks to the success with digital subscriptions at our mastheads, the expansion of subscribers at Foxtel, the development at HarperCollins through the Harlequin purchase and the addition of realtor.com and our other Asian real-estate-related investments. Advertising trends are difficult to forecast, and the situation in Greece remains a potential catalyst for more wide-spread economic upheaval, so we have resolved to be vigilant in reducing costs.","Having explained that we would be reconfiguring the company over the first 2 years and having seen that plan unfold on schedule, we will continue to review our capital allocation priorities. Our goal remains to be balanced among organic investment, strategic M&A and as we had indicated, the return of capital.","Now let me turn it over to Bedi, who will provide background detail and texture on today's results.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, Robert. First, I'll cover some high-level financial highlights and then discuss each segment in further detail. We reported fiscal 2015 second quarter revenue of $2.28 billion, a 2% increase versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year.","With regard to EBITDA, we reported total segment EBITDA of $328 million compared to the prior year period of $327 million. This quarter includes $13 million of costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters net of indemnification and $16 million of transaction-related costs for the Move acquisition, which closed in mid-November. Excluding those costs plus the remaining impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, our adjusted total segment EBITDA grew by 4% versus the prior year. As Robert noted, we were impacted by currency headwinds, primarily the Australian dollar, which negatively impacted Q2 total revenues by $72 million or 3% and total segment EBITDA by $16 million or 5%.","Reported EPS were $0.24 versus $0.26 in the prior year period due to higher effective tax rate and lower interest income. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges, U.K. Newspaper Matter costs and other onetime items, our adjusted EPS were $0.26 versus $0.31 in the prior year.","The results, again, underscores the strength and diversity of our asset portfolio, which continues to show underlying EBITDA and free cash flow improvement despite the uneven global ad marketplace. We continue to extract cost efficiencies while strengthening 2 of our key pillars, Digital Real Estate and Book Publishing, which we believe will materially reshape the growth profile of News Corp.","Turning to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter declined $89 million or 6% versus the prior year period, and adjusted segment revenue declined 3%. Within the segment revenues, advertising, which was 58% of segment revenues this quarter, declined around 9% or 6% in local currency relatively similar to the first quarter. If we look at the performance across our key units starting at News Corp Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined around 10% or approximately 3% in local currency, again, showing sequential year-over-year improvement versus fiscal first quarter and last year's fiscal fourth quarter on a local currency basis, helped by market share gains in print and higher digital advertising sales. We saw strong improvements there in the national, notably government and travel, real estate and classified ad categories. News Corp Australia EBITDA also improved due to low costs, including overhead reductions and from the closure of the Gold Coast printing facility in the prior fiscal year.","At The Wall Street Journal, advertising grew 2% versus the prior year, a big improvement from the first quarter, benefiting from strength in 2 key categories, finance and technology, combined with strong demand for the WSJ magazine. We saw advertising growth in both print and digital this quarter.","At News UK, advertising revenues remain soft this quarter, declining around 18% or 16% in local currency, which was slightly worse than Q1, still impacted by weakness in grocers, telecom, finance and automotive.","At News America Marketing, revenues declined due to continuing weakness in free-standing inserts, which have been under pressure over the past 2 quarters, impacted by lower spending from consumer packaged goods companies. The decline was partially offset by in-store advertising growth.","Total circulation and subscription revenues, which account for 35% of segment revenues this quarter declined by 3%. The decline was driven by the professional information business at Dow Jones, which had a negative $11 million impact to revenues this quarter but again, continues to show sequential year-over-year improvement as the pipeline of business is strengthening. As Robert had noted, we expect to see further improvements in the second half and hopefully be positioned for growth next fiscal year.","Total newspaper circulation revenues, however, showed modest year-over-year growth on a local currency basis in every region driven by subscription and cover price increases at a number of our mastheads, coupled with higher revenue from digital subscribers, which more than offset print volume declines. Of note, starting in January, we have begun to migrate legacy Wall Street Journal subscribers to higher price point tiers.","Segment EBITDA decreased $39 million in the quarter or 15% as compared to the prior year period and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 12%. Included in segment EBITDA was $8 million impact related to the relocation of our London operations for deal rent and other facility costs. As I mentioned on past calls, we do not expect any material deal rent and other facility costs from the second half and onwards. This quarter we also incurred roughly $9 million higher legal expenses at News America Marketing related to ongoing litigations.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 20%, and segment EBITDA grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the results from the Harlequin acquisition, which closed in August 1, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were in line with the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA declined 4% due to tough comparison from the Divergent series in the prior year period.","While the Divergent series continues to sell well, this quarter totaling over 1.5 million net units, this, as expected, was lower than the 5.7 million net units sold in the prior year period, creating a $33 million revenue challenge. Despite that challenge, the core HarperCollins business performed very well to nearly match year-ago levels with solid contributions in General Books, from Amy Poehler's Yes Please, Patricia Cornwell's Flesh and Blood and Chris Kyle's American Sniper as well as continued demand of Sarah Young's Jesus Calling series in Christian Publishing.","Total e-book sales for the quarter grew 14% and accounted for the 17% of consumer revenues. Harlequin contributed $80 million of revenues and $11 million of EBITDA in the quarter. It's worth highlighting that Harlequin's profitability is improving, and we are implementing a number of initiatives to reduce costs, including streamlining, manufacturing and distribution as well as harmonizing sales strategies.","In Cable Network Programming, revenues improved $2 million or 2% compared to the prior year quarter. Subscription revenues grew 3% benefiting from higher affiliate fees from Foxtel and increased number of subscribers. Advertising revenues decline modestly due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations, but revenues were up slightly in local currency despite a soft TV marketplace. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues increased 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA improved by 9%.","In Digital Real Estate Services, we now include results from both REA Group and from Move effective from November 14. Total revenues for the segment increased $51 million or 50%, and EBITDA improved 4% compared to the prior year period. Again, included in the reported results are $16 million of transaction-related fees for the Move acquisition. Excluding foreign currency fluctuations, REA's adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 26% and 38%, respectively, an improvement from the prior quarter driven by higher pricing and increased penetration for enhanced products.","The quarter's results also include $34 million in revenue and $3 million of EBITDA for Move for the period November 14 through the quarter end, as the business continued to benefit from higher traffic this quarter. EBITDA does include $4 million of stock-based compensation expense though, and as a point of reference, Move excluded stock-based compensation when reporting their adjusted EBITDA.","Audience growth at realtor.com has accelerated through the year with fiscal second quarter average monthly unique users up 26% led by mobile platforms, which were up 60%. And also importantly, lead volume growth improved by 38%.","As Robert noted, our immediate focus for realtor.com is on product development. We've already refreshed the homepage, added widgets and links across The Wall Street Journal Digital Network and The New York Post, and are integrating our content across the site. Our goal is to drive significant revenue growth and material contribution to profitability in the coming years, and early results are encouraging with January monthly unique users up over 30% to 37 million.","In the second half of this fiscal year, we expect to see revenue growth accelerate driven by the continued success of our buyer agent, co-broked (sic) [ co-brokered ] product, which grew over 100% last quarter combined with higher usage levels. And we also intend to reinvest judiciously in marketing and product development as I've previously said. Overall, we are very pleased about Move's trajectory and remain excited about it's potential.","At business and education, revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter, and segment EBITDA improved $20 million to a loss of $24 million. Again, about $14 million of that improvement was due to the capitalization of software development costs related to our digital ELA learning products, and the balance came from operating efficiencies.","With respect to earnings from affiliate's, Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.7 million total subscribers, up 5% versus the prior year driven by cable satellite subscribers. Foxtel revenues for the quarter in local currency were in line with prior year, and EBITDA improved 2%. Churn declined to 11.8% from 12.8% in the prior year quarter. Foxtel launched its new revamped pricing and packaging on November 3 last year with an expectation of improving cable satellite subscriber penetration over the course of the year. Again, while it's early in the rollout, results overall are encouraging. Total new sales volume has improved by approximately 80% since launch, and churn has reduced. Despite the impact of the lower selling price point, ARPU remains favorable year-over-year, reflecting the limited spin down to date of existing customers.","Turning now to cash flow. News Corp's cash flow from operations in the first half of fiscal '15 improved to $492 million compared to $407 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $275 million compared to $217 million in the prior year. The vast majority of our $1.9 billion cash on hand is in U.S. dollars.","We continue to expect full year CapEx to be relatively similar to the prior year at around $400 million, including around $70 million for the London relocation, which is now complete and $60 million related to capitalized software at Amplify Learning.","So in summary, we believe this quarter and the first half results demonstrate that News Corp is on the right track. While the ad market has been unpredictable and currency has been and remains a headwind, we believe the steps we're taking both in reinvestments and operating efficiencies are positioning the company for long-term growth.","With that, let me hand it back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Fraser McLeish with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Fraser McLeish - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question on Move. Just noticing that ListHub is -- or Zillow is not going to be getting its listings from ListHub anymore. Just was that your decision or theirs? And what sort of impact in second half on your revenues and also what sort of strategic advantage do you think that's going to give you once those listings go?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, certainly, we were in negotiations with Zillow up until recently, and they've filed a form, which declared that those negotiations had finished. So it's fair to say, if you want to put it this way, they took the initiative. It is now up to ListHub, of course, to recreate through the rather complex MLS system a -- which is -- or through -- Zillow through the complicated MLS system, a feed that takes into account that there are in total around 850 MLSs, and that -- frankly, that's their responsibility. Now ListHub itself provides feeds to about 166 publishers, and we at Move, of course, have a direct feed from the MLSs. We don't use ListHub itself, which is a syndication services, and -- but what we do have at Move, quite frankly, are fresher listings, more accurate listings. And that, we are going to make clear with our marketing over coming months, and we believe that once it becomes clear that, that -- they -- our IR comparative advantage is that users, as they already are, increase -- increasingly turn to realtor.com as their source of real estate listings and information. There is no material impact at all on our revenues through the Zillow move.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Janedis with Jefferies.","John Janedis - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on your prepared remarks. Do you need any more scale through acquisitions in the real estate or book verticals if you will? And how do you think about your cash balance and the timing around the potential for return to capital given your desire to have that balance?","Robert J. Thomson","Certainly, with the Move acquisition, our immediate gain -- goal is to develop the potential of the company. As we've made clear, we're very excited about that. That will be an ongoing task in the next year or 2. As for the Book Publishing business, we've successfully integrated the Harlequin business into HarperCollins, which, as you can tell, performed very well during the quarter. We look ahead to more cost synergies at Harlequin, but we also look ahead with much optimism to the catalog that we have at -- more generally at HarperCollins. As we said in the past, the first 2 years are years of consolidation and development and transformation. We're well on schedule there. We will -- we'll obviously be reviewing capital allocation in coming months, but that's really all we can say at this stage but to reinforce our sense that we're pleased with the trajectory of the company and in particular with both the Book Publishing business and so far, from what we've seen, very much so with the performance of the new team at Move.","Operator","We'll now hear from Bill Bird with FBR.","William G. Bird - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Was wondering if you could elaborate on your expectation for meaningful reduction in Amplify investment spending next year. Was wondering if you could address whether you're committed to all 3 business lines and if you're open to considering narrowing the scope of the business.","Robert J. Thomson","Look, we have 2 priorities over the coming months. One is to continue to develop the best-quality digital curriculum in the country and, we believe, in the world; and secondly, to get our sales teams out to see the market reaction to that curriculum. That will be the priority. We'll be reviewing the situation at Amplify at the end of that selling season. But we're confident in our curriculum and we're confident in our teams.","Operator","We'll go on to Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just following up on your comments in your prepared remarks about the strength you saw in the quarter at The Wall Street Journal, particularly in the print side where you saw positive growth. I guess, anymore color you can give there in terms of -- I know you mentioned the tech and the finance being a driver of that. Was it more broad based? I guess, was there anything specific to the quarter that led to the strength? Or do you think this could be a more sustainable trend? And then just a second question, if I may, on News America and the weakness there. Do you find that to be a core holding for your company? Or is that something you might strategically consider to maybe divest down the road?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, look, we were extremely gratified by the performance of The Wall Street Journal in the quarter just passed. I think what you saw was a recognition by tech companies and finance and others, luxury goods advertisers in the magazine about the strength of that platform, the power and obviously, the positive reaction to the advertisements. So I think it tells you that The Wall Street Journal has a distinct demographic, and it tells you that high-quality content brings high-quality audiences and high-quality advertisers. As for News America Marketing, the task for our team there is to push hard on the FSI business. It's a competitive market. There's absolutely no doubt about that. They know the extent of the challenge. But to give you a sense of the opportunity at News America Marketing, they are very much involved with -- in discussion with our team at Move, looking at how you can bring together, for example, knowledge that somebody's going to move house with household-related products in which News America Marketing has a particular strength.","Operator","We'll go on to Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Entcho Raykovski here. My question is around Fox Sports Australia, and obviously, you've achieved some higher affiliate pricing in the quarter. I just wanted to understand, is this part of a new package that Foxtel is providing as well? And also, there have been some new channels, which are being offered in Fox Sports Australia. Are they likely to result in higher costs over the coming quarters?","Robert J. Thomson","The increasing revenue is related to subs itself, up low double digits, which is due to the growth in those subs. I mean, we're very optimistic that the development of the channels there will provide opportunity for more growth in revenue than growth in expenses. And I think the team there is particularly excited that the sports in which they have specialized, like soccer and cricket, are sports in which the -- as we mentioned earlier, the national teams are doing well, and when you have a positive mood, you have greater audience growth. I mean, I'll put you across to Bedi for further metrics on...","Bedi Ajay Singh","Just on -- I think on your cost question, obviously the -- there'll be some costs increases in Q3. We've got some onetime events, the Asian Cup, Cricket World Cup, so that'll will take cost up a bit. Margins and maintaining the margins will depend on how much higher volume we get in terms of subscribers and additional rate increases.","Operator","We'll go on to Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. First, on the last call, you mentioned that circulation revenue would have been flattish in 2014 without DJX. Can you remind us when those headwinds fully subside and what circulation would have looked like in fiscal Q2 excluding DJX? And also, you made 2 recent investments in India sort of back to back. Can you talk a little bit about how big of an opportunity these investments could be and whether this is maybe the overarching strategy in India?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Right. So on DJX, as I said, this is -- we're seeing improvement in terms of the rate of revenue drop, and I think by the end of this fiscal year, we should be pretty much out of that. So coming into the new fiscal year next year, we should actually see that not being a drag on the overall circulation. In terms of the India investments, we made an investment in a real estate company called PropTiger, and we also made another small investment. So we're looking at the Indian market in terms of making relatively smart and sort of relatively smaller size bets. But the market there is completely exploding in terms of Internet platforms, and I think we have to be in that market. And there's a lot of synergy in addition to the real -- on the real estate side. We think we are doing, not just here in the U.S. with Move, but also with REA operating in the Asia-Pacific region.","Operator","And Justin Diddams, with Citi.","Justin Diddams - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question is around the News UK, advertising down 16% in local currency. I don't think we can sustain that kind of decline much longer, so I'm wondering what the strategy is for the U.K. business to either halt those advertising declines and\/or monetize football rights or what the plan is for the U.K. business, particularly in the context of a $70 million office move.","Robert J. Thomson","Well, just, first of all, the office move was bringing together all the companies, and out of that, we've already seen not only creative synergies but cost synergies. And those cost synergies will continue to be manifest. There's no doubt that the advertising market in the U.K. is a volatile one. The winds are fluky, but what Mike Darcey and the team are doing in particular: one, focusing on digital advertising where we do believe that there is room for growth; two, we're constantly looking at circulation revenue; and three, the team is going out and arguing in a very competitive market about the value of the unused mastheads, which is very clear. And it's very clear, indeed, when you look at the circulation uptick in The Times, where -- while other newspapers are struggling, The Times is doing very well. And that message, when advertisers hear it and understand it, will resonate not only with advertisers but with potential consumers. So Mike and the team are very much on the case, and they certainly have levers to pull.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC","Wanted to focus for a second here on the cost outlook for your Australian newspapers and the U.K. papers. Did you feel at the stage that you have much room to take out more -- plenty more cost? Could you give us a sense how much fully to take out at this stage, both the U.K. and Australia, please?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Craig, I think -- I mean, the way to think about it is in Australia, and I think we've said that on some of the previous calls, the team there keeps doing a super job looking at the distribution, the manufacturing footprint. We brought down pricing on newsprint. They're doing a lot of work looking at sort of duplication of backrooms. So I think there's still runway to go in Australia to keep taking out costs. I mean, I think, they're diligently doing it. The U.K. has taken out a lot of costs, but I think there's always opportunity. And clearly, as Robert said, now that we've put everybody into one building and one location, some of that work is starting now in terms of can we get synergies out of everybody being together in one place. So I think there's still work going on there, but I would say probably Australia, there's more than there is in the U.K.","Operator","We'll now go to Doug Arthur with Evercore ISI.","Douglas M. Arthur - Evercore ISI, Research Division","On Book Publishing, I mean, flat adjusted revenues seems pretty impressive given the Divergent comparison. Is that comparison likely to get tougher in the next quarter or next 2 quarters? Or will the next movie release and the books attached to it start to offset that? I mean, how do you see that playing out in the near term?","Robert J. Thomson","Very good question. Look, it is a tough comparison. Q3 last year, the series sold around 8 million units, but look, there was surprise on the upside last quarter with the emergence of American Sniper. The full value of American Sniper will be felt in this quarter, and to be honest, sales are increasing still for that particular book. And as you mentioned, we do have the imminent release of the next film in the series. Again, around that, there'll be a lot of marketing and product placement that one would presume will be beneficial for sales. But the team at HarperCollins have done an excellent job making those tough comparisons and making the most of not only a great frontlist but a backlist that they are dynamically pricing and exploiting full value of.","Operator","We'll now go to Michael Morris with Guggenheim.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on Wall Street Journal. The price increases that you put through for new subscribers, last quarter, can you talk about what you learned in terms of the trajectory of new subscribers, whether that was impacted by the price increases and how that impacted the price increases for existing subscribers you're putting through this quarter -- or you put through this quarter and whether it gave you more confidence in the pricing power that you have at The Journal?","Robert J. Thomson","I think we have a lot of confidence in the pricing power of The Journal both in print and digitally. We increased the newsstand price, and newsstand sales are not a large percentage, but they're a significant measure at times of reaction to price increases. And that was an increase from $2 weekday to $3 with very little impact on circulation itself. So that's an immediate measure of the strength of that brand and the elasticity that we have.","Operator","Adam Alexander with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Robert, I've just got a question on Move. Now that you've had some time to look at the business, make some management changes, and you've reported some quite good metrics to date. At acquisition, you mentioned a marketing investment would make the acquisitions sort of dilutive to earnings. I'm just wondering whether that's still your expectations and if so, when we expect that sort of marketing spend to start ramping up.","Robert J. Thomson","The marketing spend will ramp up when we're happy with the marketing campaign and when we're happy with the adjustments to decide to make the user interface better to improve the experience that not only for use of the site but for Realtors who are our core clients. And so those are the priorities in the shorter term, and then around that, we will build our marketing campaign. But what I have to say that's been gratifying is that the -- what we presume to be the case, the bringing together of the platforms of the Dow Jones network and Move, realtor.com, that, that would have, of itself, for example, increased the power of organic search, and that is what you're seeing behind that rapid rise in usership in recent times. And we're particularly gratified by the increase in mobile usage. And for example, the mobile app, the number of visits in January was up close to 65%, and when you look at the app deep, the number of page views per visit, as best we can tell, at the app is around just over 18 pages per visit. So you're not only getting a lot of visitors, but you're getting very sticky visitors. And that comes at, frankly, very little or no marketing cost. So whatever we do longer term with marketing spend -- and there will be marketing spend, and our guidance has to be that it will be dilutive. What we're already seeing is an impact that has exceeded our expectations on the upside, so far, in terms of traffic and stickiness.","Operator","We'll now hear from Alice Bennett with CBA.","Alice Bennett - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division","Just have a question around Foxtel. I think you mentioned total subscribers up around 5%, and in recent quarters and years, most of that growth has been coming through with the digital subs. Just wondering post the price change if you can give us a sense of how much of the cable and satellite subscribers were up relative to the digital ones.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Yes. Alice, it's sort of -- I would say it's split almost evenly, but we are seeing encouraging pickup in the cable satellite part of it, which is good.","Alice Bennett - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division","Okay. And just on Foxtel, the iQ3 box, do you have any sense when that should be launched?","Bedi Ajay Singh","I don't they've announced a date, but we think it should be soon.","Operator","Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","I've got a couple, actually, if that's okay. Unrelatedly, first, I just wanted to ask, you mentioned about CPG, FMCG advertisers being quite tight with their budgets. I think that was a reference particularly to the U.K., but I wonder if you've got any further comments regarding that category in general, I mean, if you want to talk for your FSI business or just in general across your newspapers because that's a major advertising category that I know has been not spending very much lately. And then separately, secondly, on the subject of Amplify again, could you -- I assume you'll let us know if and when you win some decent school districts. But could you just describe what the status of school district purchases of curricular materials now are under the Common Core? Most states rolling out the Common Core this year, I just don't quite understand what the status is of states' decisions to go about making new curriculum purchases.","Robert J. Thomson","Well, it's difficult to generalize about advertising markets. You see, trends in the U.K. and Australia and at the Journal are frankly different, and I wouldn't want to therefore to generalize about a particular sector with -- globally. I think what we are experiencing at News America Marketing is compared -- competition in the sector generally for free-standing inserts. As for Amplify, we expected around 30,000 subscribers in -- for digital curriculum that -- we're around about that total at the moment, so it's on track. But we're quite honestly in the high peak of the selling season now so we'll have clearer numbers for you next quarter and the following quarter. Around the Common Core, clearly, there's a lot of debate about the Common Core, but even those states that don't adopt the Common Core in its entirety are adopting elements of the Common Core. And it varies very much state by state as to how different that adoption process is. But we're confident that there is a strong market for high-quality digital curriculum in the U.S., and that confidence has -- is flowing into the sales teams who are, as they should be, out selling.","Operator","We'll go to Brian Han with Morningstar Corporation.","Brian Han - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Now that the Move acquisition has been made and Amplify investment spending is going down, your CapEx outlook is pretty benign. Your free cash flow is still tumbling in. So I'm still wondering how you think about the capital management front going forward.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Brian, look, I think we've been pretty consistent in what we said in terms of -- out of the gate, we were looking at capital allocation priorities in terms of stabilizing the business, in terms of potential acquisitions. And I think Robert said earlier to another question that we had, we are -- clearly, the company is stabilizing, and I think in terms of looking at our capital allocation priorities, we are now reviewing those in much more detail.","Michael Florin","Operator, are there any additional questions?","Operator","No, sir. No additional questions, and with that, I will go ahead and turn things back over to Mike Florin for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Okay.

We\u2019re about to begin. Good day, and welcome to the News Corp\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Media is allowed to join today's conference in a listen-only basis. ","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to the call over to Mr. Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. ","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Matt. Hello everyone and welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal first quarter of 2017 earnings call. We issued our earning\u2019s press release about 30 minutes ago and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today, Robert Thomson, Chief Executive, and Bedi Singh, Chief Financial Officer.","We\u2019ll open with some prepared remarks, and then we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This called may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's form 10- K and for 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and gap [indiscernible]gap reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I'll pass over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments. ","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. The most recent quarter has highlighted the continuing digital development at New Corp at a time of great transition for media companies. Many of which are struggling to cope with devolution. Our growing portfolio of digital products and global character have enabled us not only to weather those profound changes but to build a firm foundation for a profitable future. ","There is no doubt the two of our core markets, the U.S. and U.K., have been characterized by a certain amount of uncertainty in the economic and political environment. But we have remained focused on developing long-term and robust sources of revenue while curtailing costs without undermining the quality about uniquely valuable content. ","Collaboration among our businesses has increased, but the sharing of lessons software and data to provide more valuable insights for our clients, readers, and advertisers.","During the first quarter of financial year2017, despite a distinctly soft-print advertising market and patent weakness in the British pound, our revenues were down only slightly. It is thus clear that our emphasis on digital real estate has given the company more resilience in even difficult training periods. ","We are still at the early stages of that real-estate development particularly in the U.S. where we are renovating realtor.com while living in the house. We expect the rates of growth at Realtor.com will increase later in the year as new products and pricing take hold in a U.S. property market that is itself still recovering from the extreme dislocation of the financial crisis.","For the most recent quarter our total segment EBITDA declined 21% versus the prior year, but half of that decrease was due to planned investments and one-time transaction cost. And we do not expect the quarterly performance to be reflective of the full-year results. In fact, we expect to see EBITDA improvements in the remainder of the year largely driven by growth in digital real estate at HarperCollins. ","As our real estate business continues to evolve and expand, we are now highlighting listing-based revenues separately in the digital real estate services segment to better reflect our performance and provide a clearer indication of the trajectory in that increasingly important sector. ","Significantly, this highlights are reduced reliance on traditional advertising, which today accounts for only a third of our total revenues. In addition to the strength of digital real estate, we are also pleased with the trends in book publishing at News American Marketing, which showed continuing growth in its in-store product revenues and is ahead of schedule in achieving its year-end goal of ten million downloads of the Check Out 51 app, which provides incentives for shoppers and unique marketing opportunities for consumer goods producers and retailers. ","As mentioned, one of the more profound changes at New Corps since its reincarnation in 2013 is the burgeoning of the digital real estate business building on our early success with R.E.I. in Australia and complementing that with investments in the U.S. East Asia and India. R.E.I. performed well again in the quarter despite some weakness in listing volume. Pricing improved and services provided to agents were enhanced.","Revenues expanded by 16% in local currency including sales of the recently acquired I property. R.E.I. is the clear market leader in Australia and has proven the robustness of its business by expanding reach and revenue despite macroeconomics Australia.","Move which operates Realtor.com experienced 9% revenue growth in the first quarter as we revamped the site and retooled its products. With the rollout of Showcase 2.0 in December and deeper penetration from the recently launched Seller Leads [indiscernible] products, we are confident revenue momentum will build in coming months. ","We firmly believe Realtor.com will make a meaningful contribution to segment revenue and EBITDA growth this year. We are investing for the long-term, but not at the expense of returns for investors. ","According to comScore engagement with Realtor.com leads the competition by a significant margin. Since our acquisition of move two years ago this month, Realtor.com\u2019s audience has grown more than 60% and brand awareness at Realtor.com is at 87%, which is up more than 25% in the last 18 months","In book publishing, HarperCollins reported a 14% increase in EBITDA despite a 5% decline in revenues, which was largely the result of the impact of the comparison with last year's sales of Go Set a Watchman the To Kill a Mockingbird prequel sequel. ","The HarperCollins\u2019 team is increasingly focused on books which resonate beyond the traditional elites. That is evident from the popularity of such titles as J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy and Sarah Young\u2019s books including the new Jesus Always, which builds on the success of her Jesus Calling. Also performing well, The Black Widow by Daniel Silva, The Magnolia Story by Joanna and Chip Gaines and Commonwealth by Ann Patchett. ","While a consolidation of our international operations in tandem with the Harlequin acquisition has given as I significantly more powerful global platform. We are also able to use our trade assets to market crossover successes from the Harlequin\u2019s stable of writers, which is increasing by the sales and margins to select titles.","In coming weeks, we will see the release of the highly anticipated Settle For More by Megyn Kelly. That title Settle For More will be our [indiscernible] incoming quarters. We also have optimistic expectations for Veronica Roth\u2019s next book, Carve the Mark. Veronica wrote the extremely successful Divergent trilogy, and for Chaos by Patricia Cornwall. ","In using information across our masthead, we saw a more challenging print advertising marketplace as has already been articulated by other companies in the sector. While digital advertising increased that growth was not enough to offset the decline in print. There is no doubt that the advertising market is in upheaval and that the renewed advertiser focus on view-ability and measure-ability to naturally benefit trusted brands with accurate metrics. Hype and hip are not alternatives to quality and integrity. ","In the middle of this commercial commotion, it is appropriate that ad agencies are under scrutiny as too much ad tech is bad tech. Advertising of the Wall Street Journal was down 21% but our circulation revenue rose 6% and the number of paid digital subscribers at The Wall Street Journal crossed the 1 million mark in September. ","The transition at the W.S.J. was highlighted by the fact that digital accounted for a record 55% percent of revenues this quarter. Obviously, some of that change is due to the decline in print advertising, but it also reflects the emphasis on broadening the digital subscriber base and the long term strategy of upselling higher yielding specialist products to those subscribers.","Historically, advertising accounted for about half the revenues at Dow Jones, but that ratio is now closer to 1\/3. Clearly, there is a renewed emphasis on cost control including a reduction in [inaudible] at Dow Jones and a redesign of the journal itself. You'll be able to see the results of that redesign in coming weeks and it will be obvious that print remains a very powerful platform and that the journal has an audience of unique influence and affluence. ","At News Corp Australia, we continue to confront the cost space while broadening our range of digital offerings. We experienced strong digital paid subscriber growth in the first quarter and an expanded number of [indiscernible] with a premium hybrid model allowing limited free access along with a paid for premium subscription. That model builds on the success we have seen at The Australian.","Meanwhile at News.com.au Australia\u2019s leading news website advertising revenue rose more than 30% in local currency compared to the same period last year.","Sports is a vital part of our offering in Australia, which is why we announced the acquisition of the Punters Paradise website in October offering news, analysis, and comparative odds for horse racing and other sport. At the same time, we are keen to dispose of known core assets to sharpen the focus of our operations. To that end we've sold our stake in New Zealand Media and Entertainment and hope to complete the sale of CarsGuide and The Sunday Times in Perth by the end of fiscal Q2. ","At News UK, The Times continues to gain market share and drive higher volume growth, experienced a 13% gain in [indiscernible] in the first quarter in a sector that is too often defined by decline. ","At The Sun, while advertising revenues have fallen the digital audience has expanded dramatically since the pay was lifted late last year. We are seeking to attract loyal readers with quality content and not digital drive-bys distracted by vacuous contentious click back.","In September, there were almost 46 million monthly visitors to The Sun compared to fifteen million units in September 2015 before the lifting of the pay indiscernible] News UK also benefits from cover price increases for its [indiscernible] market and from the launch of Sun [indiscernible] in August.","With the acquisition of Wireless Group, the team at New UK is working on the integration of this valuable asset, leveraging talent across platforms fashioning new ad packages to take advantage of multimedia opportunities, and cross promoting our brands including [indiscernible], which would be a powerful generator of future revenue for the company. ","And speaking of successful popular titles Digital Ad revenue for Q1 grew 42% year over year at the New York Post where the broader Post Digital Network had a record 65.1 million unique visitors in September. An increase of 109% year over year based on internal metrics.","At News America Marketing in-store price continue to post strong revenue growth driven by the creation of innovative avenues. Points of purchase persuasion is a powerful asset that we have at News America Marketing, which also has valuable direct links to advertisers who rely on a unique market intelligence.","In the past Digital has been a rather modest part of News America Marketing\u2019s offering, but the acquisition of Checkout 51 has changed that outlook dramatically. We had targeted the acquisition of ten million members this calendar year for Checkout 51, but could top that total this month if not this week.","The larger the audience, the better quality offerings, the [indiscernible] the experience. That virtuous cycle is clearly in motion at Checkout 51 where we\u2019ve had an influx of new deals of companies such Proctor and Gamble, Mandalay, and General Mills. ","We have just launched a Spanish language version of the app to appeal to the large and growing Latino audience in the U.S while we are able to get a rich permission data from users that is of supreme value to advertisers want to get inside in the shopping habits. And we're looking forward to the integration of Pay Pal into Checkout 51 expected by December, which will make it even easier for consumers to receive rebates for their purchases.","Foxtel posted modest year over year growth in cable satellite subscribers, although there was [indiscernible] partially related to Remotional non-contract offers last fiscal year.","Foxtel remains keenly focused on improving the quality of experience for subscribers and providing more product focus hence the decision to unwind the Presto the joint venture with Seven West. ","The executive team led by Peter Turner is determined to convey to potential subscribers the clear relative merits of Foxtel Play. His offering is vastly superior to that of competitors.","Foxtel Play\u2019s streaming service will roll out next month. It will present consumers with greater choice and flexible packages as well as much easier access to Foxtel\u2019s premium content including Fox Sports whose viewer numbers have repeatedly said records in recent months.","To ensure that subscribers have an unparalleled experience, Foxtel announced this quarter a new agreement with HBO that will give Foxtel even more extensive rights to HBO\u2019s lobby of content through 2021. ","Despite the focus on product enhancement and infrastructure investment, we're encouraged to see relatively stable EBITDA this quarter. As for Fox Sports, the record ratings were particularly pronounced for NRL, while there are also strong performances by Aussie Rules Football and motor racing. NRL viewership was up 11% for all games and those exclusive to Fox Sports were up 15%. ","For AFL total viewership was up 8%while the preliminary final between the Giants and the Western Bulldogs with an ultimate match of the year with the number one subscription T.V. program so far in calendar year 2016 in Australia. That increased viewership as well as expanding digital advertising what catalyst for advertising growth of low double digits in local currency in the first quarter, which compares rather favorably to listless levels elsewhere in the industry.","Costs were higher in the first quarter as was expected reflecting the timing sports expenses about which Bedi will have further details. Thankfully these quarterly costs are not reflective of the full-year exposure. ","Globally, we continue to integrate our Storyful and Unruly acquisitions into our existing brand. ","News UK now brings Storyful and Unruly into joint pitches for digital advertising. Storyful which has a unique ability to define meaningful moments on social media has become a part of the pitch for our Dow Jones risk and compliance business. If the consumer has a problem with a product and uploads a video or a comment Storyful\u2019s unique access to social platforms globally allows it to track the virility of the incident. It also remains the world's leading authenticator of social video for news agencies and broadcasters around the world. ","In conclusion, New Corp is not just a news company. We are a digital real estate company and a global and information company. We are proud of our prominence, but also leading the way in defining a digital future for media, whether it be to the strengths of our mastheads, on mobile, or the rapid growth of innovative news and commercial apps, that focus on long term growth is complemented by a rigorous monitoring of costs in the here and now. We are extremely conscious of our responsibility shareholders to create products that will prosper. While ensuring that we are custodians of our traditional businesses in transition.","Speaking of canny, I now pass you over to our CFO, Bedi Singh.","Bedi Singh","Thanks, Robert. We reported fiscal 2017 first quarter total revenues of 1.97 billion down 2% compared to the prior year. Currency had a 36 million unfavorable impact to revenues with modest year over year improvement in the Australian dollar more than offset by continued weakness in the British pound. Total segment EBITDA was a 130 million including five million in transaction related costs for the Wireless Group acquisition compared to a 165 million in the prior year.","For the quarter EPS from continuing operation were negative $0.03 compared to positive $0.22 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were negative $0.01 versus positive $0.05 in the prior year. Before discussing segment performance as Robert noted listing based revenues from our digital real estate businesses are now captured in a new real estate line on our income statement to better highlight that growth. Prior to this change those revenues were reflected within advertising revenues, we have also adjusted price comparatives for this. This real estate revenue line represented 9% of total revenue this quarter and grew 19% compared to the prior year.","Turning to the individual operating segment, in news and information services revenue for the quarter decreased 5% from the prior year to approximately 1.2 billion and within segment revenues advertising which accounted for just under 50% of revenues decreased around 11% or 10% in local currencies driven by weaker global print ad trends. Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 4% but were up 1% in local currency which is relatively stable with last quarter and the prior year driven by higher paid digital volume and price increases. News and information services segment EBITDA this quarter was $46 million down from $83 million in the prior period. This decrease was driven by lower print advertising revenues combined with $12 million and additional investment spending at Checkout 51 and the $5 million in wireless transaction cost partially offset by cost savings initiatives. ","Looking at performance across our key units, at Dow Jones domestic advertising declined 21% versus the prior year quarter which is greater than last fiscal fourth quarter rate reflecting a weaker print marketplace most notably in the finance and technology categories. On a positive note Wall Street Journal Circulation revenues grew over 6% this quarter due to higher subscription pricing and higher digital paid subscribers with digital only subs surpassing the one million mark during the quarter as Robert noted.","At the Professional Information business revenues were literally stable. And as Robert mentioned Dow Jones announced a series of initiatives focused on modernizing the news room and rationalizing print circulation and pagination while shifting resources to digital. As part of the plan we are targeting approximately 8% or $100 million reduction of the cost structure on an annualized basis by the end of fiscal '18. The restructuring program will begin implementation and Q2 this year and is expected to continue into Q3 with an anticipated restructuring charge of between $50 million to $60 million pretax during fiscal 2017 and benefit starting to phase in over the remainder of the fiscal year.","We believe this timely response for the secular print advertising declines will leave the business well positioned to maximize the digital growth opportunity. At News Australia, advertising revenues for the quarter declined 7% approximately 11% in local currency relatively be similar to the last fiscal fourth quarter. Circulation revenues at News Australia increased modestly for both reported and on the local currency basis as a result of cover price increases and higher paid digital subs are setting print volume declines. While we continue to benefit from the cost reduction program with News Australia announced in the second half of fiscal 2016 which totaled around 5% of the cost base. We are now embarking on further cost initiatives. We expect an additional AUD40 million in cost savings this fiscal year while we continue to push digital initiatives more broadly. At News U.K. while reported advertising revenue decrease 28%. Ad revenues were down midteens in local currency primarily due to print declines. Circulation revenues at News UK declined mid-teens versus the prior quarter but were relatively flat in local currency as cover price increases at the both the Sun and the Times were offset by single copy volume declines.","News UK also benefited this quarter from previously announced cost savings initiatives as well as lower production cost and remains focused on identifying further cost reduction. At News America Marketing, the business overall performed well with revenues relatively flat versus the prior year driven by mid-teens growth in domestic in-store revenues. Domestic FSI revenue was down mid-teens due to lower volume. At Checkout 51 we achieved over 9 million members adding approximately 3 million this quarter and well on place to achieve 10 million by the end of this calendar year which I would mention is a key initiative to accelerating the digital transition of News America Marketing.","Turning to the book publishing segment, revenue decreased 5% but segment EBITDA improved 14% versus the prior year which included the release of Go Set a Watchman that accounted for 32 million in revenues in the prior quarter. EBITDA margins improved by 12.3% from 10.3% in the prior year driven by the mix of titles. And this quarter benefited from a strong new release slate including Black Widow by Daniel Silva, Hill Billy by JD Vance of Sarah Young Jesus Always.","Total digital revenues were approximately 20% of consumers revenue similar to the prior year. In digital real estate services total segment revenues increased 35 million or 18%, 226 million, segment EBITDA was 67 million up from 57 million in the prior year. ARIA's revenues grew 22% or approximately 16% in local currency due to an increase in Australian residential debt revenue benefiting from favorable product mix combined with modest revenue contributions from my iProperty. Results were partially offset by softer listings in Australia declining approximately 8% versus the prior year.","ARIA's reported fiscal first quarter earnings today and just concluded the conference call which provided more quality delay. Move revenues rose 9% to $93 million versus the prior year reflecting continued strong performance Co-Broke after more than doubling the Q1 Fiscal '16 as well as growth in software services revenue albeit at a slower rate.","The Move team is focused on the next generation showcase product as we expect to roll out later this quarter and further penetration of recently launched new products including turbo and seller leads [ph], we therefore expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year and are on track to deliver increasingly positive contributions to the segue EBITDA this fiscal year.","Average monthly unique user growth at Realtor.com related strong up 15% year-over-year to 53 million in the quarter. In cable network programming revenues increased by 3% compared to the prior quarter primarily due to advertising growing midteens benefiting from higher ratings across the board as well as higher contributions from digital advertising.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $14 million which was $14 million lower than the prior year quarter here today as expected cost related to the similar cost of additional NRL matches from Channel Nine and the airing of the Sri Lanka Australia cricket partially offset by the absence of the EPL rights cost. We do expect EBITDA improve in Q2 due to the absence of the cost from the English Premier League and Rugby World Cup which we had in the prior year.","With respect to earnings from affiliates, Foxtel ended the quarter with more than 2.9 million total subscribers with cable and satellite subscribers increasing approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. Last month Foxtel announced that it had bought out Seven West media share in the Presto joint venture and the Presto service will be subsequently closed and Foxtel will shift its IP efforts to Foxtel Play.","Existing Presto customers will be invited to the move to the new Foxtel play and Presto seize operations on January 31, 2017. Foxtel recorded a $21 million loss as a result of the decision to seize Presto operations and our equity income was $11 million lower principally as a result of this.","Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 5% and they are up 1% in local currency, and EBITDA increased 2% but was down 2% in local currency due to higher programming costs and marketing. Sales as expected remained above prior year at 15.5% as we cycle through some historical no contracts offers. Importantly underlining year on year churn data when adjusting for the impact of new customer office has been more stable. ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 3% TO around AUD88. Capital expenditures from continuing operations for the quarter were $49 million lower than $63 million in the prior year and turning to the balance sheet net cash of September 30th was 1.1 billion including 377 million of debt related to iProperty. Cash on the balance sheet is down from fourth quarter 2016 principally reflecting the payout of the News America Marketing settlement of $250 million.","So in summary while the quarter faced some obvious challenges as we had noted we expect to see improvements for the remainder versus the year. A few points to highlight while print advertising remained very volatile and visibility continues to be limited we have stepped up our cost savings initiatives particularly at cost at Dow Jones and expect improved EBITDA performance in the current quarter and the balance of the year. We will also be including the contribution from wireless group within the news and information services segment from October 1st.","Book publishing should see favorable comparisons and we look forward to the release of Settle for More by Megyn Kelly, Chaos by Patricia Cornwell and the Magnolia Stories by Chip and Joanna Gaines as well as carry over sales of Jesus Always by Sarah Young with debuted last quarter.","We have a strong roaster of titles this year and expect to see a return to growth in digital which bodes well for the year ahead. Fox Sports Australia as I mentioned could benefit from lower rights cost in the second quarter and should see an improvement in EBITDA versus the prior year. For all the full year cost should be down modestly in local currency with no major [indiscernible] impacting this fiscal year. For digital real estate we expect continued revenue and EBITDA growth for the segment. While [indiscernible] volumes in Australia for the second quarter remained lower than the prior year we expect continued growth benefiting from favorable pricing and increased penetration. Realtor is expected to roll out showcase 2.0 later this quarter and the revenue lift is expected to be more second half weighted reflecting the timing of contract renewals. We expect to see strong improvement in EBITDA contributions from Realtor this year.","With that let me hand it over to operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].We will take our first question, this will be from Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","My question is around using information services and your speaking about digital advertising revenue offsetting some of the print declines, can you give us an idea of some of the quantum graph within digital ad revenues and also any background you could give us by jurisdiction as well as what sort of trends you\u2019re seeing within digital ad revenue growth would be appreciated. Thank you.","Robert Thomson","That\u2019s for the future itself, unfortunately I don't have [indiscernible] powers so it's difficult to define. At Dow Jones we are seeing some improvement in October but beyond that I don't have the confidence to give you a forecast just more broadly before we get into the granular details what we are seeing at the moment is some mayhem in the ad market. Avatar is having ads placed on sites we seen almost to have contempt for profit companies or they have their products bobbing around in buildings [ph] and that ad apostasy simply can't continue [indiscernible].","So at heart we\u2019re very confident about our quality content, our quality audiences and the quality campus we have for advertising. At News Australia we saw advertising down about a 11% excluding FX in the quarter. News UK advertising title was down mid-teens, Print was down high teens digital up low teens and Dow Jones advertising is down 21% but we have experienced double digit growth in the digital News UK and Australia where emphasizing the quality of [indiscernible] and our audiences and we\u2019re building out more segmented products for advertisers so that we will be able to target those quality audiences in a meaningful way and I think what we're talking about is a longer term strategy but one that should have results in the short term.","Operator","We will move along to Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes a question the Wall Street Journal just what's your thoughts on why the decline has accelerated in negative 21% at the print Wall Street Journal last quarter and what's your outlook there for the upcoming quarter.","Robert Thomson","I think there is a broader issue about advertising, generally there is definitely mayhem in the market, some advertising is driven more by trend than by substance and when you have that amount of volatility in a broader market you are going to have for certain [indiscernible] and certain quarters a fair amount of volatility and that that was certainly the of the general. Tech advertising was down to a degree, financial also. On the NWSA magazine we had a record issue in September. So it's not as if advertisers have abandoned print as a sector and print is a very powerful platform. It's is that there is a lot of content out there. Frankly a significant amount of that content is less meritorious and more meretricious.","Bedi Singh","The only thing I would add is that advertisers pretty much week by week and we are seeing those when we look at October but there are some temporary rate of decline that we saw in the first quarter and whether that continues for the rest of the quarter it's difficult to say but certainly the Wall Street Journal and in News Australia at News UK we\u2019re seeing some tampering of the declines so I think visibility is limited but at least we\u2019re seeing some improvement a little bit.","Operator","We will now move to Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Just one question, you\u2019ve had $500 million buyback program in place for a little while now and yet you\u2019ve bought back a freshen up that to-date just wondering how the board thinks about all this specially during times when the stock price is depressed?","Robert Thomson","Well we've a $500 million provision. We had bought back a modest amount of stuff but clearly when we think in terms of a couple of allocation it's a broad based strategy which includes internal investment and certainly includes returns to investors and we have also and modest dividend in place and -- but it has to be based on an understanding of the long term value of the company and that is what guides all of our decisions and the board's decision about the buying back of the stock. Thus far we've bought back $71 million but that will be any further moves will be in the context of that goal or strategy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will move to [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","I was hoping you could provide some color around free cash operations for the business, obviously there are $300 million for the quarter and what the expectations are going forward and how fast can we track EBITDA and what can we expect the round up conversation of free cash flow? Thank you.","Bedi Singh","So free cash flow obviously we reported negative for this quarter. As I mentioned its namely driven the fact that we had a payment to make for settling the News America Marketing which was $250 million, was accrued for the last year and now we paid it out this quarter. We also have slightly higher working capital this quarter some of it was due to the acquisitions of iProperty and obviously we have lower EBITDA. So all of those factors contributed to that. You shouldn't take the first quarter as being indicative of the rest of the year, we're very focused on generating healthy positive free cash flow and I would say mainly it's all timing things this quarter. So without giving a specific number though, I think we are striving to make sure still we are very healthy for the remainder of the year.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Peter. Operator, we'll take our next question.","Operator","At this time we have no questions in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Okay, we'll take a follow-up question from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, I'd be curious to hear what the margins were like at Move.com versus a year ago, how about the profits there?","Bedi Singh","We don't give out specific margin information. As your know Craig, we have started giving out obviously revenue information based on your last requests. I would say that margins are growing and if you exclude stock based compensation, EBITDA was higher when we've had the whole, and it's ramping -- it's ramping up, even I would say. And so we're not giving the specific number but they're on-track to be very meaningfully profitable for next quarter onwards.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Craig. Operator, are there any other questions?","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Thanks, gentlemen. Just one more on; in your other division I appreciate rather that you want to continue to canvas new businesses to in but the $180 million costs in the other divisions still seems quite substantial. Do you think there is any room to reduce that cost base?","Bedi Singh","We're continue to be striving to reduce the -- as you call the other, which is principally our sort of copper and other head costs and it's come down a lot since we started showing our results two to three years ago. So we've been constantly bringing that down and I think you'd expect to see some improvement on that as we go forward. And UK newspaper matter which was included in that obviously coming down as we've reported.","Robert Thomson","Operator, are there any other questions?","Operator","Yes, we'll take a follow-up from Entcho Raykovski from Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi, just a follow-up from around the new agreement; we'd like to be -- would you mention that Foxtel has entered into -- could you give us any more indication of the terms of that agreement and that sort of uplifting costs which results in and if -- I mean if it was a significant -- I appreciate you might not give us the exact numbers but has significant that uplift [ph]?","Robert Thomson","I'm sure your instinct is correct, we're not going to give you the exact numbers. But look, I think the key word at Foxtel is high [ph]. The rights you're talking about are exclusive to subscription TV. As you know we have taken the decision to close down Presto, frankly, we thought that was a distraction from the core brand and core proposition which has by far the best way to programs in Australia as I'm sure you will know from your personal experience.","Operator","Okay, we have one more question in the queue, it's from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","Hi, good afternoon. So you mentioned looking through the balance of the year, several segments talking about improvements, particularly in EBITDA, I was also wondering if you can give a little bit more color on that because it sounds overall that you expect improvements but I don't know if that means for instance some news, EBITDA would be higher or growth rates would be better? Any particular quarters or back half of the year that you point out in any particular segment.","Robert Thomson","I'll start and then Bedi will no doubt compliment my comments but -- individual real estate as Bedi has indicated, we expect a momentum as the year unfolds with new products and new pricing; and it will be strongly EBITDA positive, that is a certainly a growing business. At Harper Collins you need only to look at the best seller list at the moment to get a sense of the impact about the titles and we are very pleased with the focus on books like the Magnolia Story, like Sally. And no doubt like Megan Kelly's sort of a more; there will have been broad impact on society and a positive impact on our accounts. And we think Fox News as we get into the Spring selling season in Australia for sports given the record audiences of last year, and the buzz around by its Rugby League and Aussie Rules next year; that will be efficacious also.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Eric. Well, thank you all for participating. Have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Once again, this does conclude today's quick conference call.

And welcome to the News Corp Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. Media is allowed to join today's conference in a listen-only basis. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Matt. Hello everyone and welcome to News Corp's fiscal third quarter 2017 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today, are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive, and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer.","We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy, actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson, for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, we saw positive results in our ongoing mission to become increasingly global, digital and diversified to be resolutely cost conscious and to deliver enhanced results for our shareholders.","There was robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, specifically a 5% rise in revenues to approximately $2 billion and total segment EBITDA of $215 million compared to a loss of a $122 million in the prior year, which included the News America Marketing settlement charge. Excluding that charge, total segment EBITDA in the quarter would have increased 36% compared to the prior year.","We are pleased with the performance of many of our businesses, including at our digital real estate services segment, which continues to fly. We had indicated that the EBITDA contribution at Move would improve and that revenue growth would accelerate and I am pleased to report both goals have been achieved this quarter, though we will certainly not allow our compliance field smugness to be characteristics at realtor.com.","While print advertising remains challenging, we saw some moderation and declines across mastheads this quarter. And notably the news and information services segment was a sort of growth this quarter, both in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the muscular performance of installed product revenues in News America Marketing, healthy circulation revenue gains at the Wall Street Journal and a thoughtful cost production program.","Speaking of the Wall Street Journal, we continue to build on the momentum of digital styles, adding more than 300,000 subscribers year-over-year. Digital now accounts for 53% of total subscription, up from 44% last year and 38% two years ago. In fact we added even more subs this quarter than in the second quarter, suggesting that the appetite for premium news and thoughtful commentary is undiminished.","This success also as a result of innovation with our payroll including the elimination of Google so called First Quick Free Scheme [ph], which is in need of serious scrutiny as it punishes premium news. But whiners are not winners, so I am pleased to report, we are making progress on our development of a new digital advertising platform, focused initially on the U.S. market using the data, content and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real rich and are not subject to guilt by association.","This initiative follows our news connect offering in Australia and we will provide more information about the emerging platform in coming months.","We have been among the strongest and most consistent voices in making clear that the digital duopoly has commoditized content and had created an ecosystem that is dysfunctional and defiled. The consequences of commodification include fake news, ramping piracy and brands just oppose we joined us on extremist websites. The current content configuration is detrimental to consumers, the businesses and to societies.","We are in discussion with Facebook and Google about premium content and brand enhancing environment and hope that will assist in fashioning a healthier eco system that rewards created in content and not just the distributors, the parts and the perfidious. At this stage, it is fair to say, that Facebook is more responsive and responsible. That we will highlight these issues until there is meaningful movement.","Let us turn to our businesses in more detail. At Move, home to realtor.com reported revenues increased by 15% in the quarter, accelerating from fiscal Q2 levels. Excluding the $4 million from TigerLead which we sold in November, growth was 20% and the company contributed segment EBITDA growth consistent with our expectations.","Average monthly unique increased from $44 million in Q2 to $55 million for the quarter, including a monthly record of $58 million in March. And we saw improvements in pace penetration and audience engagement, both crucial for Lead volume which also improved in the quarter.","Overall according to CUNY School in March realtor.com led by Zillow and Trulia an engagement by 30% based on minutes spend and has continue to gain share in this sector. The new advantage product launched in December is performing in line with expectations and we saw acceleration in growth in the connections for buyer's product, driven by higher lead volume and increased customer flow.","We continue to fortify realtor.com, with products like Sciencenab, Streetpeak and enhanced 3D listings which will move from better to full release in the coming months. We added photography in local data to off market listings, which helps driving engagement and we focused on the speed and reliability of our products to ensure an optimum experience for users.","Looking ahead, Move is expecting to make further developments in the software and services business an essential element of that crucial relationship with the community of Realtors, less central to real estate transactions. REA, which completed the sale with European businesses in December 2016, posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business, driven by product mix and the adoption of premium product. REA achieved record business in March and materially outperformed the competition.","The company provides a deeper content experience complementing our masters in Australia and has strengthened its premium product offerings, launching front page, allowing Windows to showcase properties on the home page based on a user's previous search behavior. At News and Information services, revenues grew almost 3% and segment EBITDA excluding the settlement charge at News America marketing in the prior year would have expanded more than 30%.","As mentioned the decline in print advertising moderated while we implemented cost reduction programs such as the Wall Street Journal 2020 initiative, which is designed to reduce expenses plus imperatively drives a contemporary flow of content for readers and clients. We are clearly cost conscious but intend to bolster the quality of our unique content across our mastheads and the cross platforms around the world.","At Dow Jones, ad revenue trends improved relative to prior quarter, meanwhile the risk in compliance business remains particularly healthy with revenue growth over 20% and prospect certainly appearing positive the real and compliance is essential. As mentioned there was robust digital subscriber growth at the Journal, with more than 30% increase versus the prior year and the momentum has continued. In fact, not only did we have the 300,000 year-over-year increase plus this also set a record in digital subscriber growth since the launch of our sales and subscriber reporting metric.","Overall circulation revenues expanded at a mid-single-digit rate. The New York Post digital network continues to make headway and digital now accounts for more than 50% of its ad revenues. We are also pleased to report last month the [Indiscernible] TV has been adopted in a 185 markets covering 90% of the country in advance of its launch this fall. That fall is well for the program and the brand.","In the UK at the time standard print circulation volumes grew high single-digits and market share improved once again. In digital the Times and the Sunday Times continue to grow subs and ARPU while in print, the Times had the largest year-on-year growth among pay for national papers in the quarter. At the Sun, the number of monthly unique visitor's version reaching 80 million globally in March, doubling over the past year and up 5 folds since the pay rule we removed in late 2015.","The Sun has already surpassed the mirror as the second most reviewed website in the UK and is working closely with talkSPORT to drive incremental traffic and revenues. Times for the UK economy remain positive despite the fee among during the ahead of the Brexit vote and regardless of the inevitable uncertainty caused by the upcoming election.","Conditions from our mastheads in Australia remain challenging although print ad declines moderated and circulation revenues were relatively stable. Thanks to a lift in digital subscribers and the price increases. Our team in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, which general 27% growth year-over-year, including ARM to more than 330,000. Meanwhile news.com today retained its ranking as a preeminent news site in Australia.","News American market saw marked growth in the in-store business which is benefiting from product enhancements and an increase in new CPG campaigns. The goods companies and the retail as they are increasingly recognizing NAMs, prowess at the point of purchase.","Checkout 51 also grew in the quarter and now has $13.4 million U.S. and Canadian members more than double the total of last year. It is become a key part of NAMs integrated digital offering. In fact, Checkout 51 along with Storyful and realtor.com are working closely with NAM on joint sales pitches with major brands to better leverage data and drive incremental revenue.","The News and Information Services segment also benefited from the acquisition of Wireless Group in UK and the Australian regional media business both of which contributed revenues in the quarter. Storyful and Unruly continue to expand their collaboration and are working more closely than ever with many of our businesses. Storyful recently announce the new partnership with Weber Shandwick, illustrating how it has expanded its work. There were six companies, the concerns are the brand safety and furnish vital intelligence on issues related to risk and compliance.","In book publishing, there was solid revenue growth at HarperCollins, which saw improvement in digital and enduring success of Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden Figures. We also had the release of Veronica Roth's Carve the Mark. We are looking forward with much anticipation the release of new books by Michael Curtin [ph] and David Williams in May and note the continuing strength of HarperCollins Christian based industrial.","We are confident that the international footprint we acquire through Harlequin combined with our Evangelical expertise should lead to increase business in Latin America where the Evangelical movement is particularly influential.","At Fox Sports, advertising remain strong compared to a relatively substitute TV marketplace in Australia. Riding a 6% higher in March of the year, thanks impart that the successful launch of the Fox League channel, it's dedicated Rugby League offering.","Fox Sports also launched the first overseas over the top partnership with IFO, the people around the world can watch the world's most captivating context sports. At our 50% earned Foxtel, the company continues to invest in top tier sports and local content.","Further differentiating it's unique package from lower quality of players, Foxtel Play, will have an upgraded user interface and additional HD options, as Foxtel seeks to provide a compelling offering for customers.","Having acquired the popular Sky News, we have added to our portfolio of cable networks in Australia and we'll be able to consolidated cost and share digital and video learning's across our platforms. We have just announced the transfer of Fox Sports News to Sky News which will allow us to maximize synergies and scale.","Looking once again at the quarters a whole, we see the enduring value of that content. The power of our platform, the benefits of [indiscernible] cost of strange and the manifold ways our businesses are combining and complementing each other and crucially driving long-term value for all of our investors.","Governmentally, we were pleased to announce the addition of former U.S. senator, Kelly Ayotte to our board. Following the departure of Elaine Chao, who became the U.S. secretary of transportation, in the new administration. We wish her well in her profound the important role. And I was finally like to say a word of thanks to the new CFO first CFO, the vulnerable Bedi Singh. He did much to assist in launching the company and I'm very proud and delighted to introduce our new CFO Susan Panuccio, a long-time colleague at news school.","Susan brings to this important task a savvy strategic sensibility and a rigorous attention to both detail and the larger landscape. She has experience in both the UK and Australia, as well as insight in the importance of digital transformation of the news and property businesses.","For these reasons and more I have great confidence not on in her but in the prospects for this business and its value for our shareholders. Thank you for your support and so please welcome Susan.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you for those kind words Robert. I am delighted to be here today and looking forward to getting to know all of you in the very near future. This is the unique time for the company, as we continue the transformation to a digital first company and I am really excited to have taken a broader role across the company.","While I am very new to this role, there are few observations, I would like to make. We are a company that has global scale, customers and data sets, that can be better monetize. As Robert mentioned, one need an initiative would be the launch of our global digital advertising platform in the coming months. But there is a lot more we can do including more effectively sharing the resources standardizing subscription strategies and better leveraging our content across the markets in the US, the UK and Australia.","There is more we can do and are doing on cost. While we need to make sure, we continue to invest in digital initiatives, I also think there is plenty of room to improve efficiencies and remove legacy cost across the business and much of that is underway.","Revenues from our printed news market is remains a very important source of revenues. However, we do need to be focused on driving incremental and higher margin revenue streams ranging from custom content to higher margin brand extension such as Sunbits [ph] in the UK. And finally I will be open to new ideas and new ways, that will drive higher growth and value per share in the long-term.","With that of an introduction, I'll now turn to the operating results for this quarter. We reported fiscal 2017 third quarter total revenues of around $2 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year. Currency had a $21 million negative impact on revenues with modest year-over-year improvement in the Australian dollar, outlaid by weakness in the pound.","Reported total segment EBITDA was $215 million compared to a loss of $122 million in the prior year which included a one-time settlement charge of $280 million at News America marketing, excluding the charge in the prior year segment EBITDA would have risen 36%.","For the quarter, loss per share from continuing operations was $0.01 versus the loss of $0.26 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.07 versus $0.04 in the prior year.","Tuning now to the individual operating segments; in News and Information Services revenues for the quarter rose 3% to approximately $1.3 billion versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising rose around 4% or 5% in local currency, driven by News America marketing and contributions from acquisitions partially offset by print advertising decline, although the rate of advertising decline moderated this quarter across all territories.","Circulation and subscription revenues decreased 1%, yet rose 3% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of Australia Regional Media or ARM, cost increases in higher pay digital volume offset by lower print volumes.","News and information services segment EBITDA this quarter was $123 million up from $93 million in the prior period, excluding the $280 million News American marketing settlement last year. We saw strong EBITDA contribution at News American marketing, led by in-store product and modest year-over-year improvements at Dow Jones and UK, offset by declines in the Australian business.","We also had an adjustment to the deferred consideration for Unruly, which positively impacted EBITDA by around $12 million this quarter.","Looking at performance across our key units, at News American marketing, the business continues to perform well, with revenues up 13% versus the prior year driven by the strength of in-store products which more than offset declines in freestanding in-store products. Some of the growth was timing related, but we continue to see strong growth due to the increased number of retailers and higher brand spending.","To give you a sense of the timing related difference, we estimate that approximately $15 million less than half of News America revenue growth this quarter was timing related, which will unwind in fiscal Q4.","Checkout 51 continues to expand, now reaching over 13 million members at quarter end and continues to increase visibility and gain traction with our CPG clients.","At Dow Jones, total advertising revenues declined around 12% due to print advertising, which was a marked improvement from the fiscal Q2 performance which still advertising down over 20%. Pleasingly the mix of advertising is changing, in fact, fiscal Q3 approximately 15% of total advertising at Dow Jones is what I would call emerging or non-traditional advertising revenue. This includes custom content conferences and of course programmatic advertising and these will remain a big focus going forward.","As Robert mentioned, we are continuing to see strong paid volume growth in digital at the Wall Street Journal, while total subscriber volumes across all formats reached $2.2 million, a 12% year-over-year increase, driven by higher digital only sales which rose over 30% versus the prior year.","Circulation revenues at Dow Jones grew mid-single digits due to both volume gains and higher subscription pricing, led by the Wall Street Journal, which grew high-single digit. Professional information business revenues remained relatively stable with the prior year, similar to last quarter, as we continue to see very strong growth in risk and compliance together with a strong pipeline for new business.","At News Australia, advertising revenues rose $8 million or 5% and were down 1% in local currency. The Increase in advertising revenues was driven by the acquisition of ARM which contributed $20 million in the quarter. Advertising revenues at our other Australian markets remained challenged, but showed a sequential improvement hardly due to the moderation in the real estate and employment categories, particularly at the local advertising level.","Circulation revenues at News Australia increased $7 million or 8% and were up slightly in local currency, primarily due to the acquisition of ARM which contributed $6 million. Cover price increases including one take into the weekday Australia in February and higher paid digital subscriptions largely offset bring volume declines at our existing markets of around 7%.","On cost initiative within the Australian business, we are on track for an additional $40 million Australian dollars in cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2017 and continue to seek additional cost reduction. Although some of the that saving is being reinvested to accelerate our digital transition given that the Australian business has the highest proportion of print advertising across our markets as a percentage of overall revenue.","At News UK, while reported advertising revenues decreased by 18%. In local currency was close to a high single digit decline, also a modest sequential improvement from the low teen last quarter. Reported circulation revenues at News UK saw 10% versus the prior year quarter, but rose 4% in local currency as cover price increases more than offset single copy volume declines at Sun.","Wireless Group revenue was flat as growth in Fox Sports was offset by the absence of revenues from sport magazine which was closed in February 2017. We continue to make good progress on the integration of wireless into the News UK Group.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment, revenues was $374 million up 4% compared to the prior year. We saw strong contribution this quarter from titles including Hillbilly Elegy and Hidden figures. Revenues also benefit from the release in January of Veronica Roth's Carve the Mark, however sales with this title were off to a slow start than anticipated.","Segment EBITDA rose 3%, $37 million, as a revenue growth was offset by an unfavorable cost to sales in this quarter. Title digital revenues which include audio books, were approximately 22% of consumer revenues, if digital fails rising modestly over the prior year quarter, driven principally by audio books.","In digital real estate services, reported revenues for the segment increased $25 million or 13% just $219 million and adjusted revenues increased 15%, which excludes the impact from the divestitures of REAs European real estate portal and Move sale of TigerLead last quarter, as well as currency impact on acquisition.","Reported segment EBITDA was $75 million up $36 million or 92% versus the prior year, benefiting from strong contribution at both Move and REA, including lower legal cost of Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA growing 68%.","REAs revenues grew 10% due to an increase in Australian residential depth revenue resulting from favorable product mix and higher prices and a $6 million impact from favorable foreign currency fluctuation. The growth was partially offset by a $9 million or 9% decline in revenue resulting from the divestiture of the European business.","It's important to note, that the REA Group report results the present year of this discontinued operations that you will see a bigger variance this quarter between our reported revenue growth than in the past. Please refer to REAs earnings release for more detail on this.","As expected, REA results showed strong growth in EBITDA contributions, strong operation margins in its all Australian business. Move revenues rose approximately 15% to $100 million versus the prior year, reflecting continued strong performance from connection for buyers and higher non-listing media revenue.","TigerLead which was divested in November contributed $4 million in the prior period. Average monthly unique user growth at realtor.com remains strong, up high single digit year-over-year to $55 million in the quarter, with $58 million in March.","In Cable network programming, revenues rose 14% to $122 million compared to the prior year quarter, from the inclusion of $9 million related to the acquisition of Sky News and favorable foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenue growth was 1%.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was flat at $34 million and up modestly on an adjusted basis. With respect to earnings from affiliates, equity income was negative $23 million this quarter compared to positive $2 million last year. Our equity loss pickup this quarter included a $7 million negative impact related to a change in the fair value of Foxtel investment in the Ten Network and a fair to $10 million loss related to Foxtel's Presto wind down consistent with our expectation. Both numbers reflect our 50% share.","Regarding its operating performance, Foxtel ended the quarter with 2.8 million total subscribers with closing cable and satellite subscribers down 1% compared to the prior year, but saw small subscriber gains from the prior quarter.","In the third quarter cable and satellite churn was 16.1% compared to 14.3% in the prior year, an encouragingly showed improvement late in the quarter with the beginning of winter sports and the launch of the Foxtel channel.","Foxtel revenues for the quarter increased 2% to $591 million but were down 3% in local currency and EBITDA decreased 9% to a $131 million and was down 13% in local currency due to the decrease in revenue and increases in programming cost principally in sports. Cable satellite ARPU for the quarter was down approximately 2% to around AUD 86.","And finally for Q3, capital expenditures from continuing operations year-to-date were $168 million, lower than the $180 million in the prior year.","I would like to now turn to the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter. You may recall that the prior year included the 53rd week, which contributed a $112 million in revenues last year. In addition we also recognized a gain of a $122 million related to the NAM Group settlement.","As for those items, I have a few more observation. In the News and Information services segment, overall advertising trends at this point are relatively similar with the fiscal third quarter for our key market. As I noted News American marketing had a timing benefit this quarter which will reverse in Q4 of around $15 million and we will also be lapping a price increase at the Sun, Monday to Friday in the prior year.","In Digital Real Estate services, we expect to see improved revenues and continue strong EBITDA contribution at realtor.com. REAs expect phasing of cost to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the year ago in the third quarter, due to increased investment in product innovation in associated marketing expenses. REA will discuss to see more detail during the quarterly conference call, shortly after ours.","At book publishing, the environment remains relatively healthy in the fourth quarter however we will have fewer front list titles from the prior year. Notable releases for Q4 will include Dragon Teeth from Michael Crichton and David Williams, World's Worst Children 2 to [indiscernible].","In summary, the quarter demonstrated a few scene, we are a company that is evolving with a unique mix of assets so this continuing our push towards digital.","Digital real estate continues to expand, Move's contribution to EBITDA is now solidly positive as we had anticipated and the segment is helping to reshape News Corp's long term growth trajectory. We are taking action to stabilize the News and Information services segment, we're still facing an uncertain print market and we must be diligent on cost and accelerate digital as quickly and impressively as we can.","With that let me hand over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It's time we'll move to Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Entcho Raykovski","Hi Robert, hi Susan. My question is around News and Information services and in particular where there any synergies that's being generated from the recent acquisitions of ARM and Wireless. Any particular, if I look at the News Australia operations that the cost reduction target of $40 million that you have in place at the moment. Does that take into account the benefits of the combination with ARM or do you think these say the cost benefit to come?","Susan Panuccio","Just in relation to News Australia and the ARM acquisition, so I think what we'll find in the current year is that we will have integration cost largely offsetting any synergies that we will get, but we are expecting to see benefits coming through in this next financial year. So they are not included in the $40 million target that they are closing. So we are on track to deliver that $40 million target for this financial year.","In relation to Wireless I'll now hand it over to Robert to talk about that integration.","Robert Thomson","Yeah thanks very much Susan. Entcho I think what we are seeing, is what we hope to see which is a real complementarity in the offering of the two. You've seen talkSPORT drive way to the Sun and the Sun drive business to talkSPORT. We're also seeing portfolio at pitches with the Wireless Group, the Sun, Storyful, Unruly, generating new business and obviously it's the early stage of the new partnership in UK.","But Rebekah Brooks and the team are doing an excellent job in ensuring that the teams are talking to each other, working with each other and generating returns to shareholders.","Michael Florin","Thanks Entcho. Matt, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to John Janedis with Jeffries.","John Janedis","Thank you. Rob, there is been a lot of discussion, as you know in the industry about the new cycle and the impact circulation. But based on what you are seeing at the Journal. How do you think about the medium term this type of opportunity, and can you talk about to what extent there is a some sort of positive cross platform advertising benefit?","Robert Thomson","John, we are standing in the middle of an interesting cycle, there is no doubt, a premium unpremium news and we are seeing that in the continuing growth in paid digital subs, the Wall Street Journal up 34% year-on-year.","And for us there is an added benefit, which is we obviously see those news subscribers as a potential pool of our customers for an upsell to even more premium products, whether it be through to a high network individuals, semi-professional fund managers or those who are specialist like yourself in finance take commodities FX, whatever.","So for us there is a double benefit, we are introducing a new generation of readers into the highest quality paid content and we are able to than bring them further into due diligence hold with our traditional professional information business products.","Michael Florin","Thanks John. Matt, we will take our next question please.","Operator","We will now move to Kyle Baker with Guggenheim Securities.","Kyle Baker","Great, thanks for the question guys. I believe in her prepared remarks, Susan you said that the 53rd week will be a $112 million revenue impact, is there any way you guys can quantify the EBITDA impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal fourth quarter, as well as any color by segment if you have it? Thank you.","Susan Panuccio","So I think we in previous calls we have obviously quoted the $112 million revenue number, but we don't talk about what the EBITDA impact is. I think that this way for you to look at that is to apply the normalized year-to-date margins and that would be view a good proxy to the EBITDA impact.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Matt, we will take our next question please.","Operator","And the next question will be from Brian Han, with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Good morning. Can you please talk about the $10 million increase in EBITDA loss in the other division and is that an area that we should be focused on to see the progress of your cost drive across the group?","Susan Panuccio","So the other division include, corporate cost now headquarter cost and our strategy team, but it also includes a severance amount this quarter as well which is what you are seeing and why you are seeing the increase coming through.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Matt we will take our next question please.","Operator","And that will be from Craig Huber, with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, thank you. Just curious, any updated thoughts expectations here about the billion 85 of cash, it sits on the balance sheet here, I mean this there is a huge amount of cash on balance sheet for roughly four years its only changes here, is the mindset change it all here to potentially to buyback any stock or what's the game planning here, as I get this a question a lot from investors?","Robert Thomson","Thanks Craig and thanks for passing on the question Craig. It's a very silent one, it's a situation we constantly has under review as you know, we have a semi-annual dividend in place, the big buybacks up to around $71 million of provision for buybacks of $500 million. But we've divided, look really into three areas, opportunistic acquisitions, internal investment and capital. And if you look at the three main investments we have made which is realtor.com via Move, Harlequin and Wireless Group, you would have to agree that they played a crucial role in transforming our business.","There is no doubt that if you noted out the $600 million we invested in Realtor has fundamentally transform the company and as you can see given the increasing growth in both revenue and EBITDA that I will say digital businesses in general and the ability that Harlequin has given HarperCollins, to move from one language to 17 languages is quite profound and that has also increased our digital footprint. And you can see the early signs in UK of the value of the Wireless Group. So we will continue to be opportunistic that we will continue to have the situation under review.","Susan Panuccio","And Craig I think just to add Roberts thought from those matters, that I think just to reiterate my point that I made at the start of my statements. We will continue to look at opportunities that drive higher growth and value per share in the long term and we will look at everything.","Michael Florin","Thank you Craig. Matt we will take our next question","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll now move to Raymond Tong with Evans and Partners.","Raymond Tong","Good morning Robert and Susan. Just the question on Move and can you maybe talk a bit in more detail in the acceleration of the revenue growth at Move, sort of talked about some of the new products there and also a sense of just the EBITDA growth contributions from Move during the quarter please?","Robert Thomson","Ray the contribution to EBITDA growth was $22 million for the quarter, where we continue to expect EBITDA growth and revenue growth in Q4 without giving a detailed forecast. What we're seeing is that the traditional products like Co-Broke, which is up 34% year-on-year doing well, the newer products are also taking off, as well as our experience in advertising and in traditional media is enabling us to get better quality yields at Move. So there was a 33% growth in non-listing media revenues.","So all-in-all that ability that we have to learn from our experience at REA, our ability to generate audience through marketed platforms, which gives us a marketing edge and our ability to create a site, that's not just a listing side for Realtor's and vendors but also a site that is holistic real estate experience with more news, more analysis than any other means that we certainly have a comparative advantage going forward.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Matt we will take our next question please?","Operator","This will be a follow-up from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes hi. I was just curious, in the newspaper division, if you exclude the acquisitions and adjust for currency, how much was the cost down year-over-year please?","Susan Panuccio","Excluding the acquisitions, we think the cost were down probably low-single digits, predominantly being driven by Dow Jones. So they've seen a good decreasing cost quarter-on-quarter year-on-year around 4%. We are also seeing some cost decreases coming through in relation to some of the other divisions within that segment, but it's predominantly being driven by the Wall Street Journal.","Craig Huber","Sorry is that also adjusting for currency as well the down low-single?","Susan Panuccio","Yes correct.","Craig Huber","And also, if I could ask\u2026","Michael Florin","Matt we'll take our next question please?","Operator","We'll move on to Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Thanks. Just one follow-up question, you guys mentioned before about opportunistic acquisitions, are there any such opportunities in Australia, if the recently announced media reform package gets passed?","Robert Thomson","We don't speculate on speculation. All I would say on the subject of media reform, is that really we do need comprehensive holistic wholesale media reform in Australia. We have a set of loads that are more for the Goldenberg [ph] era than the Zuckerberg era and as long as there is wholesale reform, we'll be supported by them.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Matt we will take our next question please?","Operator","It will be from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz","Thank you. Just touching on the digital sales and the news rental services, you've clearly gained a lot from newspapers over the last couple of quarters, and I'm wondering how that's impacting your advertising particularly CPMs inventory, just the what kind of momentum are you seeing? Thank you.","Robert Thomson","I think, it's a very good question and it's one that was spending a lot of time and energy across our market looking at our ability to increase yields as we identify reader demographics and that's obviously at the very heart of the new advertising platform that we're building here in the US.","We know that across the U.S. monthly we on our sites including Realtor, we have around 220 million visitors combined with our newspaper mastered audiences that is a valuable source of audience for advertisers and we're doing our very best to monetize it in a way that make sense to advertisers, increasingly find themselves on third-party networks unable to be sure the company that they're keeping.","Susan Panuccio","I think I'd also add that we are seeing good digital growth across some markets, so we are seeing growth across News Australia, News UK on a year-to-date basis for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. And also pleasingly we're seeing ARPU growing. So I think that equally is important on the circulation side as what is on the advertising side.","Michael Florin","Thank you. Matt we will take our next question?","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue, so I'll turn it back over to you Mr. Florin for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Great thanks Matt. Thank you for all participating today. Have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","And again that does conclude today's conference call.

Thomson","Thank you, Mike. We are nearing our first birthday as the new News, and young though we are, the group companies have made significant progress on the strategy outlined to you at the Investor Day, ahead of the company's launch. We surely have much toil ahead but are patiently building a robust platform for the company and for the future. Our guidance then was that the 2 profound trends of our time, with globalization and digitization, and that we would pursue them with purpose and passion. In the past month alone, we launched a series of initiatives to realize that stated ambition.","We announced our intention to acquire Harlequin Enterprises, which will give HarperCollins and the broader company vastly expanded digital and global reach. While 99% of HarperCollins books are published in English, Harlequin books are published in 34 languages, and 40% of its revenues come from books published in languages other than English. That expertise will be crucial as we build our book business but also essential as we seek to create a network effect for complementary content sites globally.","Storyful, a social news agency and first acquisition, struck a landmark agreement to power Facebook's new Newswire, providing eloquent evidence of its ability to identify valuable content amidst the sea of material on the web, sifting the meritorious from the mediocre and the factual from the faux. Within News Corp, we envisage that through Storyful, we can create video verticals around content communities, ranging from science fiction fans at HarperCollins to soccer fans in London.","BallBall, our fledgling East Asian soccer platform, which has exclusive mobile and digital rights to European league video highlights, announced a partnership with Vietnam's leading private media company while expanding exponentially its audience there and in Japan and Indonesia, hitting a record 1.4 million unique visitors in the month of April alone, solely from social and viral marketing. That gives you a snapshot of some of the activity within the company, which is building on its proud heritage of brands and businesses and launching ventures that extend our expertise in the world's fastest-growing regions.","It is certainly true that macroeconomic growth is uneven in our core established markets, with the U.K. on the road to recovery, Australia somewhat volatile, with much attention now being paid to long-term public sector deficits, and the U.S. growing again after a frosty first couple of months but expanding at a pace less than the ideal rate.","For News Corp, for the quarter just finished, and excluding currency volatility and adjustments for other items, our revenues were relatively flat, while our profitability and free cash flow both expanded. Specifically, our third quarter earnings showed total segment EBITDA of $175 million, a 4% increase over the prior year, and free cash flow available to News Corp for the first 9 months was $496 million, a $362 million improvement over the preceding year. These favorable results come despite obvious challenges at a couple of our companies and an advertising market that remains unpredictable. Clearly one direct consequence of the Harlequin acquisition will be to reduce our dependence on advertising and create a steadier revenue stream for our content.","Our Australian newspapers are challenged, having again seen a decline in advertising, but they did pass a landmark of 200,000 digital subscribers in the past week. The digital strategy in Australia has been recast in recent months. Indeed, many of our websites were relaunched last week. Our aim is to strengthen ties with local communities and develop far closer relations with local advertisers. Julian Clarke and his able team in Australia are fully cognizant of the scope of the challenge and are working ceaselessly to turn around the trend lines.","Meanwhile, at Dow Jones, where we had obvious difficulties with our business-to-business offering, the team has started to stabilize the institutional revenue and refined our product and pitch. Their exertions have already begun to take effect. While this is an investor call, you should also regard it as something of a sales call because many of you are in the target audience for the new offerings.","Today, we announced Will Lewis' promotion from interim to permanent Chief Executive of Dow Jones, in recognition of the focus and the energy he's brought to the task. We still have much labor ahead, but Will is confident in the quality of the Dow Jones team and the potential of The Wall Street Journal and our other premium products, including our risk and compliance offerings.","Our overall results indicate that while many of our companies are complementary, there is enough diversity in the portfolio for us to counter softness in 1 sector, with growth elsewhere. For example, among the highlights of the third quarter, which Bedi will illuminate at more length shortly, was HarperCollins, which had another buoyant quarter, with revenues up 14% and e-book sales 46% higher. The Divergent series, which has sold over 17 million units worldwide to date, was and is an important contributor to that success. They're not the only star in the HarperCollins firmament. There is no doubt that Book Publishing is transitioning successfully to digital, and we are confident that the extra scale, which will come from the Harlequin acquisition, will be a benefit to the company and to investors.","But Harlequin is more than just a publishing asset, as it will provide us with infrastructure in 11 countries and a subtle understanding of the culture in many others. We will be able to leverage this network, whether it be the translation assets, the distribution platform or the cultural intelligence in a manner that will benefit much of the group. There is an opportunity to use the library in developing digital subscription products for our papers in the U.K. and Australia. It does not take much imagination to see how a subscriber could indicate an interest in a particular genre, allowing us to offer titles as part of a membership package but also suggesting further titles to increase sales at HarperCollins.","There is no doubt that we must construct our own distribution platforms. One of the more damaging trends for content creators has been the increasing share taken by third-party distributors who have no interest in the act of or the cost of creation. Apart from these tangible long-term benefits, we expect Harlequin will be accretive to earnings and improve our cherished free cash flow.","One other area where we have experienced significant growth in the quarter was REA, the Australian Digital Real Estate business in which we have a 61.6% stake. Revenues were 19% higher in the quarter, and EBITDA rose 29%. In local currency, those figures were much higher and have been accelerated. REA also has the leading site in Italy, casa.it. And it is obvious from the collective purpose in this company, which I visited recently, that the REA template can be exported, but we need to be careful and committed in our execution.","Meanwhile, at News America Marketing, we saw particularly welcome growth in in-store advertising. While some companies are focused on the point-of-sale, we are benefiting from our strength at the point-of-purchase and are mutually beneficial relationships with manufacturers and retailers. Advertising is uneven elsewhere in our business, but a physical presence is meaningful even in the digital age.","The softness in the Australian advertising market had an impact on revenues at FOX SPORTS, but overall, our top line performance was solid and profitability strong in local currency. Foxtel, in which we have a 50% stake and which acts as a funnel for FOX SPORTS, saw operating income increase in the 3 months. More generally, on advertising, without consulting a soothsayer and personally lacking in prescience, we are cautiously optimistic, but Australia clearly remains a challenge. Our Australian teams are about to embark on a fresh campaign to show the value of our platforms, including the potency of print to advertisers. In a world, the e-ephemeral [ph], the affinity and intensity that comes from a trusted brand and a deep reader relationship are currently undervalued assets. That reader relationship affords us pricing power, and so over the course of the year, we have raised prices at many of our mastheads in Australia and at The Times and the weekend editions of The Sun in the U.K. and The Wall Street Journal. In constant currency, our circulation revenue rose in the U.K., Australia and the U.S. We are continuing to refine our newspaper apps with, for example, enhancements made to the Australian newspaper app, leading to an increase in average time spent from 4 minutes to more than 13 minutes, and we are working to increase that engagement.","At Amplify, we're excited by the launch of our new middle school digital English Language Arts curriculum. By later this year, we expect to be able to talk about our implementation efforts at schools that will be using our curriculum. We have known from the beginning that moving from the old way of doing things to a new, more rigorous and engaging way cannot be done overnight. So we have 2 main goals for next year: start with a limited number of users and allow our results to help us stand apart from the competition.","Amplify represents a truly contemporary approach to education, empowering teachers and parents and providing students with compelling lessons. The curriculum is common core compliant and more broadly designed for this generation and the next. We firmly believe and expect that the efficacy of our curriculum will help facilitate fundamental improvement in student outcomes and, in turn, drive market penetration.","Finally, one consistent theme throughout the company over the quarter, a theme evident in the results, is cost discipline. Whether it be at head office, in London or in Australia, our teams have been cost-conscious, a quality reflected in a 7% reduction in operating expenses in the third quarter, which itself played a significant role in the stark improvement in our EBITDA. The other abiding theme is that our distinctive portfolio of companies has given us a robustness that distinguishes us from other traditional media companies. Our early e-expansion projects have clearly shown promise, and we will be building on that progress in the coming quarters, rolling out new products and incubating new businesses, building our customer base and serving our investors around the world. The journey is just beginning.","Now, I hand you over to Bedi, our CFO, for the financial exegesis.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Thanks, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I'll give you some high-level financial highlights, and then we will discuss each segment in further detail.","We reported fiscal 2014 third quarter total revenues of $2.1 billion, a 5% decrease versus the prior year period. However, if you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted revenues were flat with the prior year, and as Mike Florin mentioned, the earnings release includes the reconciliation to reflect these adjustments.","Turning to EBITDA. We reported total segment EBITDA of $175 million, which was a 4% increase versus the prior year period. Again, excluding all acquisitions and divestitures, the costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, which were $20 million net of indemnification this quarter, and foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted total segment EBITDA improved by 3%. Adjusted EPS were $0.11 compared to $0.13 in the prior year, and reported EPS were $0.08 versus $0.56 in the prior period, which included a significant nontaxable gain in other net, which was related to the sale of our ownership interest in SKY Network Television in New Zealand.","Free cash flow available to News Corp for the first 9 months was $496 million, an improvement of $362 million compared to the prior year. And as noted by Robert, our results demonstrate effective portfolio diversification, with a healthy mix of advertising, content sales and recurring circulation and subscription revenues. While we have faced some headwinds this quarter, particularly in print advertising, we were still able to post strong EBITDA and free cash flow available to News Corp, thanks to the strong performances at HarperCollins, REA, FOX SPORTS Australia and in-store advertising at News America Marketing, coupled with our continued focus on cost management.","With that as an overview, let\u2019s turn to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues declined $143 million or 9% versus the prior year. Australia accounted for $103 million or approximately 70% of that segment decline, with the majority of the decline due to foreign currency fluctuations. However, adjusted segment revenue declined 4%, consistent with the second quarter. Within segment revenues, advertising declined around 10% this quarter, also relatively consistent with the prior quarter.","Looking at advertising performance across our key publishing units, at News Corp Australia, ad revenues declined 24% or mid-teens in local currency, and we saw further softness this quarter in national and retail, partially offset by some improvements in real estate. At News U.K., advertising revenues declined 3% or high single digits in local currency versus the prior year, with the Easter shift having a modest negative impact. We were also impacted there by weakness in retail, most notably, the grocers. And at The Wall Street Journal, advertising revenues were down mid-single digits in the quarter, fairly consistent with the prior quarter. We continue to see pressure on advertising, and broadly speaking, bookings remain very short and volatile on a week-to-week basis.","Circulation and subscription revenues declined around 5%, driven primarily by continued decline in institutional sales at Dow Jones, which had a negative $20 million impact to revenues this quarter.","At our consumer businesses, we benefited from cover price increases of The Sun and The Times in the U.K. and several of our Australian mastheads, plus higher subscription pricing at The Wall Street Journal. Consequently, in local currency, we saw circulation revenue growth this quarter at The Wall Street Journal, News U.K. and in Australia.","It's also worth noting that in April, The Wall Street Journal increased subscription pricing for new customers by an additional $2 per month for both its digital-only and print digital bundle after a 4-week promotional period.","At News America Marketing, sales improved 4% versus last year, led by in-store advertising, which rose more than 20% and more than offset modest declines from free-standing insert advertising.","Total costs for News and Information Services were down 8% or approximately $120 million this quarter. We continue to benefit from lower headcount as we realized some savings from prior year restructurings and lower newsprint and production costs. These savings were partially offset by a $10 million increase related to the relocation of our London operations, which as I mentioned in the last call, was mostly noncash related to due rent and other facility-related costs. Segment EBITDA decreased $20 million in the quarter or 12% as compared to the prior year, and adjusted segment EBITDA was down 11%. However, excluding costs related to the relocation of our London operations, the decline in adjusted segment EBITDA was a modest 5%.","Turning to Cable Network Programming. Revenue declined 12% -- $12 million or 10% compared to the prior year due to adverse foreign currency fluctuations. We also saw higher digital platform subscribers and increased affiliate pricing in the quarter. Subscription revenues, which accounted for 85% of FOX SPORTS revenues this quarter, grew 6% in local currency, benefiting from higher digital platform subscribers and higher CPI-linked cable and satellite affiliate fees. FOX SPORTS Australia advertising revenue declined modestly, impacted by the absence of domestic cricket rights and a generally weaker ad subscription TV marketplace this quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, adjusted revenues increased 5%. Segment EBITDA in the quarter increased $2 million or 8% compared to the prior year, driven by lower programming costs, which were impacted again by the absence of domestic cricket rights compared to the prior year. If you exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, adjusted segment EBITDA increased 24%.","In Digital Real Estate Services, revenues increased $16 million or 19% compared to last year, reflecting higher pricing and uptake of premium products. Segment EBITDA increased $12 million or 29% compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the increased revenue. Excluding adverse foreign currency impact, adjusted revenue and adjusted segment EBITDA grew 36% and 49%, respectively, both accelerating from the prior quarter. Margins in local currency expanded 500 basis points to 53% from around 48% last year.","Turning to the Book Publishing segment. Revenues improved 14%, and EBITDA grew over 80% versus the prior year. Excluding divestitures, primarily the sale of our Live Events business, adjusted revenues were up 15%, and adjusted segment EBITDA improved by 77%. This was obviously an unusual growth quarter, with very strong performance from the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, which clearly got a boost from the theatrical release in March. We sold a total of over 8 million net units of the series this quarter, on top of the 5 million net units sold last quarter, with a high proportion of these as e-books.","Total e-book net sales for the quarter grew 46% versus the prior year and accounted for 26% for total HarperCollins revenue, up from 21% in the prior year period. We have, as Robert mentioned, announced plans last week to acquire Harlequin Enterprises from Torstar Corporation for CAD 455 million, approximately USD 415 million, which we believe is a unique opportunity for HarperCollins to significantly broaden its global footprint, strengthen the key content vertical and expand its backlist while importantly improving our financial profile. We expect this deal to be accretive to earnings from day 1 and improve our free cash flow. At this point, we would expect the deal to close by the end of this calendar third quarter, pending regulatory approvals, approval by Torstar's Class A shareholders and other customary closing conditions.","In our Other segment, revenues decreased $6 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower project-based consulting revenues at Amplify's legacy assessment business, coupled with divestitures of certain of the company's non-core Australia businesses during fiscal '13. At Amplify, we remain on track to roll out our English Language Arts digital curriculum for this coming fall, which we unveiled at South by Southwest in March, and our sales force is now meeting with school districts in major U.S. markets. We also announced plans to roll out new tablets in collaboration with Intel, including a new and expanded agreement with Guilford County Schools in North Carolina, starting in the fall of this year. Other segment EBITDA in the quarter declined by $12 million, primarily due to higher investment spending at Amplify and corporate costs compared to the allocated basis used in the prior year quarter. Also in the quarter, U.K. Newspaper Matters net impact on total segment EBITDA declined to $20 million from $34 million in the prior year. Again, that's net pretax costs after the indemnification from 21st Century Fox.","Turning to equity income. Earnings from affiliates were $23 million compared to $27 million in the prior year. The lower contribution primarily reflects the absence of the company's 44% stake in SKY Network Television, which was sold in March 2013, and the adverse impact of foreign currency. Foxtel ended the quarter with around 2.6 million total subscribers, up 5% versus the prior year, driven by higher digital platform subscribers. Cable and satellite churn improved to 13.1% compared to 14.9% in the prior year.","Turning to cash flow for the 9 months ended March 31, 2014. News Corp's cash flow from operations improved to $803 million compared to $420 million in the prior year, and free cash flow available improved to $496 million from $134 million, as I mentioned previously.","Just a few additional items. We continue to expect full year CapEx to be relatively similar to the FY '12 level of $375 million. CapEx this quarter was $97 million versus $86 million last year. Restructuring costs were down again significantly this quarter at $10 million, of which $6 million was related to the News and Information Services segment, compared to $54 million in the prior year. We continue to look at G&A cost reductions across the company, and this quarter, we negotiated over $10 million in annual savings from new technology, hardware, software and office service contracts. Over $5 million from new corporate airline and credit card deals, and we continue to look at consolidation of our print plants, warehouses and office facilities to improve efficiencies.","In February, we announced that we plan to contribute around $50 million to our existing investment in SEEK Asia for its acquisition of JobStreet, as it significantly expands its online employment market share across Southeast Asia. Our ownership will remain at 12%.","Subsequent to the year end, we also sold 850,000 shares in The Rubicon Project during its initial public offering, which generated about $12 million in proceeds for us. We still maintain about a 14% stake in Rubicon, and the company remains an important partner for us.","So in summary, as I've said in past calls, our key focus in fiscal 2014 continues to be to stabilize the top line while managing our cost base and prudently investing in the business. I think this quarter showed progress as we remained vigilant on costs in the face of still challenging ad trends, particularly in Australia. We talked in the past about appropriately pricing our content, and we have selectively raised either cover prices or subscription pricing across a number of our mastheads. We also expect to see additional investments in our digital products, as well as marketing efforts in the fourth quarter.","We're very pleased by the performance we're seeing in Book Publishing and are really excited about our announced plans to acquire Harlequin, which is both a great strategic fit and fiscally very attractive. We remain laser-focused on strengthening our asset base and continue to be balanced between reinvestments and cost discipline as we better position News Corp for sustained growth.","So with that, let me turn back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned on the call. This book publishing subscription model, is that something that will be rolled out in the next year? Can you give us any color on what you're thinking of charging? And would it be a Harlequin-type -- like romance? What are the genres that you're thinking of? And then the second question is on Amplify. Can you give us any more clarity on sort of key benchmarks, like adoptions or anything we can look -- timing of what we can look for, for some progress?","Robert J. Thomson","Thanks for the question. There are 2 different types of subscriptions that we're referring to. One is a book subscription offering, where we have partnerships with companies such as Scribd and Oyster. The subscription offering that I was specifically referring to was the development of our plus programs, whether it's Times+ or Sun+ and similar plus programs in Australia built around newspaper offerings. They would have both digital access and us providing access to audiences to discounts and so on. And you could certainly imagine for many of our papers that the Harlequin catalog would be a very suitable offering, both to, as we're intending to do, bringing the back catalog front and center but also provide a platform for further Harlequin sales.","Bedi Ajay Singh","And, Jessica, on your question on Amplify, I mean, as I said, the sales force is out there right now in all the major markets. I think we would expect to see some sort of contracts emerging before the summer, during the summer, as the new school year will be starting in September. That would be the expectation.","Operator","Our next question is from Fraser McLeish with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Fraser McLeish - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just -- you gave some numbers on digital subscribers in Australia. I was just wondering if you'd be able to give us an update on digital subscribers around your other newspaper properties. And also, just -- could you -- just a housekeeping one. Could you tell us where Foxtel's debt stands at the moment, please?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, to be honest, we're not breaking out all of our digital numbers, and it's not necessarily a like-for-like comparison. What we are seeing is a good digital growth at The Times of London, where net-net, paying customers are on the rise. That's a combination of print and digital. We're at the early stage of the Sun+ digital offering. And the next phase, the next iteration of that, really, will come with the upcoming football season in the U.K. And at the New York Post, we've seen a doubling of digital usage, but that's, at the moment, to a free site, since the site itself was redesigned about 6, 7 months ago. And we continue to see a robust digital growth at The Wall Street Journal. That's a quick sum-up for you, but you have to be careful because, clearly, there are some free offerings in the numbers, as well as paid-for numbers. But what we're seeing generally is confidence around the globe at our properties in the future of digital.","Bedi Ajay Singh","And, Fraser, just on your question relating to Foxtel, obviously, as you guys know, Foxtel is not consolidated, but we do give separate financial data for that at the end of the year. For the last balance sheet, they had approximately $3 billion of debt, of which $2.2 billion is third-party debt and about $800 million was shareholder loans, which were equally split between Telstra and ourselves.","Michael Florin","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","We'll hear next from Alan Gould with Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got a question regarding Amplify. It seems like the losses are running a little bit less than we might have anticipated. Do you still see yourself having Amplify cost $160 million to $180 million this year?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Alan, yes, I think they're running kind of where we expected they would be running, and I think for the year, it will be somewhere around the $180 million sort of that sort of level of investment.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","How much was it this quarter?","Bedi Ajay Singh","It was about $44 million, I think, this quarter.","Operator","Next is Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is on the strength we saw in the Book Publishing business in the quarter. I guess is there any color you can give us on how we should think about the outlook for revenue growth there? I mean, how long does a popular book like Divergent typically continue to drive growth? And given the younger demographic skew of that book, does it help your digital subscription model there?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, it's -- obviously, it's inappropriate to forecast. However, what we can say is that, clearly, there's a strong digital component to the Divergent offering, where e-book growth was up 46%. Revenues -- our e-book penetration itself rose from 21% to 26%, and clearly, with digital, the contribution margin of digital is around 75% versus 40% for hardcover and 60% for paper. But more broadly, without being specific about any sort of forecast, clearly, Brian Murray and the team at HarperCollins have some follow-up books related to the Divergent series early in the next financial year, and there will be a series of Divergent-related movies, which I understand the next one is slated for spring of next year.","Operator","Next is Entcho Raykovski with Deutsche Bank.","Entcho Raykovski - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is around the Harlequin acquisition. I was just wondering if you can provide some milestones for the acquisition, the stage at which it gets to grow. And obviously, that business seems to have been pretty challenged over the last couple of years. And I just wanted to understand why the e-book segment has been so challenged at Harlequin, whereas HarperCollins has been growing very strongly.","Robert J. Thomson","I'm not sure it's fair to say that the e-book segment has been challenged for Harlequin. In a sense, it's selling about 40% of its books digitally in the U.S., so it has a quite sophisticated platform. What we see in Harlequin is an opportunity not only to develop the Harlequin offerings, which as I outlined earlier do have some complementarity with our popular papers but, more importantly, to develop our HarperCollins offerings. Because HarperCollins, 99% of the books are published in English. With Harlequin, you get 34 languages. And for us, it was always going to be a question of build versus buy to build out our global infrastructure. But -- and clearly, Harlequin was a great opportunity. You're getting institutional intelligence and understanding of those markets and, frankly, something else, which is a little more abstract, the social capital. These types of books have an editorial empathy that you need to connect with different cultures. So all of those characteristics of Harlequin were attractive to us and so was the price.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Diddams with Citi.","Justin Diddams - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just have a question for Robert. The Australian newspaper business has been hit pretty hard. I mean, I think it would be described as nothing short of violent, the change in advertising, momentum for newspapers in Australia. And, Robert, I just wanted to get your view onto why advertisers in the Australian market had turned on newspapers and when you think that we will reach the bottom in this sort of fairly aggressive decline in revenue momentum.","Robert J. Thomson","Well, look, I think forecasting, obviously, is inappropriate. What I can say is that newspapers are oversold. Newspapers are a very powerful platform, and I think there's a certain fatalism at other media companies in Australia that may have infected the perception of papers. But we're very proud of our papers. And I think what will become more clearly understood over time is the relative power of print in a digital world, where you literally cannot multitask if you are reading a newspaper. And to a certain extent, what you're seeing in Australia is a lagging of a trend that was profound in the U.S. and U.K. in recent years. Each newspaper market is different. You have a cauldron of competition in London, which obviously expedited some of the competitive challenges not only among other papers but platforms. And so in Australia, you are now seeing that trend writ [ph] large. But I do think that there'll be a reconsideration of the value of print in the next year or so because it's a platform that we know can deliver results to advertisers. And we'll be doing our best with the Australian team over the coming months to prove that point.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.","Michael C. Morris - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is about the B2B offering from Dow Jones. Can you describe the changes that you made to the product and how that better exploits your competitive advantage? And also just remind us, your target audience there. Is it individuals or businesses that are using existing services? Are you trying to expand the market for the type of product?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, broadly speaking, we've adjusted the product, we've adjusted the pitch and we've adjusted the pricing to suit our customers' needs. What Will Lewis and the team have done in the last few months is go out and, frankly, talk to customers and find out what they want for us. I think broadly defined, there are 2 sectors, there's the B2B sector, the high-end finance, high-end corporate, what you would call a B2P segment, which is Business to Professional, which is separate to the B2C of The Wall Street Journal. And so the team are working up strategies in both. Some of the -- about 4 weeks ago, some fundamental changes were made to Tractiva [ph] to make it more user-friendly. You are able to bookmark more articles, the search was improved. But you have to see these improvements as iterative -- we will go on improving the product. What we've found is that our customer base has welcomed the changes, and it's now up to our sales staff and our product team to continue to pitch and to continue to sell.","Operator","Next is Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.","Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC","My questions had to do with Foxtel, please. In the quarter, adjusting for currency, can you please give us what the revenue percent change was year-over-year, operating profit and also EBITDA, please?","Bedi Ajay Singh","The revenues were up kind of in the low single digits, and the operating income, I think we reported was higher. We took some price increases at Foxtel in February. So I think that sort of is the financial picture there.","Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners, LLC","When you say higher, what do you mean? Can you quantify that at all for operating income?","Bedi Ajay Singh","We're not giving out a specific number, but if you look at the...","Robert J. Thomson","Look at the press release.","Bedi Ajay Singh","Press release.","Operator","Next is Adam Alexander with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Robert, you talked a bit on the call about pushing cover pricing and subscription pricing across the masthead, and it seems to be doing quite well. Still seems to be a fair bit of a gap though between what you charge for Wall Street Journal and some of your competitors. Given the characteristics of your rata base, what plans do you have to sort of close that gap over time?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, I think the 2 key things to bear in mind is affinity and intensity. And affinity and intensity in relationships with both readers and advertisers, which is -- while not only as a source of circulation revenue but as source of advertising revenue newspapers, remain a powerful platform. Clearly, we will be looking at pricing both print and digital. And print and digital bundled at The Wall Street Journal, it's a great product. It's improving all the time. The other area that we'll be looking at, obviously, is global, where only 20% of our audience at the moment is outside the U.S. Clearly, given the character of the content, there is a great opportunity for us to take advantage of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Sacha Krien with CLSA.","Sacha Krien - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I've just got a question on the economics of the Book Publishing segment. In your Investor Day presentation, you presented unit economics for hardcover versus e-books. And the price you had in there for e-books was $14.99, and I think royalties of about $2.60. Can you give us an idea of how this has been changing or trending since the Investor Day presentation and where you see it going, going forward?","Bedi Ajay Singh","Actually, those haven't changed that much. And I think the margins that we were looking at are still around 75% for e-books versus 40% for hardcover and 60% for paper. So it's been pretty consistent with what we reported.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Eric Katz with Wells Fargo.","Eric Katz - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So when the spin from Fox was first being discussed, there was the thought by most investors that the reason for the spin was to allow News Corp to purchase newspaper assets and expand that business. But now we see your biggest acquisition, thus far, is a book publisher, and there's been some complementary acquisitions that seemed to bolster the current newspaper assets. So can you frame the M&A strategy for us at this point in time? Should we expect some newspaper M&A or you're looking to diversify even more?","Robert J. Thomson","I think it's fair to say that the 2 guiding trends of strategy, generally, are globalization and digitization. You've seen that with the first acquisition, Storyful, which has been very well-received both from an editorial perspective, but not just for our newspapers, from our digital sites, particularly, but also from a commercial perspective because Storyful will be able to create content communities around products and companies, and I think you'll see some of that in coming months. So we said during the Investor Day, globalization and digitization, and that's very much what the team is doing.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Alice Bennett with CBA.","Alice Bennett - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Research Division","I just had a question around the digital sales of Harlequin and HarperCollins. It looks like there's a bit of a divergence with Harlequin, much stronger in the U.S. relative to the other markets they're operating in. I just wondered if there is a similar divergence within HarperCollins. Are your digital sales much above that 26% rate in the U.S. market or is it broadly similar across the globe?","Robert J. Thomson","Well, clearly, Divergent is not just a book title, but it varies in the case of Harlequin because it's strong in emerging markets, where, quite frankly, the digital development is less forward. There will be -- whether it's Brazil or India. And I would recommend, actually, that you look at the Harlequin website to get a sense of the range of its international exposure, which is a great asset. But download speeds have slowed, and people are less likely to download. So partly, it's defined by the economics and economics of itself defines digital development, but it also varies by genre of book.","Michael Florin","Thank you, operator. Any other questions?","Operator","No, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Florin, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Well, thank you for all your time. We look forward to showing an update next quarter.

Welcome to the News Corporation 4Q '12 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2012 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer. First, we'll give you some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter. And then, we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking informations with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-K for the 12 months ended June 30, 2012, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained with such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-K filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as statement operating income, adjusted statement operating income and adjusted earnings per share, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of those non-GAAP measures is included in the earnings release.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David F. DeVoe","Reed, thank you. And good afternoon, everybody. As you have well seen in today's earnings release, News Corporation closed out fiscal 2012, achieving the financial targets we provided to you a year ago. For the full year, adjusted total segment operating income was $5.6 billion, 13% higher than the $4.975 billion adjusted total segment operating income we reported a year ago. This increase was driven by a 19% operating profit growth in our cable networks, 22% growth in contributions from our Filmed Entertainment segment and the elimination of MySpace-related losses, partially offset by lower Publishing results. Reported net income this year was $1.2 billion or $0.47 per share, which included impairment and restructuring charges of $3 billion equating to $1 per share, primarily taken in the fourth quarter and mostly related to the company's Publishing assets. Additionally, full-year results include gains of $270 million or $0.07 per share from the company's participation in BSkyB buyback program. And $224 million in costs related to the U.K. investigations also represented $0.07 per share. Excluding the net income effects of these items and comparable items in both years, adjusted earnings per share was $1.41 compared to the adjusted year-ago result of $1.18. This 19% improvement primarily reflects our operating segment income growth and the buyback of close to 10% of the company's outstanding stock over the course of last year.","Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. And for the quarter, the company reported adjusted segment operating income of $1.24 billion as compared to $1.35 billion reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. This anticipated decline, which was discussed in our last earnings call, reflects continued growth in our cable networks, more than offset by decreases at the company's remaining segments. The company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of $1.6 billion, largely reflecting the previously mentioned impairment and restructuring charges that offset segment operating income. The fourth quarter results also include charges of $57 million related to the investigation in the United Kingdom. Excluding these charges and the comparable items in the prior year, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.32 per share as compared to the year ago adjusted EPS of $0.35 a share.","And now, let's -- I'll provide some comments on the fourth quarter performance at a couple of our businesses. Now let's start with the cable networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating 2\/3 of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Fourth quarter operating income contributions increased over 25% from year-ago levels to $792 million, reflecting particularly strong results at FOX News and FX domestically, and at both the FOX International Channels and STAR internationally. This growth continues to be top line-driven, with segment revenues up 15%. Affiliate fees at the cable networks increased 19% over year-ago levels with domestic affiliate fees up 16%, driven by our successful affiliate renewals earlier in the fiscal year. International fees were up 31%, with about 1\/2 of the international affiliate revenue increase, driven by organic growth and the remainder reflecting a consolidation of FOX and American sports after acquiring that business in December.","Fourth quarter advertising revenues for this segment were up 9% over year-ago levels, with domestic ad growth of 5% and international growth of 18%. The strong result from the international businesses reflects particular strength in viewership trends and ad markets in Latin America and India, as well as this year's contribution of Fox Pan American Sports. Fourth quarter expenses at the cable networks increased 11% over a year ago. This primarily reflects increased sports programming due to costs, due to the delay of the NBA season and the resulting increase in televised games this quarter. It also reflects the launch of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as the impact of Fox Pan American Sports.","At our Television segment, operating income of the quarter of $213 million decreased $20 million versus the fourth quarter a year ago. This decline is largely due to American Idol and other rating softness that more than offset higher retransmission revenues and a higher political advertising at the stations. At our Film segment, fourth quarter operating income was $120 million, a $90 million decline compared to a year ago, largely reflecting the expected difficult comparisons to last year's very successful theatrical release of Rio and the strong home entertainment titles, Black Swan and the Chronicles of Narnia. This quarter results included the launch cost of a number of successful theatrical releases that will help set up the Film segment for a solid fiscal 2013, and they include Prometheus and, of course, Ice Age: Continental Drift, which has generated over $715 million in total worldwide box office to date.","Turning to SKY Italia. Segment operating income of the quarter of $89 million declined $56 million from a year ago. This decrease reflects the challenging economic environment in Italy as directly impacting gross subscriber additions in churn. SKY reported 4.9 million subs at quarter end, a net loss of 42,000 subscribers in the quarter, resulting in reduced subscription revenue compared to a year ago. Quarter results also reflect increased expenses related to subscriber retention efforts, as well as the more than 10% negative impact on operating profits and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro in the quarter.","Given the relatively low pay-TV penetration in Italy and SKY's strong competitive positioning, we continue to have complete confidence in the long-term growth prospects for this business. However, in the short-term, weak consumer confidence and consumption behavior is likely to sustain the current difficult trading conditions in Italy.","And at our Publishing segment, operating income of $139 million declined $131 million compared to a year ago. This decrease largely reflects lower advertising revenue at the Australian and the U.K. newspapers, lower in-store revenues at News America Marketing, as well as the impact and the closure of News of the World. The quarter results also include a charge for litigation -- for a litigation settlement related to the e-Books price at HarperCollins. And these declines -- the declines of these groups were partially offset by higher earnings contributions at Dow Jones.","Before I turn to our guidance for fiscal 2013, I'd also like to update you on our buyback program. And through August 7, the company spent $5.1 billion repurchasing nearly 280 million shares, reducing News Corporation's total outstanding by more than 10% compared to 12 months ago. As you may recall, 3 months ago, we increased our original $5 billion buyback authorization by another $5 billion, with a target of completing the total authorized buyback by the end of fiscal 2013. Even with the June announcement that we intend to pursue a separation of the Publishing and entertainment businesses, we are fully committed to completing the $10 billion buyback program. Although the repurchase pacing will initially moderate to a $3 billion to $4 billion annual rate as we worked through details of the separation process, as always our objective is to buy back our shares in a disciplined manner without artificially pushing our share price up.","And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013. And as we measure our guidance, we are starting with the fiscal 2012 total segment operating income of $5.4 billion, we just reported, and exclude from this the $224 million of charges related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom, resulting in a base for 2012 of $5.6 billion for comparative purposes. And as we look at fiscal 2013, we expect our channels businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth, resulting from continued double-digit growth at our cable networks lead by further expansion of our international channels, as well as sustained advertising and affiliate increases led by FOX News, the RSNs and FX, higher Television segment earnings, which will benefit from the continued growth in retransmission consent revenue and a strong political advertising market heading into the November elections. Growth at our channels businesses will be partially offset by reduced contributions in SKY Italia, largely due with the current economic climate in Italy. Additionally, our operating plan for fiscal 2013 assumes development spending in our education group amplify nearly $180 million, which is $100 million more than we recorded in fiscal 2012. We're also assuming that the contributions for our Publishing segment will stabilize and be no worse than the results reported in fiscal 2012. And also, across the whole company, foreign currency rates will negatively impact our growth by about 1%. And lastly, we are continuing to exclude the cost of the U.K. investigations from our forecast due to their unpredictability.","Taking all of these items into account and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we anticipate our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 to be in the high single to low-double digit range below the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base levels.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Okay. Thanks, Dave. I'll probably use the next few minutes to provide a bit more color on the guidance that Dave just gave. In a number of ways, I believe our headlight in guidance for 2013 does not fully reflect the underlying strength and momentum of our core business. The driving force of our growth will continue to be our cable channels and broadcast business. Networks like FOX, FOX News and FX continue to build on their position as unique market leaders. We also continue to meet or exceed our targets for retransmission and subscription fees that reflect the success of those networks. Internationally, we're ahead of the targeted growth previously discussed, and are always looking to add new dimensions to this business. One of the areas where we are investing for the future is in sports in India. Core STAR business will grow strong in 2013. However, we will also be investing in building a dynamic Indian sports business. While these strategic investments will more than absorb STAR'S growth this coming year, it will take the business to a whole new level of profitability in the next 3 to 4 years. These are exactly the kinds of growth investment opportunities we're targeting.","I also believe that one of the things that really sets us apart is our strength in content. On the Film side, the international success of Ice Age 4 has gotten us off to a great start. And our TV studio is, once again, an industry leader. Demand for our product is stronger than ever as more company strive to compete in the dynamic digital world. Nonetheless, we believe the prudent approach for setting expectations in the content business is to be cautious in projecting film contributions so our guidance reflects essentially flat year-on-year results at a very large base of profits. Our satellite platforms, we believe our businesses and investments in the U.K., Italy, Germany and India have never been stronger competitively. In each case, the strengths reflect the combination of leadership in content, technology and operations. The one business that is facing real economic headwinds and will adversely impact 2013 results is Italy. We're focused on taking steps to position SKY Italia for tough economic times, which will enable the business to resume its growth as we move towards 2014. In all honesty, SKY Italia has never been in a stronger competitive position and we could not be more excited about the future of this business, particularly as the Italian economy begins to recover.","Another business of ours that we believe has long-term potential is education. However, it will impact our overall growth in 2013, as Dave said, as we're investing an incremental $100 million this year. Our aim here is to build a unique education business positioned to take advantage of today's digital technologies. These investments are recorded as a loss in our P&L. However, as in the case of other businesses we successfully built over the years, we believe these are investments that we'll pay off in multiples. Recent agreements like the one with AT&T speak to the unique excitement about this initiative. We have more to come. We know many of you would like to know more about our plans here, and Joe Klein is planning to provide that vision for you this fall.","Finally, our Publishing businesses are clearly in a restructuring mode. Overall, this segment is expected to be essentially flat in 2013. We do expect to start to see some of the benefits of our initiatives in the U.K. However, Australia and News America Marketing will still be in the midst of restructuring and challenging pressures that will adversely affect -- impact profits. As we look ahead into fiscal 2013, we also expect to continue addressing our off-balance sheet investments. In some cases like NDS, we've moved to monetize investments. In other cases like our recently announced steps around DSX and CMH in Australia, we're moving to take greater operating control of businesses. This is obviously an ongoing process and we're not going to lay out timetables for future moves, but we will be opportunistic. Equally as important, we want to be flexible and opportunistic. We also recognize the importance of an efficient capital structure to maximize shareholder value. We pursue the balanced approach of buybacks and investments to achieve this goal, and that continues to be our plan. Our undervalued stock continues to support our buyback plans. At the same time, we believe there may be strategic investment opportunities to exceed our target returns and strengthen our businesses for growth.","Overall, we really like where we stand, and are particularly excited as we move forward with our planned separation that is really all about bringing focus and alignment to our businesses. There isn't a lot of news to add on the separation since we announced it a little over a month ago. But everything is on course and we're targeting to make our initial regulatory filings around calendar year end, with operating details to follow.","In closing, while these macro economic times may test our nerves, we are incredibly well positioned for another year of growth inclusive of the investments we're making. Ultimately, we feel confident that our strategies will bring strong shareholder returns for years to come.","Reed Nolte","And now, Chase, James and David will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, the executive team will take questions first from members of the financial community. [Operator Instructions] And we go to Michael Nathanson with Nomura Securities.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 quick ones, I promise, on domestic key units. If you look at affiliate fee growth this year, and they're 12%, but it was lumpy: the first half, 9%; the second half, 15%. Can you give us a sense of next year domestic affiliate fee growth? What's the right range within that ballpark of affiliate fee growth?","David F. DeVoe","Yes, I mean, I think it's pretty much what we said in the past, which I think as we said, we've sort of been achieving low-double digit affiliate fee growth. And I think that, as we look out, that's the growth we expect. There'll always be a little lumpiness just because when large deals come up and in particular channels, they can give a quarter-to-quarter lumpiness. But as we look out over the next few years, I think we expect to continue the same sort of growth rate we've been generating.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then last, the other question would be you also had lumpiness on the cost side throughout the quarter domestically. What's the right range of cost growth organically? Because I know there's a lot of moving pieces on the domestic side. But what's the right range of cost growth at the domestic networks?","Chase Carey","I mean, that's a much tougher one to make a general statement about because you really have such a mix of businesses that -- or different places. I mean, they're -- I think we do think it's important to make target investments to strengthen channels. I think there are channels where we think we still have room to improve margins, and probably others that are overstaying margins, and there are probably channels that we think we should be -- we can grow both the top and the bottom line that have yet achieved their potential. So if you look across business FOX News, which obviously has a much more controlled cost base, sports business has rights that come up. There are businesses like transactions, like -- or agreements like ones with the UFC, where we're investing to build the channel-like fuel. So I think we feel comfortable with those margins but, again, it's going to be a mixed set of stories as you look across the mix of channels when you have as many channels as we do, across the expanse of sports entertainment, news and nonfiction. There are different strategies for each.","Operator","And we go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess 2 questions on the guidance. One on the Publishing business, you mentioned sort of flat results. Can you talk about, on the expense side, what you're doing there? It sounds like expenses will be down, at least, in the U.K. And then on the cleanup around your investment chase, can you comment a little more on Sky Deutschland? I think that the business is, it's sort of an inflection point. You've got the Bundesliga rights now. I think they start being exclusive in the fall. And the business is starting to probably ramp in profitability. Does that make that something that you want to own more of? Any comment on some of the opportunity in Germany, how are you feeling about operations, maybe compared to Italy, and help us think about the long-term plan there?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, I guess, first one at the cost side in the Publishing. I mean, we certainly are focused on the costs, and I think particularly in some of the businesses that will be a major focus for the coming year. Major places -- some we're a little further along the curve, as I think I referred, in a place like the U.K. In Australia, we brought in new management just in the first half of this year, so that's probably one that is really going to be moving into a very significant restructuring during this year. So I think it's a part of all of those businesses, but they're a little bit at different places. Obviously, the U.K. also has initiatives. They're not just cost-based like the Sunday Sun, that bring a dimension back, but certainly costs are a major focus across those businesses. On Sky Deutschland, we're thrilled with the business. Yes, there was nothing really to announce. As we said before, we're comfortable where we're at today. I agree the business continues to make great strides forward. I think the management team there has done a fabulous, fabulous job. We continue to see it in the growth of subscribers and the improvement of the financials. And I think if you -- and you start where you can really feel it's the channel that really, it is creating a real excitement about it. And surfing the channels are creating a real excitement about it, a launch of sports news there added exciting dimension to it. I think the breadth of rights we took, we just acquired on the boom display will give us the opportunities to widen again, some of the technological enhancements that are added to it are really getting traction. So it's a business doing really well. Again, our focus today, it's on continuing to improve that business and driving everything it can be. And that we'll decide as we go, what's the right path for us in an ownership context.","Operator","Yes, we go to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Also 2 questions. Chase, I was hoping you could just elaborate a little more on your global sports strategy? I mean, it really seems like you're focusing in on some really big markets. Besides the rights fees, and I think you bought something in Holland today, are you -- what is the level of investment? Are you trying to develop Palanca Brown's [ph] ESPN and are you managing it, can they be global channels? And the second question is, can you just give some color on the fiscal Q1 advertising outlook by business?","Chase Carey","Sure. And I think -- this is for a -- for this sports actually, yes, it's not a global strategy. I mean, I think it has to start sort of within each business, making investments that makes sense. There may be, as we go forward, opportunities to connect it and look at it more broadly, nothing to do with the ESPN is the day without the building businesses that we think makes sense and we think where we can drive real value. We like sports. I mean, as sports, yes, there's a cost attached to it. But I think in a world that is increasingly fragmented and digital, it's been proven time and time again, that if there's one area of content that just continues to sort of differentiate itself, it's sports. And I think sports has particularly unique values where you've got a large broad business, so you look at in India, where we're we've got multiple channels and the like, and the ability -- or even in the U.S. where having those big flagship sports franchises, you create value within the sports, but in many ways, it becomes a part of the larger growth strategy for those businesses. I think it really starts, and you have to -- I mean, those bets are beg enough, we make a bet, whether it's from Germany, Italy, India or the U.S. or Latin America. We made all those bets. We made them based on what we think the returns, to make sure we believe we can generate the returns we need within those markets, that there are opportunities to then take the breadth of those investments. And as I mentioned, I think that's something we can -- we'd always love to do, but the fundamentals are really make sure we can add value there, clearly. When you're adding sports in a place where you've got the breadth where we did with Sky Deutschland or SKY Italia or the breadth of the businesses, STAR, or the right of channels we've got in the U.S., sports plays uniquely an important role in driving the business as a whole. In terms of fiscal, in terms of advertising for the first quarter. Yes, I think it's actually been -- it feels reasonably good. I mean, maybe a couple of weeks have been shot, I mean, sort of, obviously, pretty dormant for most of us not in the Olympics. But I said, excluding sort of the immediate term, it's -- the market's pretty good. I mean, there's anxieties, I think still the anxieties, whether it's Europe or the election here, and what are the consequences to those as they continue to -- certainly, keep our eyes in short, and people have been on edge. But when you look at the scatter market network, is still some low, double-digit scatter market. Cable is always a big factor. Cable market's probably stronger than that. And so, I mean, it actually is -- the market has -- reasonably good market. It's not great. It's not off the charts. But in a reasonably solid market in a period when, clearly, there are a lot of anxieties about the economy.","Operator","We'll go to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could actually follow-up on the advertising comment. Can you give us a sense of what the domestic ad growth underlying your guidance is?","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, I think in the station business, we've assumed for essentially a pretty flat marketplace except -- well, you said the underlying marketplace. I think our marketplace is like low-single digits, like 1 or -- the market, it's like 1% or 2% [indiscernible] So I think we assumed a flat, a close to flat marketplace. We do think we can face -- we've been successful in taking share, and that is our goal for the year. But I think we can assume a pretty flat in advertising market in -- overall.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Overall, so that's stations and network?","Chase Carey","Yes. The network is -- we came, we've got to come through the upfront. So you -- and you sort of into the network, it just sends a bit, a little bit more based on the upfront. So I mean, we -- I think we achieved what we set out in the upfront, that's about 80% of our inventory and equipment down a touch on volume, up on pricing. And then I think sort of achieved what we set out to achieve. And the scatter market has been pretty good so far.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And a follow-up to that, Chase, is -- and I'm afraid the answer to this will be sort of a little bit of everything. But the biggest swing factors from the low end to the high end of guidance that you would point us to do beyond advertising?","Chase Carey","Yes, beyond the marketplace?","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes.","Chase Carey","Well, I guess, it's something to dig. It's probably, to start with, a business, as I said that we forecast flat, which is the Film business. And we always got stuff that's always tough to forecast. We've gotten off to a really good start with Ice Age, with the Ice Age film. But there is that business. And you -- even on the TV side, we think the digital world, it gives a lot of energy. We're not going to go out and get too far out there. I mean, you're getting more international activity than you've had. So you've got a lot of -- you've got the energy domestically, you've got more activity internationally. We've got to first make sure we continue to be disciplined about how we approach it. And I think we've always said, we're not going to just grab a quick buck. But you can see if there are opportunities there. And I would not say we projected sort of any big buyer coming in, in a new way. So we've approached it sort of much more based on in terms of the world as we know it, and in a world that I think is, if I'm going to say, \"Where do I think that digital world goes?\" You look out next year, certainly feels like it could happen. More buyers across the world that are looking to try to access unique content. And I think we feel great about our content and brands. And I think that will give us opportunities to intelligently explore it while sort of protecting and building our core businesses to channels, but intelligently, taking advantage of digital. So I'd probably say that those would be the execution on content, on content film that we don't put in there, and the digital world providing opportunities that we haven't tried to project.","Operator","And we go to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions also related to Cable Nets. First on sports. I think sports is such a vibrant part of what News Corp. is all about. And I think some investors who don't like News Corp. really fear that the RSN business is not in a strong position, just given the cost of those networks in the current multichannel world relative to other networks as well as just the risk of team on networks, when you see what's happening like in L.A. You seem to have a lot of confidence in the trajectory of our RSN business. Kind of help us all understand kind of why you are so confident in that business. And then just kind of a related question to the topic of Cable Net. We're seeing new distributors like Google Fiber with their facilities buildout, and we're seeing some potentially new over-the-top MVPD's come online over the course of the next few months. Can you just update us on what your thought process is? I know you're working with Google Fiber. Maybe just an explanation of why, that would be great.","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean, as for the RSNs, I mean I guess -- yes, I think that the confidence is probably -- starts with the simple fact that most of our agreements have pretty good terms to them right now. I mean, the Dodgers, what we're dealing with, I think, most of them are at least 5- to 6-year terms and some of them -- many of them are decades. So the issues we're dealing with, with the Dodgers, don't, aren't really ones that broadly exist. And I think beyond that, I think we believe we can navigate those issues. And I think we've been pretty good. I mean, I've used Texas as an example where we did. And feel good about the business we came out of Dallas with. So sports is always going to have a -- all our business is going to get more competitive with more players. And that's part of our challenge, and try to make sure we've got the strengths and management that could continue to tackle those challenges and build those businesses. And I think we've proven an ability to do it. So I guess, I think, it's combination of the strength we've got, the track record we've proven to be able to execute in the face of those challenges, and the strengths of the agreements we've got in place for those businesses. In terms of Google, the Google Fiber, I mean -- you mean the Kansas City thing we're doing?","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","David F. DeVoe","Yes, they're, I mean, essentially, they're just been building the ultimate cable system. We -- I mean, just as we saw the satellite, we don't sell geographic exclusivity, so somebody comes in and wants to overbuild this next Generation cable system, if we could reach the right terms, then yes, we'll do business. We want to make sure it's the people that respect issues that are important to us, around piracy and everything else. So but there are players that, again, we said, we think it's important about the business, and we can reach appropriate business terms. We -- just as we licensed our product satellite when they came on the same -- this is really, I think, it's a next generation cable operator building out a cable system. I think the whole visual MVPD thing is much murkier and much less clear when it comes to who's doing what. But I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on in digital, but I think that that's much more digital because I don't think it's really evolved far enough to really have a clear picture of who's trying to do what. There are a lot of people talking but I think that Google Fiber is much clearer. Again, I think they just -- whether the economics of that works for them long-term, I guess we'll see. But they just built a, as I said, next generation cable system and broadband network. And for them determining, can you generate enough incremental revenues to pay for that incremental cost they've invested in the ground.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Is that why you're putting in an investment Roco this quarter, to just kind of have it to get that over-the-top table?","David F. DeVoe","I think it serves as -- it's not that specific. I think it's -- yes, I think, look, we know this digital reign is going to be important to our future, I think. You don't want to be spending ahead of the curve because a lot of business models have yet to evolve, but we think it's important for us to be active in this place and try and get insights to it. Hulu, obviously, gives us one important task to try and develop digital businesses. We've played a little bit with the YouTube channels and the disc models clear, but it gives us, again, an ability for a very modest investment to try and develop a different dimension to the digital experience, growth of business again, a little different window in the digital experience. Roco also has some values to our satellite platforms overseas that are probably -- would be different to what we'd be pursuing strategically here that could be enhanced to them as they try and figure out, which is clearly part of their strategy and you see is today, as we roll out products, whether it's SKY Go or SKY on demand and the like, and better understanding of how do you develop that sort of everywhere, TV Everywhere, concept as the satellite player. So I think it's more like that, just say insights into the digital world in a way that we think is a smart, manageable investment.","Operator","We'll go to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One for Dave and one for Chase. Dave, just wondering if you have the numbers on organic affiliate and advertising revenue growth of the international Cable Networks if you were to exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and the impact of FOX Pan American Sports consolidation? Just looking for a sense for the recurring growth rates of those and then what they look like and what might be implied in your fiscal '13 guidance for those? And then I'll just give my follow-up here, which is, Chase, that the only times reported that you're able to negotiate FOX News with Time Warner at a very favorable step-up initially, just wondering if you can comment for us about that agreement, how that kind of played out, what your thoughts are? It was reported you weren't able to renegotiate the other networks early along with FOX News. Just wanted to get some context from you on that.","David F. DeVoe","Yes, the affiliate fee, is about 14% organic. And the advertising would be about 13% if you pull out the items you mentioned.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And for the guidance? Any comment on sustainability of that type of organic growth?","David F. DeVoe","I think we said before, that we feel pretty good about double-digit growth, both in the international businesses.","Chase Carey","I'm not going to comment about some -- a lot about specific agreements. I don't think that's been our practice. And we won't -- we achieved our -- I mean, we feel good about the agreement. I mean, and let's not try and put a stick it anybody's eyes. And I think, we -- that our goal in these is to get fair value. We're not trying to pick fights. We think FOX News has been undervalued, is undervalued for the importance of it in the marketplace. As we've talked about the fact, by the end of the calendar year, will have renewed a sort of second renewal, I think at least 1\/2 the FOX News universe, we've expected, and we've expected to receive significant increases, reflects the value of that FOX Business Network, and use to make strides that will actually affect the business network, will be profitable this year. So it is -- and I think it's a stronger channel as it goes forward. We always look to sort of try and look at all our franchises, find the right balance. I will say, we achieved what we set out to do, and probably exceeded targets we had, which is pretty much, I'd say, in really affiliation agreements we've had certainly over the last couple of years. And I think we have -- we've tried to be pretty disciplined, pretty clear. Yes, in some places, we have asked for significant increases, but -- and I think where we do, we think it reflects the value, whether it's retransmission of FOX News or other franchises. And we have continued to achieve or exceed our targets. But I'm not going to get into comments on -- in specifics. We have good a good relationship with Time Warner Cable, and that would be our goal, is to continue to have that constructive relationship with them.","Operator","We'll go to John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk about any change in strategy you may employ in the near-term with SKY Italia, against the downturn? Will you continue the retention program? Has churn ticked out to maybe mid- to high-teens at this point? And has the competitive environment changed at all?","David F. DeVoe","It's Dave here. I think on SKY Italia, look, I think it's very clear to everyone, particularly SKY Italia and us, that the macroeconomic environment in Italy is providing some real challenges. But with the focus from a strategic point of view, is to really handle the cost base, as best we can, really attack the cost base to rightsize the business in an economic environment that is very different than it was a number of years ago. And that's really across-the-board in terms of operating costs and rights costs and things like that. Subscriber management, clearly, a very, very big focus. And churn has ticked up a bit, but I think that this year we'll see that businesses stabilize and be able to grow from a different base. And we have very high hopes to that business going forward. On the competitive landscape side, I would just say that I think we all think that SKY Italia has probably never been better positioned competitively. It's performing very well in a challenging environment there. And I think when you hold it up to the competitors and where Mediaset is, where Talk of Italia is, where the cable industry which doesn't really exist there is, we feel very good about positioning. And right now, it's just a question of really rightsizing the cost base to deal with the subscriber growth environment that really isn't going to be there for a little while, and to move from there.","Operator","We'll go to Alan Gould with Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Chase, on the digital side, can you -- it seems like News Corp. has been a little bit less vocal about TV Everywhere authentication. Can you give us your thoughts on that, and which of your programming or networks you're starting to either get paid for or negotiate for with TV Everywhere in authentication?","Chase Carey","I don't know [indiscernible] we haven't been less vocal about [indiscernible]. We think it's the right path. I mean, we think it's the right solution and it's -- there's no question. Yes, I think it's what the consumer wants, is that flexibility to get that content where they want and when they want. Obviously those become part of larger negotiations in many cases, but we think it's the right path for us and our distributors. We think it enables us to continue to grow this business in many ways. So every time somebody asks me about the costs, the cost of the content to a consumer, I say, I think one of the most important ways to address that is to continue to give consumers new things that excite them, that make it more valuable and make them appreciate it more. And I use my experience at DirecTV where I said I think realistically, I don't think in most cases costs -- I mean, obviously, they always care, but they really care about a quality experience, whether they're getting what they hoped, and things that excite them. If you really deliver on their expectations, I think the business has real -- I think we have an ability to continue to add dimensions to it. So we think it's the right path. We have to negotiate the appropriate agreements around it. And in some ways, I think we expressed our frustration that it hasn't moved faster. And in some ways, probably recognize the importance of doing some things, like standardizing and simplifying the experience. And if there's a question it's too complicated of an experience for consumers, it's too cumbersome an experience for consumers -- and I think we all can look at the simplicity of an iPad and realize how important it is to create an experience that 3- and 4-year-olds can figure out.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And if I can follow-up, when do you realistically expect to have some measurement on authentication? And is that an important milestone?","Chase Carey","You mean measure -- I'm not sure what you mean by measurement, though.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So you can measure your advertising, get paid on the advertising side of it?","Chase Carey","Well, we're certainly -- look, we're getting paid. I mean, we've got digital content. It is getting -- we're getting, I mean, we're getting value for advertising today. We started a year ago when we went into the upfront of being able to package part of our digital advertising with our traditional Television advertising. So we are measuring it today. Now some of that is sort of just digital sites, but it's going to be part of the whole digital experience. I don't think it's really -- I don't view that as sort of purely an authentication issue. I think I view that as digital, and some of that digital viewership will come through authenticated viewing, some of that will come through the experiences of the Hulu Pluses, the Hulus and other players then. But we are certainly well into trying to develop -- we don't have targeting. Clearly targeting and advertising broadly is an opportunity that's yet untapped, and I think one of the real opportunities for the business, I know the cable guys are investing in it. And I think that's important for all of us to figure out how do we take that pipe of targeted advertising to another level. But we certainly, we've been in it and developing it for the last year. And it's an important area of focus of growth for us.","Operator","We'll go to David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","2 questions. The first one is to help us kind of evaluate the scale and size of the international cable business. Could you give us a sense, on a pro-forma basis, for the fiscal year that just ended, including Fox Pan American Sports and STAR and all those things, what is the split in revenue and OI between international and domestic? And then if you can give us a sense for what you think that would be underlying your 2013 guidance? And the second question is, without addressing any specific partners, can you give us a sense of when you think about the guidance next year, does it anticipate any new additional players of scale coming into the digital distribution business that you're counting on revenues from? Or does it sort of anticipate the same basic playing field?","Chase Carey","No, well, on the latter question, I think it's Mark who asked earlier about where the upside, I think we touched on it there. I mean, we think there will be more activity, but we haven't really -- our guidance does not factor any big new player or something big happening. I think we've looked at it more as largely a continuation of the international side, again, that's had some activity growing into it. But I think we've guided it much more towards what we see today as opposed to trying to handicap what the new players do to it. I think that is an upside. I take it's much more of an upside than downplay. That is mostly upside opportunity for us, but we haven't factored in the numbers. And I think in terms of...","David F. DeVoe","Internationally, it's roughly 25% of the earnings we just reported. So it's 25% of revenues in earnings international. That's pretty broad, okay, so...","Chase Carey","And international said a different way, I mean, I think we said in the past, we expect the business in 2015 to be -- and this is excluding STAR, to be a $1 billion business. We're at -- and realistically we're ahead of that curve today. And then STAR would be on top of that. And STAR is certainly a significant additional component to the channel business internationally.","Operator","We go to Jason Bazinet with Citi Investment.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just have a quick question for Mr. DeVoe. I just want to confirm that the guidance that you laid out assumes that the offer for CMG does not go through, or, in other words, it's not in the guidance? And if that offer does go through, say, midyear, does that help your OI about 1% or 1.5%? Is that directionally about the right number, if you could give a calendar year close midyear fiscal?","David F. DeVoe","It's not included in our guidance. And depending on when it closes, it would help our OI. Obviously, part of that, at the moment, we pick up as equities on the sports business. So you're not too far off, actually, with this 1%.","Operator","We'll go to Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 quick ones. The first one, it sounds like the flat guidance for Publishing will be driven primarily by cost cuts rather than any stabilization in revenue. So is this the right way to think about this? And then my second question is, on education, when would this become a contributor to profits? Is this a 12- to 18-month thing or a 3-year initiative? And will costs ramp up over time, so we're looking beyond fiscal 2013, that $180 million may grow another $100 million each year?","Chase Carey","And I'll touch on the education, let Dave will touch on the Publishing. I think probably, really, the right way to give you some visibility because we haven't and it's a complex plan, is to have Joel Klein do it, which we're going to plan for this fall, and he can give you some visibility. I will say that the spending, we do look at probably 2013 as essentially being a peak year. But and it, from there, we start to develop the revenue side of it and really invest [indiscernible]. We still have significant investment in 2014, but '13 is probably the peak. And I think we will develop the revenue. I think Joe's better off to give a better sense of that, and a better sense of what the products and the plans are. Dave?","David F. DeVoe","Yes, [indiscernible], really, it's a combination of both. It's a combination of crosscuts, but it's also a combination of increases in revenue. We certainly expect our business in the U.K. to do significantly better in fiscal '13 than in did in fiscal '12.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin. Please go ahead.","Michael Florin","Thank you very much, Eduardo. Hello, everyone, and welcome to News Corp's Fiscal First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago, and it's now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We'll open with some prepared remarks, and then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community. ","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release. ","With that, I'll pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Mike. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, News Corp showed strong growth at Dow Jones and higher revenues at Move, operator of realtor.com. So the company also faced challenges from pronounced currency headwinds, a sluggish Australian economy, in particular, a struggling Australian property market, as well as difficult comparisons with the prior year onetime revenue item, a noncash impairment charge in this quarter. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $2.34 billion with total segment EBITDA of $221 million. This represents a decline of 7% in revenues and 38% in profitability versus the prior year. Of the revenue decline, 3% was directly attributable to currency and 2% to our onetime cash payment last year by Tabcorp in the U.K. ","Before getting into the final details of the quarter by segment, I want to address a significant development that bodes well for our future prospects. There has been a fundamental change in the content landscape. For over a decade, News Corp has led the international debate in seeking fair returns for our high-quality content from the digital platforms. Clearly, the dominant digital platforms are under intense and continuing regulatory scrutiny on issues such as privacy and an opaque advertising market. There has, however, been a substantial development with Facebook's decision to pay a significant premium for our premium journalism at the WSJ and beyond. This decision begins to change the content equation, and we expect a positive impact on financials at our News and Information Services segment over the long term, beginning this fiscal year. The Facebook deal complements the agreement we reached with Apple in March when The Wall Street Journal became a launch partner for Apple News+, which expanded the reach of The Journal and its journalism to new audiences. Our brands and our content obviously benefit from the marketing region prowess of a partner, which has nearly 189 million phones in the U.S. and 1.4 billion devices globally. ","We expect the sectoral shift in the value of digital content to have significant implications for our investors and our bottom line. And let us be clear, these unprecedented changes in the publishing industry would not have been achieved without the determination of Rupert and Lock and Murdoch and the unwavering support of the new score board, which has taken a long-term principal stand on the need to change the digital ecosystem. Other publishers around the world should feel free to send us a commission for services rendered. ","Another development worth highlighting is the ongoing simplification of News Corp. As you are aware, we have put our News America Marketing business under strategic review and are in discussions regarding a possible sale of that business. We expect to update you in due course. ","Consistent with that theme of simplification, we have our Unruly ad tech business under strategic view and are also in discussions about a potential sale. We have learned much from the very talented team at Unruly, and those lessons will inform our ad business for many, many years to come. With simplification being an ongoing process, the company will continue to review its structure with the aim of bringing extra focus to our key assets, allowing investors to have a far clear review of their prospects. ","Let me turn to the News and Information Services segment in which Dow Jones had a strong quarter with increased revenues and greater profitability year-over-year. Wall Street Journal subscriptions grew 8%, and we have crossed the 70% threshold for the number of digital-only subscribers. Important to note, we currently do not include readers of Apple News+ in that number. So it certainly does not fully capture the number of readers who are now paying for access to The Journal. ","Advertising revenue at Dow Jones grew 2% in the quarter and led notably by strong digital outperformance at wsj.com, which grew 13% as compared to a decline of the New York Times. We also saw stronger circulation revenue growth and increasing profitability as compared to the New York Times. Dow Jones Professional Information Business continue to thrive, with the burgeoning risk and compliance sector, in particular, growing 25% year-over-year. With many companies under intensifying regulatory scrutiny, the imperative to minimize risk and to maximize compliance remains a burgeoning source of business. Overall, our Professional Information Business represents a pronounced distinguishing advantage over media competitors and provides multiple opportunities for us to upsell specialist content to companies, professional investors and individual investors who actively manage their portfolio. ","Barron's group continued to report strong traffic growth in Q1, with total unique users up 27% year-over-year driven by MarketWatch and Barron's online. Barron's subscribers grew 7% to 587,000, while MarketWatch Q1 revenue was its strongest quarterly revenue performance ever. ","In the U.K., digital subscribers at The Times and Sunday Times grew 19% to 312,000. Advertising in local currency was up for the first time since Q3 of financial year '18 as digital growth more than offset modest print declines. Digital advertising growth of The Sun accelerated from the prior quarter rate and benefited from a growing audience and higher yield with approximately 129 global monthly unique users in September 2019. Meanwhile, at Wireless, the October radar results show that the reach of Wireless's stations grew 21% year-over-year with a 26% increase in listening hours. And propelled by Chris Evans joining the network, Virgin Radio experienced a 300% increase in reach and a 500% jump in listening hours. ","Meanwhile, talkSPORT had a 20% increase in digital listening, thanks in part to the new Premier League rights, which drive Saturday listening up 120% year-over-year. In Australia, there were harsh economic conditions that affected all of our businesses, including HarperCollins. In media, we continue to execute on our digital strategy with the mastheads reaching more than 542,000 digital subscribers, representing 23% year-over-year growth. At the Australian, 65% of subscribers were digital, showing that a subscription sensibility is indeed evolving and more people expect to pay more for digital products. Circulation revenue was also lifted by cover price increases at our metropolitan mastheads. We took the bold step of sharply increasing the cover price of the New York Post in June, and there has been a 12% year-over-year increase in circulation revenue. Advertising also rose at a similar rate. It is worth noting that more than 70% of The Post advertising revenues in the quarter were digital. ","Turning to subscription video services. Total subscribers at Foxtel grew 6% year-over-year despite the difficult conditions in Australia. The latest number of paying Kayo payer subscribers as of November 5 reached 402,000 with total subscribers at 443,000, and this is less than a year after its launch. With the Rugby World Cup ending last week, Kayo is now preparing for the seasonal shift to cricket and other summer sports in Australia. And Kayo customers continue to be highly engaged with over 75% of subscribers using the product each and every week. Kayo is a premium streaming service and shows that a far larger number of Australians are prepared to pay for content they had previously been presumed. Given that we have already acquired the sports rights, it's another important opportunity to monetize those rights without undermining the core. [Technical Difficulty] operator of realtor.com had a robust quarter, and we have reason to be optimistic over its prospects, thanks to signs of improving health in the U.S. housing market. Existing home sales are on the rise, and there has been rapid audience growth at realtor.com where there was an 18% year-over-year increase in traffic in the quarter. ","Based on the most recent comScore data, realtor's.com traffic is clearly going significantly faster than that of our nearest competitor. In addition, we are pleased with the ongoing integration of Opcity, a business that is helping realtor.com become even more connected to consumers and to REALTORS who are provided with higher quality refined leads that we expect to monetize in adjacencies such as mortgages. We are not entering the house flipping distressed sale business, but we want to offer vendors as many potential purchases as possible. The more competition for our house, the higher the price for the seller. While we have been in a period of reinvestment of Move due to the Opcity acquisition, we are seeing the benefits of that commitment with improving financials, and that will accelerate in the second half. ","For News Corp, as the year unfolds, the simplification of our structure will continue, and we expect to see further benefits from the shift in a balance of power between creators of content and the digital distributors. Investors in News Corp should be the beneficiaries of that fundamental transformation. ","And now for further insight, we will turn to Susan.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Turning to the financials. Fiscal 2020 first quarter total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, down 7% versus the prior year, and total segment EBITDA was $221 million, down 38% versus the prior year. The results were impacted by last year's onetime benefit related to the exit of the partnership for Sun Bets in the U.K., coupled with continued currency headwinds and challenging prior year comparisons at HarperCollins. ","On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues fell 4%, and total segment EBITDA decreased 30%. Net loss for the quarter was $211 million compared to net income of $128 million in the prior year, reflecting a $273 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily at News America Marketing. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $0.39 as compared to earnings per share of $0.17 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.17 in the prior year. ","Turning now to the individual operating segments. In News and Information Services, revenues for the quarter were over $1.1 billion, down approximately 8% versus the prior year. Currency had a $35 million or 3% negative impact. Digital revenues for Dow Jones and the newspaper mastheads represented 38% of the combined revenues. Approximately 34% of the segment's revenues were digital, up from 33% in the prior year, which included the onetime Tabcorp payment. Advertising revenues for the segment were down 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, with approximately $15 million or 3% due to negative currency fluctuations. Performance was stable versus the prior quarter rate. Improvements at Dow Jones and News U.K., absent currency impacts, were offset by declines at News America Marketing and News Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 1% versus the prior year despite a $15 million or 3% negative impact from foreign currency. Growth was again led by Dow Jones. ","Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $56 million, down from $109 million, with the decline due primarily to the absence of the net benefit related to the exit of the partnerships with Sun Bets in the U.K. last year. We reclassified approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 from the other segment to the News and Information Services segment. The costs are mainly related to initiatives, including News IQ, our global programmatic asset and some shared technology services to directly benefit the News and Information Services segment as part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our global scale to lower costs. ","I will now talk through some segment highlights. At Dow Jones, consumer circulation revenues in the first quarter remained very healthy, growing 6%, benefiting from 17% growth in digital-only paid subscribers at The Wall Street Journal to approximately 1.9 million as well as subscription price increases. Digital paid subscribers accounted for 71% of the total subscriber base at The Wall Street Journal, up from 65% last year. We see a big opportunity to scale The Wall Street Journal, both directly and through valuable third-party relationships, as Robert mentioned. As a result, we expect to see incremental revenues from these partnerships this year. Total subscribers in the quarter for Dow Jones consumer products, which also includes Barron's and financial news in the U.K., reached approximately 3.3 million, again posting record levels. Of that digital-only, subscribers rose 20% versus the prior year to almost 2.3 million subscribers. ","We remain optimistic about our Professional Information Business, which accounted for 29% of Dow Jones revenues this quarter. The key growth engine continues to be in Risk and Compliance, which accelerated its revenue growth to 25% in the quarter compared to the prior quarter. Overall, our Professional Information Business grew a robust 8% this quarter. Advertising revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter rose 2%, an improvement from the fiscal fourth quarter rate. It's led by digital growth with a relatively stable print performance. Digital advertising accounted for 42% of total Dow Jones advertising compared to 37% last year. ","We continue to balance healthy revenue growth at Dow Jones with reinvestment, which is leading to ongoing profit growth. Elsewhere across our news portfolio, advertising conditions were mixed. News UK's advertising revenues were flat on a reported basis and up 6% in local currency, representing the first year-over-year increase in local currencies since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The U.K. showed notable growth in digital, particularly at The Sun, which is growing in both audience and engagement. ","Advertising conditions in Australia were more challenged, notably in print, with advertising revenues down 13% on a reported basis and down 8% in local currency. Digital growth helped mitigate print declines with continued growth from music stand, small medium business initiatives and news.com.au.","On circulation, our digital paid subscribers again grew at an impressive rate. Digital subscribers rose 19% at The Times and The Sunday Times and 22% at News Australia. The increase in digital subscribers, along with cover price increases at both News UK and News Australia, helped mitigate print volume declines and currency headwinds. Finally, at News America Marketing, revenues fell 10% driven by weakness in freestanding insert products given the ongoing digital migration, but partially offset by growth in in-store product revenue, which accounted for roughly half of the overall revenue. ","Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $514 million, down 9% versus $565 million in the prior year, of which $34 million or 6% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. Broadcast revenue trends were relatively similar to the prior quarter, with the revenue decline driven by a lower broadcast subscriber base and changes to the broadcast subscriber package mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from Kayo and Foxtel Now. Importantly, as we look at a core driver of the business, TV subscription revenue, which includes both broadcast and OTT revenue, excluding the impact of currency, revenue growth from OTT products almost offset broadcast declines in the quarter, which will be key to the stability of the business. ","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $81 million, down 28% with the prior year, which, in addition to the revenue trends, was also impacted by $16 million of costs related to domestic cricket rights, which we didn't have in the prior year and $14 million related to the noncash accelerated amortization of certain of our entertaining -- entertainment programming costs, as we highlighted last quarter. We continue to expect approximately $30 million to $35 million impact from the accelerated amortization for the full year with a greater impact in the first half of the year. ","Other costs notably in overheads were lower this quarter as the team is focused on rightsizing the cost base. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 20% lower than the prior year and for the cash flow generation to improve. ","Turning to the KPIs. Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base was approximately 3.1 million as of September 30, with volume growing 6% versus the prior year driven by the launch of Kayo last November. Of that subscriber base, over 2.3 million of the total closing subscribers were broadcast and commercial subscribers, and the remainder consisted of Kayo and Foxtel Now. Kayo paying subscribers grew to 364,000, up from 331,000 last quarter or 12% of the total Foxtel subscriber base, including trial list Kayo rose 430,000 subscribers. We are seeing that customer activations are more pronounced around big events. The first quarter had less exclusive content, particularly following the Cricket World Cup, but we have seen notably stronger ads with the start of the Rugby World Cup, which began in late September. As of November 5, Kayo paying subscribers have increased to approximately 402,000. ","We continue to see that Kayo subscribers are incremental to the subscriber base with very little cannibalization from the core broadcast business. Paying subscribers for Foxtel Now were approximately 375,000, down from 446,000 last quarter following the conclusion of the Game of Thrones, but still up from the prior year and have seen an improvement in ARPU from both the last quarter and the prior year. In addition, Foxtel is also planning a new entertainment product, which will leverage the Kayo platform with the commercial launch anticipated later in this fiscal year. ","In the first quarter, broadcast churn was 14.4% versus 12.9% in the prior year, but down from 14.7% in Q4, reflecting continued focus on churn management in the Foxtel direct channel and higher penetration of the iQ4 set-top boxes. ","As a reminder, lower ARPU customers on expiring contracts from the past 12 to 24 months compounded by a price rise is resulting in higher churn versus the prior year. Churn from platinum and sports teams remain materially lower than the base. ","Broadcast ARPU grew 2% to about AUD 78 per month. We expect to complete the refinancing of a significant portion of Foxtel debt in the coming weeks, which will include a package of bank refinancing, third-party financing and additional shareholder funding. As part of the refinancing, News Corp has contributed an additional AUD 200 million loan, and the new financing that will extend maturities for at least 3 years and, importantly, provide Foxtel with ample liquidity and flexibility to execute on its strategy. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins faced an unusually difficult comparison to the prior year due to the success of Rachel Hollis' Girl, Wash Your Face, Angie Thoma's The Hate U Give and Mark Manson's Subtle Art. As a result, revenues for the quarter fell 3% to $405 million and segment EBITDA fell to $49 million. ","Notable releases this quarter include Daniel Silva's New Girl, Ann Patchett's, The Dutch House, Karin Slaughter's The Last Widow, Demi Moore's Inside Out and Ant Middleton's The Fear Bubble. Digital revenues declined 5% and represented 20% -- 22% of consumer revenues also impacted by the year ago comparison. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, revenues were down 7% to $272 million, of which $10 million or 3% was due to the negative impact from foreign currency. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined 5%. REA Group revenues were down 14% and down 8% in local currency as higher yield and improved product mix was more than offset by an overall 15% year-over-year decline in new listing volume during the quarter. Developer revenues were also down on the back of a 26% decline in new project development. Revenue decline was also impacted by the extended duration of premier all listings from 45 to 60 days, which increased the revenue deferral for the period. ","Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call that just concluded for additional details and comments on the outlook. Group revenues rose 4% to $123 million versus the prior year, with real estate revenues growing 11%, which is an improvement from the fourth quarter rate. The increase in real estate revenues, which represented 80% of total revenues, was led by a higher contribution from Opcity, combined with an improvement in lead volume and audience. This is in the context of the U.S. housing market showing signs of improvement, with existing home sales up low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year. ","As I mentioned last quarter, we began live testing a performance-based-only model in over a dozen markets starting on May 1 to analyze the impact and scalability of the platform. The test also allows us to better control the consumer experience and the transaction. Although it is still relatively early in the testing, every single one of the core metrics has gone up materially. Leads, meeting rates, home values and close rates are all trending in the right direction. We are very encouraged by the results and have continued to allocate more leads to the Opcity model, which will allow greater opportunities to further extend into ancillary revenues. On audience, we saw an acceleration in audience growth versus the fourth quarter growth rate with average monthly unique users at realtor.com reaching over 71 million, rising 18% versus the prior year, together with a notable pickup in both page views and time spent. Segment EBITDA fell 22% to $82 million due to REA revenue declines and investment at Move due to Opcity. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined just 2%. ","Other costs increased to $47 million from $37 million. The majority of the increase is related to higher equity comp due to the performance, existing schemes and the stock appreciation since the grant date as well as the phasing of certain strategic initiatives. Most importantly, we do not expect this increase to be reflective of the full year. ","I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter. In News and Information services, advertising trends thus far remains similar to the prior quarter levels, although visibility remains limited. We continue to seek cost efficiencies, particularly in both the U.K. and Australia. Comparisons should ease now that we have moved past the Sun Bets benefit, and we expect to show improvements, particularly at our news brands. ","In Subscription Video Services, we will anniversary the acquisition of the domestic cricket rights, and cost trends should be more favorable. We will also lap the price increase from October last year. In Book Publishing, as Robert mentioned, we're excited about the recent launch of Ree Drummond's Pioneer Woman The New Frontier, although we'll continue to face difficult comparisons as the prior year included Joanna Gaine's Homebody and strong backlist sales. Given the timing of the release schedule, we expect performance will be more second half weighted. ","At Digital Real Estate Services, we anticipate improvements at Move as we lap the Opcity acquisition, particularly in the second half. As noted on their release, REA expects revenue growth to be skewed towards the second half of the fiscal year. Please see the release for more detail. ","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. I'll take our first question from Kane Hannan at Goldman Sachs.","Kane Hannan","Just at Dow Jones revenue growth of 6%., can you give a bit more color around the level of cost growth during the quarter to drive that growth? And then I suppose, some comments around the revenue quantum we should be expecting from those digital partnerships this year, sort of next year? I -- should we expect them to be material?","Robert Thomson","Well, look, I'll take the second part of the question first, Kane. The Facebook deal is a big deal. It establishes a clear precedent of paying a premium for premium journalism. And there are a couple of other initiatives that are notable. When you click on a headline in the Facebook News tab, you'll be taken to our site. So the story is not hosted by Facebook. And that means that we're able to sell advertising directly, and we'll have a more lucrative flow of permission data. And these were all essential preconditions for our ascent and our agreement, and will have a long-term benefit on our accounts. ","The fact is that there'll be less providence if there's not a premium for Providence. And it's frankly clear that the revenue show flow had shifted dramatically from the creators to the distributors. So for us, there are -- commercially, there are 2 things that are meaningful and absolutely essential. Firstly, development of a subscription sensibility. There has to be more of a propensity to pay. Thankfully, Facebook understood that priority. Secondly, the digital advertising market is dysfunctional. The so-called open market is a virtual monopoly. We've been very public about our concerns on that segment, which is in dire need of reform, and is thankfully now under close scrutiny by 50 U.S. attorneys general.","Susan Panuccio","And Kane, just in relation to the costs, we saw about a 4% increase in cost for the quarter for Dow Jones. So you should use that number as your proxy.","Michael Florin","Eduardo, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll now take the next question from Eric Pan at JPMorgan.","Eric Pan","You mentioned in your comments, you're bringing extra focus on your key assets. And given the proposed sale of NAM, how should we think about the company's overall strategy going forward? Are you looking to unlock the value of the assets via monetization? Or could you be looking to beef up your existing businesses with acquisitions?","Robert Thomson","Eric, simplification is indeed an ongoing process, and it doesn't stop at News America Marketing and Unruly. But we're very cognizant that the company trades at a discounted to some of the parts. We're seeking to rectify that situation and maximize value for all our shareholders. So it's fair to say that the institutional introspection will continue apace.","Michael Florin","Eduardo, we'll take our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Entcho Raykovski","Robert. Just a couple from me related to SVs. And just firstly, Susan, wanted to clarify your comments around the next quarter. You said you've lapped the increase seen in domestic cricket rights, so should we expect any increase in the cost of the cricket heading into Q2? And then just secondly, your commentary around the launch of an entertainment-only offering in SVOD. Do you expect any additional costs associated with that offering? Or do you think that you can pretty effectively utilize your existing rights and offer streaming products? And then just related to that, sorry, to kind of carry on with this. But just your rationale for it given that it feels like it is a pretty crowded space in streaming services in Australia?","Susan Panuccio","I'll take maybe the first two, and Robert can take the last one Entcho, if that's okay. So just in relation to cricket, we would expect to see very, very modest increases over the course of the year. So the bulk of those costs have come through in Q1. But I think it's important to note when we think about the cost base, the largest increase that's come through is because of the noncash amortization in relation to those entertainment expenses. So over the full year, absent those costs, we would expect the whole cost base to be relatively stable. But it is important to note that the team down in Australia are continuing to focus on rightsizing their cost base and are continuing to look for opportunities as they move forward. ","In relation to Aeries [ph], we are looking to launch that towards the back half of this particular fiscal year. We're not expecting to see significant incremental costs to your point. We do have a lot of the content covered within existing deals. We will, of course, have marketing costs as we scale up that product, but the actual incremental cost that we'd expect to see within the year is going to be minimal.","Robert Thomson","And if I could just supplement Susan's comments. And it will obviously be based on the Kayo distribution platform. So much of the engineering there has already been done. And I think when you speak of streaming, this salient point to note about Foxtel is the rapid growth of Kayo from nothing a year ago to 402,000 paying customers now and another 443,000 in total. And this is not a service that cost $6.99 a month. It's $25 a month. And given the view of feedback and satisfaction, there's obviously some longer-term elasticity in that price. And when you see the sluggishness in the Australian economy in advertising and real estate, which has obviously had an impact on our earnings, the results are even more impressive.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Entcho. Eduardo, we'll take our next question, please.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners. All right. We'll now take our last question from Fraser Mcleish at MSC [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Robert, I'm just interested in your comments upfront that you were talking about giving us a clear view of the assets and the value, you're willing to just give us a little bit more insight to what you mean there. I assume you're talking about The Wall Street Journal and timing of that. I mean do we now have to wait until the next financial year for that? And that's my first question. And then just secondly, just on Move, which the margins -- you've got to do a little bit of work obviously to back them out because you don't report them, but look later around about that sort of 10% level and have sort of been stubbornly at that level for a little while. Is it structurally just a low-margin industry in the U.S. because they're obviously very low margins relative to similar businesses around the world? Or do you think you can really see some margin improvement there over the next few years?","Robert Thomson","On your first question, we really can't go into detail about what simplification means in the longer term. What it does mean at the moment is News America Marketing and Unruly, which are under strategic review. But as I said, that strategic review does not stop with those 2 properties, and we are very conscious of the need to highlight the value of the company and provide more transparency for investors. As for Move, both short, medium and long term, we believe that realtor.com is a tremendous property. You could see that the growth in audience is far superior to that at Zillow at the moment. If you take the independent comScore figures from September, the unique users at realtor.com were up 17%, while Zillow grew at only 2%. And Trulia actually shrank by 2%. And the divergence was even more marked on desktop with 10% of growth at realtor and Zillow, down by 12% year-on-year. We're at a very early stage of the evolution of the digital real estate market in the United States. And we think as it evolves, those margins will surely increase.","Susan Panuccio","And Fraser, I think I'll just add to that, that part of the reason and the rationale for acquiring Opcity was to accelerate that revenue growth going forward and provide an opportunity for margin expansion via ancillary revenues and different services. And so we would expect to see for the balance of this year and over the full year that revenue and EBITDA will continue to grow within that business.","Michael Florin","Thanks, Fraser. Eduardo, we'll take our next question.","Operator","All right, we'll now take the next question from Craig Huber at Huber Research Partners once again.","Craig Huber","Yes. Can you hear me this time?","Susan Panuccio","We can hear you.","Robert Thomson","Yes, we can hear you. Loud and clear, Craig.","Craig Huber","I have no idea what happened there. Look, I have two questions. Housekeeping question, circulation revenue across Dow Jones, Australia and the U.K. with and without currency. Did you give that? Maybe I missed it, but that's my first question. And my second question, Robert, you mentioned, I think a lot of people agree with you on this, that there's two large monopolies out there on the digital advertising front. I'd like to hear from you if you could just expand upon this, what do you think the solution is on that front?","Susan Panuccio","Craig, just in relation to your housekeeping question. So circulation at Dow Jones was up 6%. In the U.K., it was flat. But in reported numbers, down 5%. And in Australia, it was down 2% in local currency; reported, down 8%.","Robert Thomson","Craig, obviously, the tech topography is evolving very quickly. If you think back even 12 months ago, the prospects of Facebook paying for content, a carriage fee, as we called it, in fact, Rupert was the first to cite that as a need, the prospects seem remote. It's now real. And what we're finding generally in our discussion with the digital platforms is that, that they have indeed adopted a new approach. They realize that for various reasons that their past policies were unsustainable. But as I made clear to you, it's not just about paying a premium for premium journalism. It is also about sorting out what is an opaque advertising market, and there's no doubt that the regulatory pressure in that area is only going to increase. And a consequence of that, well, I suspect, be that as we're already seeing, more advertisers understand how dysfunctional that market is and seek association with high-quality content, and we will undoubtedly be a beneficiary of that given the excellent journalism that we have, not only in this country, but around the world.","Michael Florin","Thank you, Craig. Eduardo, we'll take our next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Michael Florin for any additional closing remarks.","Michael Florin","Great. Thank you, Eduardo, and thank you for all participating. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day.","Operator","This now concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. "],"15748":["News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWSA) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call August  9, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Florin - Senior Vice President and Head, Investor Relations","Robert Thomson - Chief Executive Officer","Susan Panuccio - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Kane Hannan - Goldman Sachs","Eric Pan - JPMorgan","Brian Han - Morningstar","Raymond Tong - Evans and Partners","Craig Huber - Huber Research Partners","Andy Levy - Macquarie Securities","Operator","Good day and welcome to News Corp 4Q FY 2018 Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And as a reminder, all media is invited on a listen-only basis. At this time, I would like to turn today\u2019s conference call over to Mike Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Mike Florin","Thank you very much, Carrie. Hello, everyone and welcome to News Corp\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about an hour ago and it\u2019s now posted on our website at newscorp.com.","On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and then we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in our earnings release.","With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.","Robert Thomson","Thanks Mike. These are certainly uncertain times for some media companies, including social media companies. So, it is quite significant that during fiscal 2018, News Corp grew revenues and total segment EBITDA and was an influential voice of reason and reform in a sector that is evolving, but remains in need of sound change. When the new News Corp was launched 5 years ago, we promised to be relentlessly digital and global and that we would remain faithful to the principles and the values inherited from the founding company. It was also crucial for our shareholders that we become more than the sum of our partners. And while we ardently believe there is much toil head, we are confident that closer integration between and among our companies is helping us realize that potential.","Our news mastheads and digital property sites continue to work closely to drive valuable audience and traffic and while our higher quality journalism is crucial to the burgeoning of Storyful and to the exponential expansion of Mansion Global. These are not just contrived concepts, but measurable outcomes and our full year numbers provide hard evidence of the company\u2019s successful evolution. This past year, as a result of the transformative combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and muscular performances of book publishing, digital real estate services, the new News Corp. crossed the $1 billion threshold in profitability. And for the fourth quarter, both revenues and EBITDA were distinctly high compared to the previous year.","Meanwhile, constructive conversations are underway with Google, YouTube and Facebook to recognize provenance, contract, piracy, and share the permission data that was generated by our journalism and our creative work. We sense that these companies are conscious, but the editorial ecosystem is changing and that IP is a priority, while piracy and pedantry are anathema to the growth of a healthy and harmonious community. We are watching closely as Amazon, a dominant horizontal platform, expands into more verticals, bringing in the possibility of algorithmic abuse. We are reassured that the dominant algorithms are under increasingly close scrutiny internationally. Thankfully, the credulous have been succeeded by the sedulous.","One important development reflected in the most recent quarter is the combination of Foxtel and Fox Sports strategy. We now control the combined company and with the enhanced structure and a new leadership team in place, the combined business obviously increases the share of subscription revenues. At the time of our separation, almost half of News Corp. revenues came from advertising. Today, our revenues from advertising for the year accounted for less than a third of the half. In fact, this quarter, subscription and other non-advertising revenues now exceeded 70% giving News Corp, a healthy foundation for growth in an age, in which subscription is increasingly important for revenues and for a deeper relationship with customers.","The new Foxtel will also work much more closely with our mastheads, which we expect to become an important marketing platform for subscribers. I was in Australia in recent days and its patent that there is a renewed vigor, creativity and customer consciousness at the company. We have traditionally suffered from a positive summer sports offerings, but the securing of rights from Cricket Australia for 6 years and the launch of a dedicated cricket channel mean that we will have a year-round offering for the first time and believe that seasonal customer churn will decline. Our mastheads will certainly play a crucial role in complementing our broadcast platform in the pursuit of cricket victories.","For Foxtel, we are confident that the current phase of investment in rights and technology should drive increased subscriptions and value for our investments. The new team is acutely aware of the importance of improving the user interface and customer service and the need to innovate such as the introduction of an over-the-top streaming service later this year to give more Australians easier access to premium sports. We indicated our plans for an IPO when we announced the combining of Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and that continues to be our goal. In using information services, you are able to offset print advertising declines through our expanding digital revenues. We have seen notable success in subscriber growth at Dow Jones, which crossed the 3 million subscriber mark in June, with digital accounting for more than 60% of the Wall Street Journal subscribers.","Also, at The Australian, The Times and The Sunday Times, digital subscribers are now more than half of the total subscriber base. Notably, at The Times and Sunday Times, we supposed 500,000 total subscribers in June. Meanwhile, according to ComScore, in May, Sun Online topped Mail Online in the UK in unique visitors. It is no coincidence that such growth in readership comes alongside independent research highlighting the trustworthiness of the Times of London and the Wall Street Journal. In an era in which veracity is a particular virtue and hyperbole is no longer hip, we are proud to have the most trusted news brands around the world. These brands offer increasingly important venues for advertisers who want their reputation burnished, not tarnished. It is thus unsurprising that The Sun and The Times grew their full year ad revenues for the first time in 7 years.","Wallace Group saw another strong set of audience figures this quarter, with the listening hours at our UK stations up 14% versus the prior year based on the latest industry data outpacing the overall market. And revenues in the most recent quarter rose significantly, thanks in part to England serendipitous success of the World Cup, but also because of the marketing prowess of our UK and digital platforms.","At Dow Jones, fiscal year circulation revenues grew 10%, largely due to digital subscriber growth at the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, there was a solid 7% increase in full year revenues at the professional information business, which is the largest year-on-year jump in their annual revenues since the creation of the new news. It was a particularly pleasing performance in risk and compliance as companies recognized the importance of Dow Jones\u2019 insight and the intelligence in areas crucial to the health of the business. The Dow Jones team is also working closely with the team at Storyful, because unique understanding of social media around the world is crucial for companies seeking to avoid reputational roadkill.","The New York Post is gathering momentum in a tough turbulent market and is the standout performer in Greater New York, where its positive influence is matched by a positive audience response. The Post digital network, including pagesix.com, had 101 million unique visitors in June, up 51% on the previous year. Clearly, that growth is far superior to that of the New York Times and the struggling Daily News. The Wall Street Journal also added more digital subscribers and had significantly higher circulation revenue growth this quarter than the New York Times.","In Australia, digital subscriber growth continue to pace. While our team addresses the cost base to stabilize and strengthen the business, the results of that vigilance were reflected in a positive segment EBITDA contribution for the year and a platform for future growth. Cost savings and potential partnerships with traditional rivals around the world such as Fairfax in Australia and a plethora of publishers in the UK have become possible as the media landscape has changed dramatically, but we will never enter into agreements that undermine the essential character of commercial purpose and social role of their publications.","As for book publishing, our team at HarperCollins, through their expert discovery of great authors and empathetic curating of manuscripts and clever marketing campaigns ensured strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That success was reflected in the popularity of its frontlist titles and in the effective leveraging of its substantial backlist. One benefit of that backlist was a $28 million in revenues coming from the sublicensing deals involving JRR Tolkien\u2019s works. As Gandalf observed, perhaps with Chief Executives and investors almost in mind, all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. HarperCollins also saw continued growth in its digital revenues, thanks to the rising popularity of downloadable audio and we had substantial success in financial \u201818 with the strong sales of the best-selling, The Subtle Art of Not Giving an Expletive and from Joanne Gaines\u2019 Magnolia Table, which according to BookScan, is the fastest selling U.S. cookbook in history. In children\u2019s books, we had particular success with The Hate U Give, which you will see in the theaters later this year as a film from 20th Century Fox.","Now, we come to our fastest growing segment, digital real estate services, which has been a particular priority since the formation of the new news. Overall, digital real estate services segment revenues rose 22% and segment EBITDA rose 24% for the year. We have become the most global digital property company. And we certainly still have the potential for rapid growth without alienating realtors by becoming hot to trot house-livers. At Move, home of realtor.com, core real estate revenues for fiscal \u201818 grew 20%, with total revenues up a healthy 15% for the year. Realtor.com continued to show strong audience gains and maintained its lead tangibly with 1.5x higher engagement compared to its nearest competitor.","We are continuously working to improve returns for realtors and enhance experience for customers. It is worth noting that realtor.com has nearly doubled its revenue since the acquisition by News Corp less than 4 years ago. We believe that our largest investment since the split, which has been quite lucrative and transforming is undervalued by Wall Street given realtor.com significant revenue expansion, impressive increase in audience, and the value of its peers in the digital real estate sector. We remain committed to users of the site who are making an important investment for their families and to realtors whom we have no intention of usurping unlike certain other companies.","Meanwhile, in Australia, REA continued to be an industry leader in both audience and innovation expanding into adjacencies like the mortgage broker business, which has quickly gained traction with 350,000 self completed financial profiles as of June 30. At the close of this fiscal year, 5 years since our rebirth as a company, we are proud to have leaders and creators so strong, passionate and purposeful and numbers so self evidently robust and a future that holds much promise for growth in audience, revenue and profit. Behind the impressive results are the people of News Corp, who serve our readers, members, audiences and advertisers, all have contributed to our success this year and over the past 5 years and have laid the foundations for a particularly prosperous and a fecund future for our investors.","With that, I will turn the microphone over to Susan Panuccio.","Susan Panuccio","Thank you, Robert. Before I review the financial results, I wanted to highlight five themes from this past year and the quarter, where we have made significant progress. We have taken steps to stabilize the News and Information Services segment and this year showed tangible improvement through a combination of cost initiatives and digital investments. We are seeing strong digital paid subscriber growth across many of our key properties, where digital subscribers now exceed print.","Revenues were stable for the quarter and the fiscal year and the segment EBITDA reflected moderation in declines, a material improvement from recent trends. In addition, we continued to focus on potential industry solutions, which include our recently announced printing agreement with Fairfax in Australia. We have focused on strengthening our digital real estate services platform this year, which we have done by expanding into relevant adjacencies, investing in new businesses and products and growing our core audiences. This segment was our biggest EBITDA contributor and annual revenues now exceed well over $1 billion and have more than tripled separation.","The performance at our book publishing segment this year underscores the value of premium content in global scale pasting record revenues since the company separated. We completed the Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia combination, which gives operational control to News Corp, reshapes our revenue base and provides more flexibility for News Corp moving forward and we continue to actively look at our portfolio. This year, we sold several non-core investments, including our stake in SEEK Asia and magazines in Australia and continue to evaluate our options with respect to our regional and community newspapers.","With that, I would now like to discuss our financial results. For the full year fiscal 2018, total revenues were over $9 billion, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. This includes the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestments and currency fluctuations as disclosed in the press release, revenues rose 2%. Reported total segment EBITDA for the year was nearly $1.1 billion compared to $885 million in the prior year, a 21% increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the year, which excludes the Foxtel impact and other items as disclosed in the press release, rose 6%.","During the full year, we had several non-recurring items impacting EPS. Those items included pre-tax non-cash write-downs of $1.2 billion primarily related to Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia and use American marketing, which we reported in the third quarter and a $237 million charge reflecting certain one-time adjustments as a consequence of the U.S. Tax Act. Finally, the fourth quarter included a loss of $337 million related to the Foxtel transaction, primarily resulting from the write-off of the Fox Sports Australia channel distribution agreement as a result of the transaction, which is reflected under other net. Reported EPS from continuing operations were negative $2.60 compared to negative $1.27 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.44 versus $0.36 in the prior year.","And now to the quarterly financial data, we reported fiscal 2018 fourth quarter total revenues of $2.7 billion, up 29% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis which excludes the impact of the Foxtel consolidation and the other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 5%. Reported total segment EBITDA was $312 million compared to $215 million in the prior year. Adjusted segment EBITDA, which excludes the Foxtel in fact rose 13%. For the quarter, our reported EPS were negative $0.64 compared to negative $0.74 a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations were $0.08 versus $0.11 in the prior year.","Turning now to the individual operating segments. In news and information services, revenues for the quarter were $1.3 billion and rose 1% versus the prior year. Within segment revenues, advertising revenues were down 2% and circulation and subscription revenues increased 5% with foreign currency benefiting advertising by 1% and circulation and subscription revenues by 2%. Within the segment reported revenues at Dow Jones rose 3%, News UK rose 4%, News Australia declined 3% and News American marketing fell 2%. News and information services segment EBITDA this quarter was $94 million, down 9% versus the prior year, which is a notable improvement on the declines we experienced in the third quarter.","There are few highlights, which I would like to mention from a segment. We again saw strong digital subscriber growth across our news businesses. At Dow Jones, circulation revenues grew 9% and at the Wall Street Journal, they grew 10% benefiting from strong growth in the Wall Street Journal digital-only subscribers, which were up 25% year-over-year and up 7% versus our fiscal third quarter. In addition, we again saw healthy year-over-year digital subscription growth at The Times and The Sunday Times up 27% and also at News Australia, up 14%. The Professional Information Business, or PIB, at Dow Jones posted 6% revenue growth, led again by risk and compliance, which grew 35% in the quarter versus the prior year and as expected exceeded $100 million in total sales this year. We remain very encouraged by the pipeline and trajectory of growth. Just to frame the size, our PIB products in fiscal 2018 generated 27% of Dow Jones revenues.","Fourth quarter advertising trends across our news portfolio improved modestly from the fiscal third quarter rate, the UK was again a solid performer, with advertising up 6% versus the prior year or flat in local currency led by digital advertising growth and higher year-on-year performances at both The Sun and The Times. News Australia advertising declined 6% versus the prior year in reported and local currency showing further moderation as print advertising declined.","Dow Jones advertising was down 10%, also reflecting an improvement in print declines at the Wall Street Journal. The closure of the Wall Street Journal international print editions in Q2 impacted Dow Jones advertising revenues by $5 million accounting for nearly half of the advertising declines this quarter. We remain very focused on cost initiatives, particularly at News Australia. While much work is due to be done, pleasingly News Australia showed some stability and profitability, helped by ongoing cost initiatives, which have exceeded our initial expectations and also higher digital revenues.","As we mentioned last quarter, we have been working with industry participants about potentially shaping or sharing printing and distribution facilities to drive further operating efficiencies across our key markets. News Corp Australia entered into a commercial printing arrangement with Fairfax Media to provide printing services in New South Wales and Queensland. We expect to realize approximately AUD10 million of cost savings on an annualized basis from this agreement and continue to explore other opportunities to increase efficiencies. Finally, News America marketing revenues were relatively stable as weakness in inset products were mostly offset by mid single-digit growth in in-store advertising products. Profit contribution improved due to effective cost management.","Turning to our book publishing segments, we posted very solid quarter driven by strong frontlist and backlist performances, combined with the contribution from the previously announced sublicensing agreement of Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings Trilogy with Amazon. Revenues for the quarter increased approximately 20% to $490 million and segment EBITDA increased 82% to $71 million. The Tolkien agreement, which highlights the value of intellectual property impacted revenues by $28 million or 7%. This quarter also benefited from several successful new releases, including Magnolia Table by Joanna Gaines, I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara and Girl Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis, as well as the continued strength of backlist titles such as The Subtle Art by Mark Manson. Overall, the backlist contributed approximately 49% of consumer revenues in the quarter, down 54% last year. While revenue this quarter was driven by the success of the frontlist, backlist revenue still grew at a healthy rate on an absolute basis.","Total digital revenues for the quarter grew 12%, the highest growth in recent periods due to the strength of the downloadable audio books and represented 20% of consumer revenues in line with the prior year. In the digital real estate services segment, revenues increased 19% to $299 million. Reported segment EBITDA was up 14% to $99 million. REA Group revenues grew 27% due to very strong residential depth revenue growth in Australia, including higher penetration for Premier Oil and increased yield, the integration of the Smartline acquisition and benefit from currency. Revenue growth was partially offset by lower listing volume. As always, please refer to REA\u2019s earnings release in their conference call which will commence shortly after this call for additional details.","News revenues rose 11% to $120 million versus the prior year driven by continued success of its Connections for Buyers product. Connections for Buyers benefited from higher customer flow and yield as well as increased lead volume albeit at a slower pace in the prior year. Core real estate revenues, which includes listing and lead-based products, grew 17%. As I mentioned last quarter, we have been reducing our non-listing advertising modes as part of the site redesign, initially within select market to improve engagement and lead volume with encouraging early signs. Average monthly unique users at realtor.com were approximately 63 million for the quarter rising 9% versus the prior year. As expected, Move\u2019s expenses were higher this quarter due to planned brand marketing and traffic acquisition cost to drive revenue growth and partly to increase our traction in New York City. We are also re-branding our core suite of professional services and tools ahead of the commercial launch in the coming months.","Turning to subscription video services, which include the newly combined Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia businesses and Sky News, you will see that we have attached the press release, the pro forma statements for the past few years. Revenues were $610 million versus $140 million a year ago on a pro forma basis reflecting the Foxtel transaction last year\u2019s revenues were $643 million. Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $97 versus $24 million in the prior year. As I alluded to last quarter, reported results for the segment includes one-time transaction cost of $12 million. On a pro forma basis, segment EBITDA declined to $109 million from $178 million in the prior year, primarily due to the revenue impact I just noted, higher programming costs, which reflect increased NRL and FSA rights cost as well as $10 million of transition cost.","On operating metrics, Foxtel\u2019s total closing subscribers were over 2.8 million as of June 30, up nearly 2% versus the prior year and prior quarter driven by Foxtel Now subscriptions offset by lower cable and satellite subscribers and the termination of the wind down of the TV box subscribers. In the fourth quarter, cable and satellite residential churn was 12.5%, down from the 13.3% and ARPU was down 3% to AUD80 per month. In the segment, subscription revenues totaled $523 million for the quarter, accounting for over 85% of segment revenues. Subscription revenues were down 4% year-on-year on a pro forma basis resulting from the subscriber mix.","Advertising revenues totaled $67 million for the quarter accounting for over 10% of segment revenues. Advertising was down 12% year-on-year on a pro forma basis primarily due to lower advertising at the Foxtel Network channels. As I mentioned last quarter, there will be some short-term reinvestment required at Foxtel to drive volume and improve the subscriber trajectory. I will briefly describe what these are.","Firstly, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we will start to incur the cost associated with the recently acquired Cricket Australia rights. We also faced full year of NRL costs related to the step up from the new rights contract which will likely be in the region of AUD20 million or $15 million. Secondly, we anticipate the launch of an IP-only sports offering in the second quarter and are also actively considering other non-sports IP-only products targeted at specific demographics. Thirdly, the incremental depreciation and amortization as a consequence of the consolidation was approximately $75 million in the quarter. Finally, our full year results include approximately $60 million of CapEx related to the consolidation of Foxtel in the fourth quarter.","For fiscal 2018, Foxtel CapEx was approximately $285 million. At this point, we expect Foxtel\u2019s fiscal 2019 CapEx to increase by at least $50 million to reflect expenditures related to high penetration of next-generation set-top boxes, including 4K upgrade and some additional project spend relating to improving its IP platform. It is important to note that a significant amount of Foxtel\u2019s CapEx is subscriber related, which includes set-top-boxes and capitalized installation cost and will be driven by sales volume. As Robert mentioned, our goal continues to be driving towards an IPO and believe that improving subscription volumes will be key to our long-term value creation. Over-the-top will be a key growth initiative and our goal will be to maintain the broadcast subscriber base and manage churn effectively.","Finally, I would like to mention a few other themes as we enter into fiscal 2019. At news and information services, while pre-advertising trends continue downwards, they have been relatively stable, but visibility remains limited. As a consequence, we are very focused on driving higher penetration of digital paid subscription rolling out new digital advertising solutions and delivering ongoing cost initiatives, particularly in Australia and at News UK. The segment achieved some stability this year and we remain focused on continued improvement.","At subscription video services, we expect reinvestment this year as I mentioned focusing on launching new OTT products, 4K, the next generation of the IQ Box and managing our valuable broadcast base. In book publishing, overall, we are very pleased with the performance of HarperCollins. Underlying trends seem relatively stable and we remain focused on expanding our foreign language penetration. We will cycle some challenging comparisons in the coming year that we are excited about our new releases, including the recent release of Daniel Silva\u2019s, The Other Woman and the November release of Home Body by Joanne Gaines. At digital real estate services, we expect continued revenue growth at both REA and Move and for the segment to continue to play an important role in our revenue and EBITDA mix.","With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kane Hannan with Goldman Sachs.","Kane Hannan","Good morning, Robert and Susan. Just on the Foxtel that you mentioned, could you just comment on what you say is I suppose the key hurdles this business would need to achieve on before you would be willing to go ahead and with such a transaction is adjusted subscriber growth that you are mentioning at the end?","Robert Thomson","Kane, it\u2019s Robert here. I have just returned from Australia and it\u2019s fair to say that with Patrick Delaney you have a new team, a new mood, a new momentum. And that will be crucial for the success in subscriptions that are generally speaking not just for an IPO, but for the health of the business generally. We will all be using as a benchmark. There absolutely no doubt that Foxtel has the best portfolio programs and sports rights and the letter being enhanced by the cricket rights. And there is no doubt as well that the Australian audience prepared to pay for programming is far greater than previously presumed. So, it\u2019s fair to say both the circumstances on the ground and the context of the Australian market give us confidence in the future of Foxtel.","Susan Panuccio","I think Kane I probably just add that we obviously have done a lot of investment in the business as it stands anyway and we have got the cricket rights as well you know and other sports contracts that we now have looked out for a significant period of time and it is important that we monetize those and start to push subscriber growth and that will be by a combination of broadcast and these new OTT propositions that we launched. So, we are focused on both of those and we are focused also on cost reductions out there as well. So, there is a major transformation going on across that business. And as Robert alluded to the management team down there that have hit the ground running and doing a great job so far.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Kane. Carrie, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Eric Pan with JPMorgan.","Eric Pan","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So with the change in the media consolidation rules in Australia, which sort of allow your competitor Fairfax to come together with Nine, would you say you are a seller or acquirer of assets in that market?","Robert Thomson","I would say we are a focused operator. Susan just mentioned Foxtel and Fox Sports, in that combination we want to make more than the sum of the parts. Their consolidation has given us control of the company in tandem with our partner, Telstra and that will be our absolute focus.","Mike Florin","Thank you. Carrie, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Brian Han with Morningstar.","Brian Han","Hi. Just a very quick question, the revenue increase from sublicensing Lord of the Rings, is that revenue almost 100% margin and should we be baking those earnings in for the foreseeable future?","Susan Panuccio","No, that\u2019s not 100% margin. So, I think we have said $28 million was the revenue increase and we netted about $21 million.","Robert Thomson","What you should be baking into the future is that we have an excellent team at HarperCollins led by Brian Murray and that team has become very deft at monetizing one of the most healthy backlists available.","Mike Florin","Thank you. Carrie, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Raymond Tong and Evans and Partners.","Raymond Tong","Good morning, Robert and Susan. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, just on the Move revenue, growth has moderated a bit in the quarter, just wanted \u2013 can you talk to some of the key areas of investments and how you are sort of thinking in terms of revenue growth going forward? And just on the subscription video services, there is a bit of investment coming up that you have outlined and just wondering how you think about the EBITDA trajectory into the medium-term for that business?","Robert Thomson","Raymond, we are very optimistic about the potential for continued growth of core revenues at realtor. As Susan mentioned, what you define as core rose 17% year-on-year, but actually the main product within that Connection for Buyers was up 23%. So, that\u2019s still a healthy growth rate. We are not complacent. But on a macro level, there has been slight slowing down in existing home sales in the U.S., but that\u2019s not a given trend given the health of the UK or U.S. economy and you would expect over coming quarters that I am not soothsayer that if the housing market picks up you will see a pickup also in core realtor revenues.","Susan Panuccio","And Raymond, I think just in relation to your second question on Foxtel and our expectations around EBITDA for the coming year, we obviously don\u2019t give our guidance in relation to that, but I think it would be fair to say we have talked about the reinvestment activities that we are planning to do there and we obviously have got the cricket rights that have come in with the cost associated with that. We clearly are going to be launching some new products and platforms that will come out into the marketplace which will start to grow subscribers and push that through. So, we are expecting going forward that there will be a balance of obviously investment with growth coming through and then we would be expecting lesser years to pickup.","Mike Florin","Thank you, Raymond. Carrie, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners.","Craig Huber","Yes, hi. I got two quick questions please. What was the circulation revenue percent change with and without currency by region and then also want to ask about the cost for news and information, it looked like it was up about 2% year-over-year. I assume it was closer to flat just for currency, but is there much room here in your guys\u2019 minds or plan here to take out another large chunk of the costs going forward? Thank you.","Susan Panuccio","Maybe Craig I might handle those if I will. So, in relation to Dow Jones, circulation revenues were up 9% growth in local currency as well, News UK circulation revenues were down 1% and in News Australia, circulation revenues were flat, but in relation to that first question. The second question you are right, if you adjust for M&A and other matters, then the costs were flat across news and information services and I think it\u2019s fair to say we have probably got businesses at different growth rates than different parts of the cycle, but Dow Jones will probably see more of an investment going forward. They have got revenue growth obviously they have had revenue growth this year, we are expecting to continue to invest in marketing and acquisition cost as I continue to push those digital subscribers. I think it would be fair to say that News Australia were balancing cost reinvestments with cost out and we do believe that there is work that can be gunned down there and the team is very focused on that. And at News UK, there is indeed still opportunities around cost out there. We would expect those probably to be lesser than the ones we would see in Australia as they continue to reinvest in their digital products over there. So I think it\u2019s a mixed bag across the group that we certainly see more opportunities in front of us.","Robert Thomson","Thanks, Craig. And just to supplement Susan, Craig, as you mentioned Dow Jones subscription revenue was up 9%, that was actually 10% at the Wall Street Journal. And what you have there is a tremendous base for the potential up-selling of premium specialist content at premium prices. So, our subscription base, while growing faster than the nearest competitor, is also based with a different composition and one with real price elasticity.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Craig. Carrie, we will take our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will be from Andy Levy with Macquarie Securities.","Andy Levy","Hi, guys. Thanks. Just one for me on the Foxtel IPO, I was wondering if you can just talk to the license wanting the IPO, Foxtel down the track and what News Corp would be looking to do which its holding in terms of reduce it through their prices, would you be looking at your partner exiting through that process? Thanks.","Robert Thomson","Look, we can\u2019t go into details about the future per se. All I would articulate is our absolute confidence in our ability to grow revenues, to grow the subscriber base and to grow profitability at the combined company over coming years. That means extra value for the company, but in particular, it will mean extra value for our own business.","Mike Florin","Thanks, Andrew. Carrie, we will take our next question.","Operator","At this time, I am showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn it back over to Mike Florin.","Mike Florin","Great. Well, thank you Carrie and thank you all for participating today. Have a great day and we will talk to you soon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. ","With that being said, I'll turn the conference now to the Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Reed Nolte. Please go ahead, sir.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, then we'll be happy to take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found on our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating income, EPS and net income are included in our earnings release. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David F. DeVoe","Thank you, Reed, and good afternoon, everybody. As you have seen in today's earnings release, we are pleased with our continued progress in fiscal 2012. We reported third quarter segment operating income of $1.31 billion, a 23% increase over a year ago levels. This improvement was led by very solid results at our Cable Programming and Film segment. The current quarter's operating income results include a $63 million charge related to the ongoing investigations initiated upon the closure of the News of the World in the United Kingdom. Also note, the year ago quarter included a $125 million charge related to a litigation settlement involving the company's Integrated Marketing Services business. Excluding these charges from both years, third quarter adjusted total segment operating income of $1.38 billion increased 16% from $1.19 billion in the prior year. Our share reported results from our equity earnings of affiliates were up $93 million in the quarter and after adjusting for gains associated with BSkyB's share repurchase program and adjustments in the prior year primarily related to asset dispositions, at NDS, associated results improved $67 million. The majority of this improvement reflects revenue-driven earnings growth at BSkyB.","Reported net income in the quarter was $937 million, with reported earnings per share of $0.38 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.24. Excluding the net income effects in both years of onetime items, primarily consisting of the items I just highlighted, third quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.37 compared with the year ago adjusted result of $0.26, a 42% earnings per share improvement. Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts.","Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses. Now, let's start with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating nearly 65% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Third quarter Cable segment operating income contributions increased 15% over year-ago levels to $846 million, with double-digit earnings growth at the RSN, FOX News, FX, National Geographic and the FOX International Channels. This growth continues to be top line-driven with segment revenues up 16%. Affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 18% over last year's level, with domestic channel affiliate fees up 15%, driven by our successful affiliate renewal negotiations in the first half of the fiscal year. International fees were up 31% with about half of the international affiliate revenue increase driven by organic growth and the remaining reflecting the consolidation of the Fox Pan American Sports upon the buyout of our partners in December.","Third quarter advertiser revenues for the segment were up 9% over last year level, with domestic ad growth of 10% and international growth of 7%. Although all our major domestic channels delivered year-over-year increases, ad sales increases were particularly strong at the FOX News Channel and National Geographic. ","On the international side, double-digit advertising growth for the Fox International Channels continues to reflect strength in Latin America and Asia. And at STAR, much of the double-digit local currency advertising growth was offset on a U.S. dollar basis due to the comparative weaker Indian Rupee. ","In the third quarter, we saw some slight margin compression in the Cable segment. This primarily reflects increased sports programming cost due to the delay of the NBA season and the resulting increase in televised games this quarter, the launch of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as consolidation of FOX Pan American Sports. ","At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $171 million decreased $21 million versus the third quarter a year ago. This decline reflects the absence of advertising revenues and operating profit associated with last year's Super Bowl on FOX. Excluding last year's Super Bowl, advertising revenues at both the network and the stations were aligned with a year ago. We continue to have solid gains in retransmission revenues, which more than doubles in the quarter. ","At our Film segment, third quarter operating income was $272 million, 10% higher than a year ago. This improved result includes higher contributions from the Motion Picture Studio, most notably from the worldwide theatrical and domestic home entertainment performance of the most recent Alvin and the Chipmunk release, as well as higher Television production contributions that include increased syndication and digital distribution revenues. Year-to-date, we've recognized approximately $250 million in total revenues from our Netflix and Amazon deal.","Turning to SKY Italia. Segment operating income in the quarter of $40 million improved $23 million from last year. This improvement primarily reflects higher advertising and subscription revenues resulting from the higher year-on-year subscriber base. ARPU of EUR 42 was in line with the third quarter year ago and was EUR 1 higher than the most recent December quarter. While we are pleased with SKY Italia's financial performance, the challenging economic environment in Italy is directly impacting gross subs additions in churn. As a result, SKY lost a net 86,000 subscribers in the quarter ending, resulting in 4.94 million subs at the quarter end. We continue to have complete confidence in the long-term growth prospects for this business, given the relatively low pay-TV penetration in Italy and SKY's strong competitive position there. But we are realistic and that our growth is closely linked to consumer confidence and consumption, which will be challenging, given the economic conditions in Italy over the near term. ","In our Publishing segment, operating income of $130 million declined $31 million compared to a year ago when we exclude the prior year's $125 million litigation settlement recorded in this segment. This decrease largely reflects lower advertising revenues at the Australian and U.K. newspapers, as well as the impact from the closure of The News of the World. Declines of these groups were partially offset by higher earnings contributions at Dow Jones and HarperCollins. ","And at our Other segment, we reported a third quarter segment operating loss of $147 million, $18 million lower than a year ago. This improvement primarily reflects the absence of MySpace losses, partially offset by $63 million of costs related to the ongoing investigations initiated upon the closure of The News of the World. ","Before I turn to guidance, I'd like to update you on our original $5 billion buyback program. Through May 8, the company has spent nearly $3.9 billion, repurchasing over 220 million shares, reducing News Corporation's total shares outstanding by 8.4%. As I have indicated previously, we're looking to complete this program by the end of this fiscal year. But given current pacing, we may miss this timing by a few weeks.","Our objective is to buyback our shares in a disciplined manner without artificially pushing our share price up during periods of low trading volume. Also please note that stated in today's release, our Board has increased our buyback authority by another $5 billion on top of what was authorized last summer. We are targeting to complete, total authorized buybacks by the end of fiscal 2013 by that time, it can fluctuate based on market conditions and other factors. ","And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2012. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2011, the $125 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.975 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we are excluding cost of the U.K. investigations from our guidance for the full year due to their uncertain nature. These costs, which are predominantly fees to outside lawyers and advisers, could total approximately $167 million for the first 9 months of this year. After excluding the full year effect of the U.K. investigation cost and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2012 to continue to be in the low to mid-teens range above the $4.975 billion fiscal 2000 segment operating income base level, with a bias towards the lower end of that range. I recognize that this growth forecast may appear rather conservative given the strong results generated in our first 9 months of fiscal 2012. However, there are couple of factors that will impact our fourth quarter comparative results. ","While our Film results have exceeded last year's results every quarter so far this fiscal year. As we previously mentioned, our forecast that we do expect a significant decline in the upcoming fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This reflects difficult comparisons to last year's very successful release of Rio and X-Men, coupled with this year's expense of the releasing cost for our 2 big June releases and the early July release of the next Ice Age installment. Additionally, the advertising markets at our international newspapers have continued to be soft. And also as we indicated last year, the Publishing segment included contributions from the 53rd week, which does not recur this year. As a result of these factors, we are expecting both our Publishing and Film segments each be approximately $125 million below last year's fourth quarter results, which will contribute to the reduction on the growth rate from the 9th month growth rate of 20%. ","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments.","Chase Carey","Thanks, Dave, and welcome, everyone. Before I discuss the financial and operational strength reflected in last quarter's results, I want to take a minute to address our issues in the U.K. As we said, we take these issues very seriously, and our Board of Directors and management team remain committed to keeping the company on the right track for the future. And lots of work has already been done toward this end. The select committee report delivered hard true, most of which we openly acknowledge. However, I flatly reject the Rogue Report's notion that Rupert is unfit to run a major media company. That's unjustified and in many people's opinion, including my own, a purely partisan findings. Rupert has taken great business risks, especially in the U.K., where he's led News Corp.'s heavy investment, building Sky, creating great confident choice to 10 million homes, and creating 19,000 jobs. We invested in The Times and The Sunday Times titles that were nearly out of business before Rupert made the decision to save them. He's one of the smartest, most forward thinking executives of our time and both the board and I rebuff any notion that he is unfit to run this company. ","With that said, let's focus on the quarter. As Dave said, our overall performance in the third quarter illustrates we're executing on plan to achieve our objectives of not just building but really bolstering our global content in Channels business. Our Channels business is a growth business, still in its evolution and we're committed to investing in content to strengthen our leadership position. We're not merely going to focus on squeezing the margins. We want to truly lead and to do so we're going to invest today for big returns tomorrow. Examples of this include our investment in the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championships, our spend in original productions and our renewed commitment to acquire more movies for our FX franchise, and overseas, in India, our recent investment in BCCI, the cricket rights. I believe firmly that these rights will add a whole new dimension to STAR's business.","Other examples of investing in content includes the moves we've made at National Geographic Channel, where the new management team we've installed has boosted ratings and profits, with ratings up 40% year-on-year, driven by a great slate of new programming. ","In August, we're launching our Spanish language -- U.S. Spanish-language network, MundoFox, already on target to reach 75% of all U.S. Hispanic homes. The demand is driven by one thing, great programming and stations believe that we fully understand how to use content to attract a highly valued, highly sought-after segment of the U.S. population. ","Additionally, we're devoting capital to further boost our TV libraries, with such breakout hits as Homeland, New Girl and American Horror Story. Simply put, if we have the right content then we not only maintain the value of the bundle, we can grow it. In today's diversified world of global media choices, we know that having superior programming is a must, and that's a cornerstone of our growth strategy and a key to delivering real returns to our shareholders.","We're also making progress in addressing our almost $15 billion in off-balance sheet businesses. In some cases, like Latin American Sports, we're buying out partners to take control. In others, you'll see us divesting, monetizing assets that don't support our strategy of growing our content and channels business. NDS is an example of this, where we've agreed to divest our 49% interest. Great company, but not one that fits into our overall long-term plans. ","I know you're interested in what we're seeing in the ad market, on national broadcast scatter, we're seeing solid market current pricing of low to mid-teens above last year's upfront, and June quarter cancellations were in line with historical averages. ","On the Cable front, current scatter is healthy with entertainment scatter up midteens. On the local side, the markets are a bit softer, and we're seeing a mixed pacing with heavy auto spending offset by declines in other categories. ","In closing, before I move to questions, I want to comment on our additional commitment to another $5 billion buyback on top of our previous $5 billion pledge. This buyback is yet another illustration of our deep commitment to our shareholders to maximize value by achieving our capital deployment objectives. We believe that these kind of commitments, along with the growth and success of our core operations, will continue to ensure the long-term strength of the company. ","And now we will take questions. Thank you very much.","Reed Nolte","Operator, we would like go to questions from the investment community now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First we'll go to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Chase, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on the growth potential for Cable Networks, funny enough, it was your domestic networks that led the growth this quarter. International is only single digit, right? So it looks like you have some visibility on the FOX News renewal cycle. Can you give us a sense how long that renewal cycle will last? And once it's done, do you see enough growth drivers in domestic to sustain healthy growth? And then on the international side, should investors expect you to grow in line with the marketplace, 10% to 15% subscriber growth internationally or faster than the marketplace and a faster-- any sense of drivers would be helpful?","Chase Carey","Yes, I guess, I mean, domestically, I mean, I guess, it's really true around the world. I mean, I think those Channels businesses, like you said, we feel great about them. And they're pretty much on track on all steady front you want to look at it, I think, certainly, from the U.S. pretty much right on course. I think, we've talked, take, FOX News, I think, what we -- I think, essentially, by the end of this calendar year we're in, probably about half of FOX Universal will be up for renewal. Obviously, that's the immediate focus, but that's the lead path to come. So clearly, we're working through those cycles. Other channels, again, continue to come through. I've talked before, and I still continue to believe, we've got real room to grow there. Again, just whether it's based on 2 matters, strength in the case of something like FOX News, which again is a uniquely strong and important channel and, therefore, that's why we're capitalizing there. Channels that I still don't think competitively, whether we can or should, which should be FX, which I think is really carved itself as a true leader in the entertainment space and, clearly, it has a lot of room to grow and it looks at peers it competes with and I think it's a channel that just gets stronger as it goes. Or a channel like National Geographic, that touched on, that clearly, again, when you look at some of the players in that segment has a lot of room to grow competitively. So, I think for us, and then actually stuff like Ichea [ph] as I said, one of the attractions is, if we can grow, we're not adding -- if we can sort of drive the affiliate rates to more competitive place and take advantage of the growth in the advertising side by getting ratings to where they are in Nat Geo. We've made some strides but, clearly, channels like that, I think we're even close to it than where we can be or should be. I think the international business, we believe, we have the unique position of leadership and we should lead the market. And it is why you see us continue to make investments into that market, whether it's BCCI in India or sports in Latin America or just general rights that we've acquired like we did with Atacha [ph] a couple of months ago. And I think we're very excited by potential of that market. That market, other than, certainly, I can go to that southern segment in Europe, clearly has headwinds, certainly from -- look at those from those big developing regions of Latin America and Asia. And we think there are truly exciting opportunities, we think we have unique brands, unique strengths, unique content, unique expertise. And we think with the position leadership we could -- we should capitalize on. I'm not going to get into what are the new rates, but clearly we believe we should be a market leader. The market leader in those international markets.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So, if I summarize all that, is it fair to say that investors should expect double-digit EBIT growth to continue as far as I can see, is that fair?","Chase Carey","I'm not going to get to projecting, just give a specific growth rates in those markets. We feel great about these business. They are on track. If fairly marketed, we expect to be leading these markets.","Operator","Next question is from Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question for Dave on the balance sheet. I think that you've historically said that your goal for the balance sheet is to have 2x to 2.5x gross leverage. And I think you're roughly 2x now. If you think about the cash position over the next year, between free cash flow and the NDS proceeds, cash would be roughly $15 billion before this buyback, which is very welcome. I just wondering if you could address of what you'll do with those cash proceeds? And you expect to have more proceeds from BSkyB, do you see you'll have to sell that down, can you address any other acquisitions whether it's education or something else?","David F. DeVoe","Well, we just told you with $5 billion of the $15 billion is to buy back our stock, Jessica.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, so there's $10 billion left?","David F. DeVoe","You are right with respect -- I think the gross leverage at 2x to 2.5x is basically, is probably a reasonable leverage for us and if you would strip out all the cash we get, I think everything you said is correct. And I think we just opportunistically going to have a look at how we access our -- how we utilizer our capital.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you say anything about the potential to have to sell down part of SKY?","David F. DeVoe","I don't know.","Chase Carey","We have no expectations in place, just to sell down SKY at this time.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The other part of the question was about possibly making acquisitions in education?","Chase Carey","I mean we're today we're investing, it's more investing and building it, I mean it's not, I think, at this point, that is the focus we made and acquisition is foundation. But our investments -- we are investing in education, but it's investing in building the business, which really means we are essentially as with any business you are starting-- with building it's losses you're taking as you're building the business up. Maybe it's a small acquisitions that you tag on. But again the primary investment is building the business, our primary investment today is building the business. I think touched on the side, I said last call, I think this year $75 million to $100 million investment, which is really a loss for bookings that investment in building the education business.","Operator","And we'll go to Richard Greenfield with BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","First on Sports Networks, there's been a lot of discussion about what you all may be planning to do in terms of broadening out the scope of your Sports Networks. Could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about that? And then just a housekeeping question for Dave. I think you mentioned that you backed out the FSI charge from last year that your Publishing OI was down about 20% year-over-year. But within that is obviously the closure year-over-year for the first time of News of the World. Could you give us a sense of organically, within that overall Publishing division, if you left out News of the World, what does the revenue and OI year-over-year rates look like in terms of increase, decreases?","David F. DeVoe","Europe? [indiscernible]  The OI basically will be stripped out News of the World but have be flat for the quarter. That's certainly not representative of as to where we think the year is going to be, where that segment will be down, I'm not going to give you a number, but it will be down significantly from where it was a year ago.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Is there a reason why the Q3 was reasonably flat relative to the full year?","David F. DeVoe","We had some offsets in the quarter -- you had reasonably good earnings growth from both Dow Jones and HarperCollins.","Chase Carey","And on the National Sports, obviously ,with some of the press-- I guess I'd say the press rally was a bit over blown. Look, the reality is that we are in the National Sports business. Today, we have channels, we have Speed, we have FOX Soccer we have FUEL. We have, there are more syndicated sports and I guess we always do, we're looking and we have to get big sports business in the regional side, I think. So we have some national franchises, regional franchises and, I guess, still we're looking at ways what's the most intelligent ways to maximize the value and the opportunities inherent in it. I think that there are great people connected at ESPN they could just probably, again, more of a media having fun, ESPN see these business. We like sports plays that we can do things that make sense to add dimensions to our Sports business, we would, but I think it's much more focused on the franchise that we have and how do we maximize the value and the potential of those businesses.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Has your view of the single sport network changed?","Chase Carey","I think it's always changed, give me a couple years, it always changed a bit. I mean, yes, I think there's pros and cons, to me it's how you -- I think they're still a place for them. But obviously, sports channel with multiple sports, probably has a bit more potential to because of the nature of it to just touch a few more people and bring in more of the marginal fans, so I mean, obviously, you have to be able to program it intelligently and to be able to make sense to that. And I think we have we don't have any plans so, today, I think what I've said is, we're evaluating things. And if there's something that makes sense, then we do it. If there isn't -- so if we like the business, yes. but I think this would only be simply -- we saw there's something to add, add dimension to it and we certainly explore it if not we like the businesses we have and we can certainly take them forward. So, yes, maybe there's a role for both. But I don't think -- I wouldn't say there's a dramatic shift, I think there's -- but I think there's a role for both.","Operator","And that's from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two. Just on the guidance, first, so we should start the 4 9 7 5 and then that grows low teens including or excluding the impact of the $167 million charges to date. Is that the right math?","David F. DeVoe","That's correct, yes.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And is there anything else, Dave, in the fourth quarter beyond what you called down Newspapers and Film or Publishing and Film that impacts the quarter? My math is just sort of flat to down.","David F. DeVoe","Those are the 2 principal items. Obviously, we're a dynamic business, so we've got other small items.","Chase Carey","[indiscernible] I mean, I know it's going to be down year-on-year, against it's ratings. You got some headwinds and the economy in Italy that Dave touched on, those 2 items are sort of at a level that is unique but they're always-- it's a tough business as you go across this and there'll be other items.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And advise to the low-end of the low teens is was what you said, right?","David F. DeVoe","That's correct.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then Chase, are you sort of -- is there an explicit strategy to sort of monetize the unconsolidated assets, either buy more or exit, I mean you've done NDS, Hathaway, you've got some others. I'm just curious one of the clear sort of areas of value will be good on the stock is on the unconsolidated assets, I'm curious if that's something you guys are explicitly now executing as a strategy or if it's still sort of individual case-by-case?","Chase Carey","No, actually I think, I mean first, I think, and I think I've actually said it on prior earnings calls that I think we should be with these off-balance sheet businesses moving to either own or operate or monetize. Now, I've always qualified that by saying we don't want to put time frames to it or create pressures that don't let us maximize value. The businesses we're in that we're quite comfortable with where we're at. So I think it is an objective, but I call it a very -- it's an objective and a goal without a specific timeframe or target to it. I think and particularly for businesses that we feel -- this is what we do, we like where we are and we may well be there for a while. But I think we have been more explicit where we've been historically of saying we think the right place to be is to own and operate or monetize. So there'll be a lot of issues that you don't -- you don't execute it as a short term.","Operator","We'll go to Alan Gould with Evercore Partners.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I've got a question on digital distribution. Dave gave us that the revenue was $250 million for the 9 months. I was wondering if you can give us what it was for this quarter versus what it was for the same quarter last year? And Chase, I was wondering if you can tell us if you've seen any impact on ratings or any pushback from the distributors to the digital distribution deals?","Chase Carey","Well I guess on the ratings, I would say, I wouldn't -- I guess getting any relative set backs so I guess if you took-- and there's different types of digital distribution. And take that -- I guess take something like Hulu, which can be concurrent, and there's no question you get some viewership whether it's DVRs or catch-up, there's more viewership and more streams of an episode in television I don't -- so I think the places people are finding shows again the biggest thing that could be DVRs but clearly people finding viewership in other places. The core channels, don't know what you're talking about it, and particularly, the Netflix issue and the like, it's I mean it impacts on channels. I wouldn't say so. In some places we're looking to buy. We buy film packages today where traditionally essentially buying the digital rights, so if they are SOD [ph] rights attached to a film, we're trying to capture those. And I think the channel you probably want to continue to own the broadest set of  rights you can so that there are digital rights to exploit -- you're exploiting them. So in some ways like FOX Network, but if a Fox Network show gets shown on Hulu they're capturing the ad dollars so it becomes, I think, in many ways if you look out over time, you're going to have shows premier, live on the network but in many ways people, some are going to be view live when it's showing in the networks, some are going to be view it in DVRs, some are going to view it on a various forms of electronic media, whether it's to TV Everywhere or through a service like Hulu. But for us, what we're trying to do is capture as much of that viewership and the value of that viewership in the right way. So I don't actually view that as a dilution of viewership, I think that the reality is people finding it in different places and us making sure we're capturing the value of ad content-- controlling the rights that are right, capturing that value, capturing that value with that viewership, if it cuts costs, that's great. It's different when you get into probably things that are library services in terms of what type of what rights do you own and do you own rights that -- if you own the breadth of rights you want so people aren't finding alternatives through digital media. And, again, that's why something like FX, we're buying movie rights to not create -- this quarter, I mean, clearly it's growing, I don't know, to be that precise but we're probably, this year, in this quarter, we are probably up $25 million to $30 million from a year ago in the digital packages.","Operator","We'll go to the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The first one is you indicated, Chase, that retransmission consent dollars were, I think, up year-over-year double or something like that. Could you give us a sense of where we are with reverse comp? And given that it's probably pretty early for revenue, can you update us on what percentage of the affiliate base is at least contractually locked in to start contributing something? And the second question is, a difficult thing, in that you don't want to negotiate publicly, but can you give us a sense in the context of the FOX broadcast Idol ratings. What kind of ratings guarantees do you think you make given the performance of Idol? If you could just give us a general sense of which way you expect ratings to go, I guess.","Chase Carey","I'll come back, I'm not sure followed your Idol question, but I'll come back to it. On retrans, not sure that was, I'm not sure it was, I guess, it is about double this year. The affiliates side of it, which I think was the heart of your question, retrans is where we are in the affiliate sort of side of the retrans that are sort of essentially payments for the retrans, for the affiliation rights. And that clearly behind where we are in retrans. It really is something that we have some but it won't -- it is going to pick up a lot. I think the vast majority of our we have this significant portion, I think it's probably about -- i think, what is it? About half the, I think, this by the end of the year about half the affiliate body will go through an affiliate renewal that enables us to put in place a structure that recognizes the value of our programming. And I think by the end of the following year, we get up sort of closer to 70% to 80%. So we've had some, it's been small, it's probably that is a bit of a tail behind the core retrans we've done through the ONOs and it will pick up a lot. So, I think, between now and year-end, a lot comes through and then there's another block  in the year that follows. So in the next 6, 12 to 18 months, the majority of the affiliate body will roll into agreements that help recognize the value of the programming we put forward and it will be a pretty sizable chunk that comes in this calendar year. On Idol, I didn't understand...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess the question is given the ratings have been pretty weak, right? as you enter the up fronts, you are going to have to have certain audience guarantee levels, like what is -- is this -- how do you view the prospects for ratings next year?","Chase Carey","I mean Idol, didn't -- I think I did say the last quarter, Idol didn't perform what we hoped this year. But realistically, before sort of jump on it, it is, I think, even with the Super Bowl, it just has with Voice and Super Bowl package, the Idol just past The Voice to go back to being the #1 show this year. It's a big profitable #1 show. It was down more than we would've liked this year. But it's a big valuable franchise and makes a lot of money. We certainly think we've got a lot of life left in it and I think our challenge is for next year is to put some fresh energy and I think we did well a year ago, probably not well enough this past year to find ways, then probably learned a bit that as show and clearly it's finishing whatever its 11th year or something -- but probably to make sure, each year, we're adding enough to it. So I think there was a year ago with the changes in the judges and the like, and I think some people running the show who came back with a lot of pressures to the fresh feel, probably didn't do enough this year and that's probably the lesson.  So I think we need to find and make sure we, next year, give that show enough energy and excitement to sustain it. Now the reality is, yes, it's an 11-year-old show. But the reality is, it's the #1 show in television, it makes a lot of money and it is certainly, we look at as we go into next year, the centerpiece for the network and we're excited about the potential of it. And I think we will be negotiating with advertisers about it.","Operator","We'll go to Adam Alexander with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the buyback. So far you've only focused on buying back the Class A shares. Wondering if that's going to continue? And as part of that, what plans do you have in place to reinstate the foreign shareholder vote back to 100%?","David F. DeVoe","The current plan is to continue to buyback the nonvoting Class A share. And with respect to the foreign ownership, it will be measured time to time and to the extent that we can put back part of the vote, we won't. To the extent we can't, We won't. I mean, it's a point that we have in place to deal with the issue with respect to our television license in the United States.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you think there's a timeframe you can put on that, Dave?","David F. DeVoe","I'm sorry, timeframe with regard to what?","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Getting the shareholder vote back to 100%. I mean how long do you think or what process do you actually have to reduce the foreign ownership back to the level required by the license.","David F. DeVoe","There's no timeframe on it. To the extent that the shareholding we change is would be more shareholders buying the voting stock and it would allow us to let more of the foreign shareholders vote. But it's a function of that, there's no other plan.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in changing, David, the buyback to buy back the voting stock, would that have any impact on it?","David F. DeVoe","It could, but not that's not what our focus is at the moment.","Operator","And we'll go to Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just have one question for Mr. Carey. Seems like the investment community's gotten comfortable with sort of the litigation expenses. But I was just wondering, as you sort of fast-forward to the next reporting period, presumably you guys give guidance, is there anything that you sort of see on the horizon that could cause the investigation to sort of spillover into the operating metrics, specifically, I'm thinking about indications that advertisers are pulling away or anything that you could sort of think that might be on the horizon that would influence your guidance for next fiscal year?","Chase Carey","Really, in all honesty, we've seen nothing. And I can't imagine, I guess I'd be shocked if there was, I mean, I'm certainly seeing nothing today.","Operator","And that's off from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I was interested in the step-up in the domestic affiliate fee growth, 15% from 9%. Was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how much of that step up was driven by FOX News versus the RSNs? And as you roll in more kind of renewals over the balance the year, is there potential for that growth rate to step up even more over the next few quarters?","Chase Carey","Yes, we feel very good about where we are in affiliation. I guess I've always felt that kind of look at on a quarterly basis is not the greatest practice, I mean, because the renewals you can end up with, we're right on track so I'm not trying to detract from it but I'm not going to break down channel by channel, how does it fall out and clearly renewals. In fact, we've said in the past we've had historically sort of in 10% plus getting low double digit in affiliate growth than we usually look out it over -- as we look at it over as the next few years and we continue to be confident and I feel confident about that growth, it's about the mix of  channels there. But I'm not going -- we're not going to break of the channels down. I think that said, there are channels that obviously has bigger growth. I talked about FOX News and the fact we see unique strength and we see unique value and were going -- that's it, we're going to renew half the channel between now and half now and the year-end. So there's certainly that's a meaningful part of it but, you know, the company CapEx is doing great as well. But I think, in general, again, this is one you really ought to look at over a bit longer time period it takes some of the bumps that can go in and out in the quarter, and out of it.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","If I could just follow up, you said you're renewing half of distribution between now and the election.","Chase Carey","I mean that's what we've done, so it's not all renewing. Essentially, in this recent cycle, again, we've renewed and will renew about half by the end of calendar year.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So there's more to come, it's not all done yet?","Chase Carey","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess for Chase, a question on Cable Programming and the pay Television business. Chase, you sat on both sides of the bargaining table as CEO of DIRECTV, and now running a very large cable programming group. And you alluded to preserving the bundle, yet it seems like every cable network group is aggressively trying to raise affiliate fees. So I was wondering if you could just speak about how you strike the right balance in terms of maximizing your affiliate revenue while preserving the bundle? And if I could just, on the topic off-balance sheet assets, Hulu, if you could just update us on how that fits in and the strategic direction there?","[Technical Difficulty]","Chase Carey","I think the question was on the bundle, so I guess that we can follow up and I would assume everybody's on the call to but we apologize unfortunately somebody stepped on the wrong switch on one of those extension cords. I guess, 2 responses to the bundle. I mean first from our perspective, I mean we're going to get competitively what we think is fair price for our content. And expect the only way we can run this business is to get our fair share. So that is our job and that's what we're going to do and if we do a good job and create channel for that real value, we should get a what is our fair competitive rate for our channel. I think in terms of what pressure does that create on larger bundles, I mean, so OSI [ph] is not going to subsidize it but I think we keep our eyes -- we're aware of the discussion, aware of the issue. If you think still to date it is an issue that really you don't see in the core business. I think the value of this bundle is set on and it is getting sales one that is tremendously for people [indiscernible] lose sight of it, there are two sides to the price of this bundle. I mean it's not -- there's the content and channel side and the distribution side, you're right, I used to sit on that side of it. The one thing I know from sitting on that side of it is there are big profitable business is over there so this is not about somehow you've got somebody on one side of and the other that can't afford to go outside, I understand people have pressures and we want this be healthy for everybody. But this is a good business model for both. I think that's one of the reasons why we believe TV Everywhere is an important solution to -- because one of the ways to deal with the cost is to make sure we keep making experience better and richer and a customer gets new things, able want to find content on new devices and the like, and I think it's important that we do enrich that experience and make sure-- the customers always rather pay less but at least for what-- to the degree that we -- I think one of our challenges is to make sure we continue to make that experience better and better for them by enriching this. But actually I do still think it's pretty good value. So not immune to it, and I think we'll continue to sort of do what we can to address it. I do think TV Everywhere is the primary initiative through which we would try and address it by again adding value to it as the cost goes up. But I think the power and importance and, ultimately, really the value of this bundle given the time people spend with it, making it a really good and important proposition for consumers.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just on Hulu, Chase, in terms of any update on kind of the strategic direction and how it fits in given the off-balance sheet opportunistic strategy there?","Chase Carey","I'm going to say I mean the off-balance sheet, but I don't -- I'm not sure the off-balance sheet part of it focus on. I mean, I think for us it is, I think, the focus is really how do we continue to develop that as a digital franchise that enables us to add dimensions to the content and channels businesses we have. I think it is, as I said before, it's a reason we did put forward with the sale of the business is there's no question, these digital platforms are going to be a driving force in our business going forward, real opportunities. If we can manage it properly, and I think that's the focus is we need to make sure we have rules and discipline by how we deal with it and what we put in there and what terms. That it could be a real -- I mean there's real opportunity to add a whole a new dimension to our business and something that enriches the whole, both on a content and the networks perspective. That's where the focus, not anything in terms of the balance sheet interest.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","So I don't remember your last time SKY Italia lost this many subscribers. I was just trying to get a sense of if anything has structurally changed in that market? What's the competitive situation there and where the subscribers are going, just to get a sense of how that business is kind of shaking off? And the other question was the question if I could squeeze in the question on the situation with -- I'll take the question after the answer on the SKY.","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean I think in Italy, I'm not a historian, but I think what has changed is clearly the Italian economy is going through an incredibly -- the Italian population is going through an incredibly difficult time that has people obviously concerned about the future with -- and I think probably unique in decades. Again, I can't say as I'm not an economic historian but I think this is probably one of the most challenging periods of time the Italian economy has faced in decades. And it really started last year, probably really started to manifest itself in our business in the beginning of this year. But there's the question, consumers are deeply concerned about the short-term future in Italy. What are these various austerity measures and the like, I guess the issues we all hear and read about that are affecting particularly Southern Europe are having an impact. And I think there are people that are -- have a lot of uncertainty about what the future is going to  look like. I mean, we believe in the long-term future of this business. We're very confident, I mean, actually competitively, I'd probably say, we're stronger than we've ever been. I mean I think we had -- a few years ago, we had a platform from MediaSet that service launched that competes with us. I think we've actually done a really good job in competing back, and the quality of services is better than ever.  But we're going to have to ride through a pretty tough upgrade update, very tough economic period as Italy finds its footing. And I think they have that -- you have to get to a place where the population there has some visibility or understanding on what the future is going to be. And what it think while you're going through this period of austerity with new leaders and policies being debated and election changes and the like, people are sort of hunkering down in trying to again wait for some visibility to what's there. But I think competitive -- the power of this product we feel great about, I think that the strength of this business competitively, we don't have a cable business we compete with, but -- and so I think we are excited about the long-term. But I think we recognize we have tough period ahead of us in the short-term.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","That's very helpful.

I think I know what you were talking about, I mean, I was asked was I aware, was I aware that there was investor interest in us potentially spinning off the Publishing businesses and my answer was, yes, I was aware there was investor interest and us doing so and in my responses we take that seriously. As we should both as management and board, we discussed that and other strategic options. As I said, and it would still be true today, we don't have plans to do to do-- you know we don't have plans do that.

So our focus is improving those businesses but we're aware of the issue and we appropriately discuss it in a focus on other things that we are appropriately should discuss as a board and a management team.","Operator","We'll go to the line of John Jannaron with The Wall Street Journal.","John Jannaron","With regard to BSkyB, when you talk about the way you look at an asset and believing that if you can you'd like to be an owner and an operator, how long are you willing to wait for that? I mean by that I mean is there a point in time when you might consider doing something else with all the cash you have invested like buying back your own stock. It looks like the market's pretty happy with what you announced this afternoon based on what stock was trading. So is there a point in time when you might start thinking about other options if you're not able to move forward?","Chase Carey","Let me be clear first, we are not reserving an option there today. I think we said I've said in the last couple of calls, we are not expecting any sort of the short to medium term to be doing anything other than maintaining our interest in BSkyB. So we're not managing, we're sort of going to go forward, assuming we're not doing that. So it's a perception somehow we're taking actions that have that in the planning process. That's not the case. In terms of owning it, again, I probably some of this is what I said before. We're not to put timeframes to it. We like that investment. We like that business. Obviously, we tried to buy that business. So it's an indication of our commitment to and belief in that business, you got a great management team that does a great job. We've sat with it's stake now for 20 years, so clearly we have waited for a long time. We're not going to put time frames to when we may or may not, I recognize the statement not backtracking on this statement, we rather own and control or monetize but equally we'll reemphasize the statement I made that there's no timeframes to that. And the different assets in different businesses, we may end up saying those are positions that for reasons override the desire to monetize their own and we'll finally stay the course. We've been comfortable staying the course with BSkyB, in for a long time here, and I think that's where we are today. So our focus on BSkyB is going to be to continue to be a shareholder that helps it to fulfill its potential, proud of what that company's built and excited about its future.","John Jannaron","Okay, that helps. Just one other a thing, can you tell me if he given any consideration to James stepping down either from the News Corp. board or from BSkyB?","Chase Carey","No, not.","Reed Nolte","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","That will be from the line of Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson with the Financial Times.","Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson","Could you just clarify for us the process of renewing your licenses with the FCC and the timeframe there? And also, did you get any feedback from them on the fact that you're foreign ownership and as high as 36%, which I imagine didn't happen overnight.","Chase Carey","We -- I don't know, right now I don't know all the stations for subset stations. I mean, I do know the cycle. There's a cycle you go through that is up over multiyear, how long -- Dave thinks it's every 10 years. I don't actually know what it is but I know it's not 1 or 2. But you go through a renewal process we went though and I guess it's part of that process we went through and there are corporate steps, discovered we had the issue and address it. I think -- I think that.","Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson","[indiscernible] It got so out of whack, how did you not notice that it got up so high?","Chase Carey","I think we did obviously. That's what we did. We went through the study and then we buy.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. I think we're all set for today. If you have any more questions, please call us in Europe later on.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay.

[Operator Instructions] And today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, Ryan. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we'll get some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended December 31, 2012, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found on our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David.","David F. DeVoe","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, our second quarter reflected continued solid growth in our Cable Networks, retrans led growth at our Television businesses, and overall improvement at our Publishing segment. Higher earnings contributions from these segments were partially offset by declines in SKY Italia and slightly lower profits at Filmed Entertainment.","The current quarter's operating income result also includes: $26 million in cost related to the proposed separation of the company's entertainment and publishing businesses; and a $56 million charge related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom, as compared to $87 million in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding these charges from both years, second quarter adjusted total segment operating income of $1.66 billion increased 5% from the year-ago adjusted result of $1.58 billion.","Second quarter reported revenues were up 5%, highlighted by strong Cable Network increases of 18%. All segments reported higher revenues with the exception of SKY Italia, where local currency revenues were essentially unchanged, but reported U.S. dollar revenues declined due to the strong dollar.","Our share reported results from our equity earnings and affiliates was up $32 million in the quarter. With this increase, primarily reflecting this quarter's higher gain from participation in BSkyB's share repurchase program, partially offset by a onetime cost at Hulu, resulting from their purchase of Providence 10% ownership stake.","Also included in this quarter result is $1.4 billion of income, which is included in Other, primarily from non-cash gains related to our acquisition of remaining ownership stakes in Fox Sports Australia and the ESPN STAR network -- Star Sports, rather. These gains were partially offset by $65 million of pretax restructuring charges.","Reported net income in the quarter was $2.38 billion, with reported earnings per share of $1.01 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.42. Excluding the net income effects in both years and one-time items, primarily consisting of the items I just highlighted, second quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.44 compared to the year-ago adjusted result of $0.39, a 13% earnings per share improvement. Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. The reduction of shares outstanding versus last year accounted for a $0.03 per share contribution to adjusted EPS this quarter.","Now I'd like to provide some additional context on the performance at a few of our businesses, and let's begin with the Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating 60% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Second quarter Cable segment results were driven by an overall 18% revenue increase, reflecting organic, domestic and international channel strength, as well as the inclusion of new international sports networks in Latin America and Asia. Similar to our first quarter, this quarter included the planned increased investments, both in sports rights in the United States and India, as well as the ramp up of international sports channels. These investments are in line with our strategy to create new strong cable sports franchises that will provide the foundation for a whole new level of long-term sustainable earnings growth. Additionally, the current quarter also includes a net negative $45 million impact related to the NBA lockout in the prior year and the NHL lock out in the current quarter. As a result of these investments and the lockout's impact, this quarter's operating income growth moderated to 9% domestically and 3% internationally.","Reported affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 20% over year-ago levels. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 13% over last year, with particular strength at Fox News and at the RSNs. While reported international affiliate fees were up 42%, after stripping out the effect of the new sports channels and foreign exchange, the affiliate fees increased 17%, reflecting comparable strong local currency organic growth at both the Fox International Channels and at STAR.","Second quarter advertising revenues for the segment were up 16% over year-ago levels, with domestic ad growth of 8% and reported international ad increases of 29%. Excluding the new sports channels and foreign exchange, local currency organic advertising growth of our international channels was approximately 20%.","Total Cable segment operating expenses increased 20% over the second quarter a year ago, with 1\/3 of this increase related to the additional consolidated international sports businesses and the net increase from timing differences associated with the NBA and the NHL lockout. Another 1\/3 of this increase is due to expanded college football coverage and Ultimate Fighting Championship rights in the United States, and the launch of our BCCI cricket broadcast in India. As a result of these planned investments, our operating profit margin declined slightly in the quarter as compared to last year.","At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $224 million increased 19% versus the second quarter a year ago, due to more than doubling of retransmission revenues from higher political advertising at the stations. Political advertising was strong, with approximately $70 million of political advertising revenues received in the quarter, bringing the fiscal 2013 total to over $100 million. These gains more than offset lower national advertising revenues due to weaker network ratings and 3 fewer World Series games this season, as well as higher cost associated with the expanded college football coverage on Fox.","At our Film segment, second quarter operating income was $383 million, a very solid result, which is roughly in line with the $393 million generated a year ago. These contributions include the successful theatrical release of Taken 2, as well as 2 late quarter releases, Life of Pi and Lincoln, which are up for the Best Picture.","Turning to our DBS segment, SKY Italia. SKY generated an operating loss in the quarter of $20 million as compared to operating income of $6 million in the second quarter a year ago. This decline was driven by higher program expenses, including nearly $30 million of increased cost, primarily associated with expanded UEFA Champions and Europa League coverage. The current challenging economic environment in Italy continues to negatively affect subscriber additions, with SKY reporting a net loss of 28,000 subs in the quarter, bringing the quarter end total subscribers to 4.83 million. Local currency revenues were essentially in line with the second quarter a year ago, with a EUR 1 increase in ARPU being offset by the reduced subscriber base.","In our Publishing segment, operating income of $234 million increased 7% compared to a year ago. This improvement result was primarily due to the higher U.K. newspaper contributions from the Sunday edition of The Sun that launched in February of 2012, improved profits at News America and at HarperCollins. These improved results were partially offset by continued lowered advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers.","And at our Other segment we reported a second quarter segment operating loss of $186 million, a slight improvement from the $191 million in the same period a year ago. This quarter result includes $56 million of cost related to the ongoing investigations in the U.K., $23 million of cost related to the proposed separation. Additionally, this quarter includes $20 million in contributions from the consolidation of Fox Sports Australia, although these earnings contributions are largely offset by higher development costs at the company's education business.","Before I turn to guidance, let me comment on our buyback program. As you have seen, we have been purchasing shares at a $3 billion annual pace while we work through the details of the separation process. Through February 5, we have spent $1.63 billion, repurchasing approximately 68 million shares during this fiscal year.","And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013's total segment operating income. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2012, with $224 million of charges related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom, resulting in a base of $5.6 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.","Since our last call we did 3 months ago, we've updated our operational assumptions to reflect our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year, and Chase will expand on this in a moment. But while our Cable and Content Production businesses are all on plan, 3 businesses, SKY Italia, the Fox Network and the Australian newspapers will underdeliver against is our original expectations. As a result of this underperformance, and after excluding the full year's effect of the U.K. investigation cost and separation cost, and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 will now be in the mid to high single-digit range, above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base. This outlook also now reflects the consolidation of SKY D's reported operating results from the January, although this factor's -- this does not materially affect the impact of the company's growth rate.","Before turning the call over to Chase, I'd like to give you a brief update on our plans to separate our publishing and entertainment businesses into 2 distinct, publicly traded companies. On December 21, we filed a preliminary proxy statement and initial Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. We plan to file amended documents, which will include additional financial information in the next month or so. We have also applied for certain regulatory approvals and tax rulings required to enable the transaction be completed as envisioned. At this time, we believe we are on plan for the separation to be completed around the end of the current year. And with that, I now like to turn the call over to Chase for his comments.","Chase Carey","Thanks, Dave. It was a busy quarter as we closed a number of important transactions, including acquiring all or part of CMH in Australia, the YES Network, ESS, our Asian sports business, EMM, our new Dutch sports business and a regional sports network in Ohio. We're also making great progress in the planned separation of the company, which is on track for the end of this year, this fiscal year.","Each of these acquisitions positions us for further growth. More importantly, we feel good about the momentum in most of our businesses, and excited about the progress on our new growth initiatives. However, as Dave noted, issues at 3 business units have led us to come up a bit short on expected results this year. While disappointed, we are aggressively pursuing steps to address these issues, while ensuring we continue to drive our other businesses forward.","I'll address the 3 business units with shortfalls in a minute. Let me start with what is going well. Our domestic Cable business continues to hit every target we set and execute superbly. FX, which is experienced wins on multiple levels, just finished a record-setting month in January, and last week's premier of our newest series, The Americans, had the most total viewers of any drama premier in FX's history.","The National Geographic channels made real progress, and Fox News continues to be a juggernaut. At our regional sports network business, we believe we're making the right decisions in navigating this invaluable, yet complicated business. Our new agreement with YES adds America's premier RSN to our portfolio, while our Ohio sports deal further strengthens our hand. Both businesses will generate significant profits and returns that exceed our hurdle rates. Those profits and returns look even more attractive when you look at the recently announced Dodger deal, which was too rich for our blood. We have a strong Southern California RSN with 4 great pro teams without the Dodgers, and our overall RSN portfolio is materially stronger than it has ever been. Beyond our existing U.S. channels, we're preparing some exciting additions to our portfolio, and those efforts are on plan, too. It is a testament to the strength of our U.S. Cable business that will deliver solid double-digit growth while observing over $50 million in cost for new initiatives.","Our international channels unit, Fox International Channels or FIC, is pretty much the same story of across-the-board strength and growth, while investing to add new dimensions to the business. In fact, our growth rate at FIC will exceed our domestic channel growth. That growth is helped by a couple of acquisitions, but that benefit is largely offset by some adverse currency fluctuations at the same time.","Among our newer initiatives, ESPN branded channels in Asia that we bought out last fall were rebranded Fox Sports just last week. Fox Sports Japan is on track to launch at the end of this quarter. And in Latin America, the Fox Sports business we took over a year ago is the highest-rated regional pay sports channel.","At STAR, our results in our historical entertainment businesses are ahead of target and growing this year, again, in spite of currency headwinds. However, as planned, our overall results at STAR this year will be down due to our investments in building a robust Indian sports business.","Our content businesses in film and TV have both continued to be industry leaders. On the film side, Life of Pi is a film we are proud of, both creatively and financially. We are excited about the upcoming Die Hard release, and the slate we have as we look toward the summer looks great.","On the TV side, we have about 40 scripted entertainment series on broadcast and cable this season, with 18 new pilots picked up today for the upcoming broadcast season across all 4 networks. Our satellite and cable platforms in the U.K., Germany, Australia and India continue to operate well and build on their leadership positions. Germany, in particular, has been an area of focus. We're excited about the recent restructuring that gave us a majority position there. This business has just gotten stronger and stronger in the past few quarters, with both key content and distribution agreements. It is truly establishing itself as the premier video platform in Europe's biggest market, Germany.","On the Publishing front, Dow Jones, our U.K. newspapers and HarperCollins have all made progress this year. Navigating the evolving digital age is still priority 1, and we're energized about new initiatives like our agreement with the Premier League for U.K. video clip rights. These businesses have big agendas and are on target, in spite of tough economic conditions.","As noted earlier, there are 3 business units not on target, and each warrants discussion. At SKY Italia, our problem is top line shortfalls, primarily in subscribers due to the economic crisis in Italy, particularly during the recent holiday season. We now expect this business to be about $100 million below target this year, around $150 million off last year's results. We do not expect the economy to improve in the short term, so our focus is reducing the cost base, particularly programming costs. We plan to take over $200 million out of the cost base over the next 2 to 3 years by not renewing some agreements and modifying others. We believe this business should and needs to get to a double-digit profit margin, with no improvement in the economy. From there, we can improve the margin and profitability as the economy recovers. A key positive to our Italian situation is that our competitive position is stronger than ever, which bodes well for our medium and long-term future.","At the Fox Network, it has been no secret that we had a tough fall. We hoped X Factor would grow as it moved into the competition phase, but it didn't happen. Our challenges in entertainment were exacerbated by a sports schedule that just didn't bounce our way with a 4 game World Series, NFL post-season off double-digits from last year, and late-season college football matchups that didn't pan out.","American Idol is just ramping up and our new drama, The Following, is off to a promising start. Nonetheless, the year will fall well short of our expectations.","On the positive side, our retransmission results are slightly ahead of target. The growth in retrans will enable us to have a broadcasting business network and stations combined that is significantly up on a year ago, but it will still be well short of our target.","In Australia, we've been hammered by an economy that we keep hoping has hit bottom, yet seems to continue to find new lows. This was clearly evident during the holiday season where we were unable to benefit from the seasonal advertising lift as we had in prior years. As stated before, we're actively working to restructure this business for the future.","We are highly focused on addressing these challenges. However, at the same time, we don't want to lose sight of the great momentum in our broader businesses. We remain more excited than ever about our opportunities, especially as we get closer to the proposed split, which we're confident will position us to unlock even greater value for our shareholders.","Thank you, with that, I'll turn it back to Reed for questions.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Dave and Chase. And now Chase, James and Dave would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. Both to get James' thoughts on BSkyB, now that we have this transaction in the U.K. with Virgin and Liberty, and what that might mean for that business and how he thinks about, broadly the satellite platforms in the U.S. as they continue to battle with -- in Europe, excuse me, as they continue to battle with cable properties. And then Chase, on the broadcast network, is there anything on the cost side you are thinking about? You outlined some initiatives at SKY Italia, but I didn't know if you had a view on what might, if anything, you might do on the expense front at the network moving into the latter parts of this calendar year?","Chase Carey","James, you want to talk about the U.K. and satellites in general?","James Rupert Murdoch","I think, really, just with respect to the transaction that was announced with Virgin Media, I would just say that across Europe, particularly in Ireland and in Germany, we compete as well as work with Liberty Global, in Germany where Liberty Global, through Unity and KBW[ph] distribute a lot of our programming for Sky Deutschland. And in Ireland, Sky and Liberty have been competing for some time. So I don't think there's really a big change to the landscape there, and I think, Chase spoke about the progress being made in all of the pay-TV businesses and the platforms in Europe in his remarks, and I don't think I have much to add to that. We're pretty pleased with momentum and we're pleased with the strategic position of the business, notwithstanding some of the sort of short-term issues and current issues that we have in Italy.","Chase Carey","Yes, and I think on the broadcast network, I mean, we're always focused on cost, and I think it has to be part of, in some ways, your DNA in managing the business everyday. I don't think there's anything dramatically that we'd be doing. Realistically, our core problem was we didn't have a great fall. You look at the ratings and the shortfall we had in the fall. And then, clearly, that was disappointing to us. We've had a -- The Following's off to a really good start. Idol is, very early stages so, very much a work in progress, but it's not that costs aren't important, but we need to create shows that are franchise shows for us to build a business around. And we're focused on that. We need to have shows that break out, we need to have shows that, and I think The Following is, again the type of show that can be a signature you build a night around. And so yes, we're focused on cost, but I -- and I think we always are, but I think that's the core challenge for us as we go forward.","Operator","Comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. I guess the first one was, I was wondering if you could update us on any developments you might see on the creation of a Fox national sports network, given a bunch of the rights that you've acquired on the MLB side, and some of your rights to distribute college, what you think the outlook is for that? And the second, I guess for all of you guys, there's been reasons why you've probably been a little bit less active on the buyback front. But could you kind of update us with your long-term perspective in terms of return of capital and capital allocation?","Chase Carey","Yes, I guess on sports, I mean we haven't made up an announcement about a national sports channel. I guess it's, what you could call it, the world's worst kept secret, but we think there are opportunities for us to add real dimensions to the business. We think sports is a huge arena that has room in it to build really attractive businesses. And we obviously have a lot of assets in that place that we think we can utilize in terms of trying to build a business, certainly, the regionals as we think are a real business for us. We do want to be focused on building businesses, as opposed to as, I said before, as opposed to acquiring businesses. And we think that's an important part of the portfolio as we look at our --  as we look at that bundle -- our bundle of cable channels that really cover the spectrum of the 4 arenas of entertainment, news, nonfiction and sports. We want to continue to be opportunistic at finding things that -- where we can build real value. We can build businesses that capitalize on the other assets we own. And we do think sports is an opportunity there. We recognize the challenges in terms of dealing with the cost of sports, but we just think sports, in a world of increasing fragmentation, we think sports continues to be a more and more important and unique part of that overall landscape. In terms of the capital question, again, in some ways, as we head towards the split, which is what we've said, you are going to have 2 companies that probably are each going to have their own. So it's a little difficult to get too long term on capital allocation, because again, you're going to have 2 businesses with different outlooks and at different places. And I think each has to sort of determine its own path and then come forward and set out a vision for what it intends to do. We are committed to finishing the buyback we've announced, so that, we said we're going to buy back $3 billion to $4 billion this year. We will do that. We will finish the $5 billion that we've talked about. And I think the company has to get split to then come out with an appropriate, sort of -- each company then has to come out with its own vision for how it deals with it. We think capital -- we think it's an important part of how we manage the business for shareholders. I mean, I think, we certainly know the importance of returning capital, of finding -- returning capital to shareholders. We want to make sure we continue to fulfill opportunities to grow the business, but we believe, fully, hopefully our actions recent last year plus that's indicated that. The Return of capital to shareholders is  an important part of it. But again, I don't want to get too specific, because I think you have got to get to each company to sort of, provide its own vision.","Operator","Comes from the line of Richard Greenfield, BIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, Disney, just to follow on that question about Europe, Disney made comments about looking to exit the U.K., given what's happened with ESPN and losing sports rights. Wanted to get your perspective on kind of what that means for SKY and just, as you think about the sports rights situation overseas, you -- now that you control Sky Deutschland, how you think of -- what's happened at ESPN in terms of your ability to continue to manage sports rights costs as you look out over the course of the next few years? And then, moving it over to the U.S. for a second. With the loss of the Dodgers, you've now lost the Dodgers and the Lakers, can you keep your 2 RSNs going in Los Angeles, and will that ultimately lead to higher profitability because of your affiliate fees being long term in nature?","Chase Carey","Yes, and I'll later -- I'll let James, let David can add something, if you want to. I mean, I guess, I don't think -- I have a great respect for ESPN and what they build, I don't think ESPN's plans, I would end up saying could have had a -- would have a significant impact on what we're doing in Europe. I mean, we had a relationship, but there are a lot of other players there, so I don't think ESPN's announcement on the U.K., I'd say, is an event that's -- essentially, we'd say changes our outlook or our plans much one way or the other. I think they'll be out there. I think there are other players that compete for rights. James, you want to, you have any...","James Rupert Murdoch","No, I would just say it's a super competitive sports market across Europe and in the U.K. Obviously, we had a new entrant with BT very recently. And really, and that package of SAPL rights or those rights had been ESPN's kind of core offering earlier. So -- but it doesn't really change very much as Chase said I don't think -- I think there's a lot of players over there. It's very competitive. But there are plans in Europe one way or another -- haven't really -- haven't been, and I think won't be, a big changing factor. And I think over there, to your kind of second part about managing costs, I think it's about making choices, and either deciding what you have to do, what you'd like to have, what's nice to have and what you're going to stretch for. So across the whole sports portfolio, it's about making choices, about where you want to invest and where you want to prioritize. So -- and that's why we make those choices everyday in a lot of different places.","Chase Carey","And I think as it relates to the L.A. market, we don't want to get too far into the weeds on the numbers of channels. Our goal is to maintain the profitability of our business in L.A. -- in Southern California. We've got a number of sports franchises, lots that we have long-term agreements in place. We feel good about our place. We feel our business is going to be more profitable, given the paths we've chosen than any other path out there, and we'll determine how we deal with our existing assets to best achieve that profitability. And again, on another level, I think we do look and we like each of these regional businesses, but in some ways look at them individually, and then we look at them as a portfolio. And there's no question we're in a much stronger place than we were with Ohio and then particularly, yes, than we were a year ago. So as a -- from an overall perspective, we are stronger than we've ever been, and we feel on the more local level, that we can -- we've got a combination of enough assets that we can continue to have a very healthy and vibrant Southern California business.","Operator","The line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two quick ones, if I may. So back to the best kept secret in media, I'm sorry to probe a little further on that, but in terms of the idea of a national cable sports network, do you think if you put together the various rights that you hold for a national cable rights right now, or could be reframed in that way, that it's enough for a 24\/7 sort of proposition, or do you think you would need some more? And if so, what could that possibly be? And then the second quick one, I know you just took us through a great presentation on Amplify not too long ago. So I know you said a lot about that. I guess I'm left wondering, if you could just comment, do you think that if you continue to spend a couple hundred million dollars a year pursuing that opportunity, that, that's enough to compete with the big incumbent competitors? Or would you be prepared to spend a lot more than that, if necessary?","Chase Carey","Yes, again we haven't announced it, and I'm not going to get too far into rights. I mean, we believe we have a unique combination of both rights and assets that we can use to potentially build a very attractive business. And yes, I'm not going to get into a right by right analysis to some degree. There's always -- with rights become affiliate fees. We're navigating a path where we think we have -- if we launch a channel, we're going to launch a channel that we think will excite people, and will interest people, clearly a 24 hour channel is rights as well as programming you create to invest in content genre, to -- that will excite and interest people. We think we have proven a unique capability in the sports business to really do unique and exciting things that excite people. We've certainly greatly expanded the portfolio of rights we've got across an array of sports from NASCAR to baseball to college football, college basketball, soccer, UFC and the like. So we have a broad array of rights as well as the regionals as I touched on to deal with. And clearly, look to create again distinctive content that we create that goes with it that would be interesting and valuable for customers. And then, go out with it on a set of economics that enables it to be an attractive business for us. And that's a plan we're on, and that's what we're planning to execute, and we will provide more details as we go forward. In terms of Amplify, look, we really think we're going to be a disruptor, we're not trying to be the guys that are in it. And that's, to some degree, that's what we've said is we're not planning to go to go toe-to-toe spending. I mean, in some degree, it's taking advantage of guys that are encumbered by decades of having built the business on historical practices, and we're going to come in using digital technologies which the education businesses sort of have been completely left out of, and innovate and then create a completely different approach that we think will prove to be uniquely successful in the education arena. We think they do it very cost effectively. It does regardless. We're not trying to -- I mean, we don't have any plans to go spend toe-to-toe with the old brick-and-mortar guys. I mean, in some ways it's the greatest advantage -- the biggest advantage we have is we don't have to worry about an incumbent business and what do we do, can -- what our digital technologies do in terms of cannibalizing an historical business. We can just lay out and build a digital business, and it's really built taking advantage of today's technologies and deliver a great product. We put a great team in place with unique expertise, and we think we can be a true disruptive force for good in the education space.","Operator","Comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with Nomura.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2,1 would be for Dave or Chase and then second for Chase. So David and\/or Chase, on the last call I remember asking about the ratings of Fox Network, and they start off really weakly, we all saw that, and asking about guidance and how that was incorporated. So from November until now, what really got worse? Was it weakness in the ad markets? Did you count on the second half of the season launching better? So that's something that we all were aware of, so I wonder what changed versus the last time you guys updated us?","Chase Carey","We think we've really, yes, I mean, we were only halfway there. I mean, I guess most particularly, with X Factor, we had really, obviously, went into the competition round, which is really where we were headed, that we could get a fresh energy and a fresh momentum, and clearly X Factor did -- was a disappointment for us and that didn't occur. So I think probably the first factor would be that. I think the second would be, we had a very choppy October. We were just coming out of October. We had the election, baseball, the hurricane. We had an array of disruptions. And again, we were hoping to relaunch some other shows that really had gone off and subsequently, some of the new shows, Mob Doctor, Tuesday night, and get some traction. Weren't expected to be raging successes, but hoped through those disruptions we could bring them back and to a better place, and that didn't occur. And then in sports, we actually were doing -- look, the NFL's fabulous, but sometimes just like sports were, really, the regular season was great for us. Unfortunately, the postseason didn't fall our way. I mean, we were down double digits, and that's a lot of money. So double digits in the NFL postseason, those are 3-digit millions, ad sales and then on top of that, some of the, I guess probably in college football, particularly the 2 championship games, we start off at 1 point hoping you've got a USC\/Oregon top-five matchup, and you don't get that. And you end up with a top 5 team in the Big Ten, that can't play in the championship game in Ohio State, so sort of ended up with signature games that didn't pan out. And so, I just -- and to be aware, every one of those where, maybe we've been because it's early in the year, a little too optimistic and sort of challenging people to sort of achieve. I mean, in sports, I think we did. So sports, I think is more just sort of, that's the way it fell. I think in entertainment, we really believed we could, we had an opportunity to get some of those programs to a better place and really, it just didn't go. It just went the other way as we went through the fall.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you guys actually sell on the sports network which, again, is the worst kept secret, is the gating factor to make an announcement or going more formally down the road, you used -- you just to talk to your distributors and get them to agree to a change, is that the gating factor of why we're all talking about it, but nothing has been announced?","Chase Carey","No, I mean actually if we think it's great to have everybody keep asking. So it's, we have a timing for what we're going to do, and we feel good about the timing. If we're launching something next month, I'd have to -- we would have to announce it. We're not, then so we'll continue to build up pent up demand.","Operator","That comes from the line of Jessica Reif with Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess one last question on sports and then a different topic completely. Just in general, could you give us any sense of what the incremental sports cost will be worldwide over the next, say 2 or 3 years? It seems like there was a really big step-up this year. And then, how quickly would you expect to start to see the flow through via revenue? How quickly will advertising growth accelerate and affiliate fees? So that's one question. And then the second question is you do have a lot of hidden assets, one that comes to mind is The Simpsons. Can you give us any sense there of when second cycle syndication might happen? And what the economic impact of that would be?","Chase Carey","So on sports, and I guess if you're talking worldwide, it's tough to make a general statement, and I'm not sure I can do the math in my head to go add up the pieces, I mean, I guess -- but I guess just touching all around the world, and in some places, you ought to, I guess got to remember, particularly in a number of the international markets, what we've done is take businesses that we owned a piece of and taken control of. So in Latin America, we had a minority stake, we took control of it. In Asia we had a 50\/50 partnership we've taken control of. So a lot it -- in Australia, we owned half of Fox Sports, and we've taken control of it. So in a number of these initiatives, some of them are new, Fox Sports Japan is new. The Dutch initiative is new. And they're in very different places. I mean, Latin America, which we took control of 1.5 years ago, 1 year or plus ago, is actually ahead of schedule and has turned profitable, and significantly -- generates significant profits that are on course. I think in India, this is a significant investment year, and that should be -- will have a significant uptick as we go into next year on sports there. In the rest of Asia, that's probably more of an ongoing build that is actually in the black today, because it didn't have quite the same cost that you had in India. It's a more competitive market, so there was some more cost to digest in India this year on some key rights, and we're just getting that up. Actually, I think very quickly, essentially, in the Netherlands, that's going to be a profitable business, almost after a very quick turn. I think in the U.S., to the degree we take on a new initiative, I think launching a channel, I mean we -- we don't -- we're not starting from square one. If we do something, it's still probably a couple of years to get us to a place. So I think getting -- there's always going to be an investment phase to the ability to lick our goal. Really, in aggregate, I think as you look at our cable business, has been, to maintain a very healthy growth rate, that has a degree of investment that after that investment, lets us continue to have that -- the type of growth rate you've seen. Obviously, if we did nothing new, then the growth rate would be couple of points higher. We think it makes sense for us that if you did that, at some point, your business has gone up mature in a way that we don't think is right in terms of building long-term value. So our goal is to say how do we take a small portion of that growth and reinvest it in building businesses. And again, we want to build and still be able to maintain a very healthy growth rate. If you see this year, we're building India this year, we're still building in a number of places. So India will mature and it's not just sports. Look, in some ways be built Fox business, which turns profitable this year. It's been Fox News as we've been investing in, it turns profitable this year and takes another jump next year. But I think that's a -- that is the philosophy. Clearly sports has a more significant cost just, again, because of the importance of sports, to the uniqueness of sports that it has a larger cost. Again, I couldn't pull it out of all those territories and stick it together without doing a little homework. But sports, we think, is going to be a force second to none. And really, almost everywhere we've invested in sports around the world, it has been not just important, and in many ways, it's been the cornerstone to our ability to grow and build the businesses we've built, including, here in the U.S. in many ways. In terms of The Simpsons, it's -- we are -- they're still ongoing. We are working hard to get to a place, I wouldn't speculate on a -- I wouldn't take any -- probably to sort of speculate ahead of time what it's worth, it is obviously as unique a franchise as exists in the television world now. I don't think there's anything else out there that has whatever it is, 500, 600 episodes and is headed towards its 25th year. Animation is great because nobody ages. But it's a fabulous franchise, but -- and I think we're getting, and we're hopefully getting close to a place where we can sort of try and add a dimension to it, but we still got a, I guess call it a couple of i's to dot and t's to cross to try and get there, so I'm not going to get ahead of it.","Operator","The line of Doug Mitchelson, Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions, for Chase and\/or Dave, given the nature of the guidance, the fact you provided a range, can you talk about what you would see as the swing factors that would push you to the high end or the low end of the range these last 5 months of the year? And then, I guess sort of for Chase, with regards to the not yet announced U.S. sports networks, any thoughts around the NFL networks package of games, or whether you pursue those games as a foundation of that network at some point?","Chase Carey","I guess the ups and the downs. I guess, first you always get sort of the, just the built-in uncertainty in the content business. We have -- what do films, where do films perform? I think on the network as I said, we're early days on Idol and the spring season, as a whole. I think you go to someplace, in a place like Italy, what we're assuming, yes, we can sort of stabilize subscribers. We've got a couple of initiatives we're trying to do to -- and I think that's sort of the outlook in the short term is stabilize subscribers. They've obviously been -- the last 12 months are down. And yes, we've got a couple of initiatives continuing to add new dimensions to the product. We just launched a bundle of broadbands, so some things we think that we can use to stabilize that market, we don't expect the economy to get better in the next, certainly in the short term, next couple of years so we are planning the business. We're in an economy that won't be, but we'd love to get some traction. We're not planning on that, but again, we're looking to not, we're looking to stabilize it as opposed to the last 12 months, where we've been -- we've had subscribers declining. So I think that still is something that we're focused on. And again, it made some headway in the last month, but it's too early to make any -- to have any real strong feelings about where it is. I mean I will not dwell on Italy, I mean I -- the one thing I do, as we look at that business that I feel good about is, it's a pretty clear path, how to get the business to where it should be. And it's -- you got program contracts that end in the next 12 months, the next 24 months, and some we won't renew and some we'll modify. And it's pretty structural. And I think we do those things, we get the business stabilized on the top line, take those costs down and get ourselves to a double-digit margin, and then we'll go from there as the economy evolves. But back on that, so I started to say the content businesses -- the content-driven businesses, as does span our film network. I think the cable business is probably -- don't have that type of volatility. The publishing business is -- it's pretty tough around the world, a pretty tough advertising market for publishing. We certainly experienced that first and foremost in Australia. We're not expecting it to get better, but we're not expecting it to get substantially worse. I mean as I said in the call, we had hoped the Christmas season, which is usually a good season for the newspapers in Australia, would've given us a bit of a lift and just didn't happen. But I guess I'd say those things and then, there's, we're not -- we're assuming the world itself is reasonably flat. I'm not assuming we're not assuming there are wonders out of Washington or other things that would sort of give it great momentum, but we're assuming the world sort of muddles along. So that's sort of from a macro perspective.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then, NFL content first for summer?","Chase Carey","Yes, again, I'm not -- look, NFL's a great franchise. We feel very good where we are. I'm not going to sort of speculate on individual rights and -- we are certainly, we're planning our, we're planning it light, given what we know today, and we feel very good about the path we're on, and the opportunity we have. I think you always want to be open minded and opportunistic. There are things there, see if they make sense, and they may or may not. But we're not -- our plans, the plans we have in place we are -- we have what we need to fully execute on. So it would only be if we think there's something that enhances them, the plans we have in place today, we feel great about.","Operator","Next question comes from John Janedis with UBS.","John Janedis - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Chase, just going back to Fox for a second. How do you see programming expense ramping there and try to drive the ravings growth? And does the retrans revenue allow you to take more risk or be more aggressive?","Chase Carey","Retrans certainly, I don't know if it makes -- it makes it a healthier business. I don't -- I think we, I wouldn't necessarily say it gives us license to go spend more money. I think we ought to be taking intelligent shots to try to create unique hit programs. Look, content's the heart of this business. There's no question in this digital age, you see it time and time again, great content is invaluable. And it's what you want to create, and I think we need to invest, we need to invest smart and intelligently in creating great content, whether it's at the studio or at the network or at our cable networks. And we will continue to do so. In the reality of retransmission is it enables the broadcast business to be a healthy business. As I said, I mean, we've had a very disappointing year ratings-wise, but our broadcast business is up profitability, and that's because we are building it into a dual revenue business, dual revenue. Then I got to put stations in there because that, really to me, is one business, stations and network combined. It's a dual revenue business, that can be a very exciting, healthy business and a platform on the network really is our ultimate platform to launch franchise entertainment shows and franchise content. And it'd really be a platform to market and sort of build all of our franchises in Television. And we need to continue to invest in content. We need to do it smart and intelligently. I think we've -- I think we've -- we have, I think, done a pretty good job of investing intelligently in content. We just went through a fall where unfortunately, the volatility of the content world didn't work our way. We feel good about the management team out there. We feel they're doing a good job. This is in a business you can measure in a couple of months, and sometimes you're going to have a tough 3 months. That's the nature of the content businesses. But we feel we've got a really good team that has -- is focused on trying to cost-effectively invest. We want to invest directly in content, but build unique, distinct content that can really be the type of franchises that have an ever increasingly unique value in this digital world.","Operator","Okay, that comes from the line of Alan Gould with Evercore.","Alan S. Gould - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","A question for Chase or James. Chase, you've been trying -- you've been doing a good job at rationalizing a lot of these assets, selling some, buying some. The 1 giant asset that stands out there is BSkyB. From our appearance it looks it's too cheap to sell, but sort of too hot an issue to buy. Is there anything you can do to recognize the value of BSkyB, which I think is probably not fully recognized in your stock?","Chase Carey","I'll give my two cents, James can add his two cents, hopefully they haven't -- they're not different wildly divergent -- but the -- I mean, first your last comment, I agree with wholeheartedly. It's not -- and I think it's true with all our off balance sheet sets. It's the biggest, and you're right, I mean if -- and I think it's just a question we don't get value or certainly fair value for it. And I think it is incompetent for us to continue to wrestle with that. And it certainly is something we will, but that being said, I think right now we're doing what we sort of have talked with in the past. We obviously went through the process we went through and -- the last couple of years. We've made a determination today that we're going to stay the course we're on, it's a great business. Our focus in the short term is to make sure we continue to make that business as strong as it can be. But I think over time, we need to -- but I think it's not -- it's over time, we need to figure out how do we wrestle that question to the ground and there obviously, I'm not going to get into speculation. Obviously, there are things we could do depending on the direction we want it to go, to capture more value out of the business. I mean, I think, well aware of those, but I think those are things we want to wrestle with carefully because depending on whether you head down a path, it probably precludes -- include other options on the path. So I think we're going to be patient on BSkyB. You know we're thrilled with the business. We're thrilled with the business's prospects and where it's going, and we are very comfortable where we are, and so I agree with the issue. But I think it's something we'll continue to wrestle with internally, and decide what's right as we go forward. Do you want to add anything?","James Rupert Murdoch","I don't have anything to add to that. But I guess I would say just the one thing is that across the whole portfolio, it is true that over the last couple of years, we have really strived to simplify the operating model, to deal with joint ventures, minorities, et cetera, and there continues to be a lot of work in that area, and we continue to stay very focused on it, and the recent transaction with Sky Deutschland is another good example of that as well, as all of the -- as many of the things Chase mentioned earlier. So these are things that across the whole business, we continue to be very focused on, in terms of simplifying the operating model, the portfolio, and having something that's -- that makes sense for the future.","Reed Nolte","Thanks, Alan.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Deputy Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, then we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, the definition of and the reconciliation of such measures can be found on our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.","Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call, such as segment operating income, adjusted segment operating income and adjusted EPS are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David F. DeVoe","Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, our third quarter reflected continued solid growth in our Cable Networks, retrans-led growth at our Television station and increased earnings at Filmed Entertainment. Higher earnings contributions from these segments were partially offset by declines in the Publishing, DBS and other segments.","The current quarter's operating income result also includes $25 million in cost related to the proposed separation of the company's Entertainment and Publishing businesses and a $42 million charge related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom, as compared to a $63 million charge in the third quarter a year ago.","Excluding these charges from both years, third quarter adjusted segment operating income of $1.43 billion increased 4% from the year-ago adjusted result of $1.38 billion.","Third quarter reported revenues were up 14%, led by strong Cable Networks and Filmed Entertainment growth, which were both up 17% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were mid- to low-single digit declines in Publishing and at SKY Italia.","Additionally, this quarter's result includes the consolidation of Sky Deutschland and Fox Sports Australia, which contributed approximately $540 million in revenue this quarter.","Our share reported results from our equity earnings and affiliates was $47 million lower than a year ago. While this decrease primarily reflects this quarter's reduced gain from participation in BSkyB's share repurchase program, partially offset by the absence of Sky Deutschland's losses, this business is now consolidated.","Also included in this quarter's result is $2.4 billion of income in other net, which is primarily from noncash gains related to our acquisition of the consolidated ownership stake in Sky Deutschland and the sale of our ownership position in SKY Networks Television in New Zealand. These gains were partially offset by $56 million of pretax restructuring charges.","Reported net income in the quarter was $2.85 billion, with reported earnings per share of $1.22 as compared to reported earnings per share a year ago of $0.38. Excluding the net income effect in both years and onetime gains, primarily consisting of the items I just highlighted, third quarter adjusted earnings per share this year are $0.36, slightly below the year-ago adjusted result of $0.37, and this reflects this year's higher adjusted effective tax rate.","Our press release includes a reconciliation of our GAAP results to these amounts. And with that, I'd like to now provide some additional context on the performance at just a few of our businesses. I'd like to begin with the Cable Networks.","This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating about 70% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Third quarter segment results were driven by strong revenue growth, reflecting organic, domestic and international channel strength, as well as the inclusion of new international sports networks in Europe and Asia. Operating income at the segment grew 17% over year-ago levels, with domestic channels up 16% and international channels up 21%. Reported affiliate fees at the Cable Networks increased 18% over year-ago levels. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 11% over last year, with double-digit growth at all principal domestic channels. While reported international affiliate fees were up 42%, this growth was 25% after factoring out the effects of new sports channel and foreign-exchange, reflecting strong local currency organic growth, both at the Fox International Channels and at STAR.","Third quarter advertising for the segment were up 12% over year-ago levels, with domestic ad growth of 2% and reported international ad increases of 30%.","On the domestic channels, double-digit growth at the FX Networks and National Geographic channels were partially offset by lower advertising revenues at the Fox News Channel due to the absence of the presidential primary, which occurred on the prior year, and at the RSN, due to fewer games -- fewer NBA games.","At our international channels, local currency organic advertising growth was approximately 20%, when excluding the new sports channel and foreign-exchange impact.","Total Cable segment expenses increased 17% over the third quarter a year ago, with over 2\/3 of these increase attributable to the new international sports networks, including the investments in BCCI cricket rights in India and expenses associated with consolidation of the Fox Star Sports Asia and EMM networks.","The rest of the increase reflects higher programming and marketing costs to FX Networks and National Geographic channels, reduced by lower NBA rights cost at the RSNs, resulting from broadcast of fewer games, which is a result of the lockout -- the NBA lockout a year ago.","At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $196 million increased 15% versus the third quarter a year ago due to a near-doubling of retransmission revenues and lower programming expenses at Fox Broadcasting Company. These improvements were partially offset by lower advertising revenues, due principally to weaker primetime ratings of American Idol.","At our Film segment, third quarter operating income was $289 million, which is 6% ahead of the year-ago result. These contributions include the successful worldwide theatrical and domestic home entertainment performance of Life of Pi and the successful worldwide home entertainment performance of Taken 2 and Ice Age: Continental Drift, partially offset by higher releasing cost, primarily from the successful release of The Croods for DreamWorks Animation.","Our DBS segment reported a loss of $11 million in the quarter, reflecting the first time consolidation of Sky Deutschland -- Sky Deutschland's results and lower profit contributions generated by SKY Italia. Our results reflect the inclusion of $410 million in Sky Deutschland revenues. Sky D reported ARPU gains of 4% and year-over-year subscriber increase of 320,000. We are highly confident with the local management's plan to continue to grow this business with a strong content and service offering and an underpenetrated premium pay-TV market in Germany.","Lower profit contributions of SKY Italia is primarily a result of challenging economic environment in Italy. It continues to negatively affect subscriber additions, with SKY reporting a net loss of 51,000 subscribers in the quarter. Local currency revenues were down 2% compared to the third quarter a year ago with a slight increase in ARPU being offset by the reduced subscriber base.","In our Publishing segment, operating income of $85 million decreased $45 million compared to a year ago. These results primarily reflect lower advertising revenues at the Australian newspapers and Integrated Marketing Service businesses that more than offset higher U.K. newspaper contributions, which benefited from reduced marketing and reduced production costs.","In Other segment, we reported a third quarter segment operating loss of $190 million. This is $43 million higher from the $147 million loss reported in the same period a year ago. This loss includes higher development costs at the company's education business, $42 million of costs related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom and $25 million of costs related to the proposed separation. These costs were partially offset by higher profits in REA.","Before I turn to guidance, let me comment on our buyback program. As you have seen, we have continued to purchase shares while we work through the details of the separation process. And through May 7, we have spent approximately $1.972 billion, repurchasing approximately 79 million shares during this fiscal year. While this pacing is a little slower than originally anticipated, we still intend to complete the full $10 billion authorized program in a timely manner.","And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013 total segment operating income. And as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2012, the $224 million in charges related to the ongoing investigation in the United Kingdom, resulting in a base of $5.6 billion in segment operating income for comparative purposes.","Since our last call we did 3 months ago, we've updated our operational assumptions to reflect our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. After excluding the full year effect of the United Kingdom investigation costs and separation costs, and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we expect that our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 will continue to be in the mid- to high-single digit range, above the $5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base.","Before turning the call over to Chase, I'd like to give you a brief update on our plan to separate our Publishing and Media and Entertainment businesses into 2 distinct, publicly traded companies.","Early last week we filed our proxy, setting the date of June 11 for a special meeting of stockholders to approve amendments to our charter. These amendments are required to enable us to complete the proposed separation. At this time, we are on plan for the separation to be completed around the end of the current fiscal year. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.","Chase Carey","Thanks, Dave. In addition to the solid earnings Dave just ran through, we also made substantial progress in the quarter. Our top priority is to complete the separation, which as Dave just said, is on track to be completed around the end of June. We continue to believe that the separation will enhance management focus and align it with our investors while unlocking the true value of our assets.","We plan to provide additional detail on both businesses, the new News Corp. and 21st Century Fox, will host -- each host their own Investor Day to help inform investors on their respective operations, strategies and outlooks. New News Corp. will hold its Investor Day in the afternoon of May 28 in New York and June 5 in Australia. 21st Century Fox's Investor Day will take place in early August following our year-end earnings.","While the separation is our top priority, we also continued to streamline our operations by reducing nonstrategic minority stakes. This last quarter, we sold our 44% stake in SKY New Zealand for about $670 million. We also reduced our stake in Phoenix Satellite Television in Hong Kong, raising another $92 million.","In addition, we took the opportunity to consolidate a previous equity investment at Sky Deutschland by subscribing for additional shares. We're excited about the long-term prospects of this business in Europe's largest market with close to 40 million TV households.","In the most recent quarter, Sky D added 42,000 net new subscribers for current total subs of more than 3.4 million. In addition, March quarter revenues were up 14% year-on-year and the quarter's EBITDA was positive.","Another important priority for us is to build businesses that capitalize and leverage our existing assets and leadership position, both domestically and internationally. This last quarter, we announced the upcoming launches of 2 exciting new Cable opportunities, Fox Sports 1 and FXX, as well as new international launches.","In many ways, sports has been a driving force our entire channels business. Fox Sports 1 will add a new dimension to our sports business, which largely exists today on our broadcast network and regional sports networks. At this point, it's only natural to leverage our sports franchise, our distribution, our relationships with viewers and advertisers and our expertise of developing an exciting new sports offering with significant value opportunity and relatively low risk.","In September, we will launch FXX, an extension of successful FX Network targeting slightly younger 18 to 34 demographics. FXX will leverage the stellar job FX has done, carving out a position at the top of the pyramid of entertainment networks. We expect the launch of FXX to add new dimensions to the future value of the FX family of channels.","We are also continuing to build or expand our cable franchises abroad. Our full ownership of Fox Star Sports in Asia, along with the recently acquired BCCI cricket rights in India, together will help us ramp up earnings from those markets over the next 5 to 10 years. We also recently launched Fox Sports Japan. These initiatives will require short-term investments. We expect to be able to make these investments and still maintain solid short-term growth. As we've stated before, our overall goal is to build long-term value in cash flow while delivering short-term profit growth that reflects a combination of strength in core operations, while observing the costs associated with new growth initiatives. We expect these initiatives to enable us to create new businesses that will generate annual profit in excess of the initial cost in 3 to 5 years with asset value worth multiples of that.","A third priority for us is to continue investing in valuable content that head into the value chain. We've clearly been very successful in developing new content in our movie and TV studios as demonstrated by our Film segment profit and at our Cable Networks. The momentum in those businesses continues. Our summer film slate is well positioned with Epic, The Internship, The Heat and Wolverine in the next few months, not to mention our next DreamWorks film following on The Croods.","In Television, we're looking forward to the network upfront next week with a great set of pilots, as well as exciting new cable series like The Bridge, Tyrant and Fargo. There are no such -- there are no sure things in the creative businesses, but we feel great about the strength of these operations.","In our Networks group, National Geographic, broke a number of viewership records with its first ever original factual drama, Kelly Lincoln in February, and as well as the exciting launch of its new series Brain Games in April, a great sign of things to come on the program front of that channel.","And finally, FX, January was the highest rating month in the network's 18-year history, thanks to very strong premiere numbers for The Americans, as well as the season finale of American Horror Story and strong performances from Justified and Archer.","However, we're clearly disappointed with season's ratings at the FOX broadcast network and are taking steps now to improve next season's lineup. We are looking forward to prudent creative risks that offer audiences fresh and engaging entertainment. We look forward to sharing our new lineup of shows next week at the FOX upfront.","In addition to reinvigorating our traditional Television businesses, we believe it's essential to continue embracing new digital technologies in a way that expands revenue windows while supporting the pay-TV business model. We've seen stabilization of home entertainment revenues with the emergence and acceptance of new digital formats and these formats are poised to grow the business over the next few years. We're also seeing progress in the build-out of authenticated TV Everywhere services by the pay-TV operators, and these services have become an integral part of recent contracts with pay-TV providers and rights dealers. Our recent agreement with Comcast is an excellent example of our commitment to work with our partners to deliver the best TV content to viewers when and where they want it.","Finally, we continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet. Although we have continued to repurchase our stock over the course of this fiscal year and remain fully committed to the buyback, we determined that it was more appropriate to complete the repurchase after the separation.","In closing, we believe we're in a incredibly strong position in multiple fronts. We will look forward to the many benefits the separation will afford us as we head towards the planned completion in just a couple of months. Thank you.","Reed Nolte","And now, operator, we'd like to have Chase, James and Dave take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of Nomura Securities.","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have one for Chase and one for David. Chase, you mentioned the strength of FX, which -- a lot of the hit shows you guys have. You also have some of these shows on Netflix. And I wonder if you think having a Netflix is a benefit to the network, and would you keep them on there and help the network? Or at some point, do you put them behind or garden and drive more value that way? So how do you think about your FX hits and how they've gone to the web?","Chase Carey","You want to ask both questions or only one?","Michael Nathanson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Yes, the second one is can you give us a sense for both you guys on startup costs associated with Fox Sports 1 and FXX in the first year, so any additional costs as you think about next year?","Chase Carey","I think in terms of Netflix, we've been -- certainly, it's been an important addition to our business, but I think we've been very thoughtful and very careful about sort of making sure we establish sort of appropriate parameters, I guess, following rules around how we window the products, to make sure every business is able to continue to grow profitability, successfully, whether it's content creation business or the network business. And I think at some point, the proof continues to be there in the pudding. Certainly, FX kind of has been -- has really just gotten stronger and stronger since going on through the year. I think we continue to monitor -- in all of these digital -- Netflix, all these digital outlets. But I think the availability of product in -- on the Netflix is really in a time frame that is very different than that on FX, and we think gives FX plenty of room to continue to grow and differentiate itself and continue to excite customers with that product. In some ways, you get the library experience through Netflix, so -- and I don't think it's that -- it's sort of the next-generation of windowing that has existed in this business throughout. I think we'll continue to monitor. We'll continue to evaluate. We'll continue to make sure each of our businesses can grow and grow in a healthy way as these digital platforms emerge. But I think we feel pretty comfortable with sort of how we've approached it today. We have a lot of flexibility in our agreements. And these digital platforms give us a great deal of flexibility to control what product we put in and flexibility in determining what the appropriate windows or times that we want to do so. So again, I think we feel pretty comfortable with that. I think in terms of the second question, the sort of accumulation, I guess, of sort of FS 1, I mean, we clearly have a number of initiatives going on right now. We do think, and we've said, we can manage these in the context of maintaining short-term, solid profit growth. I'd say between FXX, FS 1, the international networks, we're launching up next year probably looking sort of a couple hundred million and change to grow those out. We do think in sort of that 3-, 5-year timeframe, those differences become profitable, actually become profitable at a rate that on an annual basis, we will see what we put into those investments and obviously, for that valuation, that would be an asset valuation that would be significantly higher. So we think that's the right way for us to approach it. As I said at the opening comments, we think it's appropriate for us to balance both the healthy short-term and long-term story. Our priority ultimately at the end of the day is building long-term cash flow and value. And we want to build businesses, not buy businesses. That's what we're doing in this case. And we have some unique opportunities and we think these are all going to be exciting business and again, we can manage that investment and maintain the type of solid short-term growth that we'd like to do so, that we'd like to do.","Operator","Next question from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen of Bank of America.","Jessica Reif Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, whoever wants to answer, but 2 questions also. You have very valuable real estate, which you're starting to monetize first with Fox Sports 1 and FXX. Just wondering if you would comment on the potential for any other undermonetized or underutilized networks to be converted? And would you think about the upside in Cable Networks over the next few years? Is it -- or maybe for the 21st Century Fox company, is -- I don't know if we're [ph] working, but what is -- is the biggest driver sports and non-fiction or is it something else? And the second question is, I was hoping somebody would comment on 21st Century Fox, what your balance sheet objectives will be and how you guys are going to think about capital returns versus acquisitions.","Chase Carey","Yes. I mean I think in the short term, I mean, we've actually I think I would say our short-term focus is really executing I think, well, it could be opportunistic, but I think our short-term focus in terms of your question are the rather underdeveloped franchises we can build on. I think, realistically, our short-term focus will be to take the ones we've got and really, the next year or 2 get them to where they should be. Yes, again, I -- if we see something, I think we always want to be opportunistic, but we -- the timing was such that we had a number of opportunities to take advantage of some of that timing of rights, some of that's a timing of when our agreements come up with the distributors so -- and some of that was opportunistic in the international market. So I think with the combination of, I think, international and what we've done, I think the focus will really be in the very short term, getting those businesses to where we want them today. And we feel great about that path we're on. I think in general, we'll continue to look at the franchise we have, again, I do you're in a period where it's important that you -- you do have somewhat of a shifting from sort of quantity to quality. So I think we want to make -- we really want to build every network to a place where it can carry its own weight and really, be an important network. Some are narrower than others; that doesn't mean every network appeal to the same breadth of audience. But we think it's very important to have networks that really can each -- they may have [ph] a growth period, so clearly, any network has to get up to speed, any new network. But, I mean, some will get there faster than others, but every network is one we believe really can, as I said, I guess, if it carries its own weight in the marketplace there. And again, we're really focused on building quality networks that really can be leaders in each of the category. The value is going to be in having leading networks, hit products, what have you. I think in a fragmented, increasingly competitive world, you want to -- I think you want to focus on -- so whether, again, [ph] networks or content product that can be the best in the game. And that's what we're striving to do. I'm not going to say a lot about -- I think in the balance sheet, we are -- for the 21st Century Fox balance sheet, those are really things -- I think we're going to look to that April -- I mean, that August Investor Day. We still, again, have not put the Board in place for the company. And I think we'd look to provide, really, the appropriate visibility to -- plans for the business, operating plans for business and our priorities, but equally, on issues around the balance sheet; return of capital to shareholders and the like. We certainly plan to continue -- to finish the buyback. We thought that, as I said, it was better done, sort of, with re-energizing that post- the split. But I think clarity in terms of looking forward what are the philosophies and plans around return of capital to shareholders, whether it's dividends or buybacks, as well as plans for the business. I think we really want to do that more holistically and with the appropriate bodies in place like the Board. So I think we'll look to the August Investor Day to do that.","David F. DeVoe","Yes, surely we'll try to continue to maintain our balance sheet strength, and if we can maintain a very strong credit rating as we go forward.","Operator","Next question from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One for Chase, one for Dave. Sports is obviously becoming an increasingly interesting topic for News Corp. I'm not sure how easy this is, Chase, but I was hoping you could walk through in regards to your international investments in sports content, what sports or regions you're still missing that you'd like to have? And what big items might come up for renewal soon, so we just get a sense of how investments in sports might impact international Cable Networks? And Dave, I don't know if there's any chance you can give us the revenue and cost impact for the NBA shift to the March quarter, but that would  be helpful, trying to get the core Cable Network growth.","Chase Carey","Again, I'd say on the international networks, really it's probably sliced, to some degree, domestically -- I mean, internationally. I think our focus would be much more in execution than adding. I mean, I think we feel we've got now, sort of, the foundation of networks that we want. We've got sports networks in Latin America, Asia, Australia that will have obviously go with the new News Corp. Broad slots of Europe, those are more through the SKY platforms, but we are now in sports businesses through owned or affiliated companies; Germany, U.K., Italy, Netherlands. So we've got -- and obviously, then in sports businesses in the United States. So I would end up saying, geographically, we've got a portfolio that we feel very good about. And the focus would be on building -- as well as with rights. I mean, there'll be renewals that come up in the [indiscernible] report [ph] I mean, the international, in Europe, the international soccer rights, usually a 3- or 4-year deals. So they'll come around on their normal sort of rotation. And I think there are rights in Latin America, like Champions League. So I think the rights that exist come up on various rotations, some of a bit longer as cricket rights in India are a bit -- are longer than that. I think we're only in the first year of that 7-year deal there. So a maturing story, but I think we feel good about the portfolio that we have. I think we'd always, as we always look to certainty as something to make sense to add to it. But I wouldn't say today we feel we have hopes. I mean, I think we feel since we look around those various platforms, we feel we've got the rights in place. I think it's very true in the U.S. with FS 1. Essentially, we've got the rights in place to really fulfill the plans that we've got in place for FS 1 in the United States. So I think we will like -- we will be in the game for rights. And I think it's important if you're in the business to be opportunistic, but we feel pretty good about the portfolio of rights we have. Certainly, the rights we have will enable us to fulfill the plans that -- again, to fill the plans, we've got in place. We don't need to add rights to be -- to have our businesses to develop and execute on the plans we put in place for those businesses. I think I didn't ask -- to your question, let me answer Jessica's question on sort of the importance of sports. And again, I -- sports is certainly uniquely important and I think they're uniquely powerful. But realistically, really, all these -- the 4 content categories we compete in, are all important. I mean, they have to -- we've talked before -- I mean, in Fox News has been a success story, second to none and continues to get stronger. We're excited about that the business network just became profitable and I think is going to be really become a much stronger [ph] competitor in the last 12 months, so that's sort of news category, a huge category for us, an important one, and we think one that we certainly continue to grow. FX has been a great success story. Talk about its success in ratings in January with FXX and FXM, which is really the third leg on that. We've got some -- we're certainly increasing the breadth of entertainment product we're developing forward, some additional concepts in terms of mini series and the like. We've had some great successes around the world, in things like our Fox International Channels with series like Walking Dead, which has been a real driving force for them, as well as a number of other series, like The American Life that they've added to their portfolio. So sports is probably -- certainly as important as any, but we've got big businesses -- I mean, FIC, which we've talked just -- we have talked before Fox International Channels is on track to be a billion-dollar-plus business by '15, and that's essentially an entertainment channel business, so if you look at FIC, that's what it is today. It's just not -- it's not sports, it's not getting -- the fix that you're driving there is essentially -- I don't know, a big group of entertainment channels competing in the international marketplace. So I think it is -- the focus on sports should not sort of lose sight or cloud the importance of these businesses, be it entertainment and news business and other channel businesses for us.","David F. DeVoe","I think on your question on the NBA rights, it's approximately a $40 million -- $40 million to $45 million movement in the quarter. The majority of that is related to the rights as a result of lower games -- fewer games in the current quarter versus a year ago, considering all the NBA games were pushed into the third quarter as a result -- a year ago as a result of the lockout.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's the revenue impact?","David F. DeVoe","No, that's the overall total impact.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Benj Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question either to Chase or James about the international Television business, in particular, your Fox Sports Asia, Star Sports Asia and the EMM assets you've added recently that looked like pretty nice contributors to growth. How are you guys thinking about folding those assets into Fox International and thinking about the long-term profit potential? You've given in the past guidance, I think, about $1 billion of OI in '15, and I wanted to see how you were feeling about that number and whether these assets changed that outlook, and maybe you could add STAR to that conversation as well.","James Rupert Murdoch","Sure. Thanks, Ben. It's James here. I think -- well, first of all, as Chase said, the Fox International Channels business are kind of, what you'd call a classic business, before we started some of these sports investments over the last 2 years, is well on track towards that target, you mentioned of $1 billion of profit in 2015, and we feel pretty confident about that. Even though there's ups and downs in different markets, I think the team is pretty confident about that. The 3 -- the sort of 3 main areas have been in terms of expanding the sports portfolio around those channels has really been Latin America with the acquisition last year of the balance of the Fox Pan-America Sports business. Obviously, EMM in Europe and then as you mentioned the Asian -- the acquisition of ESPN share in the ESPN Star Sports. And right now, it's -- for the Asian business, the team is very busy kind of integrating the operations of that business. It's -- ESPN Star Sports in Singapore is a sizable business spread across the region and we want to align it more closely with the channels in India, at STAR as well as the Fox International Channels across the rest of Asia, to distribute those channels together to really use the promotional capability and really, have a stronger overall portfolio in those markets and to be more balanced with respect to entertainment and sports to, hopefully, bring something that really matters to customers in a big way in some fast-growing places as we've done in Latin America as well. In terms of targets, I think, as Chase mentioned earlier, there is an impact of the increased investment in sports. For sure, I think in particular, we see that in addition to the U.S., but in India with the BCCI and the consolidation of some of the -- kind of the lumpier rights costs that are mostly cricket rights in India. And that will impact the short-term overall profitability in India, but I think puts us on track to substantially greater profitability within the 3- to 5-year time frame. And in Asia and -- and the rest of Asia and Latin America, we think it enhances the profitability within the '15 target, I think we will be better and ongoing. So it's a really positive move. It's a lot of work right now, but it really transforms the scale of those businesses.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of David Bank of RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I hate to do this but I'm going to take another pass at Mike's first question, which is if you look at -- to understand the long-term value proposition of the new platforms you've you created, I think you've done a great job articulating them, but if we look at the first year from a practical perspective, and we lump the incremental cost into 2 buckets, sort of promotional marketing launch cost and programming cost, could you give us a ballpark sense of what the incremental is, the launch cost and the programming cost in year one? And second question is, Chase, if you look at where kind of Hulu is today versus what you'd like to see it be, if it executed on its current business plan over the next couple of years, what do you see it being 3 years from now? If it's successful in its current business plan?","Chase Carey","Sure, Dave. One of the -- on the new networks, I'm going to -- again what I -- given what I said, and I guess I'll sort of repeat is domestic and internationally, I think as we look at the next fiscal year, I mean, and we'll give more visibility to this at the Investor Day. But [indiscernible] a little bits and pieces, but I think...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible] FXX, really, specific to FXX and FS 1?","Chase Carey","Yes, I don't we have anything -- and I think, we're breaking those things down in pieces. Again, I think we'll probably provide that type of visibility more holistically at the Investor Day. And again, we're making investments, we think that's been our plan all along to make short-term investments that we can absorb while maintaining a solid growth rate in the overall business. As I said, I think as we look at the next fiscal '14, it's probably a couple hundred million in change that will go into those. But I think providing more clarity in, I think, is probably the -- to do it -- is to do it appropriately. I think we'll reserve and do it more fully at -- in early August. In...","Unknown Executive","Hulu.","Chase Carey","So Hulu. Look, Hulu, for us, in many ways I think it's the true only-digital platforms. They're a work in progress. Hulu has got great momentum. I think we're particularly excited about the subscription size of Hulu and the growth, I mean, I know they talked about it in the last week or whatever they had in their upfront. We think those dual revenue business models are ones that really the heart of creating success. So, one, I think there's an important role for Hulu classic in that marketplace. But I think the definition of what the product is that goes into that, what windows and the like is something we're continuing to stay actively discuss with our partners in it. I think this digital space will continue to grow but continue to ebb and flow, and I think we clearly have a leading franchise with Hulu. And my guess is Hulu will -- I mean, if you go out a few years, Hulu is probably going to look a bit different than it does today just because think -- even with something like -- Netflix recently talks about sort of evolving their business to slightly different to somewhat different business model. I think that's something we need to decide with our partners, to sort of where the directions we want to shift it, but I think it will continue to evolve as we go forward. But at its core, I think the most exciting part of it is really to develop that dual revenue side of it, take advantage of what Hulu's real leadership position, I think, in providing viewers the opportunity to access sort of more current products in a way that -- to add to dimension to their viewing experience today with selective original and other unique product that we can add to it. But I think it's essentially an opportunity for us to build the business that -- to take advantage of its leadership position in digital space and build a business that, we think, adds new dimension to the businesses we have today.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield of BTIG.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Your core cable network business has been vibrant. You're actively expanding it in the sports category and kind of live that you talked about. But broadcast TV is, Chase, as you touched on, really is struggling. And this isn't just a FOX, it seems to be kind of industry-wide with ratings under some pretty serious pressure. And you, all and others are doing a great job of driving retrans to stem the decline, but we keep seeing kind of lower viewership across the board. You're seeing more people skipping commercials with DVRs and using SVOD like Netflix has -- was discussed earlier. And just when you start to see cable shows regularly beating broadcast shows, from your own networks, as well as some other people's cable networks, what is the right strategy for broadcast networks and station groups as you look out over the next few years? Like how do you reposition this going forward?","Chase Carey","Look, I think there's no question; it's not been great year for the Broadcast business overall, just from a content creative perspective. But yes, I don't think -- I think you've got to take a step back and STAR, you've got to recognize these -- certainly, FOX -- I really think it's still the 4 broadcast networks are still the dominant form of events Television today by multiples. I mean, yes, there are select shows and the world's going to keep fragmenting. And there are shows that show up here and there, but if you really take a step back and say where do most of these sort of -- who are the still the viewership leaders by a wide margin in aggregate? Where does most of the events Television sort of reside that really drives business today? It is in broadcast Television. I think we have to -- I think we probably have to continue to figure out in the -- in the script today, sort of in the entertainment side, how do we compete effectively and have -- where people have more and more choices. I think they're [ph] being discussed, as you've thought about it before, if world has started creating 100 titles for us, 4 networks, and throwing all these series on -- is that the right way and do you need to sort of be a bit more targeted in the types of series do you believe it and invest deeper, than certainly the cable industry does, is take fewer vest [ph] , invest deeper and bigger in those vests [ph] to create series. The network, I think, are starting to have been a bit more about volume gain, probably a little bit more still stuck in sort of historical practices of [ph] everything goes into September everything wraps [up in May. And do you need to break some of those rules? And I think the answer is clearly yes, but these are great platforms, these are platforms that still they cannot drive the marketplace to create -- when you talk about sort of -- what is the product that whether it's sports, events, entertainment, that half hours, hours, what is the product that drives this marketplace? It's still the product business as far as performance to -- kind of close the network Television, network Television. That being said there's no question there are going to be more virtualized systems, choices and people are going to continue to find those choices. But I think in some ways, for the networks to compete, what they need to do is probably to discard a few rules that the business has continued -- sort of the old habit and rules and probably, take some shots that I think, hopefully, next week will be the start of that for us as we launch, and we're excited about schedule putting out there next week. And we think we're going to -- we think it's important for us to start to try to -- beginning to -- I mean, not that we haven't done this in places, but I think to get -- compete in different ways and try to do some different things that can really excite the marketplace and we think there are real opportunities to do it. This broadcast network continues to be a platform second to none in terms of its strength of distribution, brands and relationship with consumers.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger of Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I got another one on FS 1 and FXX, I think it's the new one and I think you might be able to add some color. I want to talk a little bit about from the distribution side, I mean obviously you needed consent from your distribution partners for these conversions. I think you did, especially at FXX, which is a pretty big format change. So I guess I'm just wondering if there's any -- I guess, you got that consent, by the way, because it sounds like you have launch dates. So I'm wondering if there's any quid pro quo around getting that approval. I mean, especially if they were off-cycle, you needed them to do something for you and I wonder if they used that to inject discussions about future timing or magnitude or increases in fees, anything you could make on that is one. And then the other, just a quick comment would be great on home video, you cited home video several times in the release and then your comments says -- sounding like a good guy for the quarter, just wondering, would you -- is it fair to say that revenue was up year-over-year in home video and -- it sounds like, and then so, how much of that was specific releases? Or do you think that's emblematic of the entire market? And if so, how was that shaping out between the purchase and rental and different platforms?","Chase Carey","Yes. I think on the distribution side of each channel, I mean, I'm going to get too deep into our sort of relationships with the distributors. We're quite comfortable from where we are and the plans we got in place and the strength of the networks we're putting forth and our ability to achieve the plans we've set out there and -- but essentially, as to specific terms in relation to any distribution agreement, I think those are things that exist between us and our distribution partners. On the...","Unknown Executive","One second, [indiscernible] information in a bit.","Chase Carey","On home video, yes, I think home video has got some nice momentum and it will be up -- I mean, markets up -- yes, I think market's up this quarter. I think that was something like 5% and we're up a bit more than that. Really, in -- the real driving force of it is digital, which is recently getting some traction in these business platforms, both rental and sell-through. And we've tried a number of initiatives. We have this premium pre-DVD releases that's been a real success for us, continues to grow. I think the overall marketplace continues to grow really well. And I think you see the digital becoming an increasing -- a growing percentage of what we do. The DVD side of it is stabilized to sort of Blu-ray, offsetting the decline in the older format. And I think some of the areas that we didn't like, low-price, really low-priced discount rentals sort of becoming less of a force, and I think the attractiveness of digital is really catching on. More people, being aware of it, I think we have a big -- better job marketing it. And I think we're excited that you can add to your, obviously, a period of a couple of years where you were sort of digesting a real sort of reselling of the home entertainment business as it -- as the DVD matured, that I think you've got some growth that we -- I don't think it's going to explode in the next few years, but I think we got some -- yes, some nice healthy growth through that business that is really led by an increased usage, awareness, marketing, better product availabilities in both rental and sell-through on the digital setting.","Operator","Okay. And the next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Chase, you've talked about FOX broadcast potentially going to potentially to a pay-TV model in response to area, so 2 questions I have. First of all, would FOX lose money at least initially in moving to this model? And then secondly, would you consider divesting your TV station portfolio at that point?","Chase Carey","I think it's getting -- I mean, getting further down the road and again, I think the point we tried -- the point we're making is the Broadcast business to be a healthy business and to be one that's able to deliver the type of quality entertainment and events it has, needs to be a dual revenue business and if it became an ad-supported only business, it really would not be able to compete effectively, as it's now able to do. And I think it's -- in the past, when it was -- when it wasn't a dual revenue business, one of the reasons why you saw product sort of moving continuously from broadcast to cable. And that, in many ways is our point -- we're -- I'm not going to get into the legal issues that we're currently engaged in because, again, we should deal with them in the appropriate forum. But that's the point. We'd like -- we believe we're in the legal rights. We're going to pursue our rights, I don't think getting into hypotheticals and is really, at this point, constructive. We like the broadcast model as long our rights are respected and which essentially means those third-parties, who want to redistribute our product, pay us a fair value. So as part of that, individual consumers that want to access it directly can do so. And with that model, we think we can continue to build product broadcast as sort of centerpiece of our overall networks business. And that's the path we'd like to pursue. We like the Broadcast business so long it's one that we can get fairly compensated for the products we invest in and the network that we built, that's the path we'd want to pursue. But there are, again, the point we've made [ph] , there are other paths. If eventually revenue stream is not available down the road, there are other paths we can pursue that we think lead us still to a very profitable business. But our choice would be to continue to build the business and potentially, as you know, today from consumers.","Operator","Okay. And the next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett of Lazard Capital Markets.","Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. I wanted to ask a little bit about ad trends, given what was coming on the upfront. I was wondering if you could update us on what you're seeing in scatter -- relative to upfront pricing? And also on the domestic cable-front, I mean you have the tough comp 2% growth because of the political comps that Fox Sports and the RSN comps, I was wondering if you could give us any color on whether we see more comp issues over the next couple of quarters as we cycle through the year.","Chase Carey","Yes, I mean on the upfront, I mean, right now we actually have a very healthy scatter market. And scatter market is probably up mid-double digits, not better [ph] probably that. So I'm not going to get -- some of my colleagues like to make predictions. I'm not going to get into prediction business. But I guess, if you look at the ones you look at, you've got a very healthy scatter market there and you have a pretty decent scatter market throughout. And I think, again, that always certainly comes into light of how much did -- appears and what happened. Therefore, that's the upfront market versus waiting for the scatter market -- buying into the scatter market. But today, you'd certainly say it is -- the market has gotten a bit stronger and in recent weeks so it's got some nice momentum to it. I think in terms of the cable network, I think Dave touched on it, I mean it really is sort of bit of a mixed bag on the advertising side. Actually, FX and Nat Geo were very strong, getting strong and even strong double digits, it's just -- the news business has got, which is the reality of the news business, the headwinds of the political comps. You had, again, the big presidential year, election year last year and you're not going to have that spending again. And clearly, the news network is -- it didn't make the money that, more than any -- more than our other businesses, some of the [indiscernible] , some in the local station markets in certain places. But to that end and the event in the RSNs. So the RSNs has a number of quite large, I think it's close to 100 games or something less. And there are a couple of rights that aren't there anymore. We had the Lakers year, going out with [ph] the Lakers this year, so there's also some -- and [indiscernible] it will be handful of reasons, but the RSNs and news have tougher comps again for politicals, gains and a couple of rights that we don't have in the flip side of things, National Geographic and FX have really been quite strong.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Adam Alexander of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Alexander - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Chase, I just had a question specifically on Fox News. It seems to be a bit of a tough quarter even taking into consideration the comp, and with channel feeding some shares to competitors, which is the first time we've seen that in a while, I just want to get your view on that and perhaps, procedures you've got in place to turn that around?","Chase Carey","I mean, I against it all. With all respect, I would disagree with the characterization of M&A. We could always have events that change, whether it's certain events, some do better with -- and they tend to hurt when you get to certain events -- some type events that certain networks become the short-term beneficiary, but I think that should ebb and flow and timing of the business, I -- look, I mean, I think Fox News is -- I think, continues to just -- I'll use the phrase I used before, be a juggernaut. I can't think of anything, just finished, [indiscernible] #2 network overall and the Television, and I think -- I can't remember which one of that, TNT or USA or somebody was behind, but was #2 overall. It's, I guess, you want to take a short enough time period, we can always talk to you -- we're always planning [indiscernible] a week, probably where it's nothing compared well, but I think in any sort of form of measurements that sort of take those short-term variability, the lesser short-term variability out of it, I think Fox Sports, Fox News just continues to be in a class by itself.","Operator","And then the final question comes from the line of Tim Nollen of Macquarie.","Tim Nollen - Macquarie Research","It's a little different from all the others preceding. It's actually about the Amplify education business, an asset that you're clearly betting on would be a good grower. I would say there's a lot of unknowns as to market size and growth, and it's looking like a very lengthy gestation period for the education business. My question is really why you think the education market is so attractive? Do you see yourselves more as disruptors to traditional content providers? Or do you see new markets emerging with the tech and data services, or is it both?","Chase Carey","Sure. I mean, sure as they say, we're pretty much on the plans that we laid out. So I think we've been clear with this. This is something that's going to take time. So the -- and you're right, right now, we are certainly engaging. We're starting to deploy some of the products, the business we bought in Wireless Generation certainly continues to grow its core business. But that being said, we are a largely in investment phase and build phase. But I'd say we're very much on the plan we laid out, so it's not -- and from a timing perspective we're up -- sort of timeframe perspective, where we expect it. We are clearly a disruptor in this, there's no 2 ways about it. That is the core, the heart of the strategy of what we're pursuing is a view that the education, the K-12 education business in this country as well as elsewhere for that matter, is really probably one of the, if not the last business that is sort of left out of the digital revolution. And you've got industry after industry that has been turned its head [ph] and thinking we haven't had very various factors to take advantage of these digital technologies to develop much better products, much better experiences, much more efficient experiences and the like, and we think K-12 education is incredibly ripe for that type of disruption to take advantage of technology to deliver a much richer and much more efficient experience to the marketplace and students. And with additional pressures coming on the cost of budget issues you've got in this country, national, state, local levels, to finalize to deliver as you can, to deliver a quality education experience, and I think everybody says that is a priority set on [ph] for this country that deliver a quality education experience, but to do so in a way that is manageable within in today's economic realities. And I think the answer to that is using technology and, specifically, digital technology, to deliver that experience and you can deliver, again, a much richer way. I think all of us can sit there and imagine how on the tablet, you could have that type of real-time interaction with teachers, peers, programs developed and tailored to students' availability. It doesn't take a lot of -- it doesn't take a big leap of faith to imagine why a really vibrant digital technology -- and not just taking old printed stuff and sticking it on a digital device, but really developing curriculums that are built for -- to take advantage of these digital technologies is really where the education world has to go. So that's a long-winded answer saying, yes, it is completely on that one, disruption with, again, when the time is right, with the pressure in education and the need to find certain solutions sort of that make sense for today's world to meet the needs of that quality education.","Reed Nolte","Well, thanks, Tim, and thank you everybody for joining today's call.
