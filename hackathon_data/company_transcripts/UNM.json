Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas White","","Great, thank you, Danny. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and also Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and our subsequently filed Form 10-Q.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website in the Investors section.","So, participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK, Randy Horn for Colonial Life, and Jack McGarry for the Closed Block. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?","Tom Watjen","","Thank you, Tom and good morning everybody. I am very pleased with our overall performance for the quarter, with operating earnings per share increasing 11% to $0.91 per share, and for the first half of the year, operating earnings per share grew at 9.9%, which is at the upper-end of our outlook we provided for you for 2014 of 5% to 10%. Importantly, to our book value per share, excluding AOCI, continues to grow and increased 9.1% year-over-year to $33.80 a share. ","Now, I think there are three key takeaways for the quarter, which Rick will just address further in his comments. First, all three of our core business segments; Unum US, Colonial Life and Unum UK, continued to produce strong results and higher year-over-year operating earnings in the second quarter. ","Each of these business segments is generating consistent solid margins, and as a Group, generated an operating return on equity of 15% for the quarter, which is also at the upper-end of the outlook as we provided for 2014. I should add too that our overall results for the Closed Block were strong as well.","Second, as I mentioned earlier, operating earnings per share grew this quarter by around 11%. What's more important to me though is the balance we saw in the quarter between operating performance and the impact of our share repurchase activities. This quarter, our after-tax operating earnings increased 7.5% and our capital management or share repurchase activities added 3.5% to our quarterly earnings per share growth rate. I like this balance and this is the balance we are seeking over the longer term.","And lastly we saw very strong sales at improved premium growth throughout much of the company. I am very confident that these results have not come at the expense of profitability, but instead reflect the strength of our brand and the quality of our offering and people. ","At the halfway point in the year, we are generally within or above the outlook for 2014 sales and premium growth we provided last year.","So, in summary, the second quarter was a strong one for the Company. All of our businesses have showed solid year-over-year improvement. Our stronger level of operating earnings growth along with our share repurchase activities give us real operating leverage. And we are seeing excellent profitable top line growth opportunities, which we are expecting to carry into the second half of the year.","Now, I will turn things over to Rick for a more thorough review of operating results. Rick?","Richard McKenney","","Thank you, Tom. Our second quarter results were quite good, as we reported operating earnings per share of $0.91, up 11% from last year. We saw good underlying growth in our after-tax operating earnings, which accounted for roughly two-thirds of our operating EPS growth. We will continue to focus on driving growth in operating earnings. ","And our second quarter performance continued to build off of the favorable trends we've seen emerging over the past several quarters. This growth will be additive to our underlying earnings growth per share that is generated as we steadily decrease shares outstanding.","Looking first at Unum US, operating earnings increased 2.2% year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable experience in the Group Life and AD&D line. Group Life and AD&D produced a strong quarter with $61.6 million in operating income, up 7.5% on favorable risk experience, and premium growth of just over 3%. ","Our supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $83.6 million for the quarter, basically flat with the year-ago quarter and operating income in our Group disability business increased slightly to $73.6 million from $73 million a year ago.","Premium income was essentially flat this quarter, which is an improved result from the small declines we experienced over the prior two quarters, as we are seeing better sales trends and continued stable persistency. Net investment income continues to reflect the impact of the low interest rate environment. ","Interest reserve margins remained solid, well above our targeted levels at 91 basis points, but lower asset yields continued to pressure net investment income for this line. ","Importantly, our benefit ratio in group disability continued to improve, with the ratio declining to 81.9% this quarter from 83.9% a year ago, as the underlying experience showed stable claim incidence trends and continued favorable claim recovery performance.","Looking forward, we expect the stable level of earnings from group disability, with some slight improvements in the benefit ratio and premium growth offset by some ongoing pressure from net investment income given the low rate environment. We expect our profit margins in this line to remain strong, among the highest in the industry. Overall, it was a solid quarter for Unum US, and the segment ROE stood strong at 14%.","Moving to Unum UK, operating earnings were \u00a323.6 million for the second quarter, 8% higher than the second quarter 2013, and generally consistent with our expectations. Our Group Life results are much improved and reflect the aggressive pricing and repositioning activities of the past several quarters. ","Group disability results were improved this quarter and our overall benefit ratio was 74% compared to 84% in the year-ago quarter. Our margins for the UK have actually improved back to the mid-20% area, which generates about an 18% of return on equity.","Colonial Life generated another very strong quarter at $75.3 million compared to $71.1 million a year ago. We saw a steady, consistent risk experience across its business lines, generating a benefit ratio of 52%, in line with the benefit ratio from last year. The underlying profitability of this business remains excellent, producing an operating ROE of 17% for the quarter.","And rounding out the enterprise, the Closed Block also had an unusually strong second quarter with operating income of $37.3 million, driven in large part by very favorable results in long-term care and higher miscellaneous net investment income. The interest\u00a0adjusted benefit ratio for the LTC line continued to run favorably at 80.8% for the second quarter, primarily reflecting a lower level of claim incidence rates. We generally expect the LTC interest adjusted benefit ratio to be in the range of 85% to 90% and the first half benefit ratio was 82.8% and has performed better relative to that expectation.","The interest adjusted benefit ratio for the Closed Disability Block showed some negative volatility this quarter at 89.4%, due to higher claim incidence levels and unfavorable mortality, partially offset by favorable claim recoveries. The age of these closed blocks subject them to more quarterly volatility and in this quarter, it ran favorably for long term care, but negatively for our disability line.","So now moving on to our sales and growth trends across the Company, we are particularly pleased this quarter with the results we are seen. In Unum US, total sale increased by 40% in the second quarter, a sharp jump from the year-ago quarter, when we were seeing the worst of the disruptive impact of healthcare reform on our market and our customers. ","When we look at the longer-term view of sales going back to 2011, this quarter's results get us back on the trend line of growth in the mid-single digits, a more normal sustainable level of sales growth.","Within our Group benefit lines, long-term disability, short-term disability and group life, total sales increased by 50%, with 40% growth in the core market and 80% in large-case market, much of which was driven by sales to existing customers. ","Our voluntary benefit sales also increased by about 20% in the quarter with a good mix of sales in the core market and large-case segments.","These are large increases across the board, but to give you context from a profitability perspective, of the $53 million of growth that we saw, half is coming from existing customers, and another quarter from sales to new core market customers which is our most profitable business. ","In addition to the strong sales, persistency for our Unum US employee benefits lines remained strong at 89% for the quarter. Bring it all together, premium growth for Unum US was up 2.3% for the quarter, and we believe we are starting to see some of the benefit from better overall employment trends. ","Also at Colonial Life, we saw very good sales again this quarter, an increase of 7.7% overall, with positive contributions from both new accounts and existing accounts. We also saw better trends in our core commercial markets, with quarterly sales growth approaching 9% in the under 1,000 life market. ","Results in the large-case commercial and the public sector markets were also favorable this quarter, largely with growth coming from new accounts. Persistency remained slightly lower relative to the first half of 2013, but overall, premium income increased by 3%, which is in line with our expectation of 2% to 4% for Colonial Life.","And finally in the UK, sales were down about 11% in the quarter to \u00a312.6 million. Much of the decline is in the group life market, down 29%, probably due to the competitive pricing conditions in our own actions, as we carefully priced this book of business. The pipeline does tell us that we should see this improve in the second half of the year.","Disability sales were essentially flat with the year-ago quarter at $9 million. Persistency in the UK is trending higher, but remains below our longer-term expectations, premium income in total, increased by about 2% for the quarter.","So, overall, we are pleased with the growth trends in the Company, and equally pleased with the pricing on the business that we're selling today. We feel we have largely moved past the disruptions brought on by healthcare reform initiatives, though some evidence of that disruption still remain to the very small end of the market. ","Also, we are beginning to see some evidence of the improved top line growth from better employment trends. It is certainly nowhere near the pre-recession levels, but a welcome trend nonetheless.","Now, looking at the investment portfolio, the credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, no changes there, and the watch list of potential problems continues to be very low. The decline in interest rates and the spread compression once again this quarter, make for a challenging investment environment. ","We continue to look for the best opportunities in the investment markets and for the best relative value among the asset categories we have historically focused on.","We are experiencing some near-term pressure on our investment income and product portfolio yields relative to our expectations similarly to what we have seen over the past several quarters. Our investment team continues to perform well, and we remain disciplined in how we manage through this low-rate environment.","Moving to a capital update, the weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional US life insurance companies remain consistent at approximately 401%, and our holding Company cash and marketable securities was $616 million at quarter-end. ","Our statutory operating earnings of $171 million are within our range of expectations and improved over the level of the first quarter this year.","Following the first quarter issuance of $350 million of 10 year notes at a 4% coupon in the second quarter where we retired $145 million of the debt issues scheduled to mature in November 2015, which was issued out of our UK holding company. ","As a result, there are two non-operating earnings that basically offset each other in the quarter debt extinguishment costs of $10.4 million after tax, and a currency hedge gain related to that debt of $10.5 million after tax, so no impact on this quarter's net income.","Also, we continually and steadily buy back our shares with the capital we are generating another $100 million for the quarter which keeps us on pace with our $300 million to $600 million range for the full year.","I would also note that our Board of Directors approved an increase in our dividend rate of 14% during the second quarter, which is the 6th year with a double-digit dividend increase.","Wrapping up, I would also affirm that our 2014 outlook for growth and operating earnings per share remains in a range of 5% to 10%. In fact, most of the trends we have experienced thus far in 2014 are in line, if not at the higher end of our 2014 outlook for sales, premium growth and our ROE expectations. A strong first half of the year and we like the trends we are seeing as we head into the second half.","And now I will turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.","Tom Watjen","","Before we move to your questions, I'll close by just reiterating some of the things that were said before, but certainly we have a very strong start to the first half of the year. Our focus remains on continuing to grow our business while maintaining strong margins through disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management. We expect to continue to generate excess capital and we will continue to balance the deployment of that capital with the needs of the business, opportunities we see in the market place and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend actions. Now this completes our prepared remarks, and\u00a0Danny, let's move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Suneet Kamath with UBS Capital Markets.","Suneet Kamath - UBS Securities","","I wanted to start with the Individual Disability Close Block. Rick, I think in your comments, you talked about the elevated benefit ratios as maybe normal fluctuations. But have you dug in to the Block to see if there's anything that's jumping out there?","Richard McKenney","","Actually, as we look at the Individual Disability Block and I try to reference our remarks, we saw some elements which we surely attribute to volatility, things around mortality and incidence levels that we haven't seen in some time. So, it does not look like a trend. Certainly, it's something we would watch, but we would very much chuck that up to volatility in that line of business. And we have dug into that, yes.","Suneet Kamath - UBS Securities","","And then, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but if we look at the sales growth now over the past three quarters, it has been generally pretty strong -- and I'm talking Unum US and Colonial combined. So, as we think about 2015, I think your 2014 guidance for premiums was relatively flattish for both of those segments, maybe a little bit stronger in Colonial Life, but how should we be thinking about the impact of these sales on your expectations for premium growth in 2015?","Michael Simonds","","Yes, good strong sales in the quarter. Feel good about how the strategy is meeting the market seeking to broaden our relationships with existing clients and grow our employee pay business. Our sales and client management folks are doing a terrific job. Our turnover in both those roles is at historic lows. And so we feel really good about how we are meeting the market. That being said, in the pure second quarter, we have a little bit of an anomaly in the year-over-year growth metric, but Unum US was up 40%. That was again, as you will recall, probably the low point in terms of market activity that we'd experienced in the second quarter of last year. And so one of the things we do is look at it, skip over '13 and look back to 2012, where we experienced growth of about 12% or 13%. ","So, a little bit of an anomaly. To your question about looking forward, I would expect those comparables will get a little bit more difficult when it comes to sales growth in the third and the fourth quarter. 2Q was really last year the low point. We saw it sort of flattened out in terms of sales growth, and then start to improve to your point in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year. So, certainly with the combination of building sales momentum probably closer in the second half of the year to the guidance that we issued last year around 7% to 10%. Combined with strong persistency levels that we are experiencing, we would start to see earned premium probably to the high-end of the guidance, and then, probably a tick or two better than that next year.","Randy Horn","","Yes. We feel real good about our sales momentum at this point. We are coming in really right within our target range for the year, which we established at 4 to 7%. We think that's going to lead to good premium growth performance again, right around our targeted range of 2 to 4% growth here in 2014. So if we can keep this momentum going, which we feel optimistic about, Suneet, there is no reason why we shouldn't be in our targeted growth ranges moving forward and possibly even in the upper-end of those ranges. ","Again, we had a range of 2 to 4% premium growth this year over the next couple of years, that was moving up more in the 3 to 5% range, and we feel our trend line is pointing us in that direction.","Suneet Kamath - UBS Securities","","And then hey it's for Randy, just a quick follow-up on Colonial, Aflac US has obviously been going through some issues in terms of their field force, so maybe two-part question. One, is that having any impact on your business in terms of additional opportunities? ","And second, can you maybe talk about how you managed your field force, because it doesn't seem that you're having nearly the same issues as they are? Thanks.","Tom Watjen","","Especially with that last question about how we're managing that sales force, it might be good just for me to make a very brief comment just about how we are structured actually. Because I think you're right, there are different people in the markets who have different ways about going about the business.","So I think as everybody knows, we have really two avenues into the voluntary market. So in the Unum US the avenue is very important to us, because voluntary provides -- allows us to have a very integrated offering of Group, individual and voluntary products in the marketplace. We actually market those to brokers and consultants. ","And so, that brand is distributed in the market in a very different way than Randy's business for example, because Colonial has a more narrow voluntary benefit offering in the marketplace, but that's sold through agents. The agents may ultimately use a broker, but the agent controls that business. And so, from the Group point of view, we have two very good brands, two very different ways to come to market, and its proven to be very, very successful for us over the years.","In fact, if you take those two businesses and look at just the results last quarter, our total VB sales were actually up 11% across Unum US and Colonial businesses. And so, that's a pretty strong performance. It's up 8% actually for the year. ","And if you look at the last three years, by having this sort of two-pronged approach to the marketplace, as a combined business, the growth rates range from 2 to say 8% over that period of time. So, we had steady growth each and every year. I just want to give that piece of context, because we go to the market a little differently from some others by having two brands and two distribution systems, and they are very powerful. They give us a lot of access to different markets. They complement one another. And that's proven to be a good formula for us. ","So with that, Randy, you want to pick up a little bit on just the Colonial part of the story.","Randy Horn","","First of all, Suneet, in terms of opportunities coming from the Aflac side of things, I, of course, can't speak to the specifics of what they are doing, but they are undergoing a lot of change in their agency distribution system. And so, yes, in the short-term, that does create opportunities for any competitor.","In terms of the management of our agency system, and how we go about things, just to give you the short story, and it is really a fairly simple story, Suneet, we are maintaining a very consistent focus on our agency distribution system. And this is the channel that we use to go to market both in terms of direct sales on the smaller-end of the market and then having our agents partner with brokers as they move up market. So through this approach, we really avoid any type of channel conflict and we have been very focused on that approach for a long, long time.","Secondly, just gets back to sound execution of the fundamentals of our business; recruiting reps and managers, upping the quality level of that recruitment effort, developing our agents effectively, growing the number of producing agents and sales managers, and seeing very, very good results from that at the present time. We are seeing increased activity levels, more appointments occurring with the employers, a good surge in the number of closed cases, that type of thing.","And lastly, we are seeing the market environment improving. So that's helping us. As Rick said, we are seeing gradual, continued improvement in the economy, still some pressure on the real small end of it, but that's loosening up as well. ","I think most employers, as Rick said, are putting the Affordable Care Act implementation behind them, and that has really led to more new accounts being open for us, sales and product lines to complement the changes that employers are making in their medical plans, such as our Medical Bridge product, critical illness, accident, on and so forth. ","So, it's really led to an environment, Suneet, a very broad based sales growth, and we are optimistic about reaching our targeted sales growth for the year based on what we're seeing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Intrigued to hear you say you are starting to see some of the benefit from better overall employment trends. What do you think that means in terms of, I think you talked about the natural growth rate, how much has it ticked up so far and where could it go?","","Michael Simonds","","So, we would have seen through the recession -- actually a headwind there, where we saw contractions in the order of 1 to 2%, I'd say over the last four quarters or so. That leveled out to a push up a little bit in the quarter down a little bit in the quarter and now I think, through the first half of this year, we've actually started to see that move into positive range and think in terms of a percentage point or so.","We are optimistic. Our business plans don't center on the assumption, but we're optimistic that we will continue to see that build slowly. It plays out in natural growth to our book-of-business as our premiums lever on hiring trends and salary increases, that premium comes in at very low acquisition cost, which is terrific. Also at play is the attitude towards benefits. So, as some of the slack comes out of the labor market, we are seeing clients with a little bit of a better attitude towards improving benefits plans, perhaps adding a new benefit or two and so, that's showing up in our MBOC results as well. ","So, not likely to accelerate rapidly, but a gradual improvement over the last couple of quarters.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","And then the sales overall this quarter, understanding that you had an easier comp, but still for that you had excellent growth. Was there an adjustment in pricing strategy? ","Obviously, your benefits ratios have been improving. Did you take that more into account when you were putting up proposals this quarter? It just seems like there was more of a step function that I am curious as to what drove that?","Tom Watjen","","Mike, you want to take that? And also as part of just (inaudible) I think you dissected -- we dissected the sales in the quarter, where that sales are coming from is a good sort of indicator of that whole pricing environment actually.","Michael Simonds","","So just to hit the question directly first and then speak to the mix of sales overall. Orientation around pricing is very consistent and actually has been for an extended period of time. We actually feel pretty good in each of our lines of business about having the market share that we do, having blocks the size that we do yield some pretty good insights around where prices need to move up a bit, where we can afford to come down a bit, but the aggregate level has actually moved not much at all. And looking at the quality of the business, it's one of those quarters, where everything broke our way across segments and products, which is good to see. But if you look at the strategy, we are very focused on building out the breadth of the relationships we have with the clients that know us and that appreciate the Unum brand. ","So, 62% of all of our new sales came from those existing relationships, that's important. We see two points or three points more favorable pricing from a line that's added to an existing relationship. We know that as we build out the relationship, it drives persistency in future period and that's very important to us through the renewal program.","One of the key drivers certainly was large case. And just to put that into perspective, if we look at large case it actually feel good about where that business is. It was up 80% in the quarter. But if you look at the last 12 quarters, seven times we've been up, five times we've been down, and we really don't get too caught up in what happens quarter-to-quarter, we look at the aggregate, long-term trend. ROE in that business is actually very comparable now to our core business, and we started to see a leveling of the earned premium, which is great and will bode well for earned premium going forward. ","So, feel actually very good about the mix and the quality of the business that's coming in.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Sorry, one more follow-up. The 62% from existing relationships, what was it in Q1?","Michael Simonds","","Well that would've been actually just a tick lower, 61% last quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Erik Bass with Citibank. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","","Just following up on a couple of the last questions, I guess in the group market, we have seen several competitors that continue to face the margin pressure and appear to be either pulling back or raising prices. So has this resulted in either less competition or provided a little bit of a price umbrella for you to ramp up growth?","Michael Simonds","","Certainly, it remains a competitive market. At any given point in time, there is going to be some carriers that are retrenching and trying to improve profitability, and in others, there's going to be carriers that are trying to extend share. That being said on balance, I would say it is a pricing environment that is slightly improved over prior year. While I couldn't speak to any particularly competitor, our best insight is that the industry, when it comes to Group insurance, is currently running at a mid-single digit ROE, which would suggest there is some work to be done and I think we're starting to see the benefit of that in a little bit of a firmer pricing environment.","As we look forward, again, so we're sort of cautiously optimistic that the market will firm or continue to firm up a bit. ","But we also recognize that, as you come around the corner and you're headed towards the second half of the year, it is not easy always to maintain that pricing discipline in the face of decreased sales and so it's somewhat of an open question, as to whether industry players will stick their guns when it comes to improving the margins of their book of business.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","","And you mentioned the sales to existing clients. What products are they adding? Is it a move to adding more voluntary products? And how much additional opportunity do you see the cross-sell? Is keeping it in that 60% range of sales of reasonable target?","Michael Simonds","","Yes. Great question. We actually think we've got a pretty long runway there. So if you think about Unum, we have built a very broad franchise, primarily around disability insurance. So we've got a large number of important clients where we've got a line or two lines in-force and we feel like absolutely voluntary is a huge opportunity. Over a third of all our new voluntary sales are coming in on in-force group relationships. We see the individual disability, which is typically a supplemental sale for higher earners, that's a big opportunity for us. And then actually, even within traditional life insurance, we a see nice opportunity for our voluntary supplemental plans that sit on top of, perhaps, an employer-funded base. ","So really across the Board, we see a pretty long runway and a big opportunity to drive additional growth.","Operator","We will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","Wanted to start off with a question on capital generation, I noticed that -- I think if I backtrack in that part of the $150 million of debt repurchase and the equity or the share repurchases and so on, I think it gets to roughly $100 million of excess capital generated this quarter. And I want to see if my math is correct, and if so why it's a little bit late compared to the $550 million to $650 annual run rate that you guided to?","Richard McKenney","","It's a good question on our capital generation, and I think this quarter we saw a good, you've to go back to our statutory earnings, which actually were back on track that we have seen over many, many quarters on average, which is right around $170 million, and you would note as well, that's up off of what was a lighter quarter in the first quarter. So you have to take that into account first.","As you look at the excess generation that we have, we continue to generate at a clip that I would expect overall. You have to take out of that, I think we're trying to do that, take out of that some of the work with debt issuance and repurchase and all the different pieces. But if you do take those different pieces out, we feel very good about our generation, where that lands and our ability to redeploy that. So, you would have seen in the quarter that we actually bought back $100 million of our stock. We feel good that we're continuing to retire some of our shares. ","And in conjunction, you would have seen our dividend increase that we did as well. So, we go through and you could reconcile the numbers a lot of different ways, but I would say very much that our capital generation plans are on track and very consistent with what we would have talked about last year at investor day and how we look for the rest of the year.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. I guess I'm still little confused, because I guess, if I take out the $100 million in buyback, $37 million dividends, $35 million interests, I get to the $505 million remaining, and then ultimately you came at $616 million. So, I guess that means about $100 million of excess cash generation. Again, it seems a little low relative what you had guided to on an annual basis.","Richard McKenney","","So, I'd add one add in there, but I'd not spend the time on this call to go through it. We could take you offline with that. But add in the UK capital generation as well, which has been very consistent over a period of time. But we're happy to take you through that offline, Yaron.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","","And then switching gears to long-term care, clearly you had a good quarter there, yet one of your competitors seem to have to run into some trouble there and is reviewing assumptions, just want to hear your thoughts on as you look at your legacy book and the older vintages, what you are seeing there and how comfortable you are with results there?","Jack McGarry","Yes. We had a very favorable quarter in the second quarter. We also reported a favorable quarter in the first quarter, driven by favorable submitted new claims, both the incidence rate was favorable as well as the severity with good claim resolutions during the quarter. So, we really didn't see some of the things that perhaps some of our competitors saw in the quarter. I'd note that it's a small immature block. It's going to be volatile. We don't -- we aren't changing our long-term outlook of a loss ratio in the 85 to 90% range, but it was just -- was a good quarter. It's good to see it. It's good to put it in the bank. And we continue to very aggressively manage and monitor the block going forward.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates","","Mostly asked and answered, but I do want to go back to the sales in Group DI. I understand ACA or whatever, and maybe that has something to do with it, although I find it hard to believe. But just my question is, why 2Q? Usually, things are very, very flat. There is not -- in my sense, there's not a whole lot of activity, flat between 1Q and 2Q, and all the big activity happens in 4Q. That's where you tend to see the surge in business being done. So, is there anything to say about why now?","Michael Simonds","","Yes, sure. I mean I think maybe one of the things that you're getting to, Steven is right. So, fourth quarter is going to be the biggest quarter from a sales perspective in group insurance, because that's when you're one-one decisions are sorted. And so, actually, you'll see a little less volatility I find in the fourth quarter, because the volume is bigger. And so, second quarter not being the largest from historical pattern, quarterly, seasonality, being the biggest quarter you are subject to more volatility. ","And that's where I think we saw was not our biggest sales quarter. A number of things broke our way, and when that happens, I think good things can happen. So, seven ones are the primary - July 1, effective date for the primary group sales that are getting submitted in the second quarter here. ","Again, strategically feel very good about where those sales are coming through. But because it's a smaller sales quarter, it is subject to a bit more volatility.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","","The 26%, I think, effective tax rate in the quarter, Rick, what should we be thinking about as it relates to the tax rate for the remainder of the year?","Richard McKenney","","Actually, John, we would, say calculate right out of 30%. So we may be moving some of the non-operating items in and out that are --","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Oh, maybe I did. Okay. That's fairly --","Richard McKenney","","30%, that's our expectation for the year. So it's tracking very much for our expectations.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Okay. And you mentioned miscellaneous investment income, maybe, a little bit high in the Closed Block. And, overall was there anything notable in miscellaneous investment income relative to sort of the run rate in the last several quarters?","Richard McKenney","","No, I think that when you look at it, on average it was maybe a tick or two higher than normal, but nothing that was out of a reasonable range of expectations.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee & Leach","","Okay. And then, just an overall question on guidance. Yes, I recognize, maybe we all recognize that there has got to be some allowance for volatility in underwriting results and that sort of thing but clearly some real strength in the first half of the year. ","Even the upper-end of your full-year, 10% EPS growth suggests the back-half of the year would be a lower earnings period relative to the first half. Affirm the guidance instead of maybe slightly raising the range. I am just wondering if you guys have contemplated that, and if you had and decided against raising the range, what was the key reasons?","Richard McKenney","","Certainly, I'll split that into two parts for you, John. One is, how we think about it from our process perspective; our outlook. As we talked about a number of our things we have seen here, we really do refer back to what we're doing last year, and we looked at 5 to 10% and it will be very unlikely that we would change that, unless we saw something taking that out of the range through the first half of the year. So, I don't want to discount. We're very happy with our first half results. We've had some things that went in our favor, certainly. But there's nothing, as we look to the back-half of the year, that I am overly concerned about and in bringing that down. But it's just almost from our process perspective, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily adjust that unless we saw something taking us outside that range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","","The first question is on group disability. Your performance there continues to be quite strong, especially relative to peers, with the benefit ratio now sub-82%. Can you comment at all -- I am sure you've looked across the industry to decipher broader trends. But can you comment at all about why you think your book has performed so differently, because I think, virtually, everyone else in the industry has seen some level of deterioration. And the one thing that comes to mind for me is, you have consistently flagged better claim recoveries and maybe that's where you're outperforming, but anyway, any help on that would be appreciated.","Tom Watjen","","And let me actually take it (inaudible) Tom, but then actually ask Mike to speak to it in more detail. But sometimes we try to get too cute about what distinguishes us from everybody else. I think as you know, we've prided ourselves for the last six or eight years around a very disciplined approach to the business. And that's word gets oftentimes overused. But I think it's very important here, because we have a very disciplined plan of attack for all of our businesses, we have very disciplined pricing and underwriting in all of our businesses. And as you know, if we look over a longer period, that means, at times, we haven't grown as fast as some of our competitors actually have grown, because we put a higher priority on margin and manageability and risk management frankly, than some have done.","So, I think to a degree, just, as Mike makes his comment, I think as an overall institution. We've put a lot of priority on the importance of disciplines, staying focused and being sure we incent people to do the right things as it relates to those things.","So, there is certainly probably some nuances about why we can do a little better, but I would say, first and foremost, it's that disciplined approach to the marketplace, I think, that frankly all of our businesses benefit from. And Mike, want to pick up on that little bit?","Michael Simonds","","And so, just to build on Tom's point, what you would've seen from us over the last several years is earn premium that's relatively flat to a tick or two down in long-term visibility. And I think part of that is the pricing discipline out there. ","In the market, it was good to see the segments start to grow just a little bit here, but I think it is reflective of front-end acquisition pricing, as well as on the backend. And so, even here in the second quarter, strong sales, but we continue to look through the Block. ","On cases in the renewal program, we achieved increases of the 6 to 8% range, depending on whether you're talking about core or large-case, where we've had strong persistency, 89%. The business that's turned has come off and has been performing at five points to eight points lower than the active blocks. So it's a continuous active pruning process in terms of the pricing. But then, yes, absolutely, we sort of look at, okay, what are the investments that we've made in underwriting and then in benefits organization in general.","So to give you a little color, LTD submitted incidence, for instance, was pretty much in line, but a little bit volatile, paid incidence was rock steady. And so what actually comes through in terms of our liability acceptance rates, in terms of paid incidence, recovery trends, what we've been able to achieve in terms of settlements and offsets, all those operational metrics have been in line with expectation to slightly improve. So again, can't comment on any particular competitor, but feel very good about the position of the block and what our anticipated trends would be going forward.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","","The next question is stat earnings looked solid. Can you comment on a more consolidated enterprise-wide basis? How did they -- how were the captive results this quarter? I presume based on the performance, at least the gap numbers on the Closed Block, those probably were additive, because just wanted to see what that adjustment would be that the 171.","Richard McKenney","","When you think about our different captives that we have out there, I think the one that I would note is Northwind was probably a little bit lighter this quarter, but that goes back to what we saw from the individual disability results in our Closed Block. So that's the only of note, that I'd it was really off of from that perspective. And as you know, the capital results in there are for a very different operation and structure, and everything else and so that's why we exclude it from our normal stat earnings, and I think that's still appropriate.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","","And Rick, did Northwind lose money this quarter and if so, how much?","Richard McKenney","","Yes. I don't think I could quantify that at the moment, but I think that it's going to be pretty breakeven I think is ultimately where it came down to.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","","Okay. And I guess, my last question is on long-term care, which would be for, Rick. So, the favorable claims that you're seeing right now and I know it's doing better than your longer-term expectations. But if we assume that it continues to remain anywhere, let's say, couple of 100 basis points around this level, does this -- would this get you out of harm's way with the potential risk of a GAAP balance sheet charge, if you look out over the next few years? And I know the GAAP balance sheet issue is more -- I know there's a heavy-duty interest rate component to that. But I just want to understand the sensitivities based on where we're trending right now and whether that might actually alleviate the need to strengthen GAAP.","Richard McKenney","","Sure. Tom, when you think about the claim trends that we are seeing right now are certainly very good and much better than we would have seen a year ago. The question is, how do those influence our longer-term expectations around the block of business? And that's a little bit more challenging. So, if time is in dimension to that, so instead if we continue to see this for a long period of time and becomes a trend, that's certainly quite helpful. But the question is, how it would that inference our long-term trends.","And we're going through a process, and that's where I take you back, you highlighted another aspect that we obviously have to continue to look at. Price increases continue to go well out there in the marketplace, so I'd iterate that. The liabilities of our book of business, which include this claim, trend that we're seeing right now, pretty good, happy about what we saw here in the second quarter. ","And third piece is interest rate, and interest rate is obviously continuing to be quite challenging. So, you take all those different pieces together, we will continue to look at them, and monitor them and work through that as we get closer to our year-end process.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","","And so, Rick, would an update on all that likely occur in 4Q of this year?","Richard McKenney","","I think that's probably realistic. We don't like to talk about the specific quarters, because we reflect it as we know things. But I think that fourth quarter traditionally, has been where we've brought all that together in a comprehensive look.","Tom Watjen","","And right not just this block, but all the other blocks.","Richard McKenney","","All of our blocks. That's our normal processes as we get to closer to year-end.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","","In the UK, I believe you noted you retained more the group life reinsurance program you had. If that's the case, just wondering what percentage of that program you recaptured? And where you think that could trend to, now that it appears -- you've stabilized and improved the profitability there?","Richard McKenney","","Yes. So, I'll take you back, Chris, to the process we went through actually two years ago, and actually reinsuring the majority of the or I should say the half of that block of business and other bloodlines of business. I think that was a good move. We were seeing volatility at that time and we're going through re-pricing. And so, I think we're happy we did that. ","At the beginning of this year, we retained 25% of that. So, we actually recaptured a quarter of the block back. As we get into year-end, we will have to make those decisions, in terms of where our pricing in the market is, where our profitability levels are, etc. But I think the actions we've taken and the team in the UK have taken are very prudent to-date. And we will evaluate that as we get closer to year-end.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","","Okay. And then, wondering what impact the strong sales growth is having on RBC strain? And if it's not that material, just given the continued favorable trends you guys are seeing, the potential for buybacks maybe to accelerate, maybe, towards that the top-end of the target you provided in December?","Richard McKenney","","I'd like to have a discussion, because as we see this growth, I think that we've always said that the first thing we want to do with our capital is continue to grow our business. And I think we're seeing that. We are very happy about that. The second piece of that is when does it become material to change our capital outlook and we're not near that yet. So, thinking about it from a premium perspective and the growth that we're seeing, it's certainly something we will continue to update you on. ","But that's something we'd like to see, but we're not in the any point where we're changing our outlook around how we deploy capital in the near-term. But that will be a great discussion to have if we continue to grow at a more rapid rate than even what we are seeing today from a premium perspective.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","","Okay. Then last one, don't even know if there's a discussion to be add here but for Jack, any evolving thoughts or developments around potential reinsurance or risk reduction opportunities in long-term care?","Jack McGarry","We continue to stay abreast of the market. We continue to talk about it. I don't think there's been a material change where the marketplace is. Still a lot of interest in the asset side of long-term care and much less interest in the liability side of long-term care. And so, I think until we get more stability in the marketplace and those two views come closer together, we will continue to do to look at it, but it's not a short-term option right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","","I just wanted to again return to sales and maybe just baseline my understanding of what the outlook was, and when you were talking about the strength in two quarters sales, you spoke about anomaly in terms of the easy comps and skipping over 2013 and looking back to 2012, does that extend for the entire year's 7 to 10% sales growth? And the reason I ask is, suppose if I was looking at this over just 2013 levels, which was, of course, a lower sales year, the 7 to 10% would imply, I believe, flat sales growth for the back-half of the year. ","But if I am looking relative to a compounded rate of growth over 2012, which was obviously a higher rate of sales, we are talking mid double digit growth in the back-half of the year. ","So, just trying to baseline what the expectations are?","Michael Simonds","","So, I we will run into tougher comparables as momentum picked up over the second half of last year and we talked about it earlier, there is a lot of work to do between now and the end of the year, we have 55 to 60% of the sales here yet to book. So, going to be a little bit cautious about making predictions, but I would anticipate that, we put guidance on the 7 to 10% for the year, I think that's actually a reasonable guidance for the pure second half as well, sort of in that mid-single digit approaching 10%; all that with the caveat that there is a lot of work to do. And as we talked about numerous times, part of the determination will be with the pricing environment out there, because we will stay pretty consistent. And if the market allows us to do that, we will certainly take it if not we'll live with the lower number.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","","Okay. So, the full-year sales growth outlook, though, relative to 2013, at least in the US, you would expect to exceed that 10% range?","Michael Simonds","","I think it's right at the top of the range, maybe a bit over it potentially; but again, a lot of work to do between now and then.","Tom Watjen","","So, I think what you hear is a sense of optimism about the things that we can't control. And I think that's where Mike, is right to point to the fact that, listen, we've got some good pipeline activity underway. We always do worry about a second half and competitors are behind sales plans that they do crazy things in the marketplace. So, please don't misconstrue anything we're saying for a lack of confidence in the second half. We can't control what happens in the marketplace, and we've seen times where people have done some crazy things when they get behind sales plans.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","","No, that's helpful, and was mainly looking to baseline expectations here. ","And in terms of premium growth, I think you also mentioned this year, maybe to hit the upper-end of that range, and next year maybe get a tick or two higher than the 2% premium growth. ","Given a normal sales environment, is that type of topline growth we should be looking for or as we look out farther in a normalized environment, we see premium growth maybe a little more than 3%?","Tom Watjen","","Yes. Rick, why don't you take that? Because I think maybe it's also a reminder. I think you said it in your comments, we try not to go back and redo the outlook sort of midpoint, unless there something really significant going on. But obviously, our Investor Day meeting is a chance to recalibrate everything. But maybe just talk about how (multiple speakers)","Richard McKenney","","Yes. And I think that the - actually, well, Seth, we would look to recalibrate that as we continue to go. And couple of things I'd highlight from the overall Mike said it very well as has Randy, I think when you look at where we are, our sales look good today. Our competitiveness feels pretty good where we are today. Importantly, our persistency is holding very well, and I think that's something we don't talk probably as much about, but that's very good. Our customers are certainly keeping us on the books. And the last piece, which is something we don't know yet today, but I think we're giving you the indication, that we are seeing better employment picture out there. And that's the first time we really have done that. And if all three of those things work in concert, I think you will see some good premium numbers as we take you to our outlook at the end of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Devine with Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir.","Colin Devine - Jefferies","","A couple of questions. One, if I think about the US business, really for the last eight years, if I look at the benefit ratio on a trailing 12 month basis, and including this quarter, it's been a very steady turn down. And yet if I look at the expense ratio, for the most part, it's been fairly flat. There's been some improvement, but not a lot. Is that something, as you look ahead, where you might be able to leverage technology to drive some change there? So that's one question.","Second, for Rick, with respect to capital, I look at every one of the businesses, the US, UK, Colonial, all solid 15%, at least the ROEs this quarter, and yet we still got the Closed Block, obviously, probably producing about 4. ","When I think of the IDI piece of that, which I assume is still about half, about half of the debt has been retired from when you did the securitization a few years back. Is there an opportunity to roll that, so we can get a little bit more leverage on that to help boost the overall ROE? Thanks.","Tom Watjen","","Thanks, Colin. Mike, do you want to pick the first one up about the US business and the component piece of benefit and expenses?","Michael Simonds","","And I think there's actually a relationship that's worth pointing out between the two, benefit ratio and expense ratios. So, one of the drivers that led to that pretty steady improvement in the benefit ratio is the shift in the mix of business, where we moved with greater growth rate in the core smaller end of the market, and we shifted more towards employee pay. Both of those businesses tend to have lower loss ratios, but they also tend to be -- have higher operating expense ratios.","You are dealing with more transactions to get at the same number of insurance. So, actually it's taken a series of investments in technology and business process to maintain the operating expense ratio\u00a0because without the actions, we would have naturally seen the operating expense ratio drift up a bit as we shifted the mix the way that we have. And as we look forward, we will continue to look for stronger growth in those businesses in particular and I think feel confident that we can offset that natural mix shift and the pressure that it creates on the operating expense ratio, and maybe do a little bit better than that as we look at, probably not quarter-to-quarter, but over the next several years, continue to find some ways to improve that operating expense ratio.","The priority though is about better serving clients and finding ways that we can grow that top line, because as you pointed out, we feel actually pretty good about where benefit ratios are. We see a little bit of improvement but we're looking to generate operating earnings out of disciplined top line growth. And that's where the priority is going to be. ","Tom Watjen","","And then might I add, that investment in certain expenses, which ultimately helped the service levels improve our ability to cross-sell, which we talked about earlier.","Colin Devine - Jefferies","","That's right. That's right. That's good.","Tom Watjen","","Rick, do you want to pick up on the capital question?","Richard McKenney","","Yes, I'd like to, Colin, actually, I think that it's a great question. And we think about all of our liabilities including those at the back -- to liabilities and others in terms of what we can do. We try to be very active in terms of how we manage that. You would have seen that in this quarter with the retirement of our UK debt and looking at that.","And particularly to the instruments that you're talking about that are backing our Closed Block. You're about right, it has run down over time and has halved. The liabilities have run down as well over that period of time. I would tell you that the team that put that in place prior to my time here, did a very good job and got a very good structure. ","It is floating rate in nature, so they actually -- the interest rates being down don't help you from a refinancing perspective, but it's certainly something we look at, just like we look at all of our liabilities in terms of, is there opportunity there.","But the more ideas you have like that around our capital, Colin, we'd be happy to take them on and look at them. Because I think it's something we have tried to be very active on, is managing the balance sheet and on an ongoing basis. Thanks for the question.","Colin Devine - Jefferies","","Yes. Just one quick follow-up, is the old IDI block still running, I guess about a cash flow neutral where you just don't have the interest rate sensitivity there anymore, or what's coming in in premiums is just paying the clients?","Richard McKenney","","That's exactly right. Still like that. I think the only place that you have to watch that as bonds get called in in this low-rate environment, but to-date, it's run very much cash flow neutral.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn things over to Mr. White for any closing remarks.","Thomas White","","Let me just finish up here, Danny, if I could. We - certainly for those on the line, we know there's a lot going on this morning, and thank you all for taking time to join us, and Danny, this will complete our second quarter 2014 earnings call.

Our first quarter results were an excellent start to 2017. We saw a continuation of many of the positive trends we have seen over the last several quarters. Our after tax operating income per share excluding after tax realized investment gains and losses and the impact of the guaranty fund assessment was $1.02. That is a record high for us and a strong increase of 8.5% relative to the year ago quarter. ","This currently exceeds our full year expectation for growth of 3% to 6%. This strong performance was well balanced throughout our business segments with particularly strong results in Unum U.S. and Colonial Life as premium growth and benefits experience remain favorable. Our Unum UK results were up slightly relative to our expectation this quarter as our benefit results experienced some claim volatility. I would note that our UK business continues to maintain a high level of profitability and operating return on equity. ","Finally we saw stable results in our Closed Block operations. I believe that we have proven our ability to consistently produce strong results during these uneven business conditions and that we remain very well positioned in our markets. We enter 2017 with great momentum and a strong focus on the disciplined execution of our customer focused business plan. I believe our first quarter results are a continuation of that trend. In addition our strategy has kept us in step with the changes occurring in the employee benefits markets and are soul focus in this space is increasingly an advantage for us. ","An example has been that as the market shifted more and more towards employee engagement and shared funding our business model has kept pace. Also the scale of our business is increasingly an advantage. It enables us to have a depth of data in the pricing of new business, scaled operations in the administration of our in-force business, and industry leading management of claims. And finally the strength of our combined Unum U.S., Unum UK, and Colonial Life distribution systems provide unique reach into the broker and business to business benefits marketplace. Allowing us to effectively serve employer groups of all sizes and industries and this is translating to our results. ","So let me give a little more context from what we saw in the quarter. Starting with the top line, our growth remains very good. Adjusted for foreign exchange our recent reinsurance arrangement we saw our core premiums grow almost 6%. Unum U.S. and Colonial Life continued their momentum with solid mid single-digit premium growth for the first quarter combined with good persistency. Sales were solid as well in the first quarter with Unum U.S. and Unum UK increasing double-digits and Colonial Life keeping pace with just over 7% growth. Overall it was a great start. ","For the overall return perspective, our profit margins remain very strong in our core business segments with operating return on equity for each of our core businesses above 15%. We believe this illustrates a disciplined approach we take to the fundamentals of our business for pricing and underwriting of new business cases to the management of our ongoing business relationships. This continues to produce a good balance between solid top line growth and strong profit margins. ","These growth trends and strong profit margins across our business line continue to generate capital and free cash flow. For the first quarter we generated approximately $180 million in after tax specialty [ph] operating income. Our risk capital levels and holding company cash position finished the quarter in excellent shape. As a result we continued to have substantial flexibility to fund the growth in our business and continue to invest at our core operations to enhance our position in the employee benefits market. We also continue as we have done for several years to repurchase our shares and look to increase our dividend which we have historically addressed in our board meeting. ","So in summary it was a very good start to the year. Market conditions continue to present some challenges but I believe that our focus on disciplined execution of our business plans to serve the needs of employers and employees we will serve our shareholders well. We remain optimistic that our actions to position Unum for a long-term sustainable growth will produce benefits for years to come. So with those highlights and excellent quarter I\u2019ll ask Jack to discuss our first quarter results in greater detail. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you Rick and good morning everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our first quarter results and I will now provide a more in-depth view of the things we're seeing in our businesses. First of all it was an outstanding quarter for Unum overall. Our after tax operating income per share of $1.02 is an increase of 8.5% over the year ago quarter. We continued to be pleased with the strong balance we're experiencing between the operational performance drivers of our EPS growth and the capital management drivers. Our after tax operating income increased 5.3% to $236.1 million for the first quarter while our share repurchase activity contributed 3.2% to our after tax operating income per share growth relative to last year. ","Similar to last quarter our growth in before tax operating income was led by our Unum U.S. segment which produce operating income for the first quarter of 239.1 million, an increase of 10.7% over last year. Each of our Unum U.S. business lines performed well. Group disability had an outstanding quarter once again with before tax operating income of 88.7 million, an increase of approximately 26% relative to last year. ","The earnings growth was primarily driven by a strong improvement in the benefit ratio from 80.6% in the first quarter of 2016 to 76.6% in this quarter. This benefit ratio includes the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and it's within the 76% to 79% range that we communicated to you in the December Investor Meeting. ","This quarter's improvement was primarily driven by favorable incidence trends in the group LTD product line, lower presence rates in the group STD product line, and the cumulative benefit of rate increases on renewals over the past several quarters. Group disability premium income growth was 0.7% over the year ago quarter. The group Life and AD&D lines produced another steady solid quarter with operating income of 56 million in the first quarter, an increase of 1.1% over the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.7% over the year ago quarter and the benefit ratio was steady at 71.9% in the quarter compared to 71.5% last year. Underlying risk results were generally consistent with our expectations but we did experience a slight higher average claim size in the AD&D product line. ","The supplemental and voluntary lines continued to perform well and generated a substantial contribution to our earnings with the forecast operating income of 94.4 million, an increase of about 5% over the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remained very favorable increasing 11.2% in the quarter compared to last year. I will remind you that we executed a reinsurance transaction in the individual disability line in the fourth quarter. This transaction lowered revenues by about 25 million which was offset by a reduction in the sum of benefits, commissions, and expenses of about 25 million. ","It caused a slight elevation of the benefit ratio but it had no material impact on the operating income of the line. Our voluntary benefits business continues to grow with premium income increasing 6% for the first quarter while the benefit ratio improved to 42.2% in the first quarter compared to 43.8% a year ago. In addition the recent acquisition of Starmount contributed 41.5 million in dental and vision premium income to the supplemental and voluntary lines. ","Sales increased by 11% for Unum U.S. in the first quarter. Driving this growth was our voluntary benefits line which increased 17% in the first quarter. The addition of the dental and vision product line also benefited our sales this quarter and we continue to see good acceptance in the market and strong core activity from these new product offerings. Our group sales declined 4.7% this quarter relative to last year with higher short term disability sales offset by declines in group long-term visibility and group life. We're very pleased that we continue to see strong growth in our voluntary benefits offerings both for Unum U.S. which focuses on the larger case broker market and Colonial Life which tends to focus on the smaller case market as well as the public sector market. ","The growth we are experiencing as a result of our approach to the VB market over the past several years continues to diversify our business and provide us with a strong and consistent source of earnings growth. Even UK had a tougher quarter where the before tax operating income was lower than the year ago quarter and slightly under our expectations. For the first quarter 2017 operating income was 21.4 million pounds sterling compared to 23.5 million pounds in the year ago quarter. Our premium income grew by 0.6% in the first quarter on local currency continuing the trend we saw in 2016 of a lack of growth in the in-force block. This is widely driven by economic uncertainties brought on by Brexit. ","Our benefits experienced overall was off from last year with a benefit ratio of 71.4% for the first quarter compared to 67.9% in the year ago quarter. Approximately 2% of the increase from the benefit ratio was driven by the inflation linked benefit which was offset by higher net investment income. A higher average size of new claim incurrals in the group long-term disability line also contributed to the increase while our group -- business were generally favorable compared to a year ago. ","In response to low interest rates in the UK we also lowered our discount rate for new claims by 80 basis points which we expect to continue to pressure year-over-year earnings growth for the remainder of the year. As Rick mentioned in his opening remarks, while the Unum UK results were slightly below our expectation this business continues to produce very good profit margins and the operating return on equity was slightly under 16% for the quarter. The exchange rate remains a pressure point with an exchange rate of 1.24 for the first quarter consistent with the fourth quarter 2016 but below the year ago first quarter of 1.43. Our outlook for this year assumes an exchange rate of 1.25, we expect this to continue to impact our reported results in 2017.","Sales in Unum UK remained strong increasing 24.2% over the year ago quarter on a local currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by the success in the large case market. Persistency was lower in the first quarter at 84.5% compared to 85.6% a year ago but was in line with our expectations for the year and reflects our renewed efforts on in-force cases. ","Colonial Life once again delivered a strong and consistent results. In fact we had record quarterly operating income of 82.4 million, an increase of 6.5% over last year. Premium income growth continues at a healthy pace increasing 6.6% for the quarter driven by the good sales momentum we produced over the past several years. Our benefits experience remain generally in line with our recent trends as well as our expectations with the benefit ratio of 50.8% for the first quarter compared to 50.9% in the year ago quarter. ","In addition the momentum we\u2019ve seen in our sales trends for Colonial Life remain positive with an increase of 7.2% for the first quarter. This is especially strong when you consider that the year ago first quarter sales growth was 16%. This increase was primarily driven by growth in the core commercial market which increased by 13.2% relative to the year ago quarter. We also saw a very good balance with new account sales increasing 3.2% in the quarter while existing account sales grew by 8.9%. Persistency for Colonial Life remained stable at 78.5%. ","Finally for the Closed Block, operating income was 31.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 33.7 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line the interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.6% in the quarter compared to 84% in the year ago quarter. This slight year-over-year improvement was primarily the result of lower new playing incidents and favorable mortality experience. For the long-term care line the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.6% for the first quarter compared to the year ago ratio of 88.9%. This slight improvement was primarily driven by favorable mortality experience. Importantly the long-term care benefit ratio remains within our expected range of 85% to 90%. ","Overall we continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re seeing in managing the long-term care block. Our claims experience has remained generally in line with our assumption since the end of 2014 when we updated our reserve assumptions to reflect our current view of the business. We are also making good progress on rate increase approvals on our in-force business. This past quarter we received several rate increase approvals and though they tended to be in smaller states we're tracking very well relative to the rate increase assumptions we\u2019ve factored into our reserves. Our reserve assumptions only factored in rate increases request related to our 2014 program. We also discounted our assumptions for what we thought we would realistically receive from state insurance departments. We\u2019ve not factored in any benefit from rate increases that we expect to file forward in the future. In addition the landing spot continues to be viewed favorably by regulators and policy holders who are favoring this option in their elections. ","As for interest rates and new money yields we once again exceeded our new money yields objective of 5% this quarter. Since our reserve adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2014, we have consistently exceeded this target giving us incremental margin in our reserves. All of these business trends have again resulted in excellent statutory income for the company. After tax statutory operating income for the first quarter was 180.1 million. Well, this is slight decline relative to the first quarter a year ago when we exclude the guaranty fund assessment our statutory income was 193.5 million, a 5% increase over last year and an excellent start to the year. ","As we discussed with you, statutory results drive capital strength and free cash flow generation. We finished the first quarter with a weighted average risk based capital ratio of our traditional U.S. insurance companies in excess of 390%. Our holding company cash position excluding amounts committed for subsidiary contributions totaled 648 million at quarter end, higher than our year-end 2016 total of 594 million. ","Our capital position and cash generation capability are source of great strength for the company. It provides us tremendous financial flexibility in our pursuit of optimizing the value of the company for our shareholders. Part of that flexibility shows up on our capital deployment strategy. By the first quarter we again repurchased 100 million of our shares consistent with the trend of the past several quarters and in line with our outlook for the year. ","Quickly looking at investments results, interest rates were improved in the early part of the first quarter which allowed us to meet or exceed our assumptions for new yields. Although interest rates have softened somewhat since March, they are still significantly higher than last year particularly at the long end of the yield curve. So to wrap up, as we outlined for you in our Investor Meeting back in December, we continue to expect our after tax operating income per share for 2017 to grow within a range of 3% to 6%. Keeping in mind that our starting point is now $3.88 per share reflecting the reporting of the amortization of prior period actual gains or losses on our pension plan as an operating item in our corporate segment. ","While our growth of 8.5% in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, it's still too early in the year to make any adjustments to our outlook. However, I am very pleased with our results for the quarter and the momentum I see in our business. We are executing very well on our strategies which remain focused on growing our core business in a disciplined manner to help us maintain strong profit margins and cash flow. This focus has served us well with shareholders in the past and we believe we will continue to do so in the future. ","Now I will turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments. ","Rick McKenney","Great, thank you Jack. I will also reiterate how pleased I am with our first quarter. Additionally I remain very pleased not only with the financial position of the company that Jack described but also the strategic position in the Employee Benefits market space. So now we will move on to your questions, and I will ask Tiffany to begin the question-and-answer session. Tiffany?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Let's take our first question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead. ","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Looking at the voluntary benefit sales in the Unum U.S. being very strong in the quarter, I was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of why -- what's driving the strong sales in voluntary benefits? ","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Humphrey. I will ask for voluntary benefit sales both in Unum U.S. and in Colonial Life to Mike specific to the Unum U.S. ","Mike Simonds","Thanks and good morning Humphrey. Good strong sales quarter and it's important because for the Unum U.S. brokerage voluntary sales 1Q is our typically biggest sales quarter of the year. So it was good to see a strong result. I'd say the long-term story is unchanged which is just a gradual but continued shift from employer towards employee choice and funding. And so we've worked hard to make investments in the product portfolio, distribution, and enrolment capabilities as Rick mentioned to keep pace with that. I would say within the quarter it is actually broad based. We saw a good new number of new clients come on board from a voluntary benefit stand point as well as a strong reenrollment activity with existing clients. I would say at the large end of the market we had some success. That can be a little bit volatile, that probably elevated the result a bit in the quarter but feel really good about the fundamental strength of the business.","Rick McKenney","It's great, let me turn it back to Tim Arnold too, I think the Colonial Life had a good quarter as well and it continues series of good quarters. So Tim you want to\u2026","Tim Arnold","Yeah, Humphrey, thank you for the question. We think there are a number of reasons driving the strong consistent performance that I would point to the unique capabilities that our agency distribution system offers. As I think Jack or Rick said earlier we have the ability to work on our business to business perspective and through brokers serving both the commercial and the public sector marketplaces. Last year's results were up 16%, it was driven very heavily by strong success in large case and public sector. This year our results were more heavily driven by success in the core markets. So we feel great about our ability to serve effectively all of the various markets in the U.S. Thanks Humphrey. ","Humphrey Lee","Alright, and then just another question so, obviously one of your big competitor has announced that they're looking to strategic alternatives for the employee benefits business, has that announcement created any impact on the marketplace in terms of competition or pricing? Can you just kind of in general terms talk about the current competitive landscape?","Rick McKenney","I will let Jack talk about the competitive landscape?","Jack McGarry","Sure, thanks Humphrey. So, generally our policy isn\u2019t to comment on any specific transaction that may or may not be in the marketplace but maybe to take your question more generally and talk about competitive trends. The group insurance market in particular remains a very competitive marketplace with a number of carriers I think looking to take some share. I think we -- I wouldn't call it abnormally competitive though, I\u2019d say probably the one place that stands out is what we would term the middle market. So that I think employers between 200 and 2000 employees. We have seen over the last couple of years carriers that typically play in the small end of the market look to move up as well as some carriers that play at the very high end of the market look to move down. They sort of all converge in the middle market and it's gotten a little bit choppy there. But on balance I'd say it's a pretty typically competitive market and we see plenty of opportunities to find ways to distinguish ourselves and grow over time. ","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Citi. ","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, good morning and I want to swing to the UK for a second, just want to get some more color in terms of what's going on there. I acknowledge that profitability remains quite strong but just some questions in terms of what you're seeing there and if there needs to be some pricing actions taken to address some of the higher claims and group disability?","Rick McKenney","Peter do you want to take that?","Peter O'Donnell","Yes, thanks very much Suneet. So, as Jack mentioned Q1 saw an higher severity for our good claims than we would expect. And you will see the discount rate coming through. Now, we didn't have the discount rate factored into our guidance. We are putting rate through to sort of counter that. So the question is, what's happening with severity? So we have analyzed this and whilst its above expectations its within a reasonable range of expectations. So our inter protection severity in the first quarter of 2017 was about 10% above the mean over the last 17 quarters. The last time we saw it at this level was around quarter four 2013 and during these 17 quarters, on three quarters we've been about 10% below that mean. So when we have analyzed it we've also looked at by type, by industry, by scheme size, and we see no discernible trends at this stage. So we're just marking this down to volatility. We would expect over a number of quarters to see that come back but it is all watch area obviously. ","Suneet Kamath","Got it and then maybe shifting to group LTD in the U.S. I mean obviously very strong results in the quarter. Just want to get a sense if was there some favorable volatility that helped you guys or I should be thinking about this maybe being a new base in terms of projecting going forward?","Rick McKenney","Mike, do you want to take it?","Mike Simonds","Yes sure do, it was a good quarter from a loss ratio perspective in group disability. But right within that range that we talked about 76% to 79% at Investor Day, I\u2019d say we probably are a bit lower in the range than we would have anticipated and that was on the back of favorable submitted new claim incidents but not abnormally. So, the big drivers, recoveries, offsets and long term disability are rock solid and right in line with expectation. ","Suneet Kamath","Alright, great, thanks. ","Mike Simonds","Thanks Suneet. ","Operator","Our next question is from John Nadel with Credit Suisse. ","John Nadel ","Hey, good morning everybody. A couple of questions; one, just on group life and disability sales in the U.S. maybe Mike you can comment on what if anything you're seeing in terms of a change or increase in the competitive environment there given the modest, I get that it's modest and it's not your biggest sales quarter but modest decline?","Mike Simonds","Sure John, absolutely and good morning. I agree that we're seeing pressure particularly in the core insurance market in that mid component of course. Of course everything under 2000 employees in the mid markets has proven to be pretty challenging. We're as you know going to stay disciplined, we're going to right business when we can do so at a long term sustainable level. But if I look at both groups life and group disability sales, I really think there's two slightly different stories. In the large end of the market as you know that's by nature a volatile kind of result quarter-to-quarter. And as I sort of look at the dynamics in that market and look at what we have in the pipeline I feel optimistic about that business. I feel optimistic about the quarter as well but it's probably a bit more of a watch area given the competitive environment. ","John Nadel ","Okay, thank you. And then Jack I was hoping you could sort of give us an update on what if anything you guys are pursuing strategically transaction wise structurally as it relates to the long-term care block, looks like obviously results this quarter were pretty stable and rate increase filings continue to go through but because I know you had touched on the idea of trying to wall off this business into a separate legal entity, any further progress there in terms of at least the thoughts, I know it'll take some time? ","Jack McGarry","I guess my comment would be that we start off all the alternatives I think and events just suggested some other ones around what we could do with the long-term care block, we're actively pursuing the reasonable alternatives. None of them are easy, none of them are basically things we can do alone. But we do work with our regulator where we are happy with the progress we're making. But again it's going to be a long-term process. ","John Nadel ","Yeah understood, and then last one Rick just -- I wouldn't ever ask you to comment on a specific acquisition opportunity but I am curious given some of the news off late how you think about size of a transaction that you think Unum could be willing to undertake, if you have -- if you really decided that a target was a strategic fit, how you think about financing something larger than just with cash on hand? ","Rick McKenney","Thanks John, the answer is lot speculative in terms of really saying or commenting on any market rumors out there. I would say M&A is a part of our overall strategy. You have seen us do a couple of smaller transactions here and couple that fit very well strategically. As we think about how things will play in the markets but we will make sure that we do so in a disciplined way. It has got to fit both strategically, it's got to be something that we do very well and then we'll look at the other means such as financing. Jack, maybe you could talk a little bit about M&A though it is one piece of our capital deployment strategy and how that fits might be helpful. ","Jack McGarry","Yes, and John we've always been active in the M&A market. We closed on two properties over the last two years. Both were dental and vision properties, kind of strategic properties for us. But we maintain the same view of our capital plans. The first thing we do is look to invest in our ongoing businesses and grow organically. The second priority is around mergers and acquisitions. We do believe with the strength of our free cash flow generation, the fact that where we repurchasing 400 million of shares a year and as we've talked about we think our free cash flow generation with a strong statutory results, we thought of late is on an improving trend. We could handle a reasonably sized acquisition with where we are. But it would have to be, it would have to meet our goals. ","We're going to continue to be disciplined in the acquisition arena, we're going to continue to look at acquisitions versus the very safe option of repurchasing our shares. We continue to think our shares are good value in the marketplace. We continue to believe we have upside as a company and so it would need to be more attractive than us in order to do that. The third thing we look at is our dividend and maintaining our -- paying our dividend we have increased the dividend pretty consistently over time. You know I think we'll continue to look strongly at that as an opportunity to deploy capital and then finally share repurchases is the final option if mergers and acquisitions and other things don't stop share repurchase but it's been very effective for us. It has contributed to earnings per share growth. And it's been a good return for our investment over time. ","Rick McKenney","So hopefully it is -- we\u2019re not going to hit -- we\u2019re not going to pinpoint what we're going to do or how are we going to do it but I think hopefully you get a sense from Jack's comments and mine that we have a great capital generation, good operating businesses. We have a lot of choices, a lot of financial flexibility but we will do, we'll deploy those as Jack talked about in a very disciplined way with a lot of thought going through that and how it fits with our overall franchise.","John Nadel ","Yeah, I really appreciate the commentary. Thank you so much. ","Operator","The next question comes from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on premium growth in U.S. group disability and I guess to the U.S. as a whole sort of in line with the trends you set out at the guidance call but good disability looks like it suffered as we saw a little bit of a tick down in persistency. Could you just comment on these lower persistency levels and the lower premium growth we saw year-over-year, is this sort of a new normal or is it more of a temporary phenomenon given the recent pricing actions you have taken?","Mike Simonds","Hey Seth its Mike, I\u2019ll take it. Appreciate the question. You are correct, persistency dropped by about a point but I think it's important to keep in mind that that's from a historical high that we've enjoyed over the last couple of years and in the high 80's across both groups segments. We feel really good about where we're situated and the care we're taking of our clients that they're staying with us at that rate. But that tick down in persistency paired with relatively flat sales year as we stayed disciplined on the new pricing front combined to put a little bit of downward pressure on the group disability earned premium line for sure. ","Like I said I am optimistic on the new sales front as we sort of look forward into the pipeline. So I don't expect the premium trends to change dramatically. I think the mid-term outlook is a positive for some improvement there and I do think it is important to take one step back to and maybe look at the business in total. It is very good to see such strong both sales in our premium growth and voluntary benefits. It's really exciting to see the early days momentum in the dental and vision benefits business. And if you take all those lines together sales were actually up 11% in the quarter which is really encouraging and we're generating solid earned premium consistent with the optimism and the long-term growth story here. ","Seth Weiss","And then just to that point in terms of, I missed a little bit more of the house keeping question but the 2017 outlook for the total U.S. business is 3% to 5% premium growth, does that take into account the new contribution from dental and also the reinsurance transaction or should I try to strip out those changes and think about this more of an apples to apples basis when I think about that 3% to 5% premium growth outlook?","Mike Simonds","Thanks Seth, its net both those so you don't have to strip them out. It includes them.","Seth Weiss","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo Securities.","Sean Dargan","Thanks and good morning. Jack, I just wanted to follow up on the uses of cash. At the NAIC, your spring meeting, there was an update around the RBC factors for investments and designations are going to increase to 19 categories from 6. I'm wondering if you've done any work internally about thinking what this is going to mean to your RBC and if you're going to have to retain some cash to prepare for this?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so this has been around for a while. We\u2019re certainly contemplating it. Actually its less impactful to us because we have a really strong balance between our C1 and C3 risk and our C2 risk. So we\u2019re a liability driven company which makes that less impactful. Its easily absorbed within our cash plans with the exceptional statutory earnings we are generating. Feel very comfortable with cash. We\u2019re also at the high end of our range at 375% to 400% risk based capital. We don't think this will be a significant hit to that risk based capital and so we\u2019re well prepared to absorb that. ","Sean Dargan","Got it, great. And then you and many of your competitors were assessed for the Penn Treaty guaranty fund. I'm just wondering if this serves as a wakeup call to regulators when you're asking for rate increases on the LTC in-forces, has this I guess drawn greater attention to the fact that the carrier do need to get rate increased? ","Rick McKenney","Actually I will let Steve Zabel talk about that. ","Steve Zabel","Yeah, great, good question. I would tell you that the Penn Treaty discussion has been ongoing for years really at the regulatory level. So I think most of the regulators have been aware of the issue. They have become much more educated around long-term care in general. I think over the last years and that has kind of made it better for the carriers to have a discussion with them. So I don't think the liquidation itself is going to generate much change in the environment. But I do think it's influenced over the past years and continuing to do that. ","Sean Dargan","Okay, thank you. ","Rick McKenney","Thanks Sean. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Eric Bass from Autonomous Research. ","Eric Bass","Hi, thank you. So over the past several quarters you certainly had favorable underwriting experience but the whole industry is also pretty good at their underwriting results in U.S. So I was just wondering do you think this is a function of the improving economy or recent hard market pricing or some other factor? And then Mike you touched on that a little bit earlier but just given the strong margins do you see risk that people do become more aggressive and pushing for growth? ","Rick McKenney","Good question Eric, Mike do you want to take that. ","Mike Simonds","Yeah, sure Eric, actually really good question. And I think it's a story that's actually both are true. So if you break down what trends have done particularly in group visibility we have seen favorable new claims submission incidence and I suspect that some of that is a stronger economy and something that's felt industry wide. I would say though that when we look at things like the recovery trends and the offset levels that we've been able to maintain that we feel pretty good that those are standout type performances. So I feel good about that. I think in general we will hire margins across the industry feed more aggressive competition, I think to a degree but frankly we talked about in fourth quarter. We've been able to successfully price for the current interest rate environment. Feel really good about the risk trends. So the degree of new price increases that we have to put in the market frankly is lower than we've had to coming into a new year. And so we suspect that on a relative basis we will be similarly situated to where we've been in years past. ","Eric Bass","Got it and as interest rates rise would it be right to think that initially that will help your returns and that there will be a lag before people start to factor that into pricing? ","Steve Zabel","Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption. It takes some time for that to burn in. Actually you think about how much new money we're putting out relative to the portfolio overall, it's going to take -- it took some time on the downside, it will certainly take time should interest rates rise. But yes, over time we would see that as a tailwind. ","Eric Bass","Okay, thank you. ","Jack McGarry","Actually can I make a comment going back to Seth's question on long-term care and Penn Treaty. I think it's worth noting, Penn Treaty has been on rather long time among insurance commissioners in the rate increase discussion. What will be new about Penn Treaty is the premium tax offsets that you get for the assessments. So this is going to bring the long-term care issue front and center on state treasuries and Governors. And I think that may have a different kind of an impact of gaining support at the higher levels of state government for doing something about the long-term care issue. ","Rick McKenney","You actually can do that Jack. Time for the next question. ","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI. ","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning, just a follow up on the competitive environment in group. I guess if we look at both the sales and the persistency, both pretty good results but a little bit softer than where they've been. Just given how high the margins have been in that business should we be thinking in the next couple of years that you'd be lowering prices at all because I assume, just taking the midpoint of your range on group LTD in the high 70's that, that would imply like a very high ROE, if we kind of overlay that kind of result. So where I guess it's long winded way of asking like where is pricing now and where do you see that going, I assume it's no longer hardening and the question is would you consider trading better growth for giving up some margin going forward because it does look like you have some room here from an ROE standpoint? ","Mike Simonds","Thanks Tom, yeah it is Mike. Appreciate the question and I think you went to a productive place which is the returns on the business are really strong and they're in line with what our expectations would be for group insurance. So we are probably more in a mode of maintaining those returns versus looking to expand those. And I think that does present the opportunity for us on a relative basis and the market continue to focus on growth. I do think there's a constant, it's important to keep in mind there's constant work in your renewal program that even on average the block overall is performing. We're always working through the inventory of clients and looking at where each individual client's risk is performing. So there's always going to be that work that happens and it's sort of a critical component that's been successful in this business. But in sum total I think you're accurate, we're at or right within the range of targeted margins and don't see the need to further expand that. ","Thomas Gallagher","Got you, so holding the line on pricing from this point forward would be a good outcome for you?","Mike Simonds","We\u2019ll watch closely what the risk trends are. So if risk trends are favorable over a sustained period of time that we get comfortable and certainly we will adjust pricing to maintain margins and be sure that we're delivering strong value to the customer?","Thomas Gallagher","Okay and then Jack just back on long-term care, any consideration on buying cash flow hedges. I know you've had some those had rolled rates had gotten real low, we've gotten a bit higher or is that something that you're contemplating?","Jack McGarry","You know it's certainly something we keep track of that. We would think about doing it at some point. I don't think we're at a place right now where we are enticed to put on hedges and lock in the current interest rate environment. I think there is a lot of speculation around things that could happen, that could drive interest rates higher. Certainly the tax plans, the infrastructure spend, the fact that the Fed needs to reduce its balance sheet over the long-term so if we thought it was an opportune moment we would, I don't think we think currently it is. ","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks. ","Rick McKenney","Thanks Tom.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. First just a question on long-term care and if there's been a change in the reviews on reserve adequacy I think you\u2019ve said in the past that if given where rates were and given your success in getting price hikes you don't feel the need to potentially take a charge this year on long-term care. So, just considering the fact that rates are a little bit lower so far this year has your view on that changed at all?","Jack McGarry","I mean rates are a little bit lower, remarkably the third year it has bounced back up to right around that 3% range. And so that's off less than the tenure is. The first quarter as we said we exceeded our 5% target. We continue -- as a result we continue to build margin in our asset base and build margin in our reserves. I would view our position as having a lot of flexibility as to when and how much of a long-term care charge we may take. I don't think there's anything pressuring us at the moment to take a charge in 2017. But again we're going to look at it holistically around how we manage the block and what we think is in best interests of shareholders.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay and then you entered the medical stop loss market a little while ago so what was behind that decision and what do you think you bring to the market and then also like what sort of a long term potential do you see in this business down the road like a few years out?","Jack McGarry","Jimmy, thanks for bringing it up. I think medical stop loss has been a string of things we've looked at and how we leverage our capabilities, what we do very well including our distribution system and medical stop falls in that line. Mike you want to talk a little bit more about it, we've just got some press releases out there and we're looking forward to getting deep into the market.","Mike Simonds","Sure, absolutely. So we looked at it and said it's a growing market, we like the trends I think. What we would bring to bare is a very good distribution into the brokerage market that distributes medical stop loss as well as a strong brand around service. Over time we are acquiring the ability to risk manage in that business starting with some strong partners as we enter the market in the latter half of this year. While I do not see it at all as a substantial contributor to our financial results in the current calendar year and likely well into next year we think it's a really good long-term play. It\u2019s a way to leverage assets that we have. And while not the primary reason for entry, one of the other big advantages of being in that business is the decision the client makes around self funding their health insurance and putting stop loss in place. It happened early when they're devising their overall benefit strategy. So it puts us in a very favorable position to help the consultative around products and services we can wrap around those health care decisions. So we're looking forward to it being a good healthy business for us over the long-term. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you. ","Rick McKenney","Thanks Jimmy.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead. ","Ryan Krueger","Hey, good morning. I had a question about Unum U.S. expenses, the expense ratio came down 70 basis points in the quarter which has continued strong recent trend. Do you view this kind of level of expenses or expense ratio in the first quarter as sustainable for the rest of the year?","Mike Simonds","Thanks Ryan, appreciate the question, its Mike. Yeah, I would say we have a little bit of timing in the expense numbers sort of bounce around a little bit but I think the important thing to keep in mind is the longer term trend which is good consistent gradual decrease in that operating expense ratio. A lot of that contributed to buy efforts across the enterprise. We put centers of excellence in place, that multi products and business units are using. We're getting great scale. Rick highlighted strong growth in voluntary. A lot of what we do to bring voluntary and market-to-market happens in one place for the enterprise and then it is taken out through different brands and channels and moves like that I think has helped us. And importantly while we are focused on being good stewards of those resources we're actually increasing the investments that we're putting into our business around new products coming to market under both Unum brand U.S. and UK and in Colonial Life as well as new technology capabilities particularly around enrollment and benefit administration. ","Ryan Krueger","Thanks and then on long-term care, when did you model the 2014 rate increase program to be complete and can you give us a sense on a cumulative basis how the rate increases have come in relative to your modeled expectation so far?","Steve Zabel","Yeah, this is Steve, thanks for the question. I would say the way to think about it is it was modeled out over several years and as you might expect you're going to get probably majority or significant part of that kind of early on within the first two to three years. But with some states there is a caps on the approval limits and those types of things. So those will be modeled out over more years. I guess what I would tell you just overall what we're still on track with what we put in our initial assessment within the gap reserve in 2014 and still really good about being able to achieve that level of rate increase. ","Ryan Krueger","I guess, part of my reason for the question was when since you haven\u2019t modeled any further rate increases in your reserves path for the 2014 program, I guess when you\u2019d be potentially in place to put in a new round of requests?","Steve Zabel","You know that\u2019s hard to say. I think we just continue to monitor the experience that we have in the block and clearly it has to be actually justified to go back to the states and so it's just something we'll continue to monitor and so have no plans at this point. ","Jack McGarry","You know Ryan, that independent decisions to -- because we're still working on prior rate increases doesn't stop you from filing new ones. ","Ryan Krueger","That's it, got it. Okay, great, thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. ","Yaron Kinar","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So first of all I want to go back a second to group disability and life in the U.S. So sales persistence your both a little bit weaker than maybe I would have expected. Are they also -- are you seeing greater competitive pressure than you had sought when you would have looked at the year ahead initially and when you provided the initial guidance or was this pressure already baked into numbers and you basically figured that the pressures in that core business would be offset by supplemental and voluntary?","Mike Simonds","Thank you Yaron, its Mike, appreciate the question. Couple of things so first, I hope everyone keeps in mind first quarter while not an inconsequential quarter, is not the most critical as we get the year under way. So there is lot of ground to cover between now and the end of 2017. I think the guidance we laid out at the end of last year of 8% to 10% sales growth is still the best guidance for us. We have an outstanding group of sales and client managers out there in the market, really strong partnerships from underwriting. And I do -- like I said I feel optimistic about the pipeline as it comes together. Did we anticipate a less competitive market I wouldn't necessarily say that. I'd say probably the one place there that I've mentioned previously on the call is that middle market which is proving a little bit more competitive and choppy than I maybe I would have anticipated. But I still am quite optimistic about the balance of the year.","Yaron Kinar","Got it, thank you. And then also had a question on your whole core liquidity levels which seemed very strong and certainly higher than any level I've seen in recent years. Is that a timing issue or does that go back to our I guess the previous conversations around strategic flexibility?","Jack McGarry","You know actually it is not a timing issue, it's real. We have been building holding company liquidity. That's going to continue because of the strength of our statutory earnings. Dividends from our subsidiaries this year are based on statutory earnings last year and we had record statutory earnings last year. So we expect that to continue to build over time. We are exercising prudence with it particularly this year because there's a bunch of things going on. You have tax reform if the corporate tax rates were significantly lowered, that would be great for us long-term. But you would have deferred tax asset impact resulting from that. We're still working on our long-term care block. We don\u2019t want to be caught short on capital should the opportunity to do something with that arise. So there is some things out there that make sense to be a little more prudent but I think largely I would not expect significant change in actions during 2017. But we realize that is going to continue to build and so our expectation is we'll come out with kind of some renewed comments on our capital plans at the end of 2017 at our Investor Day. ","Yaron Kinar","Great, I appreciate the answers, thank you. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. ","Mark Hughes","Thank you, good morning. On the \u2013 business any updates on recruiting trends if we do have a little stronger job market, how does that impact your potential recruitment there?","Tim Arnold","Hey Mark, thank you for the questions. This is Tim. Our recruiting is right on plan, it\u2019s like a little bit ahead of plan for the first quarter. We feel great about early second quarter results with recruiting but more importantly we're seeing strong sales from those new reps. So it's not just about bodies in the billing it's about their effectiveness and we see increasing effectiveness from that group. ","Mark Hughes","And then I believe you have touched on this earlier but your natural growth, your most recent sense in terms of payroll trends, hires, wages are you seeing any uptick there?","Mike Simonds","Hi Mark, its Mike. I would say not an uptick actually pretty consistent, little bit of a tail wind if anything while we've seen pretty consistent wage increases over the last several quarters. It has been maybe a tick or two drop in the new job growth but it's not usually consequential. ","Mark Hughes","Thank you. ","Operator","There are no further questions in queue.","Tom White","Great, I think we're getting up on time as well. Thanks everybody for taking time to join us this morning.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead.","Thomas White","Great. Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2012 analyst and investor conference call for Unum. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, as well as our subsequently filed Form 10-Qs.

Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Our fourth quarter was another solid one with operating earnings per share growth of 5.1%, and for the full year, our earnings per share grew 5.7%. This represents the seventh consecutive year of operating earnings per share growth at the company.","In the fourth quarter, we saw a continuation of many of the positive trends we discussed with our Investor Day meeting in December. First, our operating performance remains solid. We continue to see premium growth in our target market and continue to generate solid operating results across most of our businesses, which allowed us to maintain our strong profitability and returns. For the fourth quarter, our return on equity was 12.2%, and full year return on equity was 12.3%.","Second, our investment performance and asset quality remains strong. We have not deviated from our investment strategy to chase yield but are continuing to take the actions we discussed with you at our December meeting to manage through this low interest rate environment.","Third, our overall balance sheet remains in very good shape, and our book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew by 12% this past year to $29.55 per share. Our past 3 years, even with our restructuring actions last year, our book value has grown by an annual rate of 8.4%.","And finally, our capital position remains strong, and we have maintained our financial flexibility. We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, with statutory net income for the total year totaling $625 million from our traditional U.S. insurance companies. For year end 2012, we are estimating our combined risk-based capital ratio to be 396% and holding company cash at just over $800 million.","We are continuing to return capital to our shareholders, and in the fourth quarter, we repurchased another $100 million of stock, bringing us to $500 million for the full year and $2.2 billion over the past 5 years.","At our December meeting, we also discussed 2 areas which represented some challenges for us, and I'm pleased that we saw some improvement in both of those in the fourth quarter. First, results for Unum UK improved relative to the prior quarter. While much of that improvement resulted from strong group long-term disability results, our group life line of business, which has been the greatest challenge, stabilized in the quarter. We are in the process of repricing the life block, and while still early, we are generally pleased with the results to date.","And secondly, within our Closed Block segment, our long-term care loss ratio was lower in the fourth quarter relative to the prior quarter, and we continue to take the pricing actions we discussed with you in December.","So in summary, 2012 was another very solid year for the company. As we look to 2013, we still have a generally cautious view of the environment with continued low employment growth and low interest rates. However, we are confident we can continue to create value for our shareholders by maintaining our disciplined growth strategy, delivering consistently strong returns in our ongoing businesses, maintaining our solid financial foundation and returning excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases.","So with that quick overview of the fourth quarter, I'll now turn things over to Tom for an overview of our operating results this quarter. Tom?","Thomas White","Great. Thank you, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported net income of $233.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 or $0.85 per diluted common share compared to a net loss in the year-ago quarter of $369 million or $1.26 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 are after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $7.5 million and after-tax net realized investment gains of $16.4 million.","Included in fourth quarter 2011 were after-tax reserve additions and the write-off of deferred acquisition costs in our Closed Block segment totaling $619.6 million, net tax benefits of $22.7 million, after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $5.1 million and after-tax net realized investment gains of $4.8 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $225 million for this quarter or $0.82 per diluted common share compared to $228 million -- $228.2 million or $0.78 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.","Moving to a review of our business segments, operating income for the Unum US segment increased 2.3% to $212.2 million in the fourth quarter, with premium income increasing by 3.2%. The expense ratio was stable on the year-over-year basis, and risk experience was also generally stable, with the benefit ratio for the segment at 73% this quarter compared to 72.7% in the year-ago quarter.","Within the Unum US segment, operating income in the group disability line was $73.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $77.1 million last quarter. Premium income increased by 0.5% over last year due to sales growth and generally favorable persistency trends in recent quarters. But operating revenue declined 0.3% as net investment income declined by 4.1% due to lower assets allocated to this line and a decline in the investment yield. The benefit ratio for this line was 84.5% in the fourth quarter, down slightly from both the year ago 84.7% and the third quarter 84.9%.","In the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 4.8% to $55.1 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from an increase of 5.5% in premium income, as well as higher net investment income and a lower operating expense ratio, which offset an increase in the benefit ratio to 72.5% this quarter from 70.7% in the year-ago quarter.","In the supplemental and voluntary line, operating income increased 7.6% to $83.6 million, with solid growth in premium income of 5.6% offsetting a slight increase in the benefit ratio to 52.5% in the quarter from 51.9% in the year-ago quarter.","Moving to Unum UK. Operating income in this segment declined to GBP 21.8 million from GBP 33.1 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 76.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 69.1% in the year-ago quarter, while premium income in local currency increased by 1.6%. Results in the group life line of business were significantly weaker than the year-ago quarter but were stable with the third quarter, while income in the group long-term disability line was generally flat with the year-ago quarter but up significantly from the third quarter.","Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 5.1% to $68.3 million. Premium income increased by 4.4%, and the benefit ratio was stable on a year-over-year basis at 52.5%.","In the Closed Block segment, operating income totaled $28.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $922.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for the impact of the reserve addition and DAC write-off, operating income last year was $30.8 million.","For the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $34.6 million for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. Net investment income is lower due to lower asset levels, a lower proportion of assets invested at long-term interest rates and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships. Interest and debt expense was higher at $35.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $32.4 million in the year-ago quarter, again, reflecting the issuance of $250 million of 30-year senior notes in the third quarter.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results.","Richard P. McKenney","Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll cover the profit trends we experienced in our business segments this quarter, a little more detail on our growth trends, and I'll also update you on our investment results and capital position.","First, on operating results in the fourth quarter, our Unum US segment again produced good results with growth in operating earnings of 2.3% and generally stable risk experience across each of our product lines.","Focusing on the risk results, first, with group disability, the benefit ratio has remained stable at 84.5%, which is consistent with last quarter as well as a year ago. The underlying experience this quarter was again favorable, with stable claim incidents, continued strong claim recoveries and the ongoing benefit of price discipline on new sales as well as renewals. These favorable trends are somewhat offset by the interest rate environment and the impact of the 50-basis-point reduction we made in the reserve discount rate for group long-term disability new claim incurrals in the third quarter.  All in all, we're quite pleased with the level of profitability we are experiencing in the group disability line, with a full year ROE of just below 13%.","The group life and AD&D line was again a strong earnings contributor this quarter at $55 million. The benefit ratio was 72.5% in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with the third quarter level, with mortality running slightly higher than previous quarters. Margins in this line of business also remain very favorable, with ROE for the year at approximately 16%.","And finally, in Unum US, the supplemental and voluntary line continues to be our largest earnings generator at $83.6 million this quarter, an increase of 7.6%.","[Audio Gap]","year and risk experience also remains generally favorable. The fourth quarter benefit ratio of 52.5% was up slightly, as both the individual disability recently issued and voluntary benefit lines similarly had slightly higher benefit ratios. These lines of business continue to be attractive growth opportunities with very good returns, generating ROEs in the 13% to 14% range.","Moving to Unum UK. Fourth quarter results improved relative --","[Audio Gap]","and back within a range of expectations of GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million. The improvement relative to the third quarter was driven by strong results in the group long-term disability line of business, as claim incidents and claim recoveries were favorable.","Results in the group life line, which has been the source of much of the recent underperformance in the segment, were comparable to the third quarter. Our primary focus for this product line is to stabilize the profitability in the near term and look to improve returns and growth over the medium term. Our fourth quarter results were a step in the execution of that plan, which includes repricing and shifts in our mix of business over the next several quarters.","Additionally, as we mentioned at our December investor meeting, we were evaluating alternatives to reduce volatility in the group life results. And to that end, we have executed the reinsurance transaction for this line effective at the beginning of the year. This reinsurance arrangement will have the effect of reducing the amount and relative volatility of earnings from the group life line and will also reduce the overall level of required capital. The overall ROE was 13% for the year.","Colonial Life once again produced solid results for the fourth quarter earnings, with earnings of $68.3 million, showing an increase of over 5%, while premium income increased by 4.5%. The benefit ratio remains stable at 52.5% this quarter, which enabled an ROE for Colonial Life for the full year of 2012 of just under 17%. When you look across Unum's core businesses, you see we had very good returns for 2012.","Concluding my comments on profitability, results in our Closed Block were higher at $28.8 million this quarter. Operating earnings in the individual disability line were higher than normal, driven by favorable risk experience. On its surface, net investment income was also higher than recent quarterly trends. This occurred primarily in the individual disability line, where we received several million dollars of miscellaneous income as a result of bond call prepayment premiums. While that bond call premium increased our net investment income results for the quarter, we correspondingly adjusted the discount rate for new claim reserves. This was done to recognize the impact of losing these higher-yielding bonds to an early call and to maintain a net interest margin in our reserves. Aside from this adjustment, underlying claim experience in the individual disability block was favorable in the fourth quarter.","Long-term care results for the fourth quarter showed some improvement over the third quarter results, with the interest-adjusted loss ratio declining to 89.9% from 91.3%. Our full year 2012 LTC interest-adjusted loss ratio was 90%, at the high end of our long-term expected range.","Now I'd like to move to discussion of our sales and growth trends, beginning with Unum US. We continue to be pleased with our sales results, with a 4.8% growth in overall sales in the fourth quarter and 7.5% for the full year. This quarter, sales growth was a bit more skewed to the large-case market, where we remain disciplined and are happy to see this progress. Sales in the core market were down 2.6% for our LTD, STD, group life and AD&D lines combined, impacted by the rate increases we have been implementing on sales over the past several quarters.  Our mix of sales continues to reflect our long-term growth and mix objectives from the core market in 2012.","Premium persistency has been positive all year and ended at over 90% for group life and LTD in 2012. With these positive trends, we continue to produce premium growth in the 3% to 4% range for Unum US segment, a good combination of growth and strong profitability, particularly in today's competitive market conditions and continued flat employment trends.","In the U.K., sales results reflect the actions we are taking to turn this business. Sales were down by 42% in total, including a sharp drop of 72% in group life sales and a more moderate decline of 6.5% in the group long-term disability line. We continue to push price increases into the group life market, as well as scale back our -- certain sales in certain market sectors, as we reposition this business line for better margins in the future.","Persistency also declined as expected due to the pricing actions we're taking, from 89.3% in 2011 to 82.5% in 2012 for group life. Persistency in group long-term disability was more stable, declining from 86.6% to 84% in 2012.","And finally at Colonial Life, sales showed a modest increase in the fourth quarter. However, coming off a decline in third quarter sales of 5.8%, we were pleased to see this turn. Sales rebounded nicely in the public sector market, showing 8.6% growth over last year's fourth quarter, while sales were slightly negative in the core market sector.","In the fourth quarter, we also saw a slight improvement in sales to new accounts. We have seen increasing sales from existing customers, which we will certainly remain a focus of ours. But we're also pleased to begin to see improvements in our growth in sales attributable to new account relationships.","Moving on to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, there is little change to our recent trends of strong credit quality in the midst of a challenging environment for new money yields. This is due to the low level of interest rates as well as tight corporate bond spreads.","On credit quality, the net unrealized gain position of our fixed-maturity securities portfolio stands at $7.2 billion at year end, which is mostly driven by low rates. However, our watch list of potential problem credits remains very low. The net realized after-tax investment gain or loss from our investment portfolio was slightly positive again this quarter and for the full year.","On the low interest rate environment, while 10- and 30-year treasury yields increased slightly in the fourth quarter, much of that improvement was lost to tighter corporate bond spreads. The net result continues to be low new money investment yields, which led to a reduction of 7 basis points in our portfolio this quarter to 6.47% at year end. Our strategy for managing through this environment is centered on being selective in our asset purchases and utilizing higher allocations to asset categories such as private placements, commercial mortgage loans and below-investment-grade bonds.","In 2012, we believe this provided better relative value. We also continue to benefit from the hedges we have in place for our long-duration, long-term care portfolio, which will cover about 20% of our asset purchases for LTC in 2013.","The other important -- element of our strategy for dealing with low interest rates is to make adjustments to our discount rate assumptions, such as the 50-basis-point reduction we did in Unum US group long-term disability in the third quarter, which leads to higher pricing on new sales as well as renewal business. As a result, we saw our interest margin improve by 1 basis point in the quarter. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we estimate that the low interest rate environment will impact our earnings growth by 68% in 2013, of which we will recoup 1\/3 as price increases work their way through the book.","Now moving on to our capital position, which closed the year in a very strong position. As we've discussed in the past, the important driver is statutory net income, which totaled $188 million for our traditional U.S. life insurance company in the fourth quarter and $625 million for the full year. This performance helps to support our capital-generation model that generates between $550 million and $650 million of excess capital annually before shareholder dividends. The weighted average risk-based capital for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 396% at year end, at the upper end of our 2012 target range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $805 million at the end of the year, slightly exceeding our 2012 expected range and 3x our annual cash needs.","Our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter totaled $100 million and completed our 2012 plan of $500 million, which reduced share count by 8%. We continue to expect an additional $500 million of repurchases for 2013.","And finally, in closing, we remain consistent with the overall outlook we introduced at our December meeting, as we anticipate growth in operating earnings per share for 2013 to be within the range of 0% to 6%.","Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. As we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating what I said earlier. We are generally pleased with our financial and operating results this quarter and for the full year of 2012. Unum US and Colonial Life continue to generate strong results in the quarter, while the results in Unum UK and the Closed Block segment showed some quarter-over-quarter improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong, and that, along with our solid capital position, enables us to continue to create value for our shareholders by supplementing our operating performance, by returning excess capital to our shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividend increases.","Now this completes our prepared comments. And Kim, let's move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I wanted to focus on the U.K. and the long-term care business which surprised relative to what we were expecting. So I was just wondering if you could comment on 2 things. First, in terms of the U.K. and LTC, how much of the better-than-expected claims experience would you say is sort of a quarterly variation that could reverse? Or how much of it is just some of the actions that you've been taking in terms of pricing? And then sort of related to that, specifically on pricing, can you talk about where we are with respect to the repricing of the U.K. business, maybe a percent of the way through that? And then any feedback you've gotten from the regulators as you've tried to reprice the in-force long-term care business?","Thomas R. Watjen","Let's see if I can sort of organize that a little bit, Suneet. Let's start with just the U.K. if we can and maybe just break it down into 2 -- a couple of pieces. One is your discussion -- your question about group life pricing and where that whole stands; and Rick, maybe we can talk a little bit about the financial outlook. But maybe, Kevin, starting with you back on the U.K. pricing of the group life block and where that stands and perhaps maybe where some of the early indications of its effectiveness are.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Thanks, Tom. Suneet, with respect to the U.K. business and the group life business, we are sort of in the early stages. Probably, we're about maybe 30% through the book of business in terms of placing renewal increases. The average increases are around 12.7% so far on the renewed business. And we have some segments, as Rick mentioned, that the price increases are significantly higher than that. And we have announced some subsets of our group life business that we're deemphasizing, in particular, the larger end of the group life marketplace. So it will take about -- though into 2014 before we fully get through that block. But I would expect us to be making that kind of progress throughout 2013 on the group life side.","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe just shifting, then, if we could, Rick, to you, just on an outlook for the U.K., just sort of put the quarter in perspective as we go to 2013.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. So as you look at the different elements you asked about claims, I think the life business running similar to what we saw, and we're taking actions to move through that. The disability line actually looked pretty good, but back -- I would say, it's back more in a range of our expectations as opposed to what we've done in the third quarter. When you take that all together, as we look out next year, we came in close to GBP 22 million in the quarter. We're going to see that, I think, stabilize over the course of the year. So we go into a relatively flat plan as we're looking out into 2013. But we're hopeful with what we saw in the fourth quarter that things can look pretty good there.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then on long-term care?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, maybe we'll break it out into 2 pieces again, Suneet. And maybe, Kevin, just on operational price actions and things we talked about in December. I think we continue to make progress on that.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, we continue to be pretty much what we discussed at our Investor Day in December. We're about 60% of the way through the process in terms of filing and approvals. As you know, we are seeking rate increases in excess of 25%. And to date, on the 60% that we're through so far, we're running ahead of that plan. So good solid steady progress. Those price increases don't actually get executed and implemented in the marketplace until the beginning part of this year, and then their effects will flow through operating earnings toward the end of 2013 and into 2014.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, if I could pick up on the long-term care question around experience, we saw that. You would have seen our loss ratio come in a little bit in the fourth quarter relative to the third. So we're certainly happy to see that. But as you see, our -- just under 90%, so we're back within our range of expectations around that. But certainly, something to watch as we continue to move through time on that, as we've done. But it's good in the fourth quarter to be back in our range of expectations, which is in the high 80s.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the long-term care, if I could. If I look at your block, I think it looks like maybe half of it in terms of premium is group LTC and the other half is individual, roughly. Just as you're going for these price increases, do the regulators look at individual versus group differently? Is one more likely to get a rate increase versus the other? Or is it pretty consistent across the 2 product lines?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, I would say it's fairly consistent. I mean the average age of the group long-term care book is much younger. And there is usually -- there's always an employer involved and sometimes, employer premiums involved. And so, to that extent, I think the regulators may, to some extent, look a little more kindly on what we need to do in the group long-term care business because there are many options available to the employer, as well as the employee given their younger ages. Individual long-term care being a much higher sort of average age, I think the regulators are probably a little tighter on that. But so far, in both cases, we're exceeding expectations.","Operator","Moving on, we have a question from Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to get your perspective on how an improvement in the economy and payrolls would essentially act as a tailwind to your overall business, particularly in U.S.?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to pick up on it? You spend a fair amount of time on that.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. Well, 2 things would benefit us in the U.S. in terms of improvement in the economy -- well, 3, I'll talk to 2. Wage inflation would be one. The large majority of our group life and group disability lines of business are directly related to covered payroll, and the benefits are tied to payroll. So to the extent payrolls go up, benefit levels and premiums go up. Second, I think a positive effect would be growth in employment. As you know, we tend to target markets in our group business toward economically less downward-sensitive industries, and we try to target those that are growing. And so to the extent that we get overall employment growth, that would benefit us on the sales side. It would probably benefit us on the in-force book of business side as well. And so we would start to get some sort of positive uptick in terms of earned premium. And then the third piece of the economy probably is interest rates, and I'll let Rick talk to that.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. No, I think when you look at -- it's certainly tied together in terms of actions that are being taken by the Fed, as well as just the overall improvement in the economy. As we start to see rates come up, certainly, a benefit to our business. All of our product lines that we have out there benefit from a rising interest rate environment. So we certainly will look forward to that, although we have not factored that into our plans today.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just to get your level of comfort in the U.K. business and the runoff operations, are things tracking according to plan there?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to pick up on that again? Also, I think, Jay, too, you remember we went through some of this before in the U.S. I think as we think about what's happening there, I think, Kevin, there's a fair amount that we can take from our experience and having been through a very similar exercise a number of years ago in the U.S.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Right, right. Very, very similar to what we had to do with resetting our U.S. block of business. As you know, we've taken a couple of different actions in the U.K. on the group income protection side. We're bolstering our claim management practices, transferring some capabilities and skill sets from the U.S. to the U.K. I think some of that is starting to flow through when we had very solid group income protection claim management results, risk management results during the fourth quarter and expect that to continue going forward. On the group life side, we already talked about the rate increases that we're placing. We're also managing mix of business sort of downward, toward more core market business. And we also are putting a variety of other internal underwriting measures in place. That would probably have a downward effect on persistency in sales, at least in 2013, until sort of the market normalizes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can we start with the U.S. segment for a second? When I think of the 50-basis-point reduction in discount rate, I guess I was somewhat surprised to see group long-term disability new sales grow by 15% in the quarter with that. So any additional color you may be able to offer there would be helpful.","Kevin P. McCarthy","With regard to the discount rate change, that's primarily with respect to new claim incurrals. And so on the risk side, we did have a very, very strong quarter because we basically were able to absorb the discount rate and keep the loss ratio basically flat. In terms of the discount rate's effect on pricing, we were already moving ahead. It's really not a discount rate change. It's more a reflection of what's the assumed interest rate that we assume in the pricing. We had built that in during the course of the year, and we had mid-single-digit price increases going on in both new business and renewal business in LTD throughout the year, and we'll continue that in 2013.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the U.K. segment, could you -- I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you provide a little more color on the reinsurance program? Does that -- you put on kind of the size or structure of it?","Thomas R. Watjen","Absolutely. Rick, you want to pick that one up?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, certainly. There's 2 elements to it. And as I mentioned, it's really to reduce the volatility of this business. Our core line there is certainly our group disability side. And so as we've had the challenges here, we're taking action, using reinsurance to help us mitigate some of that volatility. Roughly, we're going with a 50% quarter share on the block. So you actually reduce capital profits, premiums associated with that block. And then we're also reducing our retention levels in terms of what we retain, cutting those down to 500 million -- or GBP 500,000 pounds per life. So actually, some good restructuring there. It's not going to have a large impact on our earnings to do that. And we think it's a good use and also frees up some capital behind that product line as well. So we're happy with the transaction, and we'll see how that plays out over the course of the year.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And if I could sneak in one more, the RBC ratio came down to kind of within the target range now. How should we think of the ability to return excess capital, with the target range kind of in -- being in the target range already?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Certainly. When you look at where our RBC level is, we're within our target range. I'd take you very quickly back to our philosophy around how we're returning capital, and that is we're returning capital in which we've been using to buy back stock here for a period of time based on our capital generation. So regardless of where our capital levels are, our 396% is quite high and probably higher in the long term that we'll need. That doesn't change our outlook in terms of returning capital that we generate back to shareholders, which we expect over the course of this year will look very similar as to what it did over the last several years, which is why we're sticking with a $500 million share repurchase.","Thomas R. Watjen","And if I could just add one thing too, Rick. I think we closed the third quarter with $762 million of cash, and we were above $800 million this quarter. And so there's some fluidity between RBC and risk-based capital, actually. And it's probably worth everybody keeping those 2 numbers in mind as we think about this whole capital position.","Richard P. McKenney","Absolutely, as we were over $800 million of cash. And so when you think of that, think of roughly 10 basis points to the RBC ratio is $100 million of cash. There's fluidity there. And like I said, I'll take you right back to what our capital-generation model looks like. And that's really what we predicate our share repurchases on, not actually the levels of excess capital we have, which we do believe we have today.","Operator","And we'll take a question from Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one on the discount rate change. The -- we look at the 10-year and then credit spreads have been tighter too. And so the 10-year, I guess, is moving higher, credit spreads are still tight. But my question is, I mean, what would need to change in those metrics we look at as analysts before we would expect the need for another discount rate change?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Well, I think that the discount rate change we made in the third quarter was reflective of those rates that we see today. And so I think that things would have to get quite a bit worse before we would change the discount rate. Something we always look at, but we made a pretty aggressive move in the third quarter. And I take you back to the fact that we do maintain a margin in that line. So when you think about that, it can be more fluid. It's not directly tied to how we put money to work on the quarter, it's taking into account how we're putting money to work, combined with the fact that we have roughly an 87-basis-point margin between our earned rate and our discount rate. So we can manage through that. The move we made, I think, was prudent in the third quarter, and we'll take that out. I'm sure we'll come back and look at that as we get out towards the end of this year.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then on Colonial, I just kind of had a couple broad questions. And so it's really starting with the benefit ratio. I mean it came in kind of where we thought it would, maybe 52.5%. And that's been where we've been running, but it's higher than we were I guess in kind of '11 and looking back to '10. And so the first question is should we expect that to be a little bit higher kind of at the current level going forward? And then just if you could kind of talk about how the economy and competition might be affecting the sales outlook for those products in '13.","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe we'll flip the 2 around, actually, Randy, and ask Randy Horn to speak to the business and the operations in the economy. And then maybe, Rick, you can just touch briefly on the outlook side of things. But, Randy, just want to sort of set the stage with the environment?","Randall C. Horn","Sure, Tom. Good morning, Randy. Overall, the economic environment does continue to provide some headwinds, as Tom said in his opening comments. But we continue to see significant opportunity in our target markets, which is that small to midsize employer on the commercial side and then the public sector. A lot of the pressure we saw in 2012 and in -- continuing into the fourth quarter of last year was in that large-case commercial account, greater than 1,000 employees. We see a lot of volatility there, and it's not a strong area of emphasis for us. So we feel by staying strongly focused on our target markets, that there's still a lot of underpenetration in those markets, and we see a lot of opportunity there. We have very strong results in the public sector, as Rick mentioned, in the fourth quarter. We're heavily focused on the local government and education side there. And even though, again, the economy is still not our friend, Randy, overall, we still see a lot of opportunity in the highly underpenetrated markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just on competition, I mean, Aflac had kind of 0% to 5% sales growth, which is probably consistent with what most of us are looking at Colonial. But I mean, is there anything -- this is an area of the industry that doesn't change that much, to be honest, from a competition perspective, but didn't know if a better economy or rate pressures and other parts of businesses have changed who you're seeing from a competitive perspective.","Randall C. Horn","Not seeing any significant change there, Randy. There certainly are new entrants to the voluntary benefits marketplace, but it's been fairly gradual over time. And in our target markets, we're still seeing primarily the same competitors: Aflac, Allstate, American Fidelity. So really pretty consistent on that side of it.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to pick up the profitability benefit ratio piece of that?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, certainly. Actually, Randy, when you look at our benefit ratio of 52.5%, it's really on our expectations. It is slightly up over the last several years. But I take you back to the type of returns this business is seeing, it's 15% to 17% is what we put out in our Investor Day type of return. So we expect 2013 to be pretty stable on the benefit ratio side, which continues to generate very good returns.","Operator","Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs has our next question.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question for Kevin. So we saw some good sales growth, a lot of it or all of it was really driven by the large-case market versus kind of your core market. I think some of this is driven by your partnership with UnitedHealthcare. But I guess how should we be thinking about this kind of 30% growth outside of your core market?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Chris, as you know, from sort of, over the last 3 or 4 years, we've got a consistent philosophy in large-case, which was basically to just grow at the average rate of the marketplace over time and to be pretty disciplined about how we pursue cases, be opportunistic. So you see some quarters when we have strong large-case sales, you'll see some quarters where we have weak large-case sales. We look for steady sales growth in our voluntary and core market business, but we look for opportunistic sales growth in our large-case national client group business. Our partnership with UnitedHealthcare has gone great. In our national client group large-case sector, we've been aggressively sort of targeting primarily the health care sector in our partnership with UnitedHealthcare. And more than half of our sales, around half of our sales in the fourth quarter came from that health sector and UnitedHealthcare partnership. We didn't write any jumbo cases. So we wrote a good volume, if you will, of large cases as opposed to 1 or 2 big large ones. And so I would say that it was a very, very good quarter for us. I wouldn't necessarily expect it to repeat itself in any following quarter. I think it's going to be, as it has been for the last several years, hit or miss depending on whether we see good disciplined pricing opportunity out there for long sustainable relationships with clients.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Rick, you gave some pretty good insight in terms of the near- to intermediate-term strategy for the U.K. But I guess when do you expect we see that shift from stabilization to growth? Is that something we could see a year from now? Or could it take longer than that, just given the duration of some of the rate guarantees that you guys have out there?","Richard P. McKenney","I think we actually expect it to turn. I mean we would be hopeful we'd see a turn in the course of 2013, although we haven't really built that into our plans. I think we're being pragmatic in terms of how we expect that to come through. There's more to play out. But we certainly would look to see that as we get out into 2014.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last quick one. I guess regarding your hedging strategy, curious if you can comment at all on any implications from Dodd-Frank around collateral requirements or if it causes you to increase your cash balances at all.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, certainly. We're looking at that. I mean there's one area in the business that we would look to hedge as rates get up and as it is, can be behind our long-term care business. So we're certainly staying close to the Dodd-Frank implications. But when we look at the actual amount, the pure nominal amount or notional amount of hedging that we'd do it would actually be relatively modest relative to the size of our overall investment portfolio. So it's something we'll stay on top of. But although it may be impactful across the financial services industry, it's not something we are overly concerned about.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","With the price increases in the Closed Block coming in later in the year, is that going to lead to declining loss ratios?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to talk just to the outlook for the Closed?","Richard P. McKenney","So when you look at the Closed Block, and it's 2 different pieces. Our individual disability block has been very stable, actually pretty good results we've seen over a period of time. We'd expect that to continue. On particular to the LTC side, which I think is what you're getting at. We'd actually expect it to be fairly stable. And so we've kind of put a high 80s number out there. This premium change that we're going to see flowing into these price increases, they're going to take place over quite an extended period of time. And so that's how we look at it, and it's going to take a while for it to be overly noticeable. And stability, I think, is what we're looking for behind this loss ratio.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then the -- in voluntary within the U.S. business, that growth has decelerated a little bit. What's the outlook there?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","We still look to grow at about sort of 150% to 200% of the marketplace, given our position, our ability to package products between voluntary lines and group lines. As you know, we have a well-stated, well-articulated strategy to enable employers to share funding with employees through combinations of employer-paid and employee-paid products. About 10% to 15% of our group products come with voluntary lines attached. And in our mid-market, 20% of our business that we sold in 2011 came with voluntary benefits attached. We'd expect to grow in the 10% plus or minus kind of range in voluntary going forward. Marketplace tends to be sort of more in the 5% to 7% range or so right now. And so I think we're very, very optimistic about it. And I think the trend of employers sharing funding with employees will only increase. It won't decelerate, and I think that bodes well for both Unum US and impacting strategy at Colonial.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Then one final question. Have you started to see any movement in that natural growth, more people, higher wages with your existing customers?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Not yet, not at least in any way that you can see flow through the numbers. I think there are good signs out there that employment may be sort of stabilizing, that this employment growth is starting to show up in some industries. We'll see what happens with the economy during 2013 if GDP holds up. And if it does, then you might start to see a little bit of wage inflation. And I think both of those things will benefit us on the normal or natural growth side.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A quickie first. Rick, earnings came in I think a little bit better than everybody was looking for. There were a few items here or there. What do you think -- what would be the base for the growth for 2013, I guess, in your mind, is the question that I want to ask?","Richard P. McKenney","Well, the base we're using as we lay out our outlook for next year is reported. So you think of the 315 as we talk about our 0% to 6% growth. If you look at it from a run rate perspective, it's probably a couple of cents lower than we expected, and that's more from a projection perspective. But I don't want to discount the fact that we had a very good quarter and exceeded earnings. But when you look forward, I think you'd probably pull it back a couple cents for a really good tax rate we saw in the fourth quarter and extrapolate off of that. But think about our baseline of 315 and 0% to 6% is what we put out there, how we expect to grow in 2013.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I want to go back to Unum UK, make sure I understand what is happening here. The reinsurance is on which line?","Richard P. McKenney","The group life line, purely.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","It's purely the group life line. And it's 50% of the in force, is that correct? Or is it 50% of new business?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, that's correct. It's in force and new business.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And --","[Audio Gap]","4Q '12 and 3Q '12. In 3Q '12, you stated that you thought there was just some volatility, that the normalized number in pounds was still GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million. I understand from Tom -- so you reported about GBP 22 million. I understand from Tom, there was about a $5 million hit from write-down of software assets, that's in the expense line there. That would kind of get you to 26, 27, somewhere in that range. Are you still thinking that, that GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million is the range for this year? And if so, how does the reinsurance play into that, if it does at all?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, so the reinsurance we've incorporated in terms of our outlook, so when you think about that overall, GBP 20 million, GBP 25 million is still a range. And it takes you back to an earlier question we had on the U.K. I'd like -- I'm hopeful that it could be better over the course of the year. But we built our plans that it will be relatively flat year-over-year as we see some of these pricing increases take hold in combination with what we see from an overall perspective. So U.K. had a good quarter, but I think as we look forward, we're still expecting a flattish-type plan and looking to see if some of these good results we saw in the fourth quarter can sustain.","Thomas R. Watjen","And one thing to clarify there, Steven, is the software impairment was GBP 3 million, which [indiscernible] $5 million, just to get the currencies straight.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. Sorry about that. And then on Colonial, I don't know if you answered this, how much of Colonial's business is individually underwritten versus group underwritten?","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, you want to pick that up, just a little bit about your block of business?","Randall C. Horn","Yes, the vast majority of our business is still on an individual basis. It's north of 90%, so that 90% to 95% range is individual business and is underwritten.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. The reason why I ask that is that, Randy, you may or may not be aware that the EBSA came out with a FAQ regarding group indemnity insurance, and whether or not it would be exempt under ACA, certain types of products?","Randall C. Horn","I am familiar with that, yes.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So it sounds to me like that doesn't affect you at all. But would it generally affect the market in a major way?","Randall C. Horn","I think that's still an open issue on that. And certainly, our trade organization is taking a hard look at that. But from our perspective today, we feel our products are all what we call HIPAA-excepted benefits and are not subject to the health care reform legislation.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I also want to go back to the U.K. just to make sure I understand it. I guess the way I'll ask the question is I think, Rick, you opened it up as kind of -- describing it as smoothing. And I guess my question is, is the ultimate loss content unchanged with this transaction and it's just the emergence of the losses? Or does it fall into more of a true risk transfer type structure?","Richard P. McKenney","No. This is true risk transfer. I'd have to go back to the transcript. I certainly did not use the word smoothing in talking about it. It's something where we're taking roughly half the book and reinsuring that out, pure risk transfer as we look at that. And we will -- or I should say, our reinsurer will take half the risk, half the benefit in terms of how it comes through.","Kevin P. McCarthy","The other thing I would add is part of that reinsurance transaction is also in excess of retention strategy. And so some of what happened to us in group life was that we got hit with some fairly significant, high severity claims. And so we backed off our retention limit, which allows us to reduce the volatility from that high severity claim incidence. And that should be a positive impact to us going forward.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I got on late. I apologize if I misinterpreted you. I guess the other question I was thinking about is just looking at the persistency of group life and the sales levels of group life in the U.K., how tied is the group life product to disability in the U.K. market? And how cognizant do you have to be in terms of declines in group life overall vis-\u00e0-vis the disability business?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, Mark, I think -- I mean a fair amount of it is certainly tied, but I don't believe that the actions that we're taking in group life should have any at all negative effect on our group disability strength in the U.K. We are far and away the largest part of the marketplace there in terms of market share leadership. We're the market leader in terms of setting product design, market penetration expectations, distribution, enrollment strategies, service strategies, claim management. And I would expect that none of what we're doing in group life will have any negative effect on group income protection.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Schuman from KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry to do this, but I think I'm going to come back to the U.K. for the ninth time. And it's probably been well explained, but I didn't quite follow it. I guess what I think I'm hearing is that you're ceding a significant amount of the volatility and you're ceding some of the capital requirement, but you're keeping the earnings, which sounds like a great outcome, but maybe I didn't quite hear that right.","Thomas R. Watjen","No...","Richard P. McKenney","So maybe I can try and clarify that, so we don't get #10 coming through. The -- it's actually full risk transfer, so we are ceding off the business. So when you look at that, the reason it's not a heavy income impact, it's because there's not a lot of income in the business right now. And so when we take that out, what we're actually able to get from the reinsurers is very similar to the profit levels that we earned at least over the last several quarters. So we'd like for that improve, but that's why the 3 of those things work together.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So at this point, they're participating in the modest level of profits, which is not much of a give-up. But then going forward, they would also participate in some of the upside, is that...","Richard P. McKenney","That's correct. That's correct. And so as we go through these repricing actions, we have to factor that in.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one kind of high-level question. I think I heard Kevin say that -- Kevin was asked a couple questions about kind of U.S. corporate America and the employer situation. And it sounds like you're not necessarily yet seeing a lot of emerging strength. Thinking back a few quarters, I think, at one point last year, your premiums started to lift a bit, and I think Tom was cautiously optimistic that maybe you were on the leading edge of seeing a little bit more strength in some of the employment markets. Is it fair to say now that maybe that's -- it's a little early to identify that strength?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. Jeff, Kevin here. I would say it's bounced around a bit. We -- in the old days, pre-2009 or whatever, we'd get 2% to 3% of sort of top line in-force lift from wage inflation and employment growth. Over the last 4 years, it's been basically plus or minus 0. Yes, I think there was 1 year, it was actually slightly negative. This year, our top line growth came primarily from a combination of a strong sales year and a very strong persistency year, plus that persistency held up in spite of moving prices up. And so that's what's really helped our top line. But in terms of whether the economy has turned or not, I'm no economist, I'm just saying that it isn't showing up right now, nor are we counting on it.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A quick question on the LTC. I was just a little bit confused by recent remarks that the improvements in earnings would be gradual over time. I thought you had mentioned earlier in the call that you're 60% of the way through this process and that we would see effects flowing through late 2013, 2014. Maybe if you just help me understand the dynamics of that.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Seth, yes, we're 60% of the way through the seeking approvals process. The actual execution of the rate increases doesn't start until during basically somewhere around the second quarter of this year. Those will roll out gradually across the book. And then the effect on earnings from that top line in coming from the rate increases will emerge also gradually. And so I think as Rick -- I think Rick mentioned that we'd start to see a little bit of that effect the end of 2013, a little more of that effect in 2014 and then going forward. But it will emerge gradually, and we expect, therefore, the loss ratio to stay within that range, stabilized range we think of 85% to 90%.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And if we think about this cycle of how long it takes to reprice the book, is it 2 to 3 years? Is that a fair sort of assessment when we start thinking about late 2013 as a starting point?","Kevin P. McCarthy","About 2 years, I would say, 2013 into 2014, and then you start to see the emergence following that. But I think it's going to be an iterative process. I don't think it's going to be a onetime thing. I think constantly we're going to have to monitor interest rates and the pressure of interest rates. We're going to have to monitor emerging experience. So I think we talked on Investor Day, this is a very, very young line of business. Most of the claims, if you will, is on the reserve side of the business, not on the paid claim side of the business. I think we're like 2% or 3% into the life cycle of this product. So we'll continue to monitor industry experience trends as well as our own and then we'll continue to make pricing adjustments to accommodate what emerges.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. Very clear. And just one high-level question on capital. You've been pretty consistent about signaling $500 million next year. I don't know if that will still have a pretty nice cash cushion. When we think going forward, what's the main trigger in terms of bringing that down? I believe you said macro events. So if we think about sort of main macro triggers, maybe if you could help take us through that?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to pick up on that?","Richard P. McKenney","Are you talking about the excess? When you say the trigger, in terms of bringing that down, I think when you look at...","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The excess, yes.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, the excess. I think as we look at that, we've been very consistent over the last several years, and we just don't see the environment yet where we want to take those down to certain levels. You can look at what's going on in the economies around the world, there's just a lot of unknowns out there. And so we feel very good about the $500 million that we've been able to do over the last several years. We think it's a good use of our capital. But I think as we look forward, as we even said as we're going into 2013, we don't expect to take down those levels of excess capital in any meaningful way.","Operator","And that last question will come from Sean Dargan from Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just when I look at the tax rate and the corporate earnings relative to where our model was, it seems that the corporate loss was higher, but the consolidated effective tax rate was lower. Should we expect to see what you reported in first quarter as sort of a guide for what we'll see -- I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter, as a guide for what we'll see throughout 2013?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Certainly. When you look at -- actually, we report on a before-tax basis, so even our corporate segment is on a before-tax basis. We have some items that are tax benefiting and on a before-tax basis actually cost us some money. So I think to cut to the chase, you should expect our quarterly run rate will look similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Sean. And I know it's been a busy morning for many of you. So thank you for taking time to join us on this morning's call. This will complete our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference for today.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead.","Thomas White","Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website in the Investors section.","So participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, the President and CEO; Rick McKenney, the Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kevin McCarthy, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. As well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'donnell for Unum UK and Randy Horn for Colonial Life. And I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. The second quarter was a strong quarter for the company, with growth in operating earnings per share of 3.8% to $0.82 per share; and book value per share, excluding AOCI, increasing 11.4% to $30.97. And let me highlight a few things before turning things over to Rick and Tom.","First, I'm very pleased with the strength of our operating performance for the quarter, with our favorable risk results generating stable to improved benefit ratios across most of our core business lines. As we've discussed in the past, our focus has been on generating not just growth but profitable growth through disciplined pricing, both new business and renewal, through disciplined underwriting and through our commitment to maintaining very high quality service levels, so that we retain our customers and hopefully expand our relationships with them over time. We are clearly benefiting from this strategy. This past quarter, for example, we generated a return on equity in our core operating segments of 14.6%, well above industry averages. The operating return on equity for the entire company, including our Closed Block, was 11.6%, also a very respectable level.","Secondly, I'm encouraged by the performance we are seeing in those areas that have been operating below our expectations. The margins in our Unum UK business, for example, improved again this quarter, as we continued to make progress repricing and repositioning the group life block. That, along with our solid results in our group long-term disability line of business, helped us strengthen the profitability in this segment.","In addition, our Closed Block segment was generally in line with our expectations this quarter. This segment, particularly the long-term care product line, will continue to be an area of focus for us and I might add the whole industry, and we will continue to devote more resources to this area to ensure that we are effectively managing all the levers we have in this business.","Third, it continues to be a challenging environment to profitably grow our business in the U.S. The combination of still weak employment growth, as well as the distraction resulting from the implementation of health care reform, has slowed quote activity and intensified price competition in certain segments. As a result, you will see that sales in Unum US in the quarter declined 19% and in Colonial Life declined about 2%. While sales declined 7% in Unum UK in local currency, that was driven more by the significant pricing actions we are taking in our group life business, more so than the broader market conditions, which certainly was the case here in the U.S. We believe these headwinds in the U.S. are likely to continue, but we are committed to maintain a disciplined approach we have taken in the market, which has allowed us to produce strong margins and returns. Returns, as I mentioned earlier, considerably above industry averages.","Turning now to investments. We continued to deliver solid investments results, and the quality of our portfolio remains excellent. The rise in interest rates during the quarter was certainly welcome, and today's new money yields still remain below our overall portfolio yield. The move in rates has not caused us to change our strategy. We will not stretch for yield by lowering our investment quality standards, but instead, continue to raise prices in the products that are most impacted by interest rates.","And lastly, our strong operating results have resulted in continued solid statutory earnings, which allows us to maintain a strong capital position, and importantly, financial flexibility. Our risk-based capital level, which was approximately 398% at the end of the second quarter, continues to be at the upper end of our target range for 2013 of 375% to 400%. In addition, our holding company cash position continued to be strong at just under $600 million. We continue to balance this high quality -- this healthy capital position with returning capital to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we repurchased just under $100 million of our shares, in addition to raising the dividend by 11.5% effective with our third quarter payment.","So to summarize, before we move to a more detailed discussion of the quarter, we are pleased with the strong operating results we saw in the second quarter. We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the business environment in the second half of the year, which will likely to continue to challenge our ability to profitably grow our business, especially here in the US. However, we are continuing as a company to take the actions necessary to ensure that we maintain our solid margins and financial flexibility and position our businesses for what I continue to believe our excellent long-term growth opportunities.","Now I'll turn things over to Tom for a review of our operating results. Tom?","Thomas White","Great. Thanks, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported net income of $218.6 million for the second quarter 2013 or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $216.4 million or $0.76 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the second quarter is an after-tax nonoperating retirement-related loss of $8.5 million and an after-tax net realized investment gain of $8.6 million. Included in the year-ago second quarter was an after-tax nonoperating retirement-related loss of $7.5 million and an after-tax net realized investment loss of $1.4 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $218.5 million for this quarter or $0.82 per diluted common share, compared to $225.3 million or $0.79 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.","Moving to an overview of our business segments. Operating income for the Unum US segment increased by 0.6% to $214 million in the second quarter, with premium income increasing by 1.5%. The segment benefit ratio was essentially flat at 72% in the quarter and other expenses were also stable at 22% this quarter. Within the Unum US segment, operating income in the group disability line was $73 million for the second quarter compared to $70.4 million last year. Premium income increased 1.5% over last year, and the benefit ratio improved 83.9% from the year-ago 84.7%.","In the group life and AD&D line, operating income was flat at $57.3 million, with premium income increasing by 3.4% and the benefit ratio improving slightly to 71.1% from 71.9% a year ago. In the supplemental and voluntary line, operating income declined slightly to $83.7 million compared to $85 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income declined by 0.8% to $273.8 million, primarily, reflecting the reinsurance of a small block of individual disability business, which is partially offset by a slight increase in premium income in the voluntary benefits line.","Moving to Unum UK Operating income in this segment improved to GBP 21.8 million from GBP 19.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Margins in this business continued their improving trend over the past few quarters, as risk experienced in both the group disability and group life lines of business improved.","Wrapping up our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 5.2% in the second quarter to $71.1 million. Premium income increased by 3.7%, and the benefit ratio improved slightly to 52.1% compared to 52.5% in the year-ago quarter.","In the Closed Block segment, operating income totaled $29.6 million for the second quarter compared to income of 24 -- excuse me, $25.7 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher net investment income from an increase in assets supporting this segment. Premium income declined by 4% relative to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the expected runoff of the individual disability block.","And finally, for the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $37.1 million for the second quarter compared to a loss of $25.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income was lower due to lower yielding assets and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships. Keep in mind that this negative impact is offset by a lower income tax rate due to the tax benefits recognized as a result of these investments. Interest to debt expense was higher at $35.2 million compared to $32.2 million in the year-ago quarter due to the issuance of $250 million of debt during the third quarter of 2012.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of the second quarter results.","Richard P. McKenney","Great. Thank you, Tom. Today, I'll cover the profit trends you saw in our business segments in second quarter, provide additional detail on our growth trends and also update you on our investment results and capital position.","As we look across the company this quarter, we saw a generally favorable risk trend in all of our lines. First, on operating results in the second quarter, Unum US operating earnings increased slightly with favorable risk experience in the group disability, group life and AD&D lines, offsetting a slightly higher benefit ratio in the supplemental and voluntary lines.","Focusing on our group disability business. The benefit ratio continues to perform quite well at 83.9% for the second quarter of 2013, which compares favorably to the 84.7% in the year-ago quarter and 84.3% in the first quarter this year. The underlying experience continues to be favorable with stable to lower overall claim incidents and continued strong claim recovery performance. This also reflects the benefit that we realized in our margins from the pricing discipline we show on new sales and renewals. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business line.","Group life and AD&D also produced strong results for us this quarter. The benefit ratio improved slightly in the quarter to 71% compared to 72% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting more favorable experience. Earnings in this line was flat at $57.3 million for the quarter, with premium growth of 3.4% being offset by lower net investment income.","And finally, in Unum US, the supplemental and voluntary line produced a good recovery from the first quarter when higher terminations in the voluntary benefits line resulted in a higher than normal level of DAC amortization. For the second quarter, earnings were $83.7 million, still lower than the year-ago quarter of $85 million, but much improved compared to the first quarter of $72 million.","Persistency was better during the second quarter in the voluntary benefits line, as we anticipated, but it is possible that we will still see some continued volatility. As a result, the accelerated DAC amortization from policy terminations likewise improved in the second quarter from the higher than normal level we experienced in the first quarter.","As for the underlying risk trends for the supplementary and voluntary line, the individual disability recently issued product lines saw a generally stable claim experience with the year-ago quarter. The voluntary benefits line saw a good risk results, but were down slightly comparing to the very good results we saw a year ago. All in all, it was a good bounce back in earnings for this line for the second quarter, as voluntary benefit [indiscernible] stabilized.","Moving to Unum UK, earnings were GBP 21.8 million, improved from both the year-ago quarter and the first quarter. As Tom highlighted, we're pleased with the margin improvement that is developing in our UK business as the group life repricing and repositioning further develops, and the results in our group long-term disability line remain favorable.","From a risk perspective, our group disability results in the second quarter were favorable due to both favorable claim incidents and claim recovery rates. For the group life block, results were favorable due to lower claims in the business that we have retained. We continued to take aggressive rate action in our group life pricing and expect to continue to do so over the next few quarters. As a result, persistency for our group life declined for the first 6 months of 2013 to 74% compared to 83.5% for the first quarter of the year. As we go through repricing this book, this is not expected to see this level of volatility.","Colonial Life's results were solid again this quarter at $71.1 million, an increase of just over 5%. The benefit ratio of 52% was slightly better than both the year-ago quarter and previous quarter, but a decreased level of claims in our accident, sickness and disability line and favorable mortality in the life line of business.","And finally, overall results in our Closed Block improved to $29.6 million this quarter compared to $25.7 million in the year-ago second quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was stable on a year-over-year basis at 82.7%, reflecting lower paid claims, offset by a less favorable claim incidents and claim recovery rates.","Long-term care earnings were higher on a year-over-year basis, driven mainly by higher net investment income. The interest adjusted loss ratio was 90% for the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter, and 88% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in the loss ratio on a year-over-year comparison was driven by an increase in the level of new submitted claims and higher group long-term care persistency, driving higher buildup in active life reserves.","Now I'd like to move our discussion to sales and growth trends. We saw a challenging quarter on the sales front as market activity slowed. We attribute some of this to the discussion and distraction to our market from health care reform. As a result, we saw a lower numbers of cases coming to market, but we also saw higher persistency in our own book. Therefore, premiums held in rather well. Overall sales in Unum US in the second quarter were lower by 19% compared to the year-ago quarter, group sales were down 20% and the supplemental benefit sales declined by 16%.","In addition to a lower number of quotes, the competition for those cases that do come to market can be extremely intensive, and our discipline may keep us out of the running in the short term. As I mentioned, a negative impact to sales is offset somewhat in that persistency has remained at very healthy levels, which is 89% for group LTD and group life for the first half of the year. We continued to see little to no benefits to premium income from marketplace growth. And in total, premium growth was 1.5% in the group disability line and 3.4% in group life and AD&D. To echo Tom's introductory comments, while we would certainly like to see an acceleration of these levels, our priority remains to protect our profit margins.","In the UK, sales results again this quarter reflect the actions we are taking to improve the profitability in this business. We were happy to see sales in the group disability line increasing by 5%, while as expected, sales in group life declined by 22%. I would remind you that the premium income was affected in the second quarter, reflecting the 50% quota share reinsurance agreement we have. Without that, the UK would have seen premium growth of above 3%.","And finally, Colonial Life sales declined by 2% in the second quarter. While we saw an encouraging trend with higher sales from existing accounts, we continue to see slower sales and activities with new accounts. And specifically, we're seeing very slow activity in the under-50 life market, a trend consistent with our Unum US segment, driven again, we believe, by disruption from health care reform. Persistency showed a slight improvement for the first half of the year, and premium growth remains positive at 3.7% for the second quarter.","So let me transition to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very strong shape. The increase in treasury yields and the slight widening in corporate bonds spreads were welcomed development in the second quarter, even though this decreased our net unrealized gain from our portfolio by roughly $2 billion. The higher new money yields helped us to get the cash balances in our product portfolios fully invested during the quarter. This helped to reduce the drag on net investment income we saw in the first quarter from holding higher cash balances, and positions us better as we move into the second half of the year.","While interest rates are up from the historic low levels over the past several months, we are still seeing new money yields well below our portfolio yields. So the pressure on yields will continue. In the second quarter, our overall portfolio yield declined by 6 basis points to 6.35%. It is difficult to draw conclusions from the overall portfolio though, and we look at it product by-product basis. We continue to make pricing adjustments with our renewals and new business pricing to reflect these low interest rates.","A good example is evidenced in our Unum US LTD business, where we experienced a 1 basis point decline in the interest reserve margin to 91 basis points. This was caused by a 4 basis point decline in the portfolio yield, while the aggregate discount rate declined by 3 basis points. As a result of the adjustments, the new claim discount rate remained in 2011 and 2012. We made no adjustments in new claim discount rate in this quarter.","As related to our balance sheet, in June, we announced that we will be freezing our US-defined benefit pension plans effective December 31 of this year and replace it with a defined contribution plans. Because this eliminates all future service accruals for active employees in the plans, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations to our plans during the second quarter. Combined with the $50 million contribution, this decreased our net pension liability by $327 million. This has a beneficial impact of approximately $0.80 to our reported book value per share, which increased by 6.2% on a year-over-year basis to $31.80. These changes are helpful in managing our retirement benefits in our risk profile going forward, but will not change how much we contribute to our employees on behalf of their overall retirement package.","Moving to an update on our capital position. We continue to see very good trends. Statutory net income remained strong at $173 million for the second quarter and $348 million for the first half of the year, which has been higher than our run rate over the last several years. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 398%, again, at the top end of our targeted range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $579 million at the quarter end and include the impact of $50 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan I mentioned. We also increased our dividend by 11.5% and share repurchase activity totaled $98 million in the second quarter. We continue to have strong financial flexibility as we head into the second half of the year.","Finally, we had no change to our 2013 outlook, and continue to anticipate growth and will have operating earnings per share to be within the range of 0% to 6%.","I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. Before I move to your questions, I want to close by reiterating that we are pleased with our operating results for the second quarter. Driven by strong overall risk results, we again generated solid profitability and returns and positive cash flow of the company. There is no doubt that producing profitable top line growth will be a challenge. However, we are maintaining a disciplined growth strategy that has served us so well in the past.","And with that, this completes our prepared comments. And operator, let's move to question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple here, if I may. Tom, in your opening remarks, you discussed competition, and you said it was in certain product -- I'm sorry, pockets. Hopefully you can fill that out for us?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes. Maybe I should ask Kevin to respond to that because I think much of that actually is within our Unum US business actually. Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. I think the environment, in general competitively has softened a bit over the last 6 to 9 months. I think as both Tom and Rick mentioned, cases coming to market are fewer, activity levels are down, incumbents are defending in-force case as well. That's reflected as well in our own high levels of persistency. And I think a lot of employers, particularly the smaller end of the market are dealing with health care reform and maybe putting off some benefit decision into 2014 perhaps. That said, I think that companies have a couple of choices. They can defend their margins and defend their in-force business, and back off on the aggressive pricing on the new sales side, so they can decide that they want to take share. In our case, our margins, as Tom mentioned, are considerably higher than the industry averages, and we're just unwilling to sacrifice the pricing discipline in margins in pursuit of market share. We'll just let the market settle down. I think Mike Simonds' here with me. Mike, you want to add anything to that?","Michael Q. Simonds","No. I guess, what I want to add is 2 quick things. One is, you probably feel the slowdowns in proposal activity, most acutely as you move down market, the small employers have less resources to deal with important decisions around reporting requirements from client's requirements, essential benefits and so forth. The second piece will be more thinking about the long term. I mean, as it's taking a great deal of time for employers and their advisers to sort through health care reform, as their sorting through it, it's playing out in ways that I think are very advantageous to us. So employers are not moving to drop benefits rapidly. They're keeping them in force. In general, employees probably have a bit more financial exposure that creates gaps for our products. So we think as they're moving through health care reform, it is a short-term distraction. But I think long term bodes real well for us.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If I could follow up on the small end, the less than 50, my understanding is that these firms are not going to have to provide insurance. So I guess, I don't quite -- and maybe I'm wrong on that, but I guess I don't quite understand what the decision process is for these guys. If I'm an employer, everything is pretty much status quo. What am I so concerned about?","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes. Great question, Steven. This is Mike. I mean, I'd day, first and foremost, many, if not most, from Unum US standpoint the employers we're doing business with are offering health care benefits today, right? So one of the key positions they have is that public exchanges come online, they've got to decide are they going to continue to provide health insurance or they're going to take advantage of public option. They're going to think about their contribution strategy, whether they're going to stay on DB or go to a more DC strategy under 50 level. It's kind of a great deal to sort through. I think compounding that is, is the brokers and consultants that are serving the market have clients that run up and down the spectrum. And so where their top energy is going to be focused maybe pulled up-market and where they might have been spending more time helping on our lines of business down market, they've got less time to do that.","Thomas R. Watjen","And that's also been reinforced, I think, Randy in Colonials business, too, because I think you've seen the greatest weakness actually is in the very small case start at the end of the market. You may want to speak to that just for a second.","Randall C. Horn","Yes, Tom. In addition to what Mike Simonds mentioned about employers, small employers that do offer health plans today, just having to sort through the requirements of the legislation and make that very basic decision as to whether they should continue to offer a health plan going forward there. For those that do not, I think a lot of those employers are wanting to see what the impact of the public exchange is going to be in terms of costs, payroll impact to their employees, that type of thing. So just a lot of things for them to sort through, we are positioning our agency force to help those small employers deal with those questions and position their plans appropriately. And as Mike said, certainly, some short-term headwinds, but I think some real opportunities for us going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just staying on Steven's question on the sales distraction from ACA. Is this a surprise to you, or that this is causing slow decision-making by customers and no new cases coming on? Or was this sort of as you expected?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Bob, I would say no. It's not a surprise. I think what's been a little bit different is sort of the delay in implementing health care reform and the sort of the consistency of inconsistency around the administration's -- the way in which administration is dealing with. And so I think it's sort of prolonged the impact. I was noticing in ALM's [ph] reported results that they're consulting revenues from health care reform consulting were up, but their brokerage fees from commissions were down. And I think if you think about that from our standpoint, we're not on that consulting sides. So the consulting side benefits there on [ph], but the brokerage commissions directly are reflective of the sort of what we're experiencing as well. So not a surprise in terms of its effect, but it sort of flowing through at a much slower pace than I think many had originally predicted.","Thomas R. Watjen","Bob, I think Mike's going to answer this, too. I think Randy mentioned it, but it's Mike it's true with your business as well. We actually made a substantial investment in our field infrastructure and help equip them to deal with these health care issues. I'm probably a little surprised, Mike, how much actually we've been a resource to people trying to help them through that process.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, it's put us in an interesting position that were a little bit outside of the fray, so we've seen this as an objective source of information. So that's been an add for us. I guess probably, what's been a bit more surprising has been the compounding effect, not just less activity in the market, but when you compound that with, as Kevin alluded to, some softening in prices, that's probably been the amplifier. That's been a bit higher than expected here in the second quarter.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got you. If I could just zoom in on the group life repricing, what did you see that caused the need to do that?","Thomas R. Watjen","You're talking about the UK business?","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I thought you were talking about repricing the US, but maybe I misunderstood.","Thomas R. Watjen","No, actually most of the emphasis is really on the UK, Bob. So really, I think as you know, we -- that there was a concerted effort, I think, as we learn more about the underlying profitability of that business, that we need to put some rate into the marketplace, and I think you saw the impact of that this quarter, both on sales and persistency. But we're really in a very nice position relative to where we thought we'd be in terms of enhancing the margin.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's old news there. You've been talking about that for a while. Appreciate it.","Thomas R. Watjen","Good. Thanks, Bob.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of things. First, I guess maybe for Rick, on the capital situation. So year-to-date, the share repurchases are, I guess, $193 million. I think on the first quarter call, you said that you're still pretty comfortable with the $500 million guidance for the full year. So I guess my first question, is that still your expectation?","Thomas R. Watjen","Let me see if I could -- let me just interject a little bit. This is Tom. Just to sort of kind of refresh everyone's memory about our capital strategy, because I do think it's always good to sort of start at that high level, then certainly Rick can speak the specifics of the share buyback. But I think nothing has really changed. I think with the company in terms of our commitment on one hand to focus on generating solid, consistent profitability, which generates very solid cash flow. I think that part of the machine, as you saw with the first quarter results, continues to work very, very well. I think the other [indiscernible] thing you've seen us over the last 5 or 6 years is I think good stewards of that capital. And you think about it from our position, we have a range of things that we think about as we think about how to deploy that capital. It's everything from the business needs, to some corporate needs, like the pension -- the contribution that Rick referred to in his comments, the debt repurchases. Plus obviously share buybacks of which we done about $2.3 billion at an average price of about 85% of book value and dividend increase. And I just give you that piece of backdrop because I think, Rick, it's safe to say, as we think about it, we think about a whole series of different deployment options for that capital, which obviously a lot of the focus in the short term has been on share buybacks. But remind everybody there's a whole host of things I think, Rick, we think about as we think about how to put capital to work.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes -- no, I'd add, Suneet. We\u2019re active capital managers. So as we come into the year, we have a range of options. We've executed on multiple of those options, including share repurchase to the first half of the year. As you look out through the second half of the year, we'll be active capital managers. And I think the most important thing, excuse me, as Tom alluded to, is our capital generation is extremely strong. So if you look at our stat, earnings are some of the best 6-month numbers we've put up in a while for the first half of the year. So it gives us a lot of financial flexibility, and we'll capitalize that in a variety of forms just like we did in the first half.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess the other question I have was about the long-term care business. Again, just kind of revisiting history a little bit here. I think when you took your charge in 2011, you talked about maybe 3 to 5 years of cushion before you might have to revisit that was sort of -- the time frame was narrowed to close to 3 years given the drop in interest rates, which I'm guessing would put us into the 2014 kind of time frame. So again, I don't think they moved around a little bit here. I just want to see if that's still kind of how you're thinking about it? And I think in the past, you've also talked about order of magnitude maybe $250 million after-tax. I want to see if that's still in line with your current thinking.","Thomas R. Watjen","Sure. Let me give you a sense of what's happened in the market. In terms of rates coming up in these near-term periods, so we certainly have been happy to see, particularly the longer end. And we think about 30-year treasury rates and credit spreads on that end of the curve over time.","Now they have come up recently, but I would take you back when we first communicated out those numbers and those ranges in terms of years and things like that. We actually were in a similar position that we are today. So we saw it moved down. We communicated that our range kind of narrowed or came to the shorter end and now we moved back up somewhere in the middle of that range. So we feel similar to what we disclosed back at that time in terms of how that looks, and we think those ranges probably still hold rolled forward by the amount of time that we've talked about.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right -- well I -- just when you say back at that time, are you talking about back to end of 2011?","Thomas R. Watjen","Correct. It's correct. So back then, we would have said 3 to 5 years given where rates were. Today, our best view -- as rates compressed, we said that time frame probably got shorter. And now as rates have come back up to those similar levels, we'd be back into that range that we talked about originally.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And then the order of magnitude of the charges, is that kind of in line with what you were thinking back then, the $250 million?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes. When you think about that, that actually on an after-tax basis would have been what we took into account back then, which took us out in that 3- to 5-year range. It might be slightly different than that given hedges and other things that go into the calculus, but I think that somewhere in that range is probably reasonable. It depends on what we're seeing and what the outlook is and what the forward curve looks like in terms of how we'd go through that process. So I don't want to speculate too much in terms of quantum, but I think the -- what we did last time is good indicator of what that might look like.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. And then just my last question is just on the Unum US business. The sales, as you noted, were down about double digits, but given your renewals and the price increases, I think your premiums are kind of holding flattish. So based on kind of where you are with those price increases, do you think that if 2014 is another year of pretty challenging sales, we'd still be looking at sort of a flattish premium line or are we going to start to see that premium line come in?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Well, trying to be optimistic here, I think as health care reform goes into implementation in the beginning of 2014, we should start to see some dampening of that negative effect on sales. So that should help us. I think cautiously, we might start to see some of the improvement in employment. We start to see some of that improvement in the U.S. economy this year although most of the employment improvement has been concentrated in sectors that aren't necessarily target markets for us in sectors like construction and retail and recreation and things like that, whereas industry sectors that are more in our wheelhouse like health care haven't seen growth in employment. So when we look into 2014, hopefully, the economy continues to improve. Sales environment starts to improve. I think if the interest rate environment improves, we won't be having to move prices up as much as we've had to in the last couple of years. So all in all, I would say 2014 ought to be a better year than 2013, but that sort of the best I can do at the moment.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I had -- just with the first question, I just had a follow-up to Suneet's question on buybacks. I still wasn't clear what your answer was. Are you committed to the $500 million or are you not for 2015? I recognize that you've retired some debt and put money into the pension plan, but could you clarify that?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, yes, go ahead, Rick.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. I think when you look at the full year, I think as you look at the back half of the year, we're going to look at the different alternatives that we have looking out there. And so when you say, \"Are you committed to that?\" We're committed to the active capital managers over the back half of the year and I'd leave it at that. We will have a variety of forms to put it to work in, as Tom alluded to. And if we can keep generating like we do, we have no reason to believe we won't be generating the way we do and we'll be putting that to work.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But not necessarily $500 million, like you look at buybacks, but you're just not willing to outline an exact number?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. And I think, Jimmy, if could add to that, even though it's not the only determinant, I mentioned the series of things that as you know, we think about as we think about the deploying the excess capital. Again, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at an average price of about 85% of book value. Our stock is trading at a much different level to that even though again that's not the only variable as Rick said in the way we think about these things. It has to be something we take into account. So...","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Now, and that makes sense. You're still even if you still do less. It's still a descent amount. I'm just -- I was just not clear on what your answer.","Thomas R. Watjen","[indiscernible] that brings a new piece you're hearing from us a little bit this quarter actually. As you know, many other companies have been saying very much the same thing. We were fortunate -- if I can digress just a moment, we were fortunate enough as you know to have the wherewithal to be buying back stock in incredibly low prices over the last 4 or 5 years. And so we're very conscious of looking at the ROI in those investments. And so again, I want to reiterate, it's not just a price-sensitive decision here because of the series of variables that go into that, but I think Rick, that's embedded in, I think, your comments.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on the U.K. business, you've had stable results for the past couple of quarters. Should we assume that if they're stable for the second half of the year that you would not renew your reinsurance contracts or what are you thinking there?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. I would -- I expect the result to be stable and improving going through the second half of this year and into 2014. But I think the reinsurance program has served us well. I think there is still a lag in reporting of group life claims that makes the existence of the reinsurance program valuable to us. And I think our intent would probably be to continue it. Although, we're not yet at that decision point.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the disruption because of health care reform, any reason to believe that, that would dissipate as you get to the end of the year or will that continue because there's still no clarity on how the exchanges are going to be set up and what the various states are going to be doing?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes. I think it would -- I mean, people are approaching the January 1, 2014 execution deadline. Exchanges are supposed to be up and running by then, although I have my doubts as to whether that's going to be the end result. So I would expect a slow dissipation into 2014.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Citi.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess going back to Kevin for a little more detail here maybe, but we've seen reported job growth in the U.S. now for a number of months. But it sounds like you're yet to see any benefit in terms of the natural growth factors. Is this because of a lag effect or is it really more because the job growth that we're seeing is in sectors where Unum is less of a presence?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I think it's both things. I think there's some lag effect. You wouldn't see it start to show up in the benefits-related payrolls for several quarters after, so you get that growth. Most employers have some sort of waiting period before you get your employee benefits, especially those paid for by the company. I want to make sure that you're locked in and embedded in the job. And then I think, as you've said and as I said earlier, the growth has been much more in the construction, retail, recreation, lower-cost service end of the -- in industries in the United States as opposed to sort of maybe the more highly paid financial sector or the health care sector. Health care, actually, I think it might have seen sort of a slight decline in the second quarter.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on, I guess, also on the rise in interest rates, how does that impact your thinking about needing to potentially make any further reductions to the discount rate?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","And certainly, with the rising rates that we've seen, it certainly takes off some of the pressure around that. As you've seen over the last several years, we managed our discount rate over a period of time, taking a forward look to that in terms of how it plays out. But certainly, this rise in rate has been helpful so I don't want to take it off the table, but certainly a much better environment in terms of matching up. As I had in my prepared remarks, our margins, particularly in our long-term disability line, remained very healthy at just over 90 basis points, so it gives us a lot of flexibility around that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And maybe just a follow-up on Erik's question on the rising interest rates and going back to the December Investor Day. When thinking about that 6% to 8% headwind facing from lower rates, I realized we're still in the low rate environment today, but it's pretty different than the 1.6% 10-year rate we had at that December time. Maybe you could just help us think about kind of that headwind as it relates to 100 basis points movement in the general environment?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Certainly, if I could take you through, I think when you think about the charts we laid out, which were the downward pressure we have on our earnings from an interest rate environment, and then how we're offsetting that with the price increases, so we're certainly still out there on a price increase front. In terms of how that downward pressure plays through, it doesn't snap back. So it's going to play out over a period of time as we put cash flows to work in the investing side, as we think about how our discount rates work over time. And so we'll certainly give a better look at that as we get out towards the end of the year, but I won't expect a material change certainly as you look in 2013 from that snapback in rates. But we'd echo what many others have said out there, which is this rise in rate is certainly helpful, but it's something that we still are in a low rate environment and something we're going to have to work through as a company.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a one quick follow-up on that. When thinking about that pressure, it's obviously relative to a more normal rate environment. Maybe you can help us think about when you set that out in December, kind of what 10-year rate that would be sort of in reference against?","Thomas R. Watjen","I think back then, it was probably $190 million, something like -- wherever the spot rate was at the time is what we're referencing and so you'd have to look at it. It wasn't as quite as low as the lows we've seen here in the first half of the year, but it was somewhere in that range. I just have to give that back to you exactly what that was.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. I'm sorry, I mean, the $160 million or $190 million relative to what, in terms of where that goes this year?","Thomas R. Watjen","That would've been -- yes, all of that analysis was year-over-year, so it would've been to the prior year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up just on the capital. I mean, obviously, you have been one of the better capital return stories within the group and a lot of that has been attributed to what you guys have talked about in terms of the strong free cash flow that you generated. So, I guess, as that continues to kind of build here and maybe the pace of share repurchases moderates, you could have an issue where you have maybe more capital than what you want, and I think you've been pointing to that here for the past number of years. So can you -- maybe as we think about the competing sources, can you talk about size of deals, if that something you would consider? Is there anything in the pipeline? And then maybe where you'd potentially look to take your dividend to?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, Chris, let me introduce it, but then maybe have Rick really more to speak to it. But you're right, again, I think we have many different potential uses of capital. I think one of the messages we're trying to get across here is beyond just share buybacks. There are other things that we have in our quiver, so to speak, to think about deploying that capital. I think we've made some good decisions in the past. M&A is certainly one of them. Rick and I said that we'll continue to look at things, but I think this group knows we've been very, very cautious about being sure that we don't get our -- get extended into things that we don't know well and don't have the financial characteristics that we work so hard to protect. But anyone who speak, too, about the M&A environment?","Richard P. McKenney","I think what I'd add to that is something we've said in previous calls as well is that when our shares are trading at a steep discount that they were, it was a very, very high hurdle to have any deal clear to that. So we chose to buy back our stock. As our stock prices moved up, I think that the other things come into play. Particularly to the M&A markets, we've been active throughout this period of time so even as we've been buying back shares, we have been on the look in terms of different pieces that we have out there, capabilities out there, things that are in our space, and so things that are definitely on strategy is what we've been looking at, and we continue on that front. I certainly don't have anything to announce. The flow externally is particular to what we look at. It's still, I'd say, medium to slower, but it's certainly something we'll be active on.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if we think about the move up in rates, curious if you're seeing any potential opportunities to reduce your exposure to the closed block? And could you potentially use some capital to shore up further pieces of the closed block to make it more enticing for a potential buyer or reinsurance solution?","Thomas R. Watjen","Let me start and again ask Rick to speak. But I think as you -- you've heard, I think, Chris in my comments at the front end of the call, we are putting more resources behind our closed block in terms of moving additional individuals and people over there to be sure that again, we're actively managing every lever that we have in that particular part of the business. And I think you're right, there's one element that this is capital-related, but I think Rick, it's not at the exclusion of other things. We're certainly working rate increases through the process . We're doing a number other things operationally to continue to improve the performance to that block. But again, I think the key message is we are actively managing that business and using all the levers, I think, we have. I'm not sure we're prepared to talk about doing something in terms of like we did with the disability block of business. I don't think the environment is not necessarily right for that, but if and when those things change, we're certainly going to be looking at those different kind of choices.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just one last quick one on LTC specifically around the charge in 2011. We've talked a little bit about the interest rate environment, but from a sort of policyholder behavior experience, recognizing it's just 1.5 years out, but anything that's mainly deviated meaningfully from the assumptions that you guys made at that time?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes. So we've seen inter-quarter volatility on different elements. We've reported that and talked to you about them. As we've seen, incidents have been -- tend a little bit higher than we expected early on, but I think the most important thing that you laid out is it's still very early in this block of business. Reserves are based on very long term assumptions around that so inter-quarter volatility that we see out there really doesn't influence that in a material way. It's more trends that we see out there, and we continue to watch all of those as does the rest of the industry.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to come back to long-term care. Can you just remind us the 90% in interest adjusted loss ratio. Just remind us where you would need to get to before you'd be out of harm's way? I know 90% is too high, but is it 85% or -- I just want to get a better handle for what the goal is and where you need to get to. And then I guess a related question, how much -- at a 90% interest adjusted loss ratio, how much margin would you have right now in the block?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. I think the 90% really relates to my last question, which is that's a fairly short-term measure around what it's running at. So we've said previously that we'd like to see ranges below that over time and -- but it is over a long period of time, and rate increases come into play in that and how that influences that, and so I think that, that's something we'll actively manage and actively communicate to you where we've seen. So I think that 90% is probably okay for the time being, but certainly, it's something we'd like to work down with price increases, et cetera, over a very long-term period of time.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You're asking a question about margin relative to that, so that's a multifaceted type discussion around how it is. We talked a little bit about the interest rate environment in that. The business is still -- the business line is still generating money. You would've seen closed block results, which were quite good in the quarter at about $30 million, and that was driven by pretty good results in long-term care. So we're still clipping along on that front.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But where do you need to get to from -- in interest rate adjusted loss ratio longer-term to be at a comfortable level? Is it mid-80s, low 80s? I just want to get a better handle on that.","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, I think I'd probably keep it more near term in terms of where we can run and look at it. It's going to be right in that 90% range, so where we like it to be lower and we're talking about multiple years and time frames around which we like to see that trend down, but we're comfortable with where we are right now.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Tom, that gets us to really the back. But again, we are using every lever we possibly have to improve the operational performance of that block. And I guess, it's been a while maybe since we've given Kevin an update on just some of the rate actions that we're putting in place. But people shouldn't assume that we're not doing we shouldn't-- permit and I think we're doing all the things we can on that front. Maybe a quick update there might be helpful.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Back in when we took the charge in sort of fourth quarter 2011 and put the block into closed block status and established gross premium valuation reserves, we anticipated and planned for the execution of rate increases in the upwards 25% and above on the block of business. We've been going through the approval process with all the states over the last year. We're basically through that approval process now. I think we've only got 2 states outstanding still, Florida and New York. I think it's Florida and New York. They're still outstanding. And we're exceeding our expectations in terms of the rate increases approved. That said, as we said in the past, it's going to be an interim[ph] process and we'll be going through that a number of times. We've started implementing those rate increases. That cash flow will start to flow in primarily in 2014 more than in 2013. We'll have to see what policyholder behaviors as a result to that, whether that take -- except the rate increases, they could buy down their benefits instead of the rate increase or they could lapse all of those. We've got assumptions about all of those things built in and right now, I'd say we're running better than expectations, which over time should, as Rick alluded to, should move the loss ratio down, but it'll take time for that to occur.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Kevin, just to help us understand what the whole dynamic of re-rates would mean. Is that likely -- is that something that's already factored into reserves or is that going to be a benefit as we think about it going forward in terms of that flowing through?","Kevin P. McCarthy","A significant amount of the rate increase was factored into the original assumptions. What we've achieved so far is slightly above what we factored into those assumptions. But also, as Rick said, those assumptions include assumptions about interest rates. They include assumptions about incident rates, mortality, all of those things over the life of a long-term care block that's going to build 20, 30, 40, 50 years. Those assumptions are going to move around with changes in medical technology, with changes in interest rates, et cetera, so that's why the rate increase process has to be an interim [ph] one.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then my last question, I guess, for Rick, the Unum Provident International Limited had a modest loss on a stat accounting basis this quarter. Was this being driven by long-term care and what would the outlook be there?","Richard P. McKenney","No, we don't get into that, we don't actually talk too much about our detailed entities because it really can get lost in the details of volatility you might see in any one entity. We did have a loss and it's actually in our supplement around UPIL, which is our Bermuda subsidiary. On the quarter but actually we made money in the last quarter so you're going to see inter-quarter volatility and I really don't want to get into drivers and attributes by each one of our legal entities.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And sorry one last one if I could sneak in just for Tom Watjen. So Tom, I just want to get a better handle for broad capital management, the way you're thinking about it. I totally hear what you're saying about considering where the stock is in valuation as it relates to buyback, but I want to get a better sense for, are you guys now thinking a bit more defensively with capital management, considering what could go wrong? Or is it more still pretty offensive-minded in terms of, if you're not buying back shares, then you'd be doing something more offensive-oriented?","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe, Tom, the word I prefer to use is balanced. I think we've always had a balance approach. As I mentioned, there were a number of different things we thought about as a potential use of capital that we've both created, as well as the excess we've had on our balance sheet. And I don't think that balance point has actually changed at all. As I said, we want to continue to do the right things. We've proven as a -- I think as a management team, we've done the right things in terms of allocating that excess capital across the different set of dimensions here. And I think those areas that we can potentially invest in that are no different today than they were 2 years ago or 5 years ago, frankly. The relative attractiveness of those can actually change as we said based on market conditions and strategic considerations and those kind of things. But I don't think anything has changed, Rick, as it relates to how we've gone about this in a very, very balanced way, in a very disciplined way. And if we end up accumulating more capital in a period of time -- periods of time like this, that's not a bad place to be either, if we don't find a good way to deploy it. So I think that's where I actually tend to -- I'd like you to think, Tom, about the approach. It's still remains very, very balanced, and we continue to have that full menu in front of us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to touch base about the earnings outlook for 2013. Operating EPS was up 6% for the first half of this year. You're still guiding to 0% to 6%. Does that sort of imply flat operating EPS for the back half of this year?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. I think that when you look at it, Jay, when we think about our 0% to 6% we went into the year, we're not going to adjust that range until we see something material that takes us either one way of the range or outside of the other. So we still see ourselves relatively in that. We're not intoning anything by leaving it where it is today. We still feel comfortable in that range, and we'll continue to execute through the second half of the year. So I wouldn't read anything into the fact that we didn't change it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. On a separate issue, given the decline in year-over-year sales in the U.S., probably greater than a lot of people's expectations, can you talk to us about how things are going so far in 3Q?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes. Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","I guess, my answer to that will be we won't talk about 3Q already. So we're early into it and so we'll take the long term and we'll talk to you in next earnings call about that.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Last issue on the improvement in the U.K. earnings. Should we anticipate that, that trend continues, not just on a year-over-year basis, but quarter-over-quarter?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. Certainly, when you look at our U.K. results, we were actually quite pleased with where they are today. I don't we've gotten to the point. It's still pretty early in our repricing process. The reinsurance that we talked about and all those different pieces, so I think we're optimistic about where that trend line lands. But I think that we'll wait and see a couple of more quarters into that process before we declare a victory. So I'd say we're happy for now and we'll watch third and fourth quarter, how it plays out, but the teams are doing great job there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go a little bit of detail maybe on the investment portfolio. I think the portfolio yield is about 6.35% now. Can you give us a little perspective on new money rates, and also what kind of coupons are rolling off the portfolio at this point?","Richard P. McKenney","It's a good question, Jeff. And I think when we look at it, we really don't spend a lot of time analyzing our portfolio at the macro level. It's a product line by product line thing. When we invest, it's really to back up our liabilities and how we look at it. So when we manage line-by-line, we actually see the portfolio runoffs being reasonable over their time frame, and so if you see that overall yield come down, which in a macro level, I would expect you would, we're taking offsetting impacts and pricing that we've talked about in the past on the other side of that equation. So it's good discussion, good analysis, but the new money rates that we're seeing today, whether it's the 30-year, which we back up on our LTC business are closer to the 10 with our disability business, we're happy to see those moved up, but we'd still like to see a little bit more of an increase here over time and going through that. So it's a good discussion, certainly, happy where we are today. And I'd reiterate that the credit quality of that portfolio is in extremely good shape.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the U.K., obviously, you're taking the pricing actions that you've needed to take and have a lot of discipline there. I guess, the hope would be at some point that the market firms along with you. I guess, still based on what we're seeing with persistency, so far, it doesn't appear that maybe there's a lot of market firming. Is there any reason to hope that maybe the market is turning yet or not?","Thomas R. Watjen","Jess, maybe I'll ask Peter O'Donnell to talk about that. And actually, one of the things, you look at headline result, you look at the declining sales position, there's a piece in there, Peter, we should talk about, which is that's really largely of group life. The LTD business actually has some good growth. And actually, most encouraging, we also assume soft -- wonderful growth trends among first time buyers. But maybe, Peter, just maybe embellish a little bit on that.","Peter G. O'donnell","Thanks, Tom. Thanks very much for the question, Jeff. So if I start with the LTD line, our sales year-on-year are up 5%. And we do see price competition also in the LTD line. Our customers and brokers really value Unum's expertise and our focus. However, some of our competitors aren't as disciplined. And we do see a lot of competition at the large case. The big strategic change for us is through the last 12 months to 2 years, we've been looking at a new to market and getting new employee classes, and almost 50% of our sales in the second quarter are actually came from either first time buyers or people deepening penetration, bringing new class of employees. And that gives us momentum to be able to sort of get momentum behind the sales and not be so dependent on price in the switch business. On the group life side, where we are there is there's a bit of portfolio cleansing going on there, I would say, Jeff. So there are some schemes that we didn't like to look at. We were putting some large price increases through our group life book, double-digit plus. We expect that to continue for the next 6 to 12 months really and really some of our competitors, as you know, people get around and they chase volumes. They're not as interested in margin. And I think they'll experience some pain on that so we would expect that market to sort of move to a more rational level over that 2014 period, really.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to dig in yet again into the U.S. sales. And if I understand correctly, the 3 main drivers for the decline were ACA, the economy and increased competition. If I look sequentially, really, things like this quarter was the first quarter where you really saw a very significant drop, where I'm thinking ACA, that was kind of a headwind for the last 2 quarters as well. The economy has certainly been headwind for several quarters. So is it really competition that's changed so much?","Thomas R. Watjen","And Mike, maybe you should take that because especially though when you do have fewer at-bats how much that can change people's competitive spirit.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, thanks, absolutely. So yes, you actually have seen that with your clients in the market that are actively looking to evaluate different benefits providers. You see many more competitors that are more aggressive competition, and we're going to hold the line there. I think as you talked sequentially quarter-over-quarter, one thing that we've talked to, Kevin has spoken to, is the fact that in the large end of the market, we're actually towards -- or better suited to be able to sort through health care and move some things on the ancillary side. We've got a couple of good quarters and that's an opportunistic segment for us. So for the last few quarters, we've -- through our partnership with UnitedHealthcare, through our focus on a couple of targeted segments, we've had some good wins there that we've been able to bring clients on board at acceptable pricing levels. So that's covered on the disability side, where we've seen a little bit of a downward trend over the last couple of quarters. And when you see that, it's primarily ACA and economy-related. As we look forward, again, as Kevin said, I think as employers push through and get health care changes sorted, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll start to see improvements in our sales results.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And about that cautious optimism, so given the increased competition that we see in certainly almost any management team that we talked to these days is focused on U.S. group or voluntary supplemental. What gives you the confidence, I guess, that, that headwind of increased competition will not overcome the offsetting tailwind of -- at the release of ACA demand?","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, I mean that's a couple of things. One is I think the long-term trends are very positive for our business. I think we see strong need and actually increasing need for the products we've got. U.S. workers, 60% of which live paycheck to paycheck. We see increased exposure appearing as gaps, appearing health care plans as employers settle kind of DC-type approaches. I think health care is getting more standardized. As the Federal Government defined health care, more and more employers are picking standards of design. So if you want to differentiate with a perspective and current employees on the benefits front, increasingly, it's our lines of business that are going to make a difference. So I think those are long-term, very positive trends. And in fact, we've been focused on consumer-driven benefits here for the last 4, 5 years. It enabled us to get ahead of the curve whether that's offering design or whether it's 40-plus technology partners that are now forming the backbones of private exchanges, we feel like we've got a pretty good head start that as sort of the temporary distraction, we'll work through that as the economy begins to pick up a bit. I think that bodes quite well for us.","Thomas R. Watjen","And if I could add, I think we feel very good about the quality of our operating and our stickiness of the -- our offering in the marketplace. We see repeatedly, I think, whether it's Mike's business, Peter's business or Randy's business, the things we really do are very competitive in the marketplace. You see that with persistency. You see that, as Peter said, with sales to knowing new customers. The one thing we, unfortunately, can't address is the fact that some competitors are still willing to price business at substantially below their cost of capital and we've all talked about returns throughout the discussion today. Our returns for our core businesses are in some cases, 2x, in some cases, 3x times the industry average actually. And we're not prepared to compromise those pieces. So again, the good news is, I think, our operating throughout all our businesses are very competitive. But again, as people compared to buy business, I think you've seen us as a management team unwilling to do that. And I think that's proven to be the right thing over the long term.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Well I think Tom that was the last question, and I think let me just thank you, all, for taking the time to join us this morning, and this completes the second quarter of 2013 earnings call.

Our third quarter results are strong, building up the positive business trends and favorable momentum we've been experiencing over the past several quarters. Our after-tax operating income per share was $1.09, another record high for the company and a very strong increase of 11% relative to the year-ago quarter.","In fact, for the first 9 months of 2017, our after-tax operating income per share has increased by 9%. This exceeds our expectations coming into the year. We now expect our full year growth to be at to slightly above the upper end of the range of growth of 5% to 8% we established last quarter. Jack will discuss the drivers of the performance in a moment.","From an overall growth perspective, we also feel positive about the top line, which saw premiums grow 5.5% in our core operating segments this quarter, excluding a reinsurance transaction, and our overall benefits performance remained stable. This financial performance continued to be driven by our Unum U.S. and Colonial Life segments.","Both businesses are producing great results, with good sales momentum and persistency driving solid premium growth. Combining our stable benefits experience and well-managed expenses, we continue to produce leading profit margins.","Our Unum U.K. results are running slightly below our expectations due, in large part, to the uncertain U.K. environment. And finally, Closed Block operations showed some underlying volatility this quarter in long-term care, although earnings results for this segment remain within our expectations.","These results are a continuation of the trends we've seen for the last several years, trends that have accelerated in 2017. Our strategy is a simple one, a singular focus on the employee benefits market, taking care of our customers at time of need and consistently executing on our plans.","Over the years, we've built strong positions in the market where we compete. We've focused on what we're good at, helping people through difficult times in their lives, and this has enabled us to become a leader in employee benefits. We also pride ourselves on delivering consistency. While we know there will always be challenges and volatility in the marketplace, we've demonstrated an ability to execute and course-correct through whatever the external environment throws at us.","A key to our success is a commitment to investing in our future. Customer expectations are only increasing, and we understand that these expectations are being set not necessarily by our peers in the insurance sector but by leading consumer companies across all industries. We're investing in capabilities that will enhance the experiences our customers have with us, and we're already seeing these investments pay off in persistency and effective risk management.","As you've heard me say before as recently as last quarter, the quality of our people and the strength of our culture are the backbone of our company. The financial protections we offer mainly deal with people at difficult times in their lives in a very personal way. An empathetic positioning is critical to ensuring we deliver on the promises we make to our customers and, in turn, we will be a company that also delivers for our shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Jack to take on some of the details of what was a very strong third quarter. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone.","As Rick stated, the third quarter was another outstanding one for Unum. Our after-tax operating income per share of $1.09 is an increase of 11.2% over the year-ago quarter, with a strong balance between operational performance drivers and capital management drivers. Our after-tax operating income increased 7.6% in the quarter, the best performance in many years, while share repurchases contributed 3.6% to upper share growth.","Unum U.S. continues to be the primary driver of this strong performance with another excellent quarter highlighted by improved sales trends, good premium growth, favorable benefit ratios in each business line and lower expense ratios. All these trends are driving strong profit margins in an operating ROE of 16.6% for the quarter.","Within Unum U.S., group disability produced an outstanding quarter, with before-tax operating income of $90 million, an increase of 5.4% over last year. Premium income increased 2.2%, and the benefit ratio improved to 76.7% from 78.6% a year ago.","As expected, favorable incidence trends in LTD and lower prevalence rates in STD have more than offset the impact of the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.","The group life and AD&D line produced a strong quarter, with operating income of $60.1 million, an increase of 12.5% over last year. Premium income increased 4.8%, and the benefit ratio improved to 71.4% from 72.6% last year, primarily driven by lower incidence and average claim size in our group life product line.","The supplemental and voluntary lines had a record quarter, with $108.3 million in operating income, an increase of 17.5% over last year. Premium income continued to grow at a healthy pace, with voluntary benefits line increasing 7% and the individual disability line increasing 2%, excluding the impact of the reinsurance treaty we entered into in the fourth quarter of 2016.","In addition, the dental and vision line, which we acquired in August of last year, contributed $42.2 million of premium income versus $20 million last year. The improvement in operating income for the segment was driven by improved benefits experience in both VB and IDI, favorable expenses and favorable DAC development.","Sales for Unum U.S. for the third quarter rebounded strongly, increasing 21.1% over last year. Sales were particularly strong for LTD, increasing 28%, STD increasing 76.9% and individual disability increasing 24.4%. We saw a decline of 1.8% in voluntary benefits sales in the quarter, primarily driven by volatility in the large case sector. For the year-to-date, our VB sales were up 12%, and we expect to see better growth in the fourth quarter, given our pipeline of activities.","The addition of the dental and vision product line contributed $9.7 million of sales versus $4.5 million last year, and we continued to see a strong level of quote activity being generated in this product line. Persistency for our group product lines is lower than the year-ago levels, but has improved relative to the first half of the year and remains well within our expectations.","Unum U.K. continues to be impacted by the uncertain environment brought on by last year's Brexit vote. Third quarter operating earnings reflect this challenge, declining by 6% from last year to GBP 20.2 million. Our premium income did pick up slightly this quarter, increasing 3.6% in local currency due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior-period sales and stable persistency.","That Unum U.K. benefit ratio was 74.9% for the third quarter, an increase from 71.8% last year, driven by higher claims incidence and lower claim recoveries in the group disability line and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits as well as the 80 basis point reduction to our discount rate for new claims, which we implemented in the first quarter.","Risk experience in the group life line improved over the year-ago quarter due to a lower average claim size. Although the quarter was an unusually difficult one for Unum U.K., we believe that business will continue to feel pressure as the U.K. works through the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","Unum U.K. sales for the third quarter declined by 14.2% in local currency. This decline was driven by lower group long-term disability sales, which was only partially offset by sales growth in the group life and supplemental line, particularly dental and group critical illness.","Looking now at Colonial Life. We saw another strong and steady quarter, with operating income of $81.7 million, an increase of 3.4% over last year. Premium income growth remains healthy, increasing 6.9%, driven by the positive sales trends we've seen over many quarters as well as stable persistency.","Colonial Life's benefit ratio ticked up to 51.8% this quarter from 51.6% last year, with less favorable experience in the cancer and critical illness lines, offsetting improved experience in the life and accident, sickness and disability lines.","Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be positive, increasing 2.6% over the year-ago quarter. Sales growth in the core commercial segment helped to drive this growth, along with increased sales in the public sector. We also continued to see good trends, with new account sales increasing 4.7%, while sales to existing accounts increased 1.5%. Persistency for Colonial Life remains stable at 79%.","Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income declined to $26.6 million in the third quarter from $28.6 million in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest-adjusted loss ratio was 82.4%. This is slightly unfavorable relative to last year's 81.5%, but continues to be in line with expectations. For long-term care, the interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 93.3%, above our expected range of 85% to 90%, although slightly favorable to last year's 93.8%.","As you may recall, last year's benefit ratio was elevated due to the impact of a large group case that moved to an individual ported status. The elevation in the current benefit ratio is largely attributable to unusually unfavorable policyholder lapses. Although we'd rather than not see this volatility, we're encouraged that the underlying claims experience was consistent with historical norms.","Other important factors related to long-term care line continued to trend favorably this quarter. Our new-money yield in the quarter was again above our 5% assumption, just as it has been since resetting of that assumption in the fourth quarter of 2014.","In addition, we continue to make good progress with rate increases on the in-force business, with several additional approvals, keeping us on pace to achieve, if not slightly exceed, the rate increase expectations assumed in our reserves.","We continue to have productive discussions with our state insurance departments, and it's worth noting that other than the small amounts outstanding from our 2014 filings, no future rate increases are built into our current reserve assumptions. With that said, we plan to actively pursue the future rate increases were justified.","So overall, we had a very strong financial and operating results this quarter. We continue to see strong risk results across the majority of our businesses, coupled with favorable top line growth. We also experienced very favorable expense trends this quarter across all 3 of our core business segments. While we are actively managing our expense base, I would caution you that some of the benefit this quarter was a timing issue and is not likely to recur at the same level in the fourth quarter.","Our financial performance has also continued to generate strong statutory earnings for the company. Net income on a statutory basis totaled $190.3 million this quarter and has totaled approximately $850 million over the trailing four quarters. This creates significant financial flexibility for us, as the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies is now at approximately 410% and our holding companies' cash position, excluding amounts committed for subsidiary contributions, is $771 million.","Both of these metrics improved relative to the second quarter, while we again repurchased $100 million of our shares, consistent with the trend of the past several quarters and in line with our outlook for the year.","Wrapping up, I'm very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. As we look to close out 2017, we expect full year after-tax operating income per share growth to be at, if not slightly above, the upper end of the 5% to 8% range we established last quarter.","Now I'll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you, Jack. And as you can tell, we're very pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We think our strategic position in the employee benefits marketplace remains very strong, and we are successfully translating that into solid operating performance with - on top of our strong financial foundation.","So now I would like to move to your questions. I'll ask Diana to begin the question-and-answer session. Diana?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","First, had a question on just the voluntary and supplemental business. I think earnings in this segment, $108 million, that's the highest level you've had as far back as I can see in your history, and it's significantly higher than it's been in the last few quarters. So what's your view of the sustainability of that number? And I'm assuming that there might be that expense benefit you referred to in there as well.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thanks, Jimmy. We'll have Jack.","Jack McGarry","So the earnings were higher than we've seen in a while. Two factors that, I think, are drivers, the growth in the business. It's growing 7% a year. So of the 17% growth, that would be 7% of it. We did have a favorable quarter from an expense perspective, favorable from risk and favorable from DAC development. I'd say those factors were kind of pretty consistent levels. I think they may settle back.","Even though we had very favorable expenses in the third quarter, we've been on a good trend as a company with our expense ratio, and we'll continue to actively manage expenses going forward. So I'd say, it's probably a little higher than the go-forward rate. But we're really pleased with the performance of the line.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then you've contributed to the New York long-term care block, I think, every - most of the past few years, a little bit each quarter - each year in the fourth quarter. Should we expect a similar contribution this year as well?","Jack McGarry","Yes, I would think it'll be of a similar magnitude.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then lastly, can you give us some sort of initial indications on this consumer reception due to new medical stop-loss product? And what do you see as sort of the long-term growth potential in that market for you guys?","Rick McKenney","Mike?","Mike Simonds","Yes, sure. So we entered the market officially quoting 1\/1\/18 effective business a little over 60 days ago. And we've actually been very positively surprised, actually, with the rapid growth in quote activity. So those decisions tend to be made very close to the effective date. So we'll have to wait and see how the fourth quarter plays out. But we're excited about that as an extension of our brand and a new way to leverage the distribution relationships that we have out there in the market.","Operator","We'll go next to Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","First question just on the M&A environment, given the large transaction that was recently announced. In the past, when we've seen deals like this, has that, historically, been a pretty favorable environment in terms of your ability to win business as a major competitors in transition?","Rick McKenney","Yes. Let me give you a couple of comments on that, Suneet. First of all, when you think about M&A and us, it's something we'll continue to be active in. It's something that we'll be disciplined on. I think it's probably the first and foremost. So I think I'd mentioned that about the environment. You mentioned a specific deal that was announced this week. I mean, I won't get in too much detail, but these are two competitors that are consolidating in the large case market.","And I'd say, they have similar capabilities. And so when you see that out there, I think that we're going to continue to be very competitive in that space. Ultimately, we'll see in the market. But I think that the team out there today on a large case basis has really been on a good run. We're providing a lot of value to our customers, and we'll continue to do that.","Suneet Kamath","And then on the Unum U.S. business. Can you remind us just how much of a drag are you seeing in the benefit ratio from the discount rate adjustment you made last year? And where are your thoughts in terms of potentially making a similar adjustment in 2017?","Jack McGarry","Yes. So I think we said the discount rate adjustment was worth about $7.5 million a quarter when we made it last year. We expected that the favorable trends we're seeing both in recoveries and incidence would more than offset that. That's played out according to our expectations.","We feel comfortable at least at this point with where our investments are and where our interest rates are. We're still doing our reserve adequacy work, but there's nothing there that would lead me to suspect we would take another action this year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI.","Tom Gallagher","The first question is the individual disability in terms of the voluntary and supplemental segment. 48% benefit ratio was quite good. Do you see that more as a bit of an anomaly? Or is there an analogy here in terms of what you've seen on the group disability side for the last several years? Or maybe we start to see a significant improvement versus where you've been in recent history? Anything going underlying with regard to that business?","Jack McGarry","Yes. I don't think we see anything underlying that. That benefit ratio has hovered in there around the 50% mark for a while. It is a smaller block than LTD block, so it's subject to more volatility than the LTD block. But we're very pleased with this quarter's results. We've been very pleased for a long time with the results that block has been generating, and I wouldn't say there's anything unusual about it.","Tom Gallagher","But I guess, Jack, would it - would you assume it's going to be back in the 50s? Or do you think there is - is there anything that you're seeing underlying the claims trends that might suggest you could stay in the 40s or at least below 40%?","Jack McGarry","I'd say, it's slightly under 50%. I think kind of the historical trend is probably a good marker for it.","Tom Gallagher","And then next question. Just you had good sales growth in group, I guess, based on where you're pricing new business now. Do you think you can sustain the favorable margin you've had overall in group? What do you think as you look out over the next couple of years with those? Based on your pricing new business, would there be any pressure on margins? Or do you think you can sustain them?","Rick McKenney","Mike?","Mike Simonds","I would say, the quick answer is, we do feel comfortable about that. If I take you back a year ago, we guided to about 8% to 10% sales growth overall. And part of the reason that we felt like sales momentum would pick up is some of the new capabilities we're putting in the market like our Starmount dental offering. But it was also because we felt like the pricing level that we took into the year didn't need an increase, and that was for the first time in several years. And what we've seen emerge over the course of the year is a reasonably favorable market.","We feel real confident that the prices that we have put out there reflect the underlying economics, the risk and the interest rates like Jack alluded to. So while 3Q sales are our smallest sales quarter of the year and, therefore, subject to a bit more volatility, I'd say, the outlook to continue to drive strong sales growth and maintain margins is good.","Tom Gallagher","And then just final topic on long-term care. Just the - Jack, I heard your comments on, it sounds like, you feel comfortable heading into the fourth quarter review. Is there - just looking at the fact that it's year-to-date, on the benefit ratio side, been above 90%. Is that - is the higher than 90% threshold not really the right way to think about it? Is it that there is significant offset from rate increases? How would you think about dimensioning that? Because - I guess, my question is, if you look into 4Q and if the benefit ratio remained elevated north of 90%, would that be a trigger or not necessarily?","Jack McGarry","Yes. I don't think what happens in the fourth quarter is going to be a trigger. Essentially, we're through our Res work before the fourth quarter is actually finalized. So this is a long-term business. In fact, no single quarter is going to drive what happens to it. I'd say that the loss ratio has been a little bit elevated. But on the other hand, our interest margin and the success we've had in placing new money has been higher than we anticipated in 2014 and has done a lot to kind of offset some of that impact.","Tom Gallagher","And just a follow-up on that. So is it fair to say - I think you've requested a fairly big rate increase in - for California, I think, 75%. Is that not even a relevant factor when you think about your reserve review? Or does that play into it at all?","Jack McGarry","No, it really isn't. I'd view that more as upside than anything. I don't think we need California to hit the assumptions that are in our reserves. But we've been very active in speaking with California, and we're hopeful we'll get a rate increase there. But it's not a reserve element.","Tom Gallagher","And then if I could just sneak one more in. Actuarial Guideline LTC, any initial thoughts on impact for you or the industry related to that?","Jack McGarry","Yes. I can't talk for the industry. I don't anticipate any impacts for us. We've always tested our long-term care on a stand-alone basis. So that's nothing new for us. In addition, our treatment of both rate increases as well as investment results have always been consistent with the actuarial guidance. We think it's positive that the guidance - we support the goal of having better consistency and clarity around actuarial matters, but we feel really good about where we are and don't anticipate any changes as a result.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Couple of quick ones. Any comment on the natural growth in payrolls in the quarter? Are you seeing any uptick there? And then secondly, the Colonial sales were a little bit slower this quarter. What do you anticipate going into next year?","Rick McKenney","Mike, do you want to start on natural growth, and then we'll ask Tim.","Mike Simonds","Yes, sure. Mark, I'd say, pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of quarters, we are seeing a bit of natural growth come through a bit, more so on the salary side, given our mix, than on the job growth, but a bit muted still from what we've seen in prior expansion cycles. I would note, though, that on the earned premium side, persistency continues to improve a bit quarter-over-quarter. And as we look forward, I'd expect that sort of slow improvement to continue as well.","Rick McKenney","And, Tim, do you want to mention on Colonial Life and sales growth?","Tim Arnold","Sure, yes. Thank you, Mark. We feel great about the market opportunity. We still feel very good about our value proposition. We like the strength and effectiveness of our team and our distribution system. We've had a strong year so far and despite the third quarter headwinds, which were largely driven by our large case segment as well as some weather-related issues, we feel good about the year, and the leading indicators we're looking at are positive for the remainder of the year.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","Had a quick one on the long-term care, I guess, more specifically, on the lapse rates. Some of the disclosure in the statutory filing suggests that you're running a little less favorably on lapses compared to peers. I was just wondering if you'd already adjusted some of those. I think some of the reserve work in the past has been related to interest rates, but I wasn't sure some of it was already reducing lapse rates.","Jack McGarry","Yes. I mean, at this point, this is one quarter. It was fairly unusual. I think we're comfortable with where our lapse rates are. There - our assumptions are under 1%, which is pretty consistent with where, I think, the industry is. So there's nothing shocking in here. There's a lot that goes into the statutory filings on long-term care, mortality and lapses and other things. So it's hard to single out a single assumption based on that information.","Alex Scott","And one other quick one on Unum U.K., the discount rate change that you made there. Can you quantify the impact that, that will have on earnings going forward?","Jack McGarry","I mean, it's already in there, so it's already having the impact on earnings for the first 3 quarters. It was kind of a - it was in the neighborhood of around GBP 2 million a quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Both you and the industry have been experiencing favorable underwriting results in U.S. group for a number of quarters now. I guess, do you think this is just a function of disciplined pricing in recent years and the improving economy and employment picture? Or has something else changed in terms of risk assessment or claims handling that's improving results?","Rick McKenney","Mike, do you want to take that?","Mike Simonds","Yes, sure. So I think it's probably much more the former than the latter. We have seen a bit of improved submitted incidents kind of very gradually over the last 8 or 10 quarters. But when I look at industry reports on profitability and the like, it does appear that pricing and underwriting discipline as some players have had to recover has been a driver as well.","Erik Bass","And I guess, on that note then are you seeing any evidence of people factoring in recent favorable experience in their pricing? I know this sort of gets at what Tom was asking to. But do you view margins, I guess, broadly sustainable at these levels? Or is there kind of risk that we're approaching sort of a cyclical peak?","Mike Simonds","I'd say, it's insurance, so you can't predict too far out. But where I've got a line of sight to, I would suspect and believe that margins won't come under any unusual kind of pressure over the coming periods. So that's probably not going to be a big issue.","Erik Bass","So you're not seeing any sort of increased competitiveness or aggressiveness in the pricing at this point?","Mike Simonds","It's a pretty competitive market, but I think that's kind of the norm that we are accustomed to.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","A question on the Unum U.S. I think in Jack's prepared remarks, he talked about the voluntary benefit sales is looking good in the coming fourth quarter. And I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit in terms of what you are seeing for that line of business?","Mike Simonds","Yes, we've really been pleased with voluntary benefit sales. We had a bit of an off quarter. It's a small quarter for voluntary benefits. We did see good growth in the core and the number of clients added. It was the large case VB market where we see a tick down, but on a year-to-date basis feel really good about double-digit sales growth. And like pretty much every line in the portfolio as we look forward and work through fourth quarter, which is when a lot of business comes in for 1\/1 effective dates, we feel good about some momentum in voluntary.","Humphrey Lee","So would you say the quoting activity is better than last year level or is it comparable?","Mike Simonds","I'd say we are seeing a bit increased number of proposals. And we're seeing deeper, broader interest in some of the supplemental lines as well. So your standard group insurance lines have disability and life insurance has a tick or 2 of growth there. But a lot of increased interest in supplemental health voluntary lines in the new dental and vision lines of business and I mentioned quote activity in stop-loss is ticking up.","Humphrey Lee","And then just a question on long-term care. So for these unfavorable lapses, do you see any kind of concentration in vintages or whether that's individual or group? Just any additional color that you can share.","Jack McGarry","I mean, the impact was more individual than it was group. But within the individual, there was no specific vintage. But it was an individual based - the lapse dynamics in the group business are very, very different than the individual and continued kind of on track with where they had been.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo.","Sean Dargan","Jack, just going back to the Closed Block long-term care. So it sounds like you've been putting new money to work at higher yields than you assumed in 2014. Can you remind us what, I guess, the slope of your longer-term interest rate assumptions are? Do they move higher at some point?","Jack McGarry","Yes, they do. So in 2014, we assumed new money rates would be 5% for the ensuing 4 to 5 years and then over the following 5 years would grade back toward a long-term average, which is in, all-in rates, in the high 6s, the 6.50%, 6.75% range. We've exceeded that by a healthy margin in each quarter since 2014. But next year, we'll start to hit the point where those assumptions are expected to start grading upward. We actually are encouraged by the march of the treasury yield over the last quarter or 2, which is good to see. It's approaching where year-end 2016 was.","Sean Dargan","And what are you buying to support that block? Is the securities different than what you have backing other liabilities?","Jack McGarry","I mean, it's somewhat of a different mix. It's longer term. So we're out at that 30-year rather than the 10-year that most people are focused on. We do have some alternative investments back in the line as well and some high yields. So it's longer. It's probably a little bit lower on the quality side from high yield than perhaps our other book.","But overall, we're very comfortable with our high-yield exposure. We're comfortable with our alternative exposure, which we think is probably lower than most of our competitors and feel good about the performance of the portfolio.","Sean Dargan","And then I just have a modeling question on Unum U.S. supplementary and voluntary. So you had a number of favorable items, but the - how should we think about the DAC amortization going forward? Because that seemed very low.","Jack McGarry","Yes, it was. Frankly, it has a lot to do with who persists and who terminates. So overall persistency wasn't out of line with the voluntary benefits. But the persistency, the people who terminated and cases that terminated tended to be kind of older cases where the DAC had already been written off. And we had more favorable persistency on newer cases where they still had a hefty DAC balance going forward. And so it was more about where - the location of where the lapses took place than it was overall lapse.","Operator","With no further questions, I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. We do look forward to seeing many of you at our outlook meeting, which will actually be in New York on December 13. We'll take you through a good look into 2018 and all other things that we're working on. So we hope you'll join us there. And Diana, I guess, that completes our third quarter 2017 conference call.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tom White. Please go ahead.","Tom White","Great. Thank you, Savannah. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 earnings conference call for Unum.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact.

And a presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website, in the Investors section.","Participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; CFO, Jack McGarry; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S.; Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK; Tim Arnold for Colonial Life; and Steve Zabel for the Closed Block.","And now I'll turn the call over to Rick for his opening comments.","Richard McKenney","Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. It was a busy fourth quarter for all, with the initial impacts from the enactments of tax reform reflected in our financial results. Through this, I am very pleased with our underlying results, which continued many of the positive trends we have seen throughout 2017.","Our net income for the quarter was $1.19 per share compared to $1.07 a share in the year ago fourth quarter. Adjusting for tax reform, a settlement on unclaimed death benefits and the net investment gains on our investment portfolio, our adjusted operating income per share was $1.13, up 14% compared to $0.99 in the year ago quarter.","I would note that this result includes a reserve release in our individual disability line of business, resulting from our annual review of reserves, which benefited our adjusted operating income by $0.06 per share. Overall, this was an excellent quarter for the company and a strong finish to the year.","The drivers of these strong results remain consistent throughout the year and again through the fourth quarter. We saw solid top-line growth in our core businesses and excellent operational performance. From a growth perspective in the fourth quarter, we experienced 4% growth in premium income for our core, with 3% premium growth in Unum US, 6% in Colonial Life and 2% for Unum UK in local currency.","A highlight was that that our fourth quarter sales were also very strong, particularly in our US business, where Unum US posted 28% year over year growth, and Colonial Life increased sales by 10.4%, giving us confidence that our premium growth trends can continue in 2018. With the sales growth, we have been firm in our underwriting discipline and we expect to continue to drive strong profit margins in our core business segments.","Our optimism for 2018 is further enhanced with the enactment of tax reform legislation, as Unum will be a significant beneficiary. From a GAAP earnings perspective, our tax rate will decline substantially from a 31% to 32% rate we have been reporting to a new expectation in 2018 of 19% to 21%.","This will also create additional cash flow in 2018, which will accelerate over time. While we expect much of the benefit will accrue to our shareholders, we also expect opportunities for enhanced investment in many aspects of our business. This includes infrastructure and technology spending to better serve the needs of our customers, further investment in our workforce, and finally, investment in and support for the communities that we call home.","And finally, we're looking to see how tax reform drives accelerated economic growth in the broader U.S. economy. For us, employment growth and wage inflation mean incremental growth for our customers and our business. Our optimism is also evident in our announcement last week of the acquisition of Pramerica \u017bycie, a financial protection provider in Poland. This strategic acquisition expands our geographic footprint into Poland, a very attractive market for us.","This is a good profitable business with an excellent reputation, strong management team and a successful distribution model. We believe that over time as we expand the product portfolio and enhance the delivery capabilities with Unum's and Colonial Life's expertise, we can help build on its growth momentum.","We continue to feel very good about our direction as we move into 2018. Based on solid positions in our markets, we continue to look for opportunities for growth through product expansion and geographic expansion. This includes opportunities to further serve the needs of both employers and their employees.","The results we're generating and the flexibility that these strong results provide us, drive us as we look to further expand our business. We do this from a position of having great purpose in what we do. Our strategy is to provide more employees access to products and services, to protect their financial wellbeing in difficult times.","The need for this has never been greater and it's threefold: providing protection gaps when people need us most, helping individuals return to work and helping employers attract and retain employees. Now, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover some of the details from our fourth quarter results. Jack?","John McGarry","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Following on Rick's comments, the fourth quarter was another strong quarter, concluding an excellent year for the company. In my remarks this morning, I'll provide more detail on our financial performance and discuss some of the financial implications of tax reform.","In addition, similar to others in the industry, we reached the settlement with a third party concerning unclaimed death benefits, which impacted after-tax net income by $25.4 million in the fourth quarter. This special item affected the Colonial Like segment, the group life and AD&D segment, and supplemental and voluntary business lines of Unum US.","In my remarks this morning, I'll exclude the impact of this settlement to make for a more consistent basis of comparison with the year ago quarter. Our strong financial performance continues to be driven in large part by the positive trends we're experiencing in Unum US, including strong sales growth, solid persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends. These trends are driving strong profit margin and adjusted operating ROE of 16.8% this quarter.","Within Unum US, group disability produced very good results for the fourth quarter with before tax adjusted operating income of $86.7 million. This is a decline from the year ago result of $89.5 million, primarily driven by lower net investment income and higher expenses. As a reminder, we had an exceptionally low expense ratio in the third quarter, which we expected to come back in the fourth quarter.","I'm encouraged that the premium income increased by 2.2% over the year ago fourth quarter, and that the benefit ratio improved to 76.3% from 77.7% in the year ago quarter. The improvement was driven by the ongoing favorable instance in claim recovery trends in LTD. So we continue to see very positive trends in this business.","The group life and AD&D line produced good results as well with adjusted operating income of $57 million in the fourth quarter compared to $56.1 million in the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 2.8% and the benefit ratio improved slightly to 71.3% compared to 71.5% in the year ago quarter as claims incidence was slightly improved.","The supplemental and voluntary lines produced very strong results with adjusted operating income of $120.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $94.5 million a year ago. Income in this line benefited by $19.5 million from an annual reserve review in the individual disability line, recognizing updated morbidity assumptions in the disabled life reserves.","Premium income continue to grow at a healthy pace. The voluntary benefits line increased 8.1% and the dental and vision line increased 8.5%. These increases were partially offset by a 3.6% decline in the individual disability line.","Risk experience was generally in line for the individual disability line and stable for the voluntary benefits lines, excluding the impact of the unclaimed death benefit reserve increase. Risk experience for the dental and vision line was favorable relative to the year ago quarter.","Sales for Unum US for the fourth quarter were excellent, increasing 28.7% for the quarter relative to last year. The increase was widespread across product lines and between core market and large case segments. Sales were strong for LTD, increasing 17.2%. And for group life increasing 25.1% over the year ago quarter.","In STD, sales increased 57.8%, but benefited by approximately $22.6 million from an update to the New York disability law for paid family leave.","Adjusting for this one-time benefit, sales still increased by 22.8% for Unum U.S., in total. We also saw strong trends in the supplemental and voluntary lines. Our voluntary benefit sales increased 11.9% and dental and vision jumped 148% from $10 million last year to $24.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.","We're very pleased with the rollout of the dental product to half of our Unum U.S. sales channel. And we look forward to the further gains in 2018, as we rollout our dental offering to the rest of the Unum U.S. sales force and to the Colonial Life distribution channel.","Persistency for our group product lines was lower in 2017 relative to 2016, but improved throughout the year and was in line with our expectations. We're also seeing encouraging trends for persistency early in 2018.","Unum UK continues to be impacted by the uncertain business environment related to Brexit. Fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings reflect this challenge declining by 7.1% from last year to $22.4 million. Premium income increased this quarter growing 2.3% in local currency due to growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales, which offset a decline in persistency.","The Unum UK benefit ratio was 75.8% for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to 67.6% last year. The increased loss ratio reflects higher claims incidence in the group disability line. The impact from the 80 basis point reduction to our discount rate for new claims, which we implemented in the first quarter and the impact from inflation linked increases in benefits, which were largely offset by higher income from our inflation index linked bonds.","Unum UK sales for the fourth quarter declined by 3.7% in local currency. This decline was driven by lower group life sales and supplemental product line sales, which offset higher sales in the group long-term disability line. Last year's fourth quarter sales results were very strong making for a tough comparison. All-in-all, our UK business is performing well and the difficult environment and produced an adjusted operating return on equity of 15.5% for the quarter.","Colonial Life was again a strong contributor to our overall income though adjusted operating income was 1% lower at $79.1 million relative to last year's fourth quarter. Premium income growth remains healthy increasing 6% driven by the positive sales trends we've seen over many quarters. Colonial Life's benefit ratio, excluding the unclaimed death benefits reserve increase was stable at 51.6% this quarter compared to 51.4% last year.","Less favorable experience in the life product line was largely offset by improved experience in the cancer and critical illness and the accident, sickness and disability lines. The expense ratio was slightly elevated in the fourth quarter driven in large part by strategic investments in our business and higher IT expenditures. The adjusted operating return on equity for Colonial Life remains very strong at 15.4%.","Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be very strong increasing 10.4% over the year ago quarter. Sales growth in the core commercial segment help to drive this along with increased sales in the large case corporate sector, we also continue to see good trends with new account sales increasing 13.2% and sales to existing accounts increasing 8.7%. We continue to invest in territory expansion and we'll begin to rollout the dental product to our Colonial Life agents this year. This should led to accelerated sales growth in 2018.","Finally for the Closed Block adjusted operating income declined to $33.1 million in the fourth quarter from $34.6 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability product line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 84.7% last year, primarily resulting from lower submitted claim incidence and a lower average size of new claims.","The long term care interest adjusted benefit ratio increased to 93.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 89.1% in the year ago quarter. Risk results this quarter showed unfavorable policy terminations, primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience. I remind you that at December outlook meeting, we indicated that long term care ratio will likely exceed our prior expectation of a range of 85% to 90% over the near term. This quarter's results are in line with our revised expectations.","Two important factors related to the long term care line continue to trend favorably this quarter. First, our new money yield this quarter was again above our assumption of 5%, just as it has been since resetting that assumption in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Again as we said in December, we're nearing the point where our reserve assumptions begin to reflect our rising new money yields. While long duration treasury yields have moved somewhat higher recently, credit spreads on bonds remain tight.","Second, while it's a quiet quarter for rating increase approvals on imports business, we still have a few large rate requests yet to be decided. Even without these, we're confident we will achieve the rate increase expectations assumed in our reserve assumptions. It bears repeating that we assume no future rate increases in our current reserve assumptions then we intend to actively pursue future rate increases were justified.","So in total, we saw strong financial and operating results this quarter. We continue to see very good risk results across the majority of our businesses along with favorable top line growth.","Now I would like to provide some commentary around tax reform and the implications for Unum. In short, we feel the impacts are largely very beneficial for the company. In the fourth quarter, we reported two immediate impacts. First, the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability at the newly enacted rate of 21% resulted in a tax benefit of $97.7 million or $0.44 per diluted common share. Second, one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings generated a tax expense of $66.4 million or $0.30 per diluted common share. This tax expense will be amortized into cash taxes over the next eight years.","We'll see additional impact as we move into 2018. First, we'll have a substantially lower GAAP tax rate. Our current reported tax rate is generally in the 31% to 32% range with the new U.S. corporate tax rate being lowered to 21%. We expect our reported rate for 2018 to be in the 19% to 20% range.","Next, from a cash flow perspective, we estimated cash tax savings equal to approximately one half of the GAAP benefit. This cash tax savings will move closer to the GAAP savings over time. For 2018, we estimate that our free cash flow will benefit by approximately $90 million and this benefit will grade up to $200 million over the next 10 years. Clearly, this has very positive implications for the company.","Finally, as you know tax reform will have negative impacts on company's risk based capital ratios. For our traditional U.S. based life insurance companies, we are estimating our year end 2017 risk based capital ratio to be approximately 390%, which compares to 405%, a year-end 2016 and about 410% at the end of the third quarter.","In the absence of tax reform, we would have expected our year-end 2017 risk based capital ratio to be consistent with the fourth quarter - with the third quarter levels. The difference of about 20 points is primarily driven by the $236 million reduction in our statutory deferred tax asset allowed to be included in bidding assets for total adjusted capital.","The 390% RBC is within our targeted range of 375% to 400% and a very comfortable - and we're very comfortable at this level. The NAIC is still grappling with how and when they will modify the RBC formulas to reflect the new tax environment. In addition, the anticipated 2019 C1 factor changes made further impact RBC calculations. It's unclear how the rating agencies will treat these changes, particularly those agencies that utilize proprietary capital models with before tax rather than after tax adjustments.","Given our strong and growing free cash flow generation, we're very confident in our ability to rack as their views become clarified.","Moving on, we continue to deliver healthy levels of statutory earnings at our traditional U.S. insurance companies. For full year 2017 statutory after tax adjusted operating earnings totaled $812.4 million, down from $884.6 million in full year 2016. 2017 results were impacted by some one-time items. But after adjusting for these, our 2017 results were in line with the year ago total. Another good year of statutory earnings in 2017 will of course drive strong dividend capacity for us in 2018.","Holding company cash ended 2017 at $864 million. Our annual need for interest expense and shareholder dividends is approximately $366 million. So we have ample comfort. We will be paying for Pramerica \u017bycie acquisition with cash at the holding company and do not expect this transition to impact our plans to repurchase $400 million in shares in 2018.","For the fourth quarter, our share repurchase was again totaled $100 million, putting full year 2017 repurchases at $400 million. It really shows the strength and flexibility of our capital position and capital deployment plans, when we can execute on the strategic expansion opportunities. Growth in our core businesses either through organic growth or acquisition is our number one priority for deployment of excess capital.","Wrapping up, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance. At our outlook meeting in December, we indicated our expectation for growth and adjusted operating earnings per share for 2018 to be within a range of 4% to 7%.","With the enactment of tax reform legislation, we are revising our outlook to a range of 17% to 23% from a base of adjusted operating earnings per share of $4.24 for 2017. This change in outlook reflects the lower tax rate, as well as our desire to use some of the tax savings to accelerate investments in our infrastructure and capabilities.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Rick, for his closing comments.","Richard McKenney","Great. Thank you, Jack. As you can tell, we're very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, which significantly exceeded our expectations coming into the year. I believe this is a result of the positive momentum we're seeing in our core business lines and the strong operational trends we are delivering.","Our strategic position in the employee benefits marketplace remain strong and we're successfully building on that through organic growth as well as the opportunities we are seeing through acquisitions, both product expansion with dental acquisitions in the UK and US, and geographic expansion with last week's acquisition in Poland.","We'll now move on to your questions, so I'll ask Savannah to begin the Q&A session, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, given the significant magnitude of the GE long-term care reserve charge, could you discuss some of the key difference you see with your block versus theirs that you see more comfort with the reserve adequacy.","John McGarry","Yeah. Sure.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, absolutely. Good morning, Ryan. So we feel like we're in a very different place than GE is. First, I'd point out that the blocks are very different. GE's block was a reinsured block, which removes them one step from the customer block. Our block was direct written, so we directly control the underwriting and benefit guidelines in that block.","The other big difference is 85% of our insured lives are group long-term care. They have a much younger profile. They - and most of those actual group long-term care insurance are employer funded as opposed to employee funded, much smaller benefit levels, much more conservative plan designs.","The other - by comparison the GE block was 100% long-term care. And it was a much older block than our block is. Second, we aggressively and actively managed block over time. Since - I know, we've had ten full-time actuaries dedicated to the block since 2012. And for a period, I was one of them.","Between reserve increases and reserve charges, we strengthened reserve margins over time by $4 billion in the block. And I will tell you, within long-term care timing matters. The earlier you move the better off you're going to be. And so, we have been an early adopter in that, in the block.","The third thing I'd say is we did our comprehensive review of the long-term care block in 2014. We provided a lot of resources to build sophisticated models. We set our assumptions to be consistent with our emerging experience. And on an ongoing basis, monthly we track our actual to assumed assumptions and we provide you quarterly updates with that on an ongoing basis.","The fourth thing I'd point out is we just concluded our 2017 reserve accuracy studies. We had margin in our reserves, as a result of that analysis. The other thing is we have no future rate increases assumed, although we intend to pursue them. And then, finally we have $1 billion difference between our GAAP results and stat reserves.","We believe these buffers insulate our capital plans. We've been dealing with this problem for a long time. I think our dealing with it is characterized, but there's been no surprises. As a result, we've kept you apprised on an ongoing basis of where we are. And there's been no impact to our capital plans along the way. And we would expect that to continue into the future.","Ryan Krueger","Right. Thank you for taking the questions.","John McGarry","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Hi, thank you. Can you talk about how you expect pricing across your businesses to respond to the tax rate changes? And are there different dynamics for different lines of business?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, Erik. This is Rick. There are different dynamics that are happening. I think that when we look at the - the short answer is we don't see much impact certainly in the near-term. But let me - we can dimension that for you and then hit it by each for a line. So, Jack, do you want to talk a little bit about kind of the overview, why we say that?","John McGarry","Absolutely. Good morning, Rick. The first thing I'd say is that our success as a company has been predicated on providing exceptional value to our customers and we do not expect that to change with tax reform. Price isn't the all-in thing in terms of how we go to market. But within that we have pieces of our business that will react very differently.","First, 10% of our earnings come from the Closed Block. We're certainly not going to be reducing prices there. The second thing I'd say that may come as a surprise to people, 53% of our earnings as a company come from IDI voluntary benefits in Colonial Life & Accident. If you look at those products, they are much different than group products. First of all, they file the rates. And so, that file process - filing process is a long and arduous process.","And so the re-pricing horizon is a five-year pricing horizon rather than a one or three year. The second thing about those is we price those products on a free cash flow generation model as opposed to base on GAAP ROE and as you know with some of the timing differences that emerged in the tax reform. Free cash flow did not benefit as robustly as GAAP earnings did.","And then the final thing I'd say about those is those are issue age rates. And so, if you did change rate over that time horizon, it would only impact new business coming onto the books. The back book wouldn't change rates and would continue to generate strong earnings for a very long time to come.","Probably the most impactful place is kind of our group term product. So group life LTD and STD. 41% of our earnings as a company are generated by that. And let me talk about some of the underlying characteristics of that. The first one would be in terms of pricing within the industry we would only need to respond to the industry tax savings, rather than our tax savings, and because the industry has a significantly lower margin than we do.","We don't see that as being terribly material maybe in the 1% to 1.5% of premium range. Frankly, 1% to 1.5% of premium isn't within the precision window of the group benefits business. And if you want to be convinced of that, look at a chart of all the group competitors, group margins over the last four or five years. I will tell you, it looks like a spaghetti chart. It would suggest that pricing of 1% really isn't much of a factor.","The other thing I'd say is not everyone was at a 35% tax rate going into this. If you were heavily invested in tax exempt bonds, you got no tax savings on that income, as a result of tax reform. And if you're using those bonds to back liabilities at a tax equivalent discount rate, you may actually be feeling some pressure as a result of tax reform.","The other thing is the capital impacts of tax reform are still uncertain. If people need to rebuild capital to come back up to the same levels of risk-based capital after the formula changes as they were before they may not see ROEs improve and wouldn't be pricing any of that back into the market.","And then the third thing is even in the group business although it's a term business, it's still a three to four year pricing cycle, because of how renewals come up and rate guarantees are in place. So some of that may get priced back over time, but we think it's going to be very muted relative to the current expectations.","And so right now I'd like to turn it back to Rick for a second.","Richard McKenney","Yeah. So I think it's instructive, Erik. Jack's given you a lot of reasons, why we just don't see it right now. I think, it's probably good to pull it up a level two, and just talk to you about what the pricing environment looks like in general, which we think is seeing some positive trends. And maybe we'll start on Unum U.S., Mike can talk about what's going on in the general pricing environment.","Michael Simonds","Yeah. Thanks, Rick. I'd say we have a pretty typical pricing environment out there right now, but I'd say gradually it's been moving up. And Jack made the point, if industry margins sits somewhere in the mid-single-digits. They're still probably some room to go for the industry to be consistently earning at least their cost of capital there. And so as we did not need to move rates up as we talked about coming into 2017, we find ourselves positioned, I think, pretty comfortable in the window. We're never going to be the most inexpensive option out there, certainly though we need to be competitive.","So what you see reflected in our new sales numbers, what you see reflected in strong and improving persistency number, and Jack alluded to it at the outset, our early read on January 1 renewals here in 2018 also reflect that. We're positioned pretty comfortably competitively.","Richard McKenney","And Tim, you want to talk a little bit about Colonial Life and the pricing and competitive environment?","Timothy Gerald Arnold","Yeah, absolutely. So as Jack mentioned in the voluntary benefit space. Rates are filed and guaranteed renewable it is a long process for changing rates and would only apply typically to new products or new issues moving forward. Product is going to be very affordable in this space. And then the VB market rates are less important than other elements of a value proposition like enrollment capabilities and the customer experience at both the employer at consumer level. And we feel we're really well positioned with our overall value prop, so we are concerned about this.","Richard McKenney","Hopefully, that's a good answer for you, Erik.","Timothy Gerald Arnold","Yes. I appreciate all the details. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","All right, Erik.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. On the expenses in group visibility, supplemental and voluntary, and Colonial Life in the quarter, as you mentioned they were somewhat elevated. But I was just wondering, what portions of those expenses were higher, because of higher variable compensation due to strong sales in the quarter as opposed to business reinvestment.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, so the very specific question, Humphrey, and Mike will answer that. But let me just hit at the highest level. So we did see some more expense in the fourth quarter, we are actually pretty happy about that overall, we are investing in the business. But I would tell you that as a company we still are focused on our efficiency. Our expense ratios have been stable to down over several years, we'll continue to focus there. But getting to your specific question, Mike, you want to hit on that.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, thanks, Humphrey, and good morning. I think, you hit it right. We talked about a little bit of favorability due to timing in the third quarter ratio and that came back as we expected a bit in the fourth quarter. And so I think there's a good chunk of it that you can attribute to timing. And then the balance of it, if you think the other half in those particular segments is a combination of the expenses incurred in a very strong sales year, so that's a good expense to take as well as the investments that we're making in the business. And I'd highlight a couple of things around the client experience.","We have recently rolled out new capabilities around leave. Corporate leaves are picking up, you'd see a lot of that in the headlines as corporations are extending maternity and paternity leaves and other protective leaves that layer on top of statutory leaves at the municipal state and federal level. That's a lot of good news for employees, but complexity for an employer and that's where we come in, and those kind of capabilities certainly give us a little tailwind in 2017. But I think really the benefit is to come in 2018.","So we're actually pleased with the earnings coming out of those segments, particularly because underneath and inside those are investments that, I think, are going to propel us here in 2018.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then on the long-term care. At the Investor Day, you talked about you expect them to be a little bit elevated in 2018. Can you remind us, why you feel comfortable that there would be a near term observation for 2018 as opposed to something that is more structurally challenge.","John McGarry","So - part of the reason is we did our reserve review, our margin during 2017 and reserves. Actually grew a little bit, because we've been outperforming on the investment side. But if you look at the big picture around long term care, and where we are with the reserves. There are a couple of factors: one, 2017 was a very good year for the living, you saw that in favorable individual life results across the industry. Our risk in long term care is a longevity risk, not a mortality risk, so we were the other side of that coin that put pressure on long term care results.","I would tell you old age mortality is very volatile. We had low mortality in the fourth quarter, which contributed to that benefit ratio. Today, we find ourselves facing one of the most virulent flu seasons in a decade. And we're already seeing some signs of that in our currently emerging results. So the business is volatile, we're not going to react to a single quarters. We're going to look at that long term care trends, we've been looking at that over time, we will continue to do so.","And the one thing I will tell you is, we'll keep you apprised of that as it emerges, and we'll see how 2018 plays out, keep you posted along the way. And if we do have to adjust reserves as a result of emerging experience, we're confident that it will be - that will not affect our capital plans, because of the margins we have, because of the rate increase latitude, and because of the gaps that difference we currently have built into our reserves.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then, I guess, just in terms of the elevated experience, how much of that was - can be attributed to you kind of pushing through the rate increases, and then the policyholders receiving the notices and have kind of the waking of the sleeping dog that you [finally saw] [ph] coming through?","Richard McKenney","There may be some minor pieces to that, but most of it was a mortality story. And you got to remember in long term care, weaker mortality results affects both the disabled claim reserve and the active life reserve, because policies don't terminate. And so that's what we saw in the quarter.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Humphrey.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Great, thanks. Just to follow up on Humphrey's questioning on the long term care, obviously, the loss ratio is something we all look at every quarter. So could you provide some more specificity around what you expect for 2018. Should we thinking 90% to 95% or 90% to 93% above 90% leaves it somewhat vague and I was just hoping you could be a little bit more specific?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, I thought, we kind of directed to the low-90%, so that would put you in between the 90% and 95% range. And again I'd remind you that we expect it to be volatile as it has been over time.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just in terms of the price increases, I'm assuming that what you've asked for so far was assuming in the 85% to 90%, so if we are elevated 90% to 95%. How much of an incremental price increase would you need, if we're at those loss ratios?","Richard McKenney","I'd say it's more complex than that Suneet, the - you make assumptions in reserves that it's not purely a one-to-one like price hits the loss ratio. There are a lot of factors around, how the incidences of things emerge and how they hit you reserve factors.","So I want to say it's a direct tie. I think we're comfortable that with the dry powder we have on rate increases given emerging experience and the buffer we have between gap and stat that we wouldn't see the remedy to this causing any impact on our capital plans. But if - in long term care it's a long term thing, it's not what happens this quarter you're predicting things out over the next 40 and 50 years. Really that has to do with how a lot of different assumptions interplay.","Suneet Kamath","Yeah. That makes sense. I mean the reason I asked the question, if I thought that some of the larger state approved some price increases in the recent past, but one of the deal they struck with that that carriers wouldn't come back for five years or so. So that the case, I mean, are you going to be able to build in incremental pricing, if the loss ratio space at 90% to 95%?","Richard McKenney","Well, some of those large states, we still have outstanding, so we haven't heard back from them. I'll give you an example of New York gave us a long term care rate increase. Several years ago they did put do not return sign on it for a while. That's expired at this point. And we will go back to New York going forward. So the fact of the matter of five years is a drop in the bucket in the long term care business. And really that trade off we would hope that any reserve assumptions we built into requests for a rate increase would survive a five year period.","Suneet Kamath","Okay.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Suneet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Thank you. First one just on capital generation, uses of capital I mean it sounds like even though the cash taxes are a bit higher than GAAP taxes, there's still incremental free cash. So could you talk about just the potential uses particularly with the cash balance of the holdco? Would you favor MNA verse potential upside the capital management you played out?","Richard McKenney","Yeah. So fortunately, we've entered this period in a really strong capital position we do have $864 million of holding company cash. At holding company, even after our DTA write-off, our RBC ratios are still comfortably in our 375 to 400 range. And actually we've entered this period with lower leverage than we've had in quite a long time. So we do see the impact of free cash flow we purchased a Polish company. Just recently, I think we will continue to look for merger and acquisition opportunities either to expand our reach, or frankly also capabilities that help to sort of support and complement our offerings in the marketplace.","But the other thing is, we're being understandably cautious at the moment, because it isn't clear yet how the NAIC is going to react, what they're going to do with their capital formulas whether it's going to be a phase-in or an immediate impact and what the follow-on on the C1 factor changes would be.","It's also unclear how rating agencies are going to react S&P, and A.M. Best have come out and said, we use our own capital formulas that are not tax adjusted and don't expect to react to RBC formulas, Moody's still kind of a wild card out there. That will have to wait and see. And the one that's really unclear, is how you and other investors are going to react. Are you going to feel comfortable with RBCs, dropping as a result of the formula changes or not, so we're going to. stand around, we're going to maintain a strong balance sheet, irrespective of what happened we're really confident that we can respond to it quickly without necessarily impacting our - the strength of our balance sheet as a company.","And so I think we're in a wait-and-see moment, but it's great to be coming into this with such a strong capital position to start.","Alex Scott","And the follow-up on long term care. I think in the past, you've had a larger amount of interest rate hedges going back a few years. Now with interest rates starting to move up, would it potentially become attractive for you guys to reimplement a more about hedging strategy run rates there?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, we've had hedges, we haven't put on new hedges in a very, very long time. And there's two factors that happens there. As interest rates move up and become closer to our portfolio rate, we would certainly consider putting hedges on. The other thing is - at the same time, our discount rate has been coming down, because of some of the charges we've taken. So the gap between current interest rates and where I discount rates are - is closing, and if we get the opportunity to lock that in a favorable environment, I think we'd certainly take it.","Alex Scott","Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Just a follow up-on long term care, Jack, your comment on old age mortality, I just want to get a better sense for what's happening there from what I gather at least, but what I'm just guessing is that that would be something like Alzheimer's patients living longer. And is that, what's happening do you think behind the scenes here and is that something that you think might need to be permanently changed in assumptions or is it not that clear, what the trend is there?","John McGarry","No. I didn't talk about old age mortality extending, I don't think there's a ton of evidence of that happening. What I said is it's volatile. And so you can't judge old age mortality, but what - by what happens in one or two quarters, you need to go through full cycle, judge it on annual and quinquennial kind of looks at it. And what we saw particularly in the - we had - the way of it would pretty good mortality in the first quarter of 2017. We had very poor mortality in the following three quarters one of the top comparisons between fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016, is the flu season hit earlier in 2016.","We saw an uptick on mortality and that resulted in more favorable results. But you're going to go through the cycle. You have to see how the years unfold it's not something you'd react to on a quarterly basis. And again kind of the improvements in mortality that doesn't happen one or two years, that's something that happens over decades.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And then, is - do you still - it sounds - Jack, from your comments it sounds like you guys are still comfortable this won't be a cash situation regardless of what the outcome is on a GAAP basis. You still feel pretty good about that, and I'm guessing with the GE charge, the regulators are going to take more notice. Do you think there's going to be any impact and reaction here more broadly, whether that's to your captive structure or anything else that you would say might be some kind of reaction to that.","John McGarry","Yeah, we're not anticipating a reaction to that. As I said, we're in a different - very different place than GE Capital. We talk regularly with our regulator that, as we have no surprises with you, we have no surprises with them either. So we're not anticipating an impact.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And then final question, just on the social security death master file charge, you took one in 2013. Why did that recurred. I would have thought, if you took care of it in 2013 I would expected you to be checking it every year or maybe I'm not thinking about that in the right way.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, now, it's a little bit different than that now. I mean, it's not a checking every year. I think it's a process change. And you're right, that back in 2013 we went through a process internally of assessing of how we want to go back and find claimants that have not actually filed a claim. So we did that, went back, several, several years to do that. That was the increase in reserves that we did back in 2013.","Since that point in time, our process has been good. We've been finding these claimants and continuing to go back further than we're required to. I think what you've seen since that period of time, you've had dozens of companies out there that have gone back even further in the process. And so, as we've looked at it, we're going to reflect that as well. And that's what you saw on the fourth quarter. So it's not a process differential. Our process is very good. This is going back several decades to find claimants that actually never filed a claim.","And so, we feel good about doing that. And this should be the last time you hear about this.","Thomas Gallagher","Got it, Rick. So really this was just because they - they request and you go way, way back. This wasn't - this had nothing to do with like the go-forward process.","Richard McKenney","No, think early '90s. So this is something that we had gone back a decade. Last time we looked at it and now we're going back to the early '90s. That's why I say I don't expect to go back further than that.","Thomas Gallagher","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you. Good morning. The corporate segment was little better this quarter. How should we think about that going forward?","John McGarry","Yeah, so two things drove that about half-and-half. Half of it was just better net investment income performance in the corporate segment. And the other half was pure expenses. We actually had higher expenses. Last year in the corporate segment, we were dealing with some - a little bit of disruption and that - in staffing that we accounted for in the corporate segment last year.","We didn't expect that to repeat it. It didn't repeat. And so, I think the expense level in the corporate segment is at a good level, net investment income, because it's kind of a leftover bucket, may fluctuate from time to time. But I would say last year was elevated as opposed to this year being low.","Mark Hughes","Right, yeah, tax rate outlook, is at 19 to 20 or 19 to 21?","John McGarry","We think it is kind of\u2026","Richard McKenney","Near term 19 to 20.","John McGarry","2018 will be 19 to 20. As some things happen it's going to float up slightly over time. So that 19 to 21 is more of a longer term outlook.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo.","Sean Dargan","Hi, thanks. I just have a question about any differences between the guidance given in December and then the - the post-tax-reform guidance given last night. So it sounds like there's some additional investment. Just wondering where that's going to come through. And also wondering if you changed your UK or how you're thinking about UK earnings in dollars, given the movement of the pound.","John McGarry","Yeah, so in our guidance if you just took pure tax reform and grossed it up, we'd be at the top end of that 23% range. We are planning on making investments in our business to accelerate some things that we were - had in the works anyway, and will take this opportunity to do - and so that brings it down a little bit in the range. It's not outsized in terms of amounts.","It's a fraction of what the savings were. The other part of that question\u2026","Richard McKenney","It's in the UK, that's about the UK outlook, because\u2026","John McGarry","Yeah, and so we did not change the UK. We have not changed the foreign exchange rate in our outlook. That may provide a little bit of upside within that range.","Sean Dargan","Okay. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Randy Binner from B. Riley.","Randolph Binner","Hey, thanks. I just want to go back to your comment, just on UK segment and headwinds from Brexit. I don't think that got followed up on in these questions. But I guess the benefit ratio is a little bit higher there. But nothing there seem dramatic.","So with Jack's comments, so is that - is it more like a premium production challenge from Brexit kind of in the southern part of England or is it - are you seeing shades of what we saw when there is financial pressure there last time around, where you see a little bit higher claim incidents? What is the Brexit pressure that you're seeing in the UK business exactly.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, Randy, let's go to Peter O'Donnell in the UK to get our Brexit update. Peter?","Peter O'Donnell","Great. Thanks very much, Randy. So the way I describe it is, the UK is doing well in a tough environment. So actually our results as you say, there's nothing dramatic happening where we're sort of performing recently well. If the market was better, I think we'd be forming a lot better. And, of course, the relativity to the US world is one of the things I guess that influences that commentary.","In terms of what we're seeing, really going back to what were the implications of Brexit, so there's three things I'd point out to you. One is those lower interest rates, interest rates are lower for longer, which means for us our interest rate sensitive products we've been putting right through in 2017.","I think there is some chink of light there in that. We are seeing the market begin to move as well. So, some of the competitors are starting to put rate through, which gives me some confidence going into 2018 that that will be a slightly easier environment to be more competitive in. But in saying that, our sales numbers and our premium numbers were pretty good last year.","The second thing is this political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. So what we are not seeing is that natural tailwinds you get from wages and you get from sort of employment growth, particularly at the large employer end. That's been muted in 2017. And I think that will continue in 2018. The uncertainty is continuing and until we have a clear plan that companies can plan for in terms of the exit, that's just a headwind for us.","And the third thing as you pointed out, we have seen slightly higher incidents across the industry on our income protection side. That's something that we are factoring into our pricing. So we're putting more rate into sort of rectify that. But that's been something that's been a little abnormal in 2017. We probably think that will continue good in 2018, but nothing dramatic in terms of what we're seeing.","And I think if you remember our guidance, flat to slightly up earnings is where we're positioning our numbers.","Randolph Binner","Yeah, that's great. And on the higher incidents is there a particular type of claim you're seeing?","Peter O'Donnell","No, it's across the piece. Just - we just think it's one of those abnormal years. And just a little bit of I think uncertainty in the environment causing people to perhaps be a little bit more tendency to have a bit more sickness in their operations. Eventually, we think that will revert to a norm. But again, it goes down to that uncertainty.","Randolph Binner","Very good. Thanks a lot.","Richard McKenney","Good. Thanks, Randy.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you very much. And good - I want to ask a question about the group dental expansion. I'm trying to understand the customers that you are targeting. Is this a pie that's getting bigger and you're going to take a greater share of it? Or is this - customers you're dealing with on the life and disability side, potentially who you might be able to get to also by the dental product?","Where does the growth come from most general insurance, not one thing, but as you expand how should we think about that?","Richard McKenney","Mike, you want to take that?","Michael Simonds","Sure. Thanks, Rick. I appreciate the question, Josh. So I think it is absolutely both. If you take a step back, the premium production in terms of new business approached about $50 million this year and built momentum all the way through the year. That was the introduction of the group dental product into roughly half the country.","As of January 1, we've introduced that through pretty much the rest of the country under the Unum brand. It targets our core market and really in particular the small to mid-sized business that's under 250 employees. And in that segment, you'd certainly find a great deal of in-force dental that might be with a standalone provider.","And to your point, we very often write it in concert with life disability and voluntary benefits. And in fact, we saw about ten points better growth in those products in the regions where we had group dental in 2017. So it's a real lift for us outside of just the dental premium and the profit that will follow.","In the smallest end of the market, you actually find employers that aren't yet offering a group data plan. So you are actually growing the pie to use your analogy in that case. And so, we feel really excited about what the prospects are as we continue to add capability network and product into that dental suite.","Also in January, excited to bring the star-month [ph] capability for dental and vision into the Colonial Life distribution. Tim, you'd like talk about early returns there.","Timothy Gerald Arnold","Yeah, absolutely. So we actually began selling the product in April, so said it'll be - start showing up in second quarter. We're very excited. Dental is the number two most requested product in the voluntary benefits industry. So we're excited to have a solution there. Our solution will be an individual PPO product. There's tremendous energy and excitement in our field about it, because in addition to being able to offer that product into our 85,000 plus employer customers, we're very excited about penetrating the 6 million small businesses that have fewer than one hundred employees, who desperately need not only this product, but we think this will be a door opener to some of our other products as well, so lot of excitement about it.","Joshua Shanker","And along those lines\u2026","Richard McKenney","We appreciate it. Josh - Josh, as I said, we appreciate the question, because that's an acquisition that we did with leverage of what we already do well on the distribution side. And it's a good example of how we can take some of the things that we're very good at and bring them out in a different way to our customers. So I appreciate the question.","Joshua Shanker","Are there of life and disability sales that you can make now that you have done till that you couldn't have made before, that people wanted all three and since you only had two and made you limited in your audience?","John McGarry","The answer to that is, yes. It's a little bit difficult. We actually spent some time with field folks and brokers to try to glean exactly what that percentage is, but we're estimating. When we write the disability and life insurance with the group dental product, fully a third of the time we would not have been invited to quote on that opportunity.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you very much for all\u2026","John McGarry","We're not for the dental, yeah.","Richard McKenney","Good. Thanks, Josh.","Operator","And we have a follow-up with Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","A quick question, on the long-term care, Is there are an opportunity to do any sort of risk transfer or reinsure - the insurance of that block?","John McGarry","From what I've seen, there's been a lot of activity on the variable annuity blocks. I think long-term care is still a ways away. They're still a bit out spread on the interest margins and long term care. And quite frankly, it's just - it's still an immature product. Underlying experience is emerging.","It's not well understood. It's volatile. And I think until either interest rates rise and you get some margin protection as a result of interest rates or the liabilities are better understood. I think we're still a ways away on a transaction.","Mark Hughes","Thanks.","Richard McKenney","Savannah, any other questioners in the queue?","Operator","And we have one follow up with Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Richard McKenney","Okay.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had just a couple of questions. First, on long-term care, if you could talk about what the environment is for price hikes. And whether you see any risk that with lower taxes it's going to be harder to get regulators to approve the price size either in long-term care and similarly in some of the other products where you have to file with regulators for prices?","Richard McKenney","Great, Jimmy. Let me turn it to Steve Zabel, who'll take you through that environment.","Steve Zabel","Yeah, thanks for the question. This is Steve. I would say from the standpoint of the regulatory environment. It's good. We've seen it really improve over the last, say, half a decade. I think regulators are becoming more educated on what the issue is. We've seen in even some of the more problematic states that there's more dialogue and more openness.","So we continue to have good relationship with our regulators and we feel pretty confident about how that will play forward. From the standpoint of tax reform and I'll handle it from the LTC side. The actuarial maths to support those are pretax loss ratios. So just from a kind of a regulatory construct the tax rate really doesn't factor into the conversations that we do have with the states.","The other thing is just based upon how profitable the block may be. Not all these blocks are making money. And so the tax reform may actually drive you to higher rates. And so, we haven't really had that conversation with any of the regulators yet. But we feel pretty good that that's not going to really impact how we think about LTC premium levels.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then, just on any of the other products where you're filing with regulators that you - do you have any thoughts on how taxes if - I realize cash taxes are going down less than GAAP. But do you have any thoughts on how that will affect?","Richard McKenney","Mike, go ahead.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, it's Mike. It's very little. And for the reasons that Jack and I talked about earlier on the call. For most of the products we're talking about, pretty de-minimis impact on the actual percentage of premium that might be impacted. So anytime, we're going to take a new product or a rate filing on active business to department of insurance. Much more important is going to be what the trends on the underlying risks are, how expenses have emerged, then the tax rate.","John McGarry","I'd say, Jimmy, too I don't think there's any place in our company other than the Closed Block, where we're filing for increased rates.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just lastly on the - if you could just talk about competitor behavior and pricing in the disability market? And how much of an opportunity do you see from this consolidation that we've seen in the market with a couple of competitors being eliminated by - through the Hartford and Lincoln acquisitions?","Michael Simonds","Right. It's Mike. I think you hit on a very good point. And so, our philosophy is always, we're going to be a disciplined underwriter when it comes to the group insurance market. And we find ourselves positioned in a spot, where we're in a window. We're competitive as I said.","We're never going to be the least expensive, but we feel very, very good about the value prop that we're bringing to market. And the stability with which we are bringing that value into our brokerage and employer clients. And so, yeah, to your point, there is a bit of consolidation and certainly the associated disruption that's happening, particularly in the mid to large end of the market.","And our folks are long tenured. They've got great relationships. The brand is very strong. And so, I think among other companies I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Great. Thanks, Jimmy.","Richard McKenney","And we're up on time here. I think we've exhausted all the questions. I would like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this morning. We do look forward to seeing many of you at various insurance conferences and investor meetings over the next several weeks. And, Savannah, that now completes our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

The second quarter was a very good quarter for the company. Our net income totaled $285 million, which is $1.29 per share. Our adjusted operating earnings per share of $1.30 is an increase of 24%, compared to $1.05 in the second quarter of 2017.","Through the first six months of the year, our earnings per share has grown over 20%. Our result this quarter benefitted from the continuation of positive operating trends, including overall favorable benefits experience and solid premium growth in our core business lines. We are also benefitting from a lower tax rate.","Our capital management has also kept pace with an additional $100 million of share repurchases this quarter, bringing up to $200 million. And finally, we have increased our dividend 13% in this quarter, marking the 10th year of a dividend increase.","Looking closer at our core businesses, we are seeing good sales and premium growth, while maintaining strong margins, for our focus initiatives are paying off, as premium income grew almost 5% for our core businesses.","Overall sales were up this quarter, led by a 14% increase at Colonial Life. Importantly, from a margin perspective, we generally saw overall favorable benefits experience across many of our lines. Our expense management efforts have also allowed us to keep expense ratio stable, while we invest in the future. Margins are very strong with an adjusted operating ROE of 18% for the first half of 2018 in our core business lines.","Strategic investments are also producing, as our recently acquired dental insurance businesses grow their foothold in the U.S. and UK. The combined performance of our core franchise again produced solid consistent results and very healthy cash flows that allow us to continue a steady capital deployment plan.","Our nearly 10,000 employees are doing a great job of protecting more people in both the U.S. and UK. For our shareholders however, these great efforts in serving our customers have been overshadowed in 2018 by our Closed Block of long-term care insurance.","Managing our Closed Block of long-term care insurance has been something we've been doing for many years. After stopping sales of individual long-term care business almost a decade ago, we have been managing and monitoring our LTC line over time. We've taken price increases where appropriate and when trends have deviated from our assumptions we've updated them accordingly, which brings us to the first quarter this year.","We had record levels of earnings, but the one challenge in the quarter was that we also saw a higher loss ratio in the LTC line of business. This was at a time when there was significant market focus on the LTC business throughout our industry. While we too were disappointed with our incidence results, we thought the reaction was not in alignment with our underlying trends in our reserve drivers. We have therefore accelerated the work during the quarter on our annual reserve analysis.","We now anticipate that our reserve analysis will be completed in the third quarter of 2018. It is a significant undertaking and one that is still in progress. But we feel it is very important to give us much clarity as possible. To that end, Jack will give you more detail on the quarter's trends and our current view as we look to wrap up this work in the third quarter.","Overall, we're committed to the strategy of being the leading provider of employee benefits at the workplace. To that end, our core business is executing well and has continued to grow and build momentum. The strength of our franchise has allowed us to generate financial flexibility to manage our Closed Block, and at the same time, return significant capital to shareholders. It is a strategy we will continue to execute throughout 2018 and beyond.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Jack to cover the details of the second quarter. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide commentary on our operating results for the second quarter and update you on our progress on the reserve review for our long-term care, and what our current expectations are for that important work and its impact on our capital deployment plan.","Beginning with Unum US, it was another good quarter with continued positive trends in premium income, very good persistency and favorable benefit ratio trends across our major business lines. Within Unum US, adjusted operating income for group disability declined by 11.7% to $81.6 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower net investment income, resulting from a low level of assets backing this line and a lower portfolio yield.","The amount of capital backing this business has been reduced with the update of statutory reserves in third quarter 2017 and the IBNR reserve update in the first quarter this year. The reduced capital, along with the steady pressure on portfolio yields puts pressure on the net investment income. With this stable earnings, we expect to continue to generate these lower capital levels are accretive to the adjusted ROE for the group disability line.","We continue to see positive trends in risks experienced for group disability with the benefit ratio improving slightly to 76.2% in the second quarter, compared to 76.5% in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by lower claims incidence in the group's long-term disability line, which was partially offset by higher claims incidence in some of the group short-term disability products.","The group life and AD&D line had a very strong second quarter with adjusted operating income of $67.2 million, an increase of 10.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 7.3% driven by improved overall persistency in our recent sales trends. The benefit ratio improved slightly to 70.3% in the second quarter from 70.6% in the year-ago quarter due primarily to favorable experience in the accidental death and dismemberment product line in a lower average claim size in the group life product line.","The supplemental and voluntary lines continue to generate strong results with adjusted operating income increasing by 8.3% to $102.3 million in the second quarter. Premium income increased 4.7% for the second quarter, due to growth in our voluntary benefits business in the rapid growth being generated by the dental and vision product lines. Risk experience was favorable in the second quarter across the major product lines.","Sales for Unum US in the second quarter declined by 5%, primarily driven by lower sales in the group disability and life lines. We did see some areas of strength in the individual disability line, the core market segment for voluntary benefits in the ongoing rollout of the dental and vision product lines.","We continue to be pleased with the persistency in our Unum US business lines. For our group lines combined persistency for the first half of 2018 improved to 90.2% from 88% in the first half of 2017.","Unum UK continues to operate in the difficult and uncertain environment. Given this backdrop, adjusted operating earnings declined in the second quarter to \u00a320.4 million compared to \u00a322.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3% on a local currency basis this quarter, generated by - largely by improved persistency in the first half of 2018 in prior period sales growth.","The Unum UK benefit ratio was 76.7% for the second quarter of 2018, up from 75.6% last year, driven primarily by higher group life claim volumes, which was partially offset by the favorable benefits experience we saw in the group disability line in the quarter.","Unum UK sales for the second quarter increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by higher sales in group long-term disability, which offset slower sales in group life and supplemental lines. Persistency also improved, increasing to 86.8% for the first half of 2018 compared to 85.5% in the first half of 2017. The improvement is particularly encouraging given our active implementation of rate increases in the disability block.","Colonial Life produced a strong result with adjusted operating income in the second quarter of $84.6 million, an increase of 3.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium growth has trending well, increasing by 5.1% in the quarter. Overall benefits experience showed a slight improvement with the benefit ratio at 51% for the second quarter compared 51.3% in the year-ago quarter.","The operating expense ratio for Colonial Life was slightly higher on a year-over-year comparison, primarily due to cost related to our territory expansion initiative, investments in our business and the rollout of the dental products in the Colonial Life distribution system. These investments are paying off as new sales at Colonial Life increased 13.6% in the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.","The introduction of the dental product certainly helped with that growth with sales this quarter of $9.4 million. In addition to the strong dental rollout, sales from our other product categories all exhibited year-over-year growth. Sales also increased for both new accounts and existing accounts.","Moving to the Closed Block adjusted operating income declined to $29.6 million in the second quarter of 2018 from $32.6 million in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability product line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 82.9% in the second quarter compared to 82.3% in the year-ago quarter. Underlying risk performance for this block was favorable, while the higher interest adjusted loss ratio reflects a reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yield from higher miscellaneous investment income resulting from increased levels of bond calls and tenders.","The results of the long-term care business line continue to be challenged as the interest adjusted benefit ratio increased to 96.9% in the second quarter this year, compared to the year-ago second quarter of 89.4% and 96.6% in the first quarter 2018.","Benefits experienced this quarter was again driven by new claim incidence that ran higher than expected. Mortality impacts in the second quarter were not as favorable as in the first quarter and active life terminations improved to more normal levels. As we described in the first quarter, our long-term care results continue to be adversely impacted by the timing of rate increase approvals and the effect that has on premium income for this line.","This has had the effect of increasing our reported loss ratio in the recent past by 3% to 4%. If we unlock our GAAP reserve assumptions with the reserve analysis currently underway, this impact to the benefit ratio will be eliminated.","As Rick said in his opening comments and as you read in our earnings release, in light of the recent market focus on long-term care business performance, we accelerated the work on our long-term care annual reserve analysis. We now anticipate that our reserve analysis will be completed in the third quarter of 2018.","Once completed, this work will include a review of all assumptions and incorporate our most recent experience. The review will also utilize internal and external data, as well as an outside actuarial consulting firm for quality assurance and industry benchmarking.","Our current thinking, subject to the completion of our work is that we may need to increase our reserves as part of our third quarter closing process. Although, we still have work to complete and we are still assessing our assumptions, our current expectation is that any increase of our long-term care reserves will likely be predominantly a GAAP event and will likely not exceed $750 million after tax.","We do not expect that any potential reserve increase will impact our ability to execute on our capital deployment plans, including our share repurchase strategy. However, consistent with past practices regarding trading windows, we will not execute on share repurchases until we announce the results of our reserve analysis.","We currently anticipate resuming our share repurchase program of approximately $100 million per quarter, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 and continuing into 2019. We are presently inclined to repurchase additional shares in late 2018 or early 2019 above that historical run rate to compensate for foregoing buybacks in the third quarter. However, we will evaluate this as we get closer to the fourth quarter.","We'll share with you more details about our 2019 capital plan at our December Investor Meeting. The process we've undertaken to analyze and update our reserve assumptions is consistent with past practices and reflect our active management at this block. We are updating our reserve assumptions to reflect the evolving claims experience and trends affecting the block. Our long-term care block is relatively young, and therefore, we want our assumptions to keep pace with emerging experience.","We have also aggressively and successfully pursued rate increases on imports business as appropriate, which is the most effective way to manage the block. We have routinely made cash contributions to support the long-term care block and we anticipate these contributions each year in our capital deployment plans.","Importantly, we are managing this block within the broader scope of a very successful and well positioned company, a market leader with strong consistent cash flow generation capabilities that are enhanced by the benefits of tax reform. We believe this is an effective path to manage the long-term care block and will help to minimize the disruption to Unum that can result from its volatility.","It also leaves us with sufficient capital flexibility to fund our growth and return capital to shareholders, do share repurchases and dividend increases. Moving back to this quarter's trends in long-term care, it was also a favorable quarter from a new money yield perspective we are realizing on our long-term care portfolio as they continue to exceed expectations we have embedded in our current assumptions.","Interest rates and bond spreads were favorable for us in the second quarter, which was beneficial for all of our product portfolios.","Moving on, the company continues to produce healthy levels of statutory earnings from our traditional U.S. insurance companies. For the second quarter, statutory after-tax adjusted operating earnings totaled $249 million, compared to $225 million in the year-ago quarter. For the first half of 2018, our statutory after-tax adjusted operating earnings totaled $491 million. The capital position of our company remained very good shape.","At the end of the second quarter, the risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. traditional life insurance companies was approximately 385%, while cash at our holding company's totaled $1.16 billion. The cash position includes $300 million from the issuance of junior subordinated notes during the second quarter. After the end of the second quarter, we paid off a $200 million maturing note, which subsequently reduced that cash position.","Our return of capital to shareholders remains on a consistent path, as we repurchased another 100 million of stock in the quarter. Back in May, our board approved a 13% increase in our common stock dividend, the 10th consecutive annual increase.","I'll wrap up by reiterating our expectation of growth in adjusted operating earnings per share in the 17% to 23% range for the year. The base of adjusted operating earnings from 2017 is $4.24 per share, and this projection excludes any potential reserve increase for our long-term care business.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Richard McKenney","Great. Thank you, Jack. I'd just reiterate, all in all, it's a solid quarter for the company. We are encouraged by the operating trends produced in our core businesses. And as Jack said, we are also aggressively working to complete our LTC reserve analysis, so that any potential impact can be part of our third quarter reporting, and we can provide more detail then.","We will be happy to take your question. So I'd ask Bettina to begin the question-and-answer session, Bettina?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Mark Hughes","Yeah, thank you. Good morning. In evaluating\u2026","Richard McKenney","Good morning.","Mark Hughes","Good morning, yes. In evaluating the long-term care block, you obviously had a jump in the claims incidence rate for the last couple of quarters. How much credibility do you give that when you forecast out over the life of the block? What the - can you give us some parameters about how this review or how your current thinking would incorporate this jump in frequency?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so certainly we've incorporated recent claims experience into our reserve analysis. Long-term care is a very long-term product line. Two quarters isn't very credible relative to the long-term trend lines. We tend to look at those over multiyear periods. So certainly, it does have some impact and influences the outcome. But it's not a major driver of the outcome.","Mark Hughes","Then, in the short-term visibility you saw claims incidence up a bit, anything to read into that? Is that just a variation as far as you can tell or is there something emerging there?","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Mark. Mike Simonds, do you want to answer that?","Michael Simonds","Sure, happy to. Good morning, Mark. Short answer is, I wouldn't read anything too much into it. We saw a little bit of a pickup in new claim incidence for short-term disability, but in general feel good about where we're positioned in the product line. And that's also a product line given the nature of how credible the experience is, is that we're able to move pretty quickly from a renewal point of view as well.","So that's a pretty - very good contributor to really healthy group disability segment. And while we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter, I wouldn't expect the long-term issue there.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","We will now take a question from Randy Binner of B. Riley FBR.","Randy Binner","Good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask one on the long-term care and the benefit ratio we saw in the second quarter, again in the high 90%s, and just to kind of reflect on how that stayed at that level relative to the first quarter. Back in the first quarter, I think the thought was that some flu activity effectively maybe pushed some of the population into a situation, where they went on claim. This benefit ratio does not appear to support that.","And you mentioned that mortality just continues to be less favorable. So the net of my question is should we plan on this level or potentially higher ongoing interest adjusted benefit ratio in the high 90%s for LTC and in the Closed Block going forward?","Richard McKenney","So I would start looking at the quarter, compared to first quarter. In the first quarter, we did have high claims incidence. But we also had very high mortality and we had very unfavorable terminations in our active claim block, so deaths and lapses in the active claim block. I would say this quarter the incidence levels continued. However, mortality reverted more toward kind of our long-term expectations. Still a little bit above the long-term expectations, but much closer to it.","But at the same time the active life terminations reverted back to - more towards the long-term norm as well. And so, those two things kind of offset each other in the quarter and we were left with a very similar level of loss ratio in the first quarter related to claims incidence. In terms of looking at claims incidence, two quarters does not trend make in long-term care. We've actually seen periods where there've been four and six quarters of either very low incidence or very elevated incidence that is turned around in other periods.","So I wouldn't read too much into the second quarter and first quarter, it's not - we wouldn't have the expectation that this is it forever. With that said though, as we look at our reserve work and we update our assumptions, our assumptions will incorporate the current experience we're seeing. And so, post assumption review, I would not expect loss ratios in the high 90%s to continue.","Randy Binner","Yeah, understood. I mean, just picking up on Mark's question a little bit. If we keep seeing it in the high 90%s, I guess, the question is, is that reflective of the review. I guess, the answer is the review would probably expect a little bit lower benefit ratio to develop over time, because that's more consistent with historic trend, is that fair?","Richard McKenney","Yes.","Randy Binner","All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We will now take a question from Jimmy Bhullar of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. So first just on your guidance on the result for the long-term care review, how much of the expected amount roughly is because of these changes in interest rate assumptions versus incorporating the uptick in incidence that you have seen? And I think you've mentioned that you will assume higher incidence than before, but maybe not at the elevated level that you've seen in the first half of this year. But could you give us an idea on - if you were to assume similar incidences first quarter this year, how much higher would the $750 million amount end up being?","Richard McKenney","Yeah. So, Jimmy, we haven't completed our work yet and we still haven't finalized our assumption set. So we're not in a position to really parse those assumptions and talk about what the individual changes are. We do anticipate that we will provide more a specific guidance when we actually do finish the work and we announced the results of the work.","But it's important to note that that this review is a comprehensive review. It's looking at all of the different assumptions. I think it's hard to find an assumption that stays the same as opposed to thinking about what assumptions change. But in aggregate, we feel very good about the progress that work is taking. We feel good about the limit we put out in the marketplace. And we think it will have a meaningful impact on the results of long-term care going forward.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then, if I could ask one more just on pricing and the competitive environment in the disability market, how that's trending and then also maybe discuss your weak sales this quarter, what really drove that?","Richard McKenney","Mike, do you want to talk about the environment, and maybe we'll turn it over to Peter O'Donnell to talk a little bit about the UK as well, after that.","Michael Simonds","Sure. Happy too. Good morning, Jimmy. Yeah, I would say first question is about the competitive market in the pricing and then second on sales. So first on competition, I think, first and foremost for us is the ability to keep and renew customers. And the story there continues to be a very good one. I think, Jack mentioned it persistency in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis is up a bit from a strong result last year just over 90%. So we feel really good about the value prop and the experience that we are delivering to the claim relative to alternatives in the market.","I would say, what we would have seen in the first two quarters, in particular, as benefit of a frothier more aggressive new business pricing market, so sales have definitely been a mix. We are up a bit in the Unum US segment in the first quarter, down 5% here in the second quarter. So at the turn, mid-year were about flat year-over-year. And as we look forward in to the second half, I'd say, in general, feeling encouraged about the pipeline, where we have a line of sight in the kind of upper end of the mid. In large case market, we do have about 60% of our sales here yet to book.","We've also taken a few actions around additional marketing programs. We started - looked to spur some growth. So we talked heading into the year about 4% to 6% sales year-over-year or full-year guidance, and I still think that's probably the best estimate for us. Longer-term, I'd say feel very good about our growth prospects are being able to continue to grow the business and accelerated in some spot, but in every case maintaining the underwriting discipline that allowed us to get the kind of margins and ROEs that we're targeting. That's sort of how I see the U.S. market, maybe I'll turn it over to Peter.","Richard McKenney","Peter, you want to take on a little bit of the environment you're seeing in the UK with pretty good sales results, but also just what you're seeing overall.","Peter O'Donnell","Yeah, I happy to do that. So I am sure you see the sort of break the headlines heading over to the U.S. and the UK. There is a media hype around Brexit, I would say from a business perspective, I think, I describe it is, it's dampening growth and businesses sort of a bit distracted at the moment from investing in their core franchises, as they try and sort of work through what Brexit might mean, and that is dampening our growth opportunities. However, I would say, we're performing very well in that marketplace.","And like Mike, the first thing, we look out is the persistency results are we keeping customers, particularly, as we are still dealing with those low interest rates, the U.S. is recovered a bit. But the UK, while we might see on Thursday, rate increase but we haven't seen a lot of rate increases over the past two years as the government has the liberty, kept interest rates low to - sort of managed some of the dislocations.","We are getting a lot of rate through our book and maintaining persistency and growing it a bit, so really happy with that and that's a really good sort of indicator of future prospects for us. As Rick said, sales were good in the quarter, we are up 4% year-on-year, so it's pretty happy with that, and particularly core sales were good, in particular with small and medium size businesses. So that was very, very good there and really happy with that.","We did see the benefit ratio for slightly raised, nothing to worry about there just a little bit of volatility on the life line. And again, like Mike, as I look forward and we get through the Brexit dislocations in 2019. I think the marketplace, what we're doing with employers will be an area of significant growth for the UK economy in generation, but also for Unum within that, so we feel positive about the future.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Richard McKenney","I appreciate that, Peter. I would - as we go through that, I think, we'd be remiss not to talk about Colonial Life, which also had an excellent quarter, still a competitive environment, but Tim and team here is doing a great job. Tim, any comments in terms of the good quarter that you had?","Timothy Arnold","Yeah, thanks, Rick. I think in the Investor Day last year, we heard the range of 8% to 12% from pushing toward the upper end of that range. The market is certainly competitive, but the employee pay benefits market continues to grow. Colonial Life has - I wouldn't say an entirely unique competitively advantageous distribution system, especially in the lower end of the market.","So we feel great about growth in the rapidly growing small business segment. But we also feel really good about our competitive capabilities in the mid-market and even in the up market. About two-thirds of our business is through brokers and great relationships with our brokers, we continue to be very competitive in that segment. Public sector is a rapidly growing segment for us and a very large segment. So at the moment, we are feeling very good about our competitive position, our value prop and our growth prospects.","Jimmy Bhullar","Great. Thanks, Tim.","Richard McKenney","Thanks for the question, Jimmy.","Operator","We will now take a question from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Hi, good morning. I guess, the first question I had was just on the incidence rates that you've seen tick up. And when I think about following the review, I get that you will be at a lower benefit ratio. How should we think about range and if the benefit ratio begins to increase again, will you do deeper reviews more recently than you got in the past? And I guess on the individual block, in particular, like where are you in the duration of the book relatively like peak claims. And we're getting to a point, where you have to do deeper reviews like this more frequently?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, so maybe I'll start up, Alex, and just talk about the reviews. We do deep reviews all the time, I think that every year we're going through that, I think, what we are talking about here in the review is, is that a different depth and also incorporates a lot of external resources as part of that process. And I think that's key, the data, the people and everything else. This is going to be different. This is going to be deeper than we probably have done before, although, we do consistent deep reviews, analyzing this block really every quarter, and then certainly every year.","And Jack, you want to talk a bit more about where we are now in the different incidence assumptions, et cetera.","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so you talked about the range of loss ratios that we would expect. And I'd remind you that we're in loss recognition, and so in loss recognition by definition, your reserves plus your future premiums need to be set equal to your benefits and expenses. And so, for us, that would continue to imply a long-term loss ratio in the 85% to 90% with expenses taking up the rest of the growth premium.","So in loss recognition that we would expect to be - I'd still say that, that improves kind of your long-term loss ratio outlook. You're still going to have volatility around that, because it's still a - it's a very big block with a long way to go that that relative to kind of reserve margin, you have a very little premium in the block. And so the results can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, but again that's kind of where I'd gauge you. And I'd reiterate what Rick said, as we look at the assumptions all the time. The timing of the update aren't driven by a clock. The timing of the updates are driven by emerging experience. And when we feel, we have enough credible experience and that we need to take action on it.","Alex Scott","Got it. And then, my second question is just on cash flow, I know, statutory impact is sort of separate and GAAP impact is separate from the amount of cash that you guys actually put down into the long-term care captive as well as first Unum, the New York entity. So does anything around this review, change the amount of cash that you put down and can you kind of dimension the holdco cash balance for us a bit just in terms of what's contingent capital? What's earmarked for may be long-term care contributions? And what your view is, I guess, access that could be used for M&A or maybe a catch up and buyback?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so, as we mentioned in my prepared comments, where we do, we are inclined to look at catching up on our buybacks. We are in a very strong cash position now, we ended the quarter at over $1 billion of cash and even after having paid off that maturing note. We are still at the high-end of our cash range.","As we said the - if we do take a charge and there's a lot of work to be that remains to resolve that, it would be predominately a GAAP charge. We would see that potential for maybe some smaller statutory events mostly related to disabled life reserve updates that we might do. As you know, the active life reserves are locked in. But disabled life reserves are based on current assumptions.","So we wouldn't see a material change in our capital position, as a result of this. We have built in our expectations for contributions to both first Unum as well as Fairwind into our capital outlook. Those contributions have not changed dramatically, and we still feel very comfortable with our capital plan flexibility.","Alex Scott","Okay, thanks.","Richard McKenney","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","We will now take a question from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just to drill down a little more on the incidence. So if I look back in 2017, you had roughly 2,300 new claims in the year, so comparing that to kind of what you've seen in 2018, like how much worse are you seeing relative to your expectation? So if I were to assume kind of average of 200 claims per month using 2017 number. We're talking about 10 more claims or 50 more claims. Let's just how do you size the adverse impact that you've seen in the past two quarters?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, Humphrey, I'm going to have Steve Zabel will answer.","Steven Zabel","Yeah, great. Thanks for the question, Humphrey. Just one thing, I'd start out with the annual claim volume is more probably in the range of 4,000 claims a year, so just kind of for level setting. You may be looking at the information that only covers one of our legal entities or a subset of our block. But I'll go back to kind of what Jack said around just the relationship between the reserves on this block and the reserve margins in our premium levels. We have about $160 million of quarterly premium on this block.","And so if you equate that to a loss ratio that's about $1.6 million for every point of loss ratio. Our average claim size is around $100 million - I'm sorry, $100,000 per claim. So you can kind of do the math and see that it doesn't take a whole lot from a variance of count to drive change in our loss ratio. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective based on it's probably somewhere in the range of 400 to 500 claims a quarter.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then, so with the past two quarters like when you think about the drivers for the incidence? Have you seen any correlation between kind of implementing the rate increases driving entire selection? Or is there some other factors that is driving the incidence?","Steven Zabel","Yeah. Yeah, this is Steve, again. We obviously look at this on a week by week, month by month, quarter by quarter basis. And we've done a lot of analytics on it, we've looked at it kind of state by state. We've looked at it from just a benefit coverage, if there are certain sales there. And we've looked at it by a location of care as well as other factors. And frankly, we just haven't seen anything that you'd say is statistically credible to show a differing trend in any of those sales than what we've seen historically.","So again, we take that all into account as we're going through our reserve analysis, but there's not kind of that one thing that you look at, and say that's driving the volatility.","Humphrey Lee","All right. If I can sneak in one more sort of a logistic question. So for the review, you expect to complete it by the third quarter. Do you anticipate it would be announced - it will be completed by the time of your release? Or if you were able to complete it earlier than your earnings release would you choose to preannounce the findings?","Steven Zabel","Yeah, we would certainly keep that open as an option, if we can complete it earlier. And we are applying a ton of resources to this work, we understand how important it is to provide clarity to the markets about where we are, and we're going to look to do that as soon as we possibly can.","Humphrey Lee","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We will now move to a question from Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Just one more on the long-term care review. And I guess, appreciate that you can't provide a lot of color on what assumption changes you're making at this point given that they haven't been finalized. But can you just talk about what gives you comfort in sizing the overall kind of maximum impact given that you haven't finalized the assumptions? And has the third party consultant been engaged with you throughout the process and are they providing input on the assumptions?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so even though, we haven't finalized our assumption, there's still a lot of work to do. We haven't gone far enough, we've really done some of the experience analysis, we've kind of built kind of our framework around it. I think, we are far enough along and we see that there are a lot of assumption sets that we're looking at. There aren't assumption sets that at this point we think would cause us - cause to drive us outside of the range that we've given you.","And so the ones, we're actually considering and looking at fall within that range, and actually then even below that. So we got to do the work, we need to finalize it. We're saying there may be a need to strengthen reserves. But we don't see that assumption sets we're looking at is going outside of that range.","With respect to the third party actuarial consulting firm, they've been with us at every step. So we have been engaged in them in the review of assumptions. They've been very, very helpful for us. They provide an independent set of eyes, and have made suggestions along the way of ways we can look at things, they've provided access to outside data that we wouldn't necessarily have otherwise. They've been important in terms of industry benchmarking and making sure that the assumptions we're picking are consistent with where other people are in the industry.","And they still have a lot of work ahead of them, because they're going to be very deeply involved in the validation and quality assurance work. So we have been keeping them to pay our board with what we're doing, they've been very helpful and looking at the work and lot more work to be done.","Erik Bass","Thank you for the color. And when you complete the review, is your intention to provide incremental disclosures on? How the assumption - the individual assumptions are changing, and maybe even any sensitivities to kind of future changes in those assumptions at that point?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so Erik, I'd say at this point given that we haven't completed the work, we are really heads down on completing the work and driving to finalize this event. We do recognize there's a desire for additional disclosure in the marketplace as we come to a conclusion of the work, and we look at where our assumptions are. We will turn our attention to determining what level of disclosure, we'll have. We will try to be consistent with kind of where the marketplace is, and there will be more detail I just can't tell you exactly what level of details they will be until we get through the work.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. I appreciate that. And just last, just quickly, if we assume that, if you make changes to your experience assumptions that that could be accompanied by the future rating or additional rate increase requests as well?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, I think, that's an important point to make, Erik. If you look at the reserve charge as being the only piece of strengthening of assumption, you'd be missing a big piece of what we're doing. And so when you look at reserves there's really three components of strengthening the underlying assumptions that the first is, that we had margin in our reserves under our current assumptions, because of the investment peak we've had over the last four years. And so the first thing that that any assumption strengthening would go to is to absorb that margin.","The second piece is that, as we strengthen the underlying assumptions that we will also refresh our rate increase strategy. We are in a good position in terms of having logically completed the rate increases that we had underlying our 2014 assumption. So we have a lot of room on future rate increases that build into our assumption set.","And then the third piece, once you've gone through those two is the actual reserve charge. So if you take those three components together, we're talking about a really robust strengthening of the underlying assumption set.","Erik Bass","Great. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Erik.","Operator","We will now take a question from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. First, just to circle back on just understand the process a little bit on the long-term care review. So Jack, I think after you guys took the charge in 2014, you would describe that as unlikely to have to make any adjustments for probably at least another three years. Would you say the same will be true in this case? Based and realizing there's some caveats here, but at a high level. Is that still from a process and procedure standpoint still a reasonable expectation?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, I would say, when we took the charge in 2014, that statement was more related to the interest rate path as that we had, and you remember it was a pretty adverse interest rate environment. Our hope is that, this is our best guess of how things are going to play out over time. So we're hopeful that they would last longer than that. I mean, we're really feeling like we're putting together a robust best estimate of what the future is likely to hold.","We'll continue to monitor experience as it emerges related to that, we certainly expect without something really dramatic happening for those. That assumptions set, they have a shelf life of at least that period. But we're also hopeful that it will last a lot longer than that.","Thomas Gallagher","So would that be in the case then, is it fair to say most of the adjustment that you're - your forecast based on the information now is longer term interest rate, discount rate adjustment in the model?","Jack McGarry","No. Again, we're deep in the work, but this is a comprehensive review of all assumptions. I think, as I stated earlier, it's - an assumption staying the same would be the exception. We're going to look at everything. We're going to update it for emerging experience. We're going to put together our best views and we would expect that that those views would play out over time.","Thomas Gallagher","Got it. And then the first half adverse experience that you guys have been highlighting, is that just adverse versus GAAP by the 6 to 7 points? Or is that adverse versus your statutory assumptions to?","Jack McGarry","That's a good question. And when you look at statutory versus GAAP, you really run your assumptions that on a GAAP basis, that's where you develop your best estimate of how things are going to play out. When you were - when you look at statutory reserves, you generally don't view statutory reserves as an assumption by assumption. You figure out what your best estimate of the future is, that's your GAAP reserve estimate, and then you test whether your statutory reserves are higher than that estimate.","So you don't do the same review by assumption on a statutory basis that you do on a GAAP basis. I'd remind you that as of year-end, our statutory reserves were $1.1 billion higher than our GAAP reserves. When we update the assumptions based on anything we're seeing right now, we would still have a reasonable margin between our stat reserves and GAAP reserves. And you wouldn't be in a position of needing to strengthen your underlying statutory reserve assumptions. You wouldn't unwelcome unless your GAAP reserve best estimate was above your statutory reserves.","Thomas Gallagher","Yeah, that's why I ask, because the - I get that it's showing deterioration versus GAAP. But ultimately, what really matters here is it going to affect capital. And so, I guess, my question is just, if we just isolate the recent trend is that developing adversely or is that you have enough margin embedded in statutory, where that's not developing adversely, if I just isolate like the more recent experience?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so even the more recent experience, our statutory reserves are on a steeper trajectory than our GAAP reserves are. And so you remember, for example, back in 2013 - 2014, we strengthened GAAP reserves. We said we had a several $100 million GAAP stat difference after that process. We're now at $1.1 billion. And so that excess strengthening - it's not really a strengthening, but the trajectory our statutory reserves are on is steeper than GAAP.","We - as a result put capital into our subsidiaries on an ongoing basis, those capital contributions are built into our capital plans and have been a regular part of our capital plans over the long haul. We don't expect that to change. We expect statutory reserves to still grow faster than GAAP reserves. We expect to continue to fund that out of our capital plans. And that's built into our expectations for capital deployment.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks. And just one final one if I can. Just on, I appreciate you given out the commentary on capital return just now that you've given us the output. Can you give us some of the inputs, because it's pretty clear you have a pretty good amount of holdco cash, and you have the cash flow generated from your core business has been trending pretty good? But the - can you talk about the puts and the takes of how you get to the resuming the buyback between, do you need to delevered at all, assumingly if you hit the high end of the range with the GAAP book value impairment? Do you need to reduce leverage at all?","And what are your - can you just give some ballpark of planned statutory contributions that you'd probably have to take this year in addition of potential deleveraging? Thanks.","Jack McGarry","Yeah, so from a leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at 27.4% leverage, when we paid off the $200 million maturity that brought that down to 20.8%. If you look at the impact of the reserve charge even at the top end of our range, that's 1.5% to 2% on the leverage. We'd be at the higher end of our leverage range, but still comfortably within it. We took that into consideration, for example, in the first quarter when we issued debt, we issued hybrids to get more favorable leverage treatment than senior unsecured notes. So we have a comfortable margin.","The other thing is, we're growing our book value at 8% a year, pretty steadily they'll be a little hick up in that as a result of, if we do take a charge, but that 8% growth is pretty good at delevering the book in and of itself.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We will now take a question from John Nadel of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Hi, thank you. Good morning, everybody. A couple of more on long-term care, if I could. So Jack, if we think about the upper end of this potential GAAP reserve charge and on a pretax basis, I think that looks like $900 million to $950 million. What is your pro forma cushion between stat and GAAP reserves look like at that point? Is it down to just a couple of hundred million? And if we looked over the next couple of years, how fast does that cushion grow again?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, I would say, it's probably a little north of that at the higher end of the charge. A small piece of that charge, as we mentioned related to disabled life reserves will be both a GAAP and a stat event, so that reduces the impact a little bit on that GAAP stat difference. But we would expect it to continue to grow. It's been - that GAAP stat difference has grown a couple of hundred million dollars a year, over the past many years, and we would expect that to continue in the future.","John Nadel","Okay, okay. But pro forma for the charge, I'm assuming some small portion of this charge impacts that we're looking at the cushion at least immediate cushion post the charge at being what, $300 million, $400 million, $500 million, something in that range would be reasonable?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, I mean, we're still completing our work, and we haven't finalize our assumptions, but that would be a reasonable guess.","John Nadel","Okay. And then, just thinking about incidence, Jack, I appreciate the fact that your block is somewhat younger relative to some other blocks out there. But I guess it doesn't - and maybe my intuition here is wrong, but wouldn't it be more likely than that as your block ages and matures, the incidence and other experience that you see coming through today, for example, is far more credible than the experience, let's say last year or the year before that? So I guess, I'm surprised to hear that you've seen to be discounting your higher recent claims incidence here over the past two to three quarters as far as employing that incidence fully into your new assumptions?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, I mean, long-term care is a long slow haul. And so, things are getting older. But they're not getting older as fast as you would - it's not like the block ages a year, every year, because older people die out. And as a result, the actual aging of the block is a long-term thing.","So there's nothing happening precipitously either around the credibility of the block, the aging of the block, or the underlying claims - claims experience that would make one or two quarters significantly more credible than things that have happened in the past.","And again, you're looking at two quarters of experience against a decade of trend. So it wouldn't be a jumping off point. And if you look at our experience, again, I go back to it. If you plot our experience by quarter, it has been very volatile. There have been periods of two, three, four quarters where we've had significantly elevated experience. There's been periods of two, three, four quarters, where our incidence rates have been well below that trend line.","And that's the nature of this business. It's going to be a long haul. It's going to be volatile. It's - but almost the good part of the business is that it allows you to manage it over the long haul, because things that emerge are not - there aren't cliff events in long-term care. They emerge over time, you get to see them coming. And I think we've done a pretty effective job at managing that over the past decade.","John Nadel","I appreciate all those comments. And then, I've got maybe two real quick last ones. If you think about the excess of the investment income you've generated over the past several years, since your fourth quarter 2014 update, how much is that worth in terms of the margin on your block today?","I think you mentioned that, through assumption changes and the reserve charge would incorporate some of the strengths already in the block.","Richard McKenney","I mean, I wouldn't pinpoint exactly what's that worth. It's a meaningful amount. And what I do, what I actually would point you to, is the fact that despite the fact that we've had an increasing loss ratio over that period, our earnings have been rock steady. And so, that margin has really absorbed the pressure on the loss ratio. And so, I think I'd think about it that way, but we don't have the specific number pointing.","John Nadel","Okay. And then, just lastly, which outside actuarial firm are you actually using?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, we can't talk about that.","John Nadel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will now move to a question from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Laxman Kamath","Thanks, good morning. I just want to try to reconcile some of the stuff that you've been saying, because if I look at that $750 million charge or $950 million pre-tax, it's bigger than I think the prior two charges, 2011 and 2014. And based on what you're saying, it doesn't seem like incidence is really scaring you too much here, so I'm trying to understand it, where are the sources of pressure that's causing that charge to be so much bigger than what we've seen before despite the fact that you've taken these charges in the past and have gotten rate increases.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, so I don't think it's necessarily that much bigger than before. I think our 2011 charge was in the high 800s. So relative to the growth in reserve senses, and this is actually smaller than that charge, the charge in 2014 was around $700 million pre-tax.","And again, the thing I'd point you to is we haven't completed the work yet. We haven't finalized where our reserve assumptions are. We've given you a number that we are not likely to exceed. We haven't given you a number yet. And so, I'd ask for your patience to allow us to do our work, allow us to finalize where our assumptions are, make sure that we validated those assumptions and done all the quality assurance.","And, I mean, hold off, we're going as quickly as possible, but I'd wait to see where the charge is.","Suneet Laxman Kamath","Understood. I'm just trying to get a sense of how\u2026","Richard McKenney","If there is a charge.","Suneet Laxman Kamath","Okay. So then, relatedly, I just wanted to, for sort of scorekeeping here, I think in the past you had not built in future rate actions that have not been filed for in your GAAP reserves. Is that approach going to be - is that right, A and then B? Is that approach - are you going to take a similar approach this time?","Steven Zabel","Yeah. Great, thanks for the question. This is Steve, Suneet. Yeah, that would be our approach. There was recently an Actuarial Guideline 51 issued that actually makes that a requirement of how you think at least for statutory reserve adequacy. It makes that a requirement of how you go about that best estimate. That had always been our methodology, is to have at least a planned rate action strategy in place, before we put any kind of estimate of future rate increases into our best estimate.","Suneet Laxman Kamath","Okay, got it. And then, just lastly on the 3 to 4 point bump that you're getting from the delay in rate approvals, I guess. I had thought or maybe I was wrong - but I had thought on the last call, the way it was described, it was that this would reverse over a couple of years. And so, my understanding was this is something that maybe the regulators that had agreed too, they were just kind of making a hold off on implementing.","But I want to make sure that that's - is that right or \u2013or because it made it seem like if you take the charge that assumption would essentially go away.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, yeah, so it wasn't expected to reverse over a couple of years just because we catch up to the premium level in the rate increases. They've been delayed, but we still expect to get them. And so, had nature taken its course that would reverse over a couple of years as we actually get approved for those rate increases and implement them.","But the fact of the matter is it's a timing difference, not an economic difference. And so, as we update our assumptions, that it'd be one of the things we'd be able to clean up.","Suneet Laxman Kamath","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Suneet.","Operator","We now take a question from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua Shanker","Yeah, thanks. I appreciate you extending the call late to take my question. So I am going to pull a few things together. I mean, what you're saying here is that, that the recent claims experience is probably not in the assumptions that are going to be used, hopefully, to determine the charge, if there is one in 3Q.","Is there a risk that the assumptions that you chose are inducing or are backing into the size of the charge rather than starting from the ground up of what you really have and saying. this is the facts on the ground right now and here is what they are. Why preannounce the charge, especially the charge whose incident rates are different from the ones you've most recently experienced? Am I wrong in thinking that there might be a risk of a method as you size everything up?","Jack McGarry","Yeah. It feels a little bit like you're assuming there is one assumption that's driving everything we do. That's not the case. We're looking at all the assumptions. And let me bring it back to the process we're going through to do this. The first step in that process is to do a thorough and exhaustive experience analysis, looking at emerging experience relative to our underlying assumptions.","And so, we've made progress on the work. We've not completed that work as yet. But we've made enough progress to kind of understand the box we're playing, which is still a pretty wide box. So that's the first step. It's the underlying experience analysis. That experience analysis drives choices around what our best estimate of assumptions will be.","As we make those choices, we run the results through our projection models. You need to step back and analyze those results, understand what the drivers are, understand not only the underlying reserve that that generates, but also understand how that reserve will function as experience emerges, and what the incidence of earnings that's likely to produce under different sets of scenarios.","And after you've analyzed those results, it's an iterative process. So you'll go back and some of that analysis will identify things that you may want to tweak in the process. So we're working through that right now. So there's not a single assumption set. But it's not an engineering piece around here's the result we're engineering assumptions to get there.","It's really an analysis of what we've experienced over the last 5 and 10 years, what we think that portents for the future, in making sure that we have a robust assumption set that covers that.","Richard McKenney","And I think there are two things you said, Josh, which are important. One it will include up-to-date assumptions through the point of when we make the determination. The second is you talked about being a top-down - it's absolutely a bottoms-up process as Jack talked about, down to every assumption, dataflow. And so, it rolls from the bottom up in the process and we'll see where the numbers come in.","But I think that it's important, as Jack said, that we've seen enough now, where Jack and the team think they can make a reasonable call. And that's what we've done. But there's still work to do. And I certainly appreciate the work, the team is, they're going to close this process 50% faster with all the quality, with more people in the process. And we look forward to bringing that to you in the third quarter.","Joshua Shanker","And completely unrelated, can you weigh the pricing trends in disability right now, so where you thought they'd be today, given the tax reform impact that should be having on pricing front?","Richard McKenney","Go ahead, Mike Simonds.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, I can take it. So we when we talked about - I still think the logic that we went through, when we talked about the tax reform still holds, which is, in general, for the industry, it's a very - it's a relatively low margin business. A few of us tend to do a bit better. But when you look at what a tax reduction on the magnitude that we saw as a percentage of margin generated off of a business like group disability, and then translate it back to a percentage of premium, you're really only talking about 1 point to 2 points of pricing gravitation.","And we would sort of see that as just kind of normal give and take in the market. So what we're seeing here in the first half, I wouldn't tie it directly back to the tax cut. I'd say in general, it is a bit more competitive than we experienced in 2017. But having been through this cycle many times, I would certainly not call it abnormal.","And again, when I look at it, most important to us is are we able to place renewals, are clients sticking with us, persistency over 90%. It's a very good story. Renewals are actually tracking a bit ahead of plan in terms of placed rate increase, where we need to do so.","And then, as I look at the pipeline for the second half, we are not going to abandon underwriting discipline. But I'm optimistic about growth in the segment.","Joshua Shanker","Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Montgomery Scott.","Robert Glasspiegel","Good morning, Unum. Sorry to ask a group disability question. But it seems like you're - through 6 months, your investment income is down $16 million and your adjusted income statement, and your adjusted operating income is down $17 million. This is a point in the economic cycle, where having followed Unum since you went public, when the unemployment rate is dropping, and normally, the benefit ratios sort of drive improving underlying earnings. So it sounds like there's something more than just investment income, holding back comparisons, what would that be?","Richard McKenney","Well, Bob, first of all - it's Rick - I'd like to say we very much appreciate your group disability question. And let me turn that over to Mike.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, thanks. Bob, I appreciate the question. I mean, I think you do - maybe just stepping back even from the pure second quarter, I think you've hit on one of the primary headwinds when we think about before-tax operating earnings for group disability. And Jack highlighted it a bit.","But when you think about just the - based on new money, a slow decline in the portfolio yield, yeah, you look at the work we've done around looking at reserves behind the line and finding some spots where we've updated assumptions and got a bit more capital efficient. And certainly, we have experienced favorable incidents. And as importantly, very steady and strong recovery patterns, which is leading to a modestly shrinking claim block.","And when you kind of take the sum total of those changes, on the one had it means less income from invested assets that's a few million dollars of pressure if you look out it on a pure quarter over prior year pure quarter basis. And I think that that kind of order of magnitude headwind is going to persist, all else being equal over the next couple.","That being said, a more capital efficient business is allowing us to generate a stronger return on equity. So we're now in the mid to high teens in the group disability business. It's a really healthy business. The stickiness of client retention we've highlighted across the group business, certainly true in group disability. The stability of the loss ratio just a tick over 76% here in the quarter and right in line with where we forecasted it would be at Investor Day.","And then, when I look at it, I mean, I think where we're going to offset some of that headwind will be is, as we find ways to grow the business profitably. And to look at some of the trends we're seeing with growth in employee and contrib pay, in group disability. And then, as we grow our capabilities, particularly around absence management, regulatory compliance around leave, the growth in corporate leave solutions. We've added some technology in helping individual employees plan around leaves. And all those I think are contributing to a more bullish outcome for growth going forward.","So I'd say that's one of the general picture on group disability.","Jack McGarry","Yeah, Bob, this is Jack McGarry. I would just sad that the relationship between our discount rates and our new money rates have improved pretty significantly over the past 6 months. Spreads are widened relative to yearend and underlying treasury rates have gone up as well, and we have benefited from that.","Robert Glasspiegel","Okay. And if I could sneak one long-term care question, can you remind me what your undiscounted reserve is for this block?","Jack McGarry","I'm not sure I understand that question. Undiscount, you mean\u2026","Robert Glasspiegel","When you put up reserves - go ahead.","Jack McGarry","You mean like the sum of future benefits less premiums. We don't even - we don't look at that.","Robert Glasspiegel","I'm just trying to see, if you're off by 5% on the ultimate claim, before you discount it back all those years, what the sort of order of magnitude could be in sensitivity analysis?","Jack McGarry","Yeah, given the length of long-term care, you can't look at it from a non-discounted basis, and we haven't tried. Interest rates will continue to be a really important element of that analysis.","Robert Glasspiegel","I got you. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We now take a question from Ryan Krueger of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods. Please go ahead.","Richard McKenney","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, good morning. Just two quick ones, do you have an estimate for your yearend RBC ratio, contemplating tax reform and other factors?","Richard McKenney","Yeah. Actually, as the factors have changed - have played out, particularly some of the changes related to long-term care and disability, insurance risk factors, the impact of tax reform has not been as dramatic as we once thought it was. And so, we would expect to end the year kind of in that 360, 365 range.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then, when you derive your capital plans, what do you typically assume for annual cash contribution to long-term care?","Jack McGarry","So it is tended to be - annual cash contributions have in that $100 million to $200 million range.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, great. Thank you.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","As a reminder - we will now move to our next question, which will come from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Dwelle","Hey, good morning. Thanks for keeping the questions open. Just to - a point of clarification, there is something you had said in response to one of the prior questions. I mean, normally when we see reserve adjustments contemplated there, expressed kind of as an actuarial range, so are we meant to think of the $750 million guidance as kind of the 95% confidence level of the high-end of the actuarial range or is there a different way we should really contemplate that number?","Richard McKenney","Yeah, so again, we're in loss recognition. So anything we do with reserve assumptions are going to reflect our best estimate. So it's going to be kind of that 50-50 call we would expect. Actual emergence could go on either side of that. The $750 that we put out there, isn't like the high-end of an actuarial range. It's just saying that, what we know now, which is we're still doing the work and we haven't finalized the assumption set. We can't give you a number right now.","But we believe that number would fall somewhere in between 0 and $750 million after-tax, when we actually finalize that. And we are working as hard as we possibly can to get that information to you as soon as possible.","Mark Dwelle","So it's fair that a considerably lower number is at least theoretically still in play. We shouldn't just assume that the needle automatically goes to $750 million and that's the starting point.","Richard McKenney","As I said earlier, I would ask you to indulge me with your patience. But, again, I wouldn't just assume that it goes to the top.","Mark Dwelle","Okay, thank you. That's helpful.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","As there are currently no further questions, I would like to turn the call back over to your host today for any additional or closing remarks.","Richard McKenney","Yeah, thanks, Bettina. I would just thank everybody for taking the time and actually extending out a little bit. And hopefully, you got a good sense of the questions and I think Jack did a nice job of talking about the dimensions of what we're still working on.","And so, we'll do that as we get through the year. We will be out there in the market, talking to all of you at a number of insurance conferences, investor meetings, over the next several weeks. And we look forward to seeing you then and working through our third quarter process. That's all we have for today. That completes our second quarter earnings call. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"21184":["Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call February  6, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Tom White - Investor Relations","Rick McKenney - President and Chief Executive Officer","Jack McGarry - Chief Financial Officer","Mike Simonds - Chief Executive Officer, Unum U.S.","Peter O'Donnell - Chief Executive Officer, Unum International","Tim Arnold - Chief Executive Officer, Colonial Life","Steve Zabel - Chief Executive Officer, Closed Block","Conference Call Participants","Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank","Humphrey Lee - Dowling & Partners","Ryan Krueger - KBW","John Nadel - UBS","Jimmy Bhullar - JPMorgan","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Tom Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Mark Hughes - SunTrust","Operator","Good day and welcome to the Unum 4Q 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tom White, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Tom White","Great. Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical facts. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K as well as our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com.","I remind you that statements in today\u2019s call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. The presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today\u2019s presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website also in the Investors section.","As you saw in yesterday afternoon\u2019s earnings release, for the fourth quarter of 2018, Unum reported net income of $249.1 million or $1.15 per diluted common share. Net income included a net realized investment loss of $32.6 million or $0.15 per diluted common share. So, after-tax, adjusted operating earnings were $281.7 million or $1.30 per diluted common share. For full year 2018, net income was $523.4 million or $2.38 per diluted common share. Net income includes a net realized investment loss of $28.5 million or $0.12 per diluted common share and the reserve charge in the long-term care line which reduced net income by $593.1 million or $2.70 per diluted common share. So, after-tax adjusted operating income was $1.145 billion or $5.20 per diluted common share.","As background in the fourth quarter 2017, the net income was $266.9 million or $1.19 per diluted common share. Included in net income were impacts related to the U.S. tax reform bill, the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at the newly enacted rate of 21% and the one-time tax on undistributed and previously untapped foreign earnings and profits, which resulted in net tax benefits of $31.5 million or $0.14 per diluted common share and included a net loss of $25.4 million or $0.11 per diluted common share related to the settlement of a third-party review conducted on behalf of the number of state treasurers concerning unclaimed death benefits. The net after-tax realized investment gain on our investment portfolio was $7.2 million or $0.03 per diluted common share. So after-tax adjusted operating income, which excludes these items was $253.6 million or $1.13 per diluted common share again in the fourth quarter of 2017.","For full year 2017, net income was $994.2 million or $4.37 per diluted common share. Included in net income was a net realized investment gain of $25.3 million, which is $0.11 per diluted common share. So excluding the two items related to the U.S. tax reform bill and the unclaimed death benefit reserve adjustment, the adjusted after-tax operating income was $976.2 million or $4.29 per diluted common share. And finally, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $19.5 million reserve release or $12.7 million after-tax related to our Unum U.S. individual disability line which was included in our fourth quarter and full year 2017 adjusted operating income.","Participating in this morning\u2019s conference call our Unum\u2019s President and CEO, Rick McKenney, our CFO, Jack McGarry as well as the CEOs of our business segments Mike Simonds for Unum U.S., Peter O'Donnell for Unum International, Tim Arnold for Colonial Life and Steve Zabel for the Closed Block.","And now I will turn the call over to Rick for his comments.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. We ended 2018 on a solid note. As our fourth quarter results demonstrated the continuation of the many positive operating trends we have seen over the past several quarters. As Tom detailed our after tax adjusted operating income totaled $281.7 million or $1.30 per share, an increase of 15% from $1.13 per share in the year ago quarter. For the full year our adjusted operating income per share increased by 21.2% to $5.20. Excluding 2017 Unum U.S. individual disability reserve release adjusted operating income per share increased 22.6%, which put us in the upper end of our original outlook range of 17% to 23%. The operating trends in our core businesses remained healthy.","We continue to see good levels of premium growth including 5% growth in Unum U.S., 7% growth in Colonial Life and 14% growth in the Unum International segment which now includes the Unum Poland acquisition that we closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter which is now an addition to our Unum UK business. These trends reflect our disciplined approach to sales growth and our ongoing management of our current customers. In addition to solid premium growth we continue to see generally stable benefits experience across the major product lines in our core businesses. This drives the continuation of the very healthy margins we have been experiencing in these business lines and the strong cash flow generation that goes with it, which all supports our financial flexibility. Also in the fourth quarter we saw improved results from our Closed Block segment particularly in the long-term care line. The loss ratio for long-term care was at 83.2% which we were pleased to see. As we roll into a full year on our new reserving basis we think attractiveness on our rolling four quarters is more appropriate. Until then we are encouraged that for the second half of 2018 the loss ratio for long-term care was 85.4%, at the lower end of our long-term expected range. Jack will provide additional details on these results as well as updates on other important aspects of the LTC business.","With this good financial performance our capital metrics remains in healthy shape as we close out 2018. The RBC ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies was in line with our expectations and holding company cash remains above our targeted levels. We have resumed our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter with $150 million of repurchases finishing the year with a total of $350 million. 2018 was certainly an eventful year for the company in many ways. We are proud of the accomplishments of the core business lines not only the strong financial performance we have seen throughout the year, but also the strategic positioning we enjoy in our markets which positioned us well going forward. Additionally, we continue make investments in our capabilities to ensure there is continued success. Obviously, there was considerable noise which created volatility in the market regarding long-term care. We understand the focus on this product line and I believe we responded in responsible and transparent way.","With the third quarter reserve update we expanded our disclosure to give investors a basis for understanding the reserve assumptions we are making relative to the experience we have seen. This was in addition to the key attributes we have talked about for the block. We have been pleased with the overall performance of the block in the second half of 2018 relative to our new assumption set as well as the progress we are making and managing it over the longer term. We are working diligently to ensure that long-term care does not overshadow our core business segments and mask what we believe is a valuable franchise that serves a growing need in our society and delivers real value to our shareholders. As we look to 2019, we look forward to continuing to grow our company and protect more people. I have had the opportunity to meet with our sales teams over the last few weeks and the view is one of optimism for the year. I would also reiterate that our operating earnings per share growth expectations for 2019 are consistent with our investor meeting which is in this 4% to 7% range for the year.","So now I will ask Jack to cover the details of the fourth quarter results. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. As Rick said in his comments, we feel very good about the operating results for the fourth quarter. In my comments, I will provide additional detail on our performance and give an update on our capital metrics as we close out 2018.","Looking at our operating results for the fourth quarter, I will begin with Unum U.S. It was another good quarter with positive trends in premium income, very good persistency in our group lines and stable benefit ratios across our major business lines. These operating results offset a decline in net investment income largely from lower portfolio yields and lower miscellaneous investment income. Within Unum U.S. adjusted operating income for good visibility declined by 6.9% to $80.7 million in the fourth quarter. We saw good premium growth of 2.9% and stable benefits experience compared to the year ago quarter with the benefit ratio at 76.2% compared to 76.3% in the year ago quarter. Net investment income declined by 9.3% compared to the year ago quarter. This decline was driven by the recent trend of reduced assets back in the line and a lower portfolio yield on those assets as well as a decline in miscellaneous investment income.","As we have said previously, miscellaneous investment income will be volatile from quarter-to-quarter and this quarter was below last year and well below that in the third quarter of 2018. With an average level of miscellaneous investment income, we would expect the group disability line to generate quarterly adjusted operating income in the mid $80 million range. This quarter\u2019s risk results were consistent with that expectation.","The group life and AD&D line had strong results for the fourth quarter, with adjusted operating income of $64.3 million, an increase of 12.8% from the year ago quarter after adjusting for the unclaimed death benefit reserve increase recorded in 2017. Premium income increased 7.6% driven primarily by improved persistency, which increased in the group product line to 91.2% for 2018 compared to 88% in 2017. The benefit ratio was slightly higher at 71.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the adjusted loss ratio of 71.3% in the year ago quarter due primarily to higher claims incidence.","The supplemental and voluntary lines also generated strong results, with adjusted operating income of $103.7 million in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted operating income included the reserve release in the individual disability product line and adjusting for that, the adjusted operating income for this line increased 2.7% compared to last year. Premium income increased 6.3% for the third quarter due primarily to higher sales in the voluntary benefits and individual disability and growth in dental and vision product line as we expand its distribution. Adjusting for last year\u2019s reserve impacts, benefits experience for our major product lines was generally favorable. In IDI, we experienced favorable mortality and claim recoveries and in voluntary benefits, we saw favorable experience in our disability and accident lines of business. The dental and vision results were in line with our expectations though the benefit ratio was higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than the favorable experience of last year.","Sales for Unum U.S. in the fourth quarter declined by 1.2% primarily driven by lower sales in the large case group lifeline and in short-term disability where the year-over-year comparison was challenging given the $22.6 million of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 from an update to the New York Disability law for pace and relief. We saw positive signs in the fourth quarter sales results, including solid improvement in sales for group LTD which increased by 16.7%, strong sales in individual disability, which increased by 14.7% and the ongoing distribution expansion for dental and vision products, which increased sales by 33.5%. Persistency in the U.S. group lines was also a bright spot increasing to 90.3% for 2018 compared to 88.5% in 2017.","With the closing of the acquisition of Unum Poland, we are now reporting the Unum International segment, which includes our Unum UK and Unum Poland business lines. Adjusted operating income for this segment totaled $30.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 2.4% over last year. Premium income in dollars increased by 14.2% due to the inclusion of Unum Poland in the fourth quarter and growth in Unum UK in local currency. Unum UK growth benefited from rate increases in the group LTD line and higher persistency which was offset somewhat by a lower exchange rate. The reported benefit ratio improved to 72.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 75.7% in the year ago quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by favorable benefits we experienced with UK supplemental in group LTD line along with the inclusion of Unum Poland, Unum International sales were $24.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $24.5 million in the year ago quarter.","On a local currency basis Unum UK sales declined by 9.8% on lower sales in the large case segment which were functionally offset by growth in the small case market and in critical illness product line. We were very encouraged that persistency for the Unum UK business improved to 88.6% in 2018 from 86.9% in 2017 given the level of rate increases we have put through the block in 2018. Colonial Life again produced strong results with adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of $85.4 million, an increase of 8% from the year ago quarter adjusting for the before tax unclaimed debt benefit reserve increase of $12.4 million for the light product line. Premium growth continues at a very good pace increasing by 7.3% in the quarter reflecting strong prior period sales growth. Benefits experience was stable at 51.6%, again adjusting the year ago quarter for the reserve increase. In addition the expense ratio for Colonial Life declined to 18.7% for the fourth quarter of 2018 from 19.5% a year ago. This was encouraging as we continued to invest in territory expansion, expanding our digital capabilities in the dental product rollout.","Sales at Colonial Life increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago quarter. The introduction of the dental products earlier this year continues to help sales growth along with the favorable trends in the core commercial market. These favorable trends were partially offset this quarter by lower sales from the public sector market in the large case market. For full year 2018 sales for Colonial Life increased by 8% following growth of 7.5% of full year 2017.","Moving to the Closed Block, adjusted operating income increased 5.1% to $34.8 million in the fourth quarter. As expected premium income continued to decline in this segment declining 4.5% in the fourth quarter primarily due to the ongoing policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line. Net investment income increased by 1.3% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in the level of invested assets and slightly higher miscellaneous investment income, which was partially offset by a low portfolio yield on these assets. In the individual disability product line the interest adjusted loss ratio remained steady at 81.2% for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017. For the full year the interest adjusted loss ratio improved to 80.4% in 2018 from 82.4% in full year 2017. The results of the long-term care business lines of the fourth quarter reflected new reserve assumptions we adopted in the third quarter of 2018.","On this updated reserve basis the interest adjusted benefit ratio for long-term care was 83.2% in the fourth quarter which is favorable to the range we outlined for you of 85% to 90% primarily due to strong improvement in the level of submitted claims. The interest adjusted benefit ratio in the year ago quarter was 93.1%, but is not comparable given the reserve basis change. For the second half of 2018, the interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care was 85.4%. While the results of this block to be measured over a long timeframe, we were very pleased with the performance of the block relative to our new reserve assumptions for the second half of the year. Since we developed our new reserve assumption set in the third quarter of 2018, we made strong progress related to our LTC premium rate increase assumption of $1.4 billion of margin. Since we have set that assumption, we have secured rate increases that provide margin of just over $500 million and includes significant approved increases from California on both our individual and group product filings.","In addition, the new money yields for the long-term care portfolio we achieved in the fourth quarter exceeded the 5.5% new money yields assumption embedded in our updated reserve assumptions. For our other U.S. businesses, new money yields for the fourth quarter were slightly higher than the third quarter, but remained below our portfolio yields, so we expect to continue to see some pressure on the portfolio yields in overall net investment income.","Wrapping up with the corporate segment, the adjusted operating loss was higher in the fourth quarter at $48.2 million compared to a loss of $33.2 million in the year ago quarter. Expenses in this segment ran higher than usual and included some acquisition related and corporate development expenses we view as one-time in nature. Going forward, we anticipate quarterly losses in this segment to average in the mid $40 million range. Statutory earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies remain at good levels and generated strong level of cash flow for the company.","For the fourth quarter, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $215 million compared to $220 million in the year ago quarter. Full year 2018 statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $916 million compared to $812 million in 2017. As a result, we finished 2018 in a strong cash position. The risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. traditional life insurance companies was approximately 370%, which was in line with our expectations. The decline from the 386% at year end 2017 was largely due to the impacts of tax reform on the RBC formula. Our actual level of total adjusted capital, the numerator of the RBC formula, increased by approximately 4% during the year. We feel very good about the absolute level of capital in the company as well as the enhancement to our cash flows resulting from tax reform. Cash at our holding companies totaled $602 million at the end of the year comfortably above our projected 2019 fixed cost estimate of approximately $430 million. We resumed our share buyback program in the fourth quarter with $150 million of repurchases putting us at $350 million for full year 2018.","I will conclude my comments this morning by reiterating Rick\u2019s earlier comments that our expectation for growth and adjusted operating income per share in the 4% to 7% range for the full year 2019. The base of the adjusted operating earnings from 2018 is $5.20 per share, which excludes the net realized investment losses and reserve increase for long-term care from our 2018 net income. This is consistent with the view we shared with you at our outlook meeting in December.","Now, I will turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you, Jack. So to sum it up, it was the solid quarter for the company and one that I feel gives us good momentum going into 2019. We are very pleased with the operating trends we are seeing in our core businesses which we believe reflected disciplined execution of our plans and the strong position we enjoy in our markets. We are also pleased to have completed the LTC reserve update last year. I am particularly encouraged by the performance of the block relative to those new assumptions in the second half of the year. We will now move to your questions. So I will ask the operator to begin the Q&A session. Amanda?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you very much. Good morning.","Rick McKenney","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Shanker","I wanted to just sense on how the competitive landscape is shaping up. There has been a lot of consolidation in the markets over the past couple of years and of course tax reform changed the profitability profile of the disability business, business in general given the long-term contracts associated with that is probably a 3-year-old, which really knows impact, but one of your competitors said that their pipeline for growth looks really good the other day. And I was trying to figure out what that means for incumbents, what that means for new interims and how do things look compare to where they were 2 years ago?","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you, Josh. We will turn over to Mike to talk about the Unum U.S. position.","Mike Simonds","Thanks, Rick and good morning Josh. I think I started with the fact that all the prior companies heading into the consolidation we are calling on the same brokers and consultants and competing for the same employer groups in the market. So post consolidation I would say we see fewer players on any particular case, but players that are more concentrated and better able and I think more likely to use their scale to invest in capabilities as the basis of competition over a strong emphasis on just say pricing and underwriting. And I think I would see that as a positive in the long run for the industry\u2019s growth and return profile. To your question, I take you back to sort of the fundamentals of the industry where we see \u2013 we are seeing demand for what we do growing, then whether that\u2019s continued change in the health insurance landscape with bigger deductibles and more exposure for employees getting filled through voluntary products. We are increasing complexity when it comes to things like leave and disability and where we could come in and help solve for that complexity for employers. We are focused on those needs. We are disciplined player. We have got market leading positions. And so as you see fewer more concentrated in the basis of competition shifts more and more towards capability, I think that\u2019s very good news for us in the long run and for the industry. To your question on new entrants, I do see that some of those barriers to entry increasing not necessarily in terms of putting product on the street that remains pretty simple undertaking, but kind of amass the capabilities around the data, the technology and the expertise. I would say the bar is going up through this consolidation cycle. And then last I think you asked about tax reform...","Josh Shanker","Yes, that\u2019s exactly. Tax is a multiyear sales cycle.","Mike Simonds","Yes. I would say we will continue to watch pricing levels. We have been able to hold to the margins that we have been generating on a pre-tax basis as we talked about when tax reform was coming and implemented, it\u2019s a relatively small share of premium and feel like we are generating enough value for clients that we are able to whether that competitive pressure pretty well.","Josh Shanker","Thank you and good luck in \u201819.","Rick McKenney","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","We will take our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. In Jack\u2019s remarks, you talked about you have made very good progress on rate increases in the fourth quarter, especially with the approval from California. For the remaining of the expected benefit from rate increases, what is your expectation for the timing of the remaining approval, I know it\u2019s going to be more art and science, but if you can provide a feel in terms of how we should think about that?","Rick McKenney","Great. Thanks for the question, Humphrey. And I will just kind of summarize what did happen since the reserve assumption reset back last year. We did put margin into that reserve of $1.4 billion. We just announced that we have secured approvals totaling about $500 million of that margin. California was a significant portion of that. We also have others states that on the group side have exemptions from filing. So that makes up the majority of what was left there. We are in the process right now of filing our increases on our new program. Those began at the end of last year. Those will continue through the first half of this year. We also as we disclosed back last year we have quite a few pending rate increases. California was one of those. We will continue to work those. The majority of those are in states that have granted us approvals in the past, but capped them on an annual basis. And so that\u2019s kind of just a process that we have to work over time. So I would say generally speaking, it\u2019s going to be a long process with these. We will get them filed, the new ones filed the first half of this year, but these take months and years to kind of go through the pipeline and especially with some of these states that are on more of a multi-year approval process. This will be measured over years. So I would say we will continue to update periodically on what our progress is, but I would say what we are able to achieve was significantly influenced by what we did in California and I wouldn\u2019t expect that to happen on a quarterly basis going forward.","Jack McGarry","Humphrey, I do think it\u2019s worth noting that this is a big step forward for us and we feel very pleased about the results.","Humphrey Lee","Yes. No doubt about it. California has always been a challenging state, so that\u2019s good to hear you get a sizable approval from them, stay on LTC, incidence for this quarter seems to favorable, but I guess on a full year basis how was incidence \u2013 how do incidence look like for 2018, especially given kind of the first half of the year saw a little bit of elevation?","Rick McKenney","Yes. So we did have the spike in incidence. At the beginning of the year, it was kind of a hump that it crested in like the second quarter of 2018, third quarter was a decent quarter and then fourth quarter was a favorable. I would say overall for 2018, we feel very good about where new claim volumes came out relative to our new reserve assumptions set and are encouraged by the results we have saw in the second half of the year.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, good morning, one first, just one quick follow-up on long-term care, on the $500 million of rate increases can you give us a sense of how that compared to what you had assumed would occur within the reserves?","Rick McKenney","Yes. I would say Ryan, we are not going to disclose or discuss really where we are on a state by state expectation. Those expectations are across all 50 states. They will vary state by state and we are just looking to track to kind of the overall margins that we have estimated related to that. So that\u2019s really how we will update going forward. It\u2019s safe to say that we are very satisfied with the process that we went through in California and we are very satisfied with the result.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks. And then now that you have completed January 1 renewals, can you give us a sense of how persistency came through on the renewals if there was relatively stable I think you had previously talked about relative to 2018?","Rick McKenney","Mike?","Mike Simonds","Yes. Sure. Good morning Ryan and I would say in line with expectations to slightly favorable and as always we are going through the book and looking for pockets where we need to take great action that would be no exceptions for this year\u2019s 11 and we were encouraged by the results.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick one following up on LTC so there was slightly more than $500 million benefit from premium rate increases, can you give us the sense I guess two fold, one, how much of that was actually from California finally coming through with an approval and how should we think about the split of that roughly $500 million benefit between individual and group?","Steve Zabel","Yes. This is Steve, we are not going to disclose exact amounts on how that $500 million breaks down. The majority of it was related to California both the individual and group filings in California were significant and we feel good about the approvals we got on both pieces of that. I would say the remainder of the $500 million as I noted is going to be related to the group policy filings on our new program. We do have some exempt states where we are not required to file so those are kind of counted as secured upfront. So I would say the majority of that $500 million non-California is mostly related to group.","John Nadel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick question I guess on Colonial, good results underwriting margin did look pretty stable. Premium growth looks good, but sales did slow down. I am wondering if that\u2019s more of a maybe a tough comparison on a year-over-year basis or if there is something that you would like to point out and if it changes any of your expectation as you think forward. I know you have been thinking about sort of high single-digit growth rate there?","Rick McKenney","Tim?","Tim Arnold","Yes, John, thank you for the question. So in the fourth quarter we are up against a very tough comparable from last year. We had approximately 10.5% growth rate in sales and over 10% growth rate in our large case segment. Large case can be volatile for us. It\u2019s a very opportunistic market. We want to serve that marketplace, but we also want to make sure that we are seeing the same returns in the large case segment that we do in other places. Despite the tough overall comparison due to large case, we had a very good quarter in our direct part of the business. Our new case business in our below 500 life market, which were all up double-digits. So we are pleased with that. We feel great about our distribution system and our reach in the marketplace. Our product portfolio continues to resonate well in the marketplace with a full suite of both individual and group products. We have what we believe the very unique set of enrollment capabilities and services. Benefits education is increasingly important in the marketplace and we have over 7,000 benefits [indiscernible] who can help us with that. Our service delivery is second to none and it increasingly includes a full portfolio of digital solution. So, we are still optimistic about the marketplace and we still feel comfortable with the range we gave investors in December for 2019 growth.","John Nadel","Appreciate that. Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks John.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. First, I just had a question on trends in the UK business your results have been actually pretty good the last several quarters, but how much of it\u2019s like the year-over-year Brexit to results in the business?","Rick McKenney","Peter. Brexit update.","Peter O'Donnell","Yes, happy to do that. Thanks Jimmy for the questions. So, I think there is a lot of hype around Brexit. It\u2019s difficult to sort out the facts from what the PR agencies are trying to drive. Our view would be at a no deal Brexit, which would be effect of the UK economy and this is operating the UK economy. It\u2019s still a possibility \u2013 a relatively low probability, the view from most of the commentators is that we will get a deal whether it\u2019s between the May deal or some very until that during 2019. In terms of our exposure to that, we are not like some of the companies in the UK where we have significant offshore business and that\u2019s a real complication. We are \u2013 we moved from that. So, it\u2019s really about how the UK economy does and how business confidence goes. Our performance during the last couple of years of being actually through what we would say a pretty difficult environment, business confidence has been low. We are not seeing people put a lot of new benefits then and you saw some of that in our sales numbers in the quarter four. Although we are seeing good core growth we haven\u2019t seen large case sort of come to market. So that\u2019s winning in the smaller end, but large cases will be pretty competitive. So we are sticking to our persistency elements getting margin through the book ensuring that we are well placed. When monitoring Brexit trends we are not seeing anything that worries us at the moment as we will have to be pretty agile to respond to things. Our view would be that the guidance we gave you in December still holds even based on the start to the year given Brexit still remains uncertain.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just following up on PG&E, I think you wrote off accrued interest income this quarter, but you didn\u2019t impair the bonds themselves. So if you could give us an idea on what your exposure is and then also the expected ongoing impact of the PG&E situation on your investment income for the rest of the year?","Rick McKenney","Yes. So we don\u2019t actually write off the accrued interest. We stopped accruing it, because PG&E made it public that they weren\u2019t going to pay the interest as a part of their bankruptcy filing. We have $107 million exposure in PG&E. When we wrote off our asset and when we stopped accruing interest, there was a small premium that we bought the bonds at initially that was like $400,000 or something, we wrote that premium off as well. Other than that, we feel pretty good about PG&E. We think its money good. We believe \u2013 our intent is a little bit to maturity. The market seems to be consistent with us. The bonds have rebounded pretty nicely of late. And so it is on our watch list. We are going to pay careful attention to it, but at least at this point, we think its good money and we will continue a little bit. From an annual net investment income perspective, it\u2019s kind of in that $5 million to $6 million range. Relative to our annual net investment income, it\u2019s pretty immaterial and we feel good about being able to hit. Our net investment income plans did despite this.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","Hi, thanks. First question I had was just if you could provide an update on sort of the year-end statutory process for long-term care. And I guess more specifically if you could provide any commentary around how much margin you have in your asset adequacy test within Unum Life Insurance of America. And any kind of update you have on just how that process went in Fairwind, I guess specifically for the long-term care. I mean it looks from the RBC ratios and the cash contributions that there weren\u2019t really any surprises from what you guys have previously laid out, but any commentary on how much more buffer you have in the two legal entities would be great?","Rick McKenney","Yes. So we have not tended to split those things out in the past. We tend to look at it because so much of that is in Fairwind we look at it in aggregate. We talked about the buffer we had at year end or when we did the update in September, we continue to grow that buffer. So we made contributions on a statutory basis. During the fourth quarter, we will continue to expect to grow that going forward where it\u2019s in the high hundreds of millions. We feel comfortable with that. And again and I think the base of it is we feel very comfortable about the GAAP reserve assumptions, our best estimate reserve assumptions is having really taken a thorough view of where experience was merging and accommodated that view in our reserves. And so we feel very comfortable on the statutory basis. Our statutory reserves say have not been unlocked. We do have contributions in first UNM because of assets, adequacy testing and the very conservative view that New York takes to mostly the interest assumption rates on reserves, but again we feel comfortable with what we are.","Alex Scott","In the high hundreds of millions that you mentioned was that in reference to the equity in Fairwind or is that sort of the margin in your gross premium valuation there?","Rick McKenney","No, that\u2019s the stat gap difference.","Alex Scott","Oh I see.","Rick McKenney","And that\u2019s actually for the algorithm book, first UNM and Fairwind and actually PLNA, I guess it\u2019s about $800 million.","Alex Scott","And so would that be a reasonable way to think about the margin that you have in the stat reserves and Fairwind. I mean, I guess that is your best estimate I guess on GAAP, so would there be any differences in the way that you sort of value it instead in the way that you would sort of valuate in stat new cash flow testing?","Rick McKenney","That\u2019s the aggregate book. So, it\u2019s first UNM, Fairwind and PLNA. So that\u2019s in total.","Alex Scott","Okay, thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could talk a bit more about competitive trends specifically in voluntary benefits. Growth has remained strong here for both you and others in the industry. I am just wondering if you are seeing any impact on pricing or is it more that competition picks up for some of the employer paid benefits is winning those mandates is really how you get access to growing voluntary?","Rick McKenney","Yes. So we will start with Mike in Unum U.S. and then we will go to Tim to talk about quarter like dynamics.","Mike Simonds","Yes, thanks. So actually you hit on it, from a UNM brand perspective, we do answer it primarily through the group lines and look to put the full offering together inclusive of voluntary. What I would say though is we have seen a very active market for new entrants in the voluntary space and we are watching pretty closely because we have seen some product pricing in commission structures emerge that to us they will appear long-term stable. So I think that does put a little bit of pressure primarily I would say in the large end of the market for us both in terms of new sales and also just watching that persistency closely on the in-force client base. And I\u2019m sure, Tim, you\u2019ve got some thoughts to add from a Colonial Life perspective?","Tim Arnold","Yes, I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of the same trends. Appreciate the question, Erik. But the place where we\u2019re probably seeing the most competitive pressure is in large end of the market and for us it\u2019s less about price and more about some of the other factors that Mike talked about including compensation overall. So, we still feel very good about our value proposition due to the factors I\u2019ve described earlier, but we are seeing more entrants in the space.","Erik Bass","Thank you. And then kind of follow-up question on the investment portfolio, you did see a bit of an uptick in impairments this quarter. I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on the drivers there, and wondering, if you\u2019re seeing anything that makes you more cautious about credit broadly?","Rick McKenney","Yes, hey, we did have higher realized capital losses during the quarter than is typical. Couple of things, about half of that is our embedded derivative Big B adjustment, which on a non-reinsurance transaction would be the normal mark that would flow through AOCI, because it\u2019s a reinsurance transaction, it actually come through realized gains and losses instead. So non-economic. It\u2019s actually an unrealized gain for that Big B adjustment. I\u2019d say the other \u2013 if you look at the other half of that charge, there is probably only half of that is actually credit market related. We did write-off some value on an energy holding, was not really a very remarkable amount. We also \u2013 we unwound a spread program that, that we had going and we sold the underlying assets on that. So, there was a realized loss, but that loss had been more than covered by operating gains during the existing \u2013 existence of this spread progress and a little bit of noise back and forth too. But I\u2019d say, that the bulk of that loss is actually not kind of underlying credit driven.","Erik Bass","Got it. No, no, when I look forward \u2013 ","Jack McGarry","Yes. As we look at the portfolio today, I\u2019ll just add to that, Erik, as we look at the portfolio, our watchlist still remains intact. We feel very good about the position we have across the portfolio today.","Erik Bass","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just had a few questions on the rate increase approval, the $500 million of net present value benefits. Can you give some high-level comments on whether the vast majority is, one-year, one-year approval meaning you get it all in the first year or is it we\u2019re talking about most of it being staggered over a number of years? And also just curious, are there any, I guess, from what I\u2019ve heard more recently, there has also been some contingencies on some of these approvals, where there is a prohibition against asking for rate requests for a number of years after it. So, any color on that, part of it as well?","Steve Zabel","Yes, Tom, this is Steve. We\u2019re not trying to avoid the details of the increase. I\u2019ll just give you the context that we still have a lot of consumer and group communication that needs to take place on the specifics \u2013 specifically around the California increase. And so at this point, we\u2019d prefer to not get into the details and that\u2019s something that eventually will become public California and normally post that on their website. But we\u2019re going to be doing a lot of communication through the summer and into the fall, and we\u2019d really like that to be the first time that our consumers, as well as our Groups kind of hear about the details.","Tom Gallagher","Understood. How about \u2013 can I ask this question then, group versus individual, I guess, now it\u2019s kind of going to be the first big push into group rate increases and it sounds like you\u2019ve already gotten a decent amount there. Is there any difference in the both the process and the terms and conditions for the group versus individual or is it pretty similar?","Steve Zabel","Yes, this is Steve, again. I would say when it comes to the actuarial valuation, it\u2019s consistent. The types of policy forms are consistent, kind of our pricing philosophy is relatively consistent as far as the types of risks. I\u2019d say where it\u2019s a little bit different just in the conversations with regulators. For the group policies, the \u2013 just absolute premiums are much lower just because of the relative benefits that are provided in those group policies. So, there\u2019s not as much maybe sticker shock on just the absolute premium amounts. I\u2019d say, the other thing is just the funding of the premiums themselves. Majority of our group business is employer funded, and so that creates a little bit different dynamic with the states, but I would say, by and large, the regulatory framework is really consistent between individual and group.","Jack McGarry","I\u2019d remind you as well, Tom, that this is not our initial foray into group renewals. We had a very sizable renewal program associated with our 2014 filing driven by group and we\u2019re very successful in the completion of that program.","Tom Gallagher","Got it, Jack. And then final question just on \u2013 just in terms of the sales results in the quarter, you had strong group LTD, weaker results in short-term disability in Group Life. Can you comment about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes there was kind of, I guess, some mixed sales picture?","Mike Simonds","Yes, thanks, Tom, it\u2019s Mike. Appreciate the question and you summarized it well. Actually, pretty pleased with where we ended in the fourth quarter. So similar to Colonial Life, tough comp last year, we were actually up about 29% year-over-year in 4Q, in a couple of the lines where we really saw that outsized growth a year ago. One was the implementation of paid family leave in the State of New York, which was a one-time slug of new premium coming in, that came in through the short-term disability line, hence the negative compared to the 4Q \u201818. And then the other place was just some good large case life insurance activity. So, if we look at transactions over $5 million, we sort of saw little bit of a spike there, which is good when we can get it at our underwriting and pricing targets and as was the case in 4Q17. o that\u2019s why Life and STD stand out, feel good about the LTD results. And then just to take you to the [indiscernible] line, it\u2019s good to have voluntary benefit sales up about 6%, our multi-life IDI sales up about 15%, and then dental and vision, which can be a real contributor to our growth here this year was up about 34% in the quarter. So, we feel pretty good about the momentum as we go into 2019.","Tom Gallagher","Alright. Thanks, Mike.","Mike Simonds","Got it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Yes. Thank you. Just sort of curious, how much more momentum you see in the dental and vision product, you had good growth there as you\u2019ve penetrated more of your network. Is that going to continue or is that going to settle down a little bit?","Rick McKenney","Mike love to talk about that. Mike?","Mike Simonds","I would love to talk about the dental, but Tim will chime in as well. This is a great Unum Group acquisition in play for us. It\u2019s coming up on about 2 years with us. So, I mentioned sales growth of about 34%, and that\u2019s consistent with what our expectations are coming here in 2019. Dental is a network business. So, as we have success through the Unum brand, through the Colonial Life brand, that improves our position in terms of adding provider to the network. We think at this point looking at some of the industry stats, we\u2019ve actually got the fastest growing provider network in the industry and find ourselves comfortably in the top 10 there and able to compete on a national basis. So, we talked a little bit about it at our outlook meeting, but we do see dental as a very meaningful contributor to our sales growth in [indiscernible] and Colonial Life segments. Here at \u201819, it starts to have a very meaningful impact to earn premium growth towards the latter part of \u201819 and \u201820. And then as we get to scale the earnings growth, will start coming in 2021. So, Tim, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d have any doubt about success on the worksite front.","Tim Arnold","Yes. Thanks, Mike. Our field organization is very enthusiastic about the dental product. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had a viable dental product in the marketplace and great results from it last year and last year we only had the product in the marketplace for 9 months and we started with about 30 states and currently have about 45 state approval. So, lot of excitement about dental again in 2019 and the opportunity that we have to both reach new customers with the dental product, but also introduce dental to a lot of our existing clients as well.","Mark Hughes","And then just curious whether with the government shutdown that has impacted recoveries in the disability area whether there was any sort of slowdown in approvals for government disability benefits, I don\u2019t think it impacted you in the last shutdown, but did you see anything there around Q4, Q1.","Tim Arnold","Yes, thanks for the questions, Mark. No, we didn\u2019t \u2013 consistent in terms of what we\u2019d seen headed into it really and expect the same to continue after.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Sure. Thanks Mark.","Operator","We\u2019ll take a follow-up question from John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","So, I just have a \u2013 thanks for taking the follow-up. I just have a quick one on Unum International. I think the outlook from Investor Day was for 1% to 3% earnings growth in 2019. Should we be thinking \u2013 is that relative to the 2018 reported earnings or should we be adjusting the baseline to include any contribution to earnings from the operations in Poland, maybe you could sort of parse that out a little bit?","Rick McKenney","Yes, that would actually, John, that would be off the reported earnings. So that\u2019s the growth for the overall segment, which only had a quarter roughly of Poland as part of 2018. So, I mean, the dynamic you see there, Poland \u2013 yes, John, very happy with Poland. How it\u2019s really hit the ground running as part of our team. So that\u2019s going to be a good enterprise and a lot of growth ahead of it. And as Peter mentioned, the UK is a little bit slow right now and so that\u2019s the reality of what we see in a Brexit world. And so 1% to 3% growth I think is good for that segment given the nature of those two dynamics.","John Nadel","Okay. So, if I sort of broke that down, is it fair to say a modest decline year-over-year in the UK constant currency I suppose, and in some contribution from Poland?","Rick McKenney","Yes, it\u2019ll just be flat, I mean, I\u2019d say, if you look at the total on a comparable basis, it\u2019s going to be flat year-over-year. And understand in Poland too, they\u2019re doing a job, we are also investing there and integrating and going through that process. So, it\u2019s smaller relative to the overall.","John Nadel","Still very modest. Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Rick McKenney","Yes. Thanks, John. Okay. I think that was our last question. Appreciate all of you taking the time this morning to join us. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks, different conferences and investor meetings. And so that now completes our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Unum Group First Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference. Just a reminder that today's program is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas White","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Analyst and Investor Conference Call for Unum Group. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at unum.com. ","I also remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website also in the Investors section. ","Participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, the President and CEO of Unum; Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; and also the presidents of our 3 business segments, Kevin McCarthy for Unum US; Randy Horn for Colonial Life; and Jack McGarry for Unum UK. And now I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning. While our overall results were somewhat below our expectations, the vast majority of our businesses met or exceeded expectations, and I sum up the quarter as follows: First, we grew operating earnings per share by 4.3% with solid performance in our Unum US and Colonial businesses, which was off somewhat by -- offset somewhat by the lower-than-expected performance in our Unum UK and Closed Block segments. While this quarter's growth and operating earnings per share was below our outlook, we expect growth trends to improve throughout the year, and we are therefore are maintaining our 6% to 12% operating earnings per share growth outlook for 2012, though at the low end of the range. ","Second, our core business segments generated healthy returns on equity of between 13.5% and 17.5% for the first quarter. Additionally, we are seeing signs of improving growth trends across these businesses. At Unum US, we saw solid sales results in the 2 segments targeted for growth, our core group and voluntary benefit lines, which were up 14% in the first quarter, an improvement over the 8.3% growth rate in 2011. ","Colonial Life sales were somewhat below our expectations, but we are seeing positive trends in the core commercial market, a targeted market for us, and our overall premium grew almost 6% in the quarter. Finally, with firming in the pricing environment in the U.K., we are seeing better new sales opportunities in that market. ","Thirdly, I'd point out that our capital position remains strong, with risk-based capital of 406% and holding company cash and marketable securities of $575 million. This gives us significant financial flexibility, flexibility that allowed us to repurchase $175 million of stock during the first quarter. Since year-end 2007, we have repurchased over $1.8 billion of stock and reduced our shares outstanding by over 20%. ","And lastly, with our relatively consistent cash flow generation from operations, as you know, we have also established a pattern of returning capital to our shareholders through regular dividend increases. You saw yesterday that we announced a 23.8% increase in our quarterly dividend, which brings our cumulative dividend increase since year-end 2007 to over 73%. ","So in summary, in spite of the results in our Unum UK and Closed Block businesses, we continue to feel good about where things stand at the company. We are growing operating earnings per share, generating attractive returns on equity and maintaining the financial flexibility needed to continue to consistently return capital to our shareholders. I can assure you that we will be very focused on improving the performance of those areas not meeting our expectations, while also building on the momentum we have established around the rest of the company. ","Now I'll ask Tom to provide an overview on our operating results. Tom?","Thomas White","Great, thank you, Tom. As we discuss our financial results this quarter, I'll first remind you that prior-period results have been adjusted for our retrospective adoption of the accounting standards update for deferred acquisition costs and also for our treatment of the nonoperating retirement-related gains and losses which we now exclude from the operational performance of our businesses. ","Adjusted prior-period results are available on our website in an 8-K and supplemental exhibit, which we filed on April 17. As a benchmark, for full year 2011, our after-tax operating income per share -- this is adjusted for the retrospective adoption of the DAC accounting standards update and excluding the after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses, after-tax realized investment gains and losses and certain other items was $2.98 per share. ","As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we\u2019ve reported net income of $213.9 million for the first quarter of 2011 or $0.73 per diluted common share, compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $223.6 million or $0.71 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2012 are after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $7.6 million and net realized investment gains of $8.3 million. ","Included in last year's first quarter are nonoperating retirement-related losses of $5.2 million and net realized investment gains of $9.7 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $213.2 million for the quarter or $0.73 per diluted common share compared to $219.1 million or $0.70 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter. ","Now turning to the operating segments. Operating income for the Unum US segment increased 5.8% to $205.9 million in the first quarter; and premium income increased by 4%, driven by positive comparisons in all 3 lines of business within this segment. Operating income in the Group Disability line was $74.7 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $73.8 million last year, as a 1% increase in premium income helped offset a 1 percentage point increase in the benefit ratio. The increase in premium income, which is the first year-over-year increase in several years, resulted from the recent favorable sales trends, solid persistency and also a slight benefit we experienced this quarter from employment and wage growth in our in-force customer base. ","The group disability benefit ratio increased to 84.9% from 83.9% in the year-ago period, due primarily to unfavorable risk experience in the short-term disability line of business and the impact of the new claim discount rate adjustment that we made during the third quarter last year. ","Within the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 1.6% to $52.4 million in the first quarter, benefiting from an increase of 7.1% in premium income, which offset an increase in the benefit ratio to 72% from 70% last year. The increase in the benefit ratio was due to higher incidence rates. ","In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, first quarter income increased 13.7% to $78.8 million. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by solid growth in premium income and favorable risk experienced in each of these product lines. Premium growth grew by 6.4% this quarter. ","Moving to Unum UK, operating income in this segment declined to GBP 24.7 million from GBP 30.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio increased to 72.4% from 69.3% in year-ago quarter, while premium income in local currency increased by 4.2%. And Rick will examine the U.K. results in greater detail in his comments. ","So concluding our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 4.8% this quarter to $69.7 million, driven by premium growth of 5.7%, which offset a slight increase in the benefit ratio to 52.1% from 51.4% a year ago. ","The results for the Closed Block segment this quarter showed a decline in operating income to $15.4 million from $31.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest adjusted loss ratio for the Individual Disability block was 83.1% compared to 84.7% last year, while the interest adjusted loss ratio for Long-Term Care was 91.2% compared to 83% last year. ","Premium income declined by 2.9% due to the ongoing wind-down of the Individual Disability block. ","For the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $20.6 million in the first quarter compared to a loss of $21.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income is lower due to the lower asset levels, a lower proportion of assets invested at long-term interest rates and an increase in the amortization of the principal amount invested in tax credit partnerships. Interest to debt expense declined to $32.5 million in the quarter compared to $34.9 million a year ago, due primarily to last year's first quarter debt maturity. And expenses are lower than the prior year, primarily due to decreases in expense accruals. ","As previously noted, our after-tax nonoperating retirement-related loss for the first quarter of 2012 was $7.6 million. And for your modeling purposes, you can expect this loss to continue at this quarterly rate for the balance of 2012. ","Now I'd like to call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results. Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Thank you, Tom. In my comments this morning, I'd like to cover the margin trends we experienced in our business segments this quarter, a view on the growth trends, and we'll also provide an update on our investment results and capital position. ","First on operating results in the first quarter, I'll start with Unum US. It was a very good quarter for the Unum US segment, with operating earnings growth of 6% and generally solid risk experience. Sales growth and persistency trends were also encouraging, and I'll cover those in a moment. For Group Disability, the benefit ratio remained within the range we've seen over the past 2 years with a benefit ratio in the first quarter of 84.9% compared to the fourth quarter ratio of 84.7% and 83.9% in the year-ago quarter. ","Submitted new claims incidence trends for long-term disability were slightly higher, but paid incidence trends were actually slightly lower. Claim recovery trends continued their favorable performance over the past several quarters. These trends were offset slightly this quarter by weaker results in our short-term disability claim experience, as we experienced higher paid incidence rates and higher average weekly indemnities. We've already begun taking action which we believe will firm up the result in short-term disability, and we don't expect to see this trending through to our long-term disability results. ","Additionally, the new claim discount rate adjustments we made in the third quarter last year negatively impacts the benefit ratio by approximately 65 basis points. We made no additional changes in new claim discount rate this quarter, and the interest reserve margin remains stable at a spread of 97 basis points. Overall, we were pleased with the performance of the group disability line, which generated over a 13% return on equity for the first quarter. ","For the group life and AD&D line, the earnings contribution this quarter remains stable at $52.4 million, up 2% from a year ago. Premiums grew by 7% this quarter due to the recent improvement in sales trends, as well as higher premium persistency. The benefit ratio at 72% was higher than we've seen in previous quarters, primarily due to higher incidence in group life. The overall margin for this line remains very healthy, generating an ROE north of 15%. ","Moving to the Supplemental and Voluntary line within Unum US, we saw very good overall earnings results again this quarter, which increased 14% due to solid risk experience and strong premium growth. Premium growth was 6.4% in total and 9.2% for the voluntary benefits product line. The benefit ratio improved to 50.1%, primarily driven by favorable risk experience in the voluntary benefits life product line and the Individual Disability recently issued product line. The ROE for this business line stands at 13%, and it remains an attractive growth opportunity for the company. ","Turning to the U.K., results were lower than we expected, with operating earnings declining to GBP 24.7 million, with lower net investment income and unfavorable group life experience. We attribute the results in our group life business this quarter to volatility, as the increased claims are not concentrated in any single customer or time period when the business was underwritten or sold. To give some context, this is a relatively small block of business at roughly GBP 130 million of annual premium income, so it's subject to variations in claim activity. We anticipate that these results will return to more normal levels of profitability as the year progresses, which would be more in the GBP 30 million of quarterly earnings and an ROE of around 20%. ","Colonial Life produced another solid quarter as operating earnings in the first quarter increased 5%, with premium income increasing almost 6%. The benefit ratio was slightly higher this quarter at 52.1% compared to 51.4% in the year-ago quarter and was up slightly in each of the lines. The ROE for Colonial Life remains a very healthy 17.4% for the quarter.","To round it out, this is the first quarter after loss recognition that we\u2019ve reported our Closed Block with the inclusion of our Long-term Care business. The results came in lower than a year ago and below our expectations due to higher claim incidence in Long-term Care. We attribute this to volatility this quarter, but we still need to establish a firm run rate in this business under its Closed Block status. ","So turning to our sales trends, we were very pleased with trends we're seeing across our business lines. Sales at Unum US continued the strong trend we've seen for the past few quarters, with total sales for the first quarter increasing 12%. For the group disability and group life and AD&D combined, sales increased 11%, with sales in the under-2,000-life core market increasing 11.5% and comprising just under 70% of the sales mix. Voluntary benefit sales were also strong, increasing almost 16% for the quarter, with positive contributions across all product lines and market segments. And persistency for Unum US was also strong at 91.7% for Group Long-term Disability and 91.3% for group life. ","Given these strong trends, along with a very slight benefit from the improving employment picture in the U.S., we produced 4.4% premium growth for the Unum US segment, its highest growth rate in several years. ","In the U.K., we also continue to see better pricing trends in the U.K. market. And as a result, new sales activity has rebounded strongly against relatively low sales volumes from a year ago. In addition, persistency is firming up for the Group Long-term Disability line at 86% compared to 83.5% last year, as price is absorbed into the market. Given these trends, premium income in the U.K. in local currency increased just over 4% in the first quarter. ","Finally, in Colonial Life, premiums grew 6%. New sales in Colonial Life were relatively flat, with new accounts increasing 3% but a smaller average case size impacting the total new account sales volume. ","Moving on to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, we continue to be pleased with the trends we're seeing. The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains excellent, with a net unrealized gain position of our fixed maturity securities portfolio at $5.5 billion at quarter end and our watch list of potential problem credits continuing at historical low levels. Net realized after-tax investment gains and losses excluded -- excluding the embedded derivative in the reinsurance contract was essentially breakeven this quarter. ","The ongoing low interest rate environment continues to be challenging. And additionally, the tightening of credit spreads throughout much of the quarter made for an even more difficult quarter to put money to work. By being selective in our asset purchases, we were able to achieve new money rate, which is hedge-adjusted for 5.4% for the first quarter. As a result, the overall portfolio yield held up relatively well at 6.62%, comparing to 6.67% at year end. Given the environment we saw in the first quarter, we did run a cash balance higher than usual, which creates a drag on our net investment income. Given lower amounts of cash flows in the second quarter, we'll look to catch up in the second quarter while continuing to be opportunistic. ","Our capital position continues to be strong. While statutory net income for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was down slightly from a year ago, our run rate continues to support our capital model that generates about $500 million of free cash flow per year. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies remains at approximately 406%, above our 2012 target range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash, marketable securities total $575 million at quarter end. And we continue to expect it to be within the range of $500 million to $800 million by year-end 2012.","During the first quarter, we took advantage of a lower share price, and our share repurchases totaled $175 million of our planned total of $500 million for the year. We also announced yesterday that we increased the dividend for the fourth straight year, and this year, notably, at a more rapid rate. We see this as reflective of our cash flow characteristics and a positive way to return money to our shareholders.","In closing, with a comment on our outlook. Despite the volatility we have described and pressure on the investment side, we continue to see 2012 operating earnings per share growth in the lower end of the range of 6% to 12%. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. In closing, despite the unfavorable results in a couple of areas which we recognize we must address, we continue to grow operating earnings per share, generate solid ROEs in our core business segments, grow our business in our target markets and generate capital, which has allowed us to continue to buy back stock and raise our dividend. And as Rick said, we're maintaining our outlook, which continues to call for operating earnings per share growth at the low end of our 6% to 12% range. ","This completes our prepared comments, and operator, let's move now to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see -- regarding Long-Term Care and the incidence levels that you guys talked about, I believe your book is at a relatively younger age maybe versus some of your peers. So curious if we should be worried that this higher incidence levels, this early on could lead to the need to maybe strengthen reserves in the future.","Thomas R. Watjen","Two questions embedded in there, Chris. Why don't we sort of ask Kevin to speak a little bit just to some of the incidence and claims trends? And obviously Rick can speak to our confidence in the reserves.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, you're right. Our average age is probably lower than our competitors, primarily because we have about 50% of our book of business in the group Long-Term Care business. And that average age is in the mid-40s. The expected levels of incidence at that age would be quite low, so even small upticks in incidence would generate the appearance of a fairly significant higher percentage. That said, the block of business isn't sizable enough to not have volatility, and I think this kind of volatility that we experienced in this quarter isn't atypical of this kind of business.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to speak to the financial side of that?","Richard P. McKenney","I will. As I noted in my script, what we saw in the higher loss ratio in the first quarter is a reflection of the quarter. With regards to claim incidence, we saw in LTC and not what we would expect longer-term in these businesses, as Kevin just referenced. So if you look at the Closed Block in aggregate, we were running around $30 million if you look over last year. It's come down a little bit as we look into this year, and we're running in probably the $25 million to $30 million range. And we were lighter than that by $10 million pretax. So I would chalk that up to volatility. You mentioned the reserves. We did take action at year-end, but those actions were much more about our long-term assumptions. And as Kevin said, this incidence we saw in the quarter is not our long-term expectation.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Kevin, the commentary in the release was pretty positive around the competitive environment in group disability, and you talked about some pickup from employment and wage increases. So I wanted to see, one, if you could talk about sort of -- expand on the competitive environment. And in the past, you've talked about sort of $80 million in premium from sort of natural growth from expanding wages and payrolls. So wanted to see how much of this you think you're capturing today.","Kevin P. McCarthy","First, let me address maybe the competitive pricing environment. I would say that, generally speaking, a number of companies over the last year have announced in one way or another, either price increases or renewal programs. I think we've seen some uptick in premium for life across the industry, which is a good solid trend. I mean, there are always a few competitors that, that's not the case. But in general, there's been an uptick in PPL [ph]. And in general, we've seen fairly stable pricing, especially in the smaller case end of the marketplace through the end of last year and into the first quarter of this year. In terms of a 4% of earned premium growth overall in Unum US, very little of it is from natural growth. I think there are encouraging signs in the economy, other than maybe this morning's payroll -- unemployment report. But in general, I think the signs have been encouraging. But that only accounts for sort of less than 0.5% of the overall growth. The primary driver of growth was solid sales here in 2011 and really solid persistency levels.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, then one just last quick one on capital management. Back at the 2010 Investor Day, you talked about potentially being able to do up to $900 million of share repurchases a year, and you backed away from that last year due to some of the economic headwinds. But curious if you would be willing to upsize your buyback this year in order to achieve your EPS growth target?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to take that one?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, I would like to talk about that one. I would agree with those numbers we laid back out in 2010. We got off of that track last year as we saw challenges over the course of the summer with what was going on in the Eurozone, et cetera. As we came into this year, our 2011 investor day, we talked about $500 million of repurchases over the course of the year. We did a little bit more than that run rate in the first quarter, but we're sticking to the $500 million for the full year. And to your last point, we don't think about it from an EPS perspective. We think much more on the capital management side as returning capital to our shareholders, doing it as a good use of the excess capital that we've generated, and we'll continue to do it that way. The last point I would make is, a lot of the numbers we put out back in 2010 still hold. So when you think of the excess capital that we still have out there on the balance sheet, both in terms of cash as well as RBC in excess of our expectations over the longer term, that dynamic still exists, but we're going to wait until we see a better market and a better environment on the horizon before we bring out some of that capital.","Operator","Up next, we'll hear from Mark Finkelstein, Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","To get to the low end of the range of 6% to 12%, does that assume full recovery in U.K. and LTC earnings?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. When you think about the lower end of the range, the 6% to 12%, we've talked about 2 dynamics there. We\u2019ve really mostly talked about one, which is the pressure we've seen from the lower interest rates and the higher cash balances that we're holding. I think our expectation, as we've said in our earlier comments, is that over the course of the year, that the volatility that we saw in both LTC as well in the U.K. will dissipate. So when you take those together and a whole lot of other things that will happen over the course of the year, it leads us to the conclusion that we're still within our range of 6% to 12%.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess, just going back to the incidence on LTC, I mean, the interest-adjusted loss ratios really did pick up quite a bit. Are there any metrics that you can give us that just show that it really was a blip in incidence and just not kind of a continuation of a negative trend, albeit much more magnified this quarter? I mean, are there any sequential actual expected type metrics or anything that can kind of tell us just how much of an anomaly this was?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to talk about it a little bit, because you guys obviously monitor the business on a fairly regular basis?","Kevin P. McCarthy","We've seen this kind of hiccup in incidence before in disability lines and Long-Term Care lines. The claim volume was a little bit elevated in the first quarter. We've seen other quarters that were somewhat similar. We typically see some seasonality in the business as well, particularly after the holidays in the first quarter. But like I said earlier, this kind of volatility, we track it, and we see it from time to time. From a claims management standpoint though, we're pretty active about making sure that we understand where claims are coming from and what we can do about it. I mean, we can't do much about the incoming mail, but from there, we can actively manage the claims. And we've taken a couple of actions since the end of the year to shore up and strengthen our Long-Term Care active management. I'll give you a couple of examples. We did appoint a new senior financial executive to oversee the business. We did put in place sort of an internal, regular internal audit-type peer review of claims activity. And we did put in place an inventory management system around claims, similar to what we executed in long-term disability that's served us so well in that line of business. So I think as Rick said, we would expect this volatility to happen from time to time, and we would expect it to dissipate.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, with you, Kevin. I think Rick made an opening remark suggesting that the STD incidence shouldn't travel over to LTD. I guess, what gives you that confidence?","Kevin P. McCarthy","A couple of things. We track something that we call the flow-through rate, the rate at which STD claims become LTD claims. That's not moving at all. In fact, if anything, it's slightly declining. Secondly, duration days, the length of time that STD claim would stay on-claim, it has been incredibly stable over a long, long period of time. So when I take a look at what's going on in STD, I think again we've got an uptick in incidence. We're addressing that with pricing actions, and we don't see any flow-through to LTD.","Operator","Up next, we'll take a question from Ed Spehar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 questions. I guess the first would be, if the earnings run rate continued for Long-term Care at the 1Q level, so I think you said about $10 million less than what you thought, what, if anything, would that imply for reserves?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, well, I think that what you're talking about though is, and it is a little bit speculative, that, that higher incident rate persists for a long period of time. And so if it's a long period of time, it's something you have to address. But I'd very quickly say that we don't expect that, as Kevin said, and as I've said. And so I think that it does not have the impact on reserves. It is more volatility intra-quarter, which is an income statement issue and not a balance sheet issue.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. But if there's -- I mean, if it did, I mean just sort of sense as to how big of a deal it would be if this number was $10 million a quarter worse than what you're thinking. I mean, is it a reserve issue at all? I guess my point is, is it a reserve issue at all, or is it just that earnings would be coming through $10 million less a quarter every quarter going forward?","Richard P. McKenney","Well, I think we're speculating a little bit here, so what we're\u2026","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","We have to do that though, unfortunately, Rick.","Richard P. McKenney","What we're talking about is short-term trends versus longer-term trends. And we're saying this is a short-term trend, and it will be earnings impact in the current quarter, which we've shown you. If it happens again, it will be earnings impact in that quarter. And then longer-term, if we see that as a trend, we'll have to reflect that into our reserving processes. But that's a long way out from where we sit here today.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and then a related question is, have you considered that there's any possibility that there was an acceleration of submitted claims in Long-term Care, simply because of your decision to exit the line? Is there any reason to think that, from either a customer or distributor standpoint, that you might have had some upfront-ing of claims?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to take that actually? Because we've looked at that right there\u2026","Kevin P. McCarthy","No, I think -- first of all, I think it would be way too soon. We didn't make the announcement until the first week of February, something like that. So it would be way too soon for that sudden influx of mail to sort of come in. So no, I don't think there's any evidence to that. Like I said, we do a lot of internal review of incoming claiming volume. We want to make sure whenever we see an uptick in incidence, that there's nothing -- there's no sort of new thing happening to us. And we didn't see any evidence of that. Like I said, I think it's just volatility.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is there any reason to think that, that could have an impact in subsequent quarters, just the announcement that you're getting out?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I don't think so. I mean, when you think about the definition of disability, I am hard-pressed to see people deciding that they've got multiple ADL losses, activity of daily living losses, just because we made an announcement. I mean, either they have it or they don't.","Thomas R. Watjen","I think, Kevin, you mentioned, too, one of the things we have done since the announcement is shore up a lot of our resources actually supporting this business, made a number of adjustments in personnel and things like that. So to the extent we do get a higher level of claims, we've got the resources to be sure that we're only paying the ones that should be paid.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jay Gelb, Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What's the sensitivity to Unum's sales in the U.S. from a pickup in improving wage numbers and employment?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, do you want to take that one?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Sure. I don't know if I could quantify it for you, Jay, but I mean, certainly an uptick in wage inflation, if you will, would increase covered payrolls, which in turn would increase the dollar volume, if you will, of sales, pretty linearly. And then I think an increase in employment would be similar. I mean, we start -- if companies started to grow, instead of covering 100 people in the company, we'd be covering 105. So I think it's a very linear relationship. And if we see an uptick in wage inflation and we see an uptick in employment, we'll see an uptick in the dollar value of sales in premium.","Thomas R. Watjen","Jim, I might say that we're not expecting significant improvement in the economic environment actually. So the growth that you've seen in the last year or 2, which we reported here in this past quarter, is more driven by basic fundamentals. It's either a combination of competitive dynamics improving. Obviously, our reach and touch in the marketplace continues to expand. We've had great stability in this company in terms of our sales and service organization. I think, Kevin, which actually is probably more behind the growth that we've seen, and probably what we're expecting the rest of this year.","Kevin P. McCarthy","The other thing I'd say, Tom, is that any improvement in the economic environment with respect to wages and employment probably reflects itself more in what we call NBOC, in-force customers beginning to grow again. And we did see an increase in NBOC during the end of last year and into this quarter. And it reflects confidence.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On a separate issue, the drop-off in Unum UK net investment income quarter-over-quarter was pretty significant. Was there any specific driver to that? Or is that the right run rate going forward?","Thomas R. Watjen","Tom, you want to take that one?","Thomas White","Yes. Jay, basically, what happened is in last year's first quarter, we had a bond call. I think it was about GBP 2.7 million. And actually, it's a little unusual for us to have that. So we had that working against us. We didn't have any on-call premium this year. So about a $2.7 million swing year-over-year because of the bond call last year.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It was down from $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '11, so\u2026","Thomas White","The other thing is we'll get some adjustments and some noise with the inflation. Keep in mind, with our group disability policies over there, about 30% or so have an inflation rider, so as inflation moves up and down, we'll have some movement in the net investment income, which actually gets offset on the reserves and flows through the benefit ratio. So it doesn't have any impact on overall income, but we can get some noise with how inflation moves around in the U.K.","Thomas R. Watjen","Their indexing guild [ph] so we're invested in over there.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So what do you feel the right run rate is for net investment income in Unum UK?","Thomas White","It's going to move around. You have to -- we can probably -- I can take you off-line, and we can kind of talk through what some of the trends have been. But it's going to be heavily dependent on the direction of inflation and how that kind of flows through the investment income line.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Tom, maybe also to point out too that, that also affect -- the movement in the rates in inflation affect also the benefit cost. So there's a linkage sometimes. So actually just focusing on the investment income is a piece of it, but it's also a benefit cost connection as well.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the Closed Block, the impact of the Long-term Care business going forward, I know you're trying to figure out what the run rate is there, but maybe you can give us a bit more sense in terms of how we should think about it.","Richard P. McKenney","We are trying to establish a run rate there, as I mentioned. But I think I also mentioned in my earlier comments, we'd expect that 25% to 30% range is probably more realistic for this Closed Block going forward. As I mentioned, that's slightly down off of the run rates we were seeing last year as we've taken the entire business through the Closed Block process.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that would be considering no other unusual impacts, correct?","Richard P. McKenney","That's our expectation.","Operator","From Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we'll hear from Tom Gallagher.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to Long-Term Care for a minute. And Rick, I just want to make sure I'm doing the math correctly. So if I take -- if I kind of overlay your interest-adjusted benefit ratio with what I think is reasonable other expense line, it looks like you lost a slight amount of money in Long-term Care in this quarter and you made money in the Closed Block Individual Disability. Is that correct?","Richard P. McKenney","I think that's pretty close. We don't split out those results, but I think that\u2019s directionally correct.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I sort of extrapolated, and again, I know this is assuming -- making an assumption, but if I assume that claims do remain elevated and I had just a moderate loss on a GAAP basis for the next 3 quarters heading into year end, would that precipitate another reserve charge, to kind of get back to Ed's question, if you had -- if you strung together 4 quarters in a row? Or is that still too early to determine that the reserves are inadequate? Or you just can't make a determination? I'm just curious how you would think about that.","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. I think I'd point you back to the underlying causes that brought that into a lower-earning position over the next 3 quarters. And then we have to take those causes, which in this quarter would be claim incidence and whatever that cause might be. And you\u2019d take those new levels and put that through the reserves and see if you're adequate on that basis. And there's other offsets going the other way that will change over the course of the year as premium -- new premiums come in from pricing and things like that. So you take all that together and then evaluate your reserves in that process. But I think you have to go to the underlying causes, not to what the earnings run rate is. The earnings run rates can differ from what your long-term expectations are of claims incidence or any other factor behind the business.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then I guess my other question would be on a related note. Even though you did take a Long-term Care reserve charge on GAAP, there wasn't much of a statutory impact from it last year. So it really has had minimal impact on capital management, which you've been able to still do in a fairly robust way. If there was a Long-Term Care issue on claims incidence, would that also be a stat issue? And would that potentially change the outlook on capital management? And then just a related question, has there been a corresponding statutory impact now that you've seen some softening on GAAP on Long-term Care this quarter?","Richard P. McKenney","Okay. Lots of questions in there. If you take what happened in the quarter from a statutory perspective, we did see higher incidence. We're paying on more claims, and so we'll have a little bit less of a run rate on the statutory side. Once again, we don't expect that to continue. So we'd expect our statutory earnings to go right back to our model that we're expecting longer-term in the company. We mentioned at year end that our GAAP reserves are similar to our stat reserves today, but those are 2 fundamentally different bases of accounting. So you\u2019d have to build up from the underlying assumptions and how that might change your view around both GAAP or stat. So if we do see pressure in this business, ultimately we could see pressure on the statutory side as well, but we don't see that today. And so we'll have to see how that plays out.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. Last question, just on the U.K. I think last time we had a blip in the U.K., you guys had talked about in the month following the close of that quarter, things had gotten a bit better. Do you have any early read on how things are playing out thus far into 2Q in the U.K.?","Thomas R. Watjen","Jack, do you want to cover that? Maybe even just step back a little bit and just sort of again, in your own words, describe a little bit what we saw here this past quarter.","John F. McGarry","Yes. It is different that the blip in the U.K. in the third quarter was a disability blip. This is clearly a group life and dependence blip. So we don't have a read on where it is in the second quarter. It is more volatile. To kind of put it in context, our entire group life block in the U.K. is smaller than 1\/4 worth of group life business in the U.S. And actually, average sizes, because the standard plan design here tends to be 4x, salary tends to be even higher. So we expect volatility in it. We don't have a good read, but we've had blips. In the past, the first quarter tends to be a little worse than other quarters. And we put some solace in the fact that we had very good group life quarters in the 3 quarters leading up to this one.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Steven Schwartz, Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A lot of follow-ups, but thanks for that on the U.K. in April. I'm wondering if you could talk about maybe April, and if it's possible to talk about April in Long-term Care and STD. And also with regards to STD, you're raising prices. Is that going to take a couple of years to get through, like it might in Group Long-term Disability?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to pick up on both of those? Obviously...","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, I'd hesitate to say anything really about the second quarter right now. I mean, just as we say the first quarter's volatility, and one quarter doesn't make a trend, I'm reluctant to speculate on one month being a different trend. So I think we'll just have to let it play out. As Rick said and as I said earlier, we expect volatility. It's happened before. We expect it to dissipate throughout. But I'd rather wait to sort of see it happen than speculate about it. With regard to STD, in terms of renewals, yes, it'll take -- it would take about roughly 2 to 3 years to have it run through the block as long as [ph] that business has either 2- or 3-year rate guarantees. We're talking about a mid-single-digit kind of rate increase. But of course, new sales would flow through right away, and we're raising prices on new STD sales as well, also in the mid-single digit range. And so as sales flow through, that'll help the block as well.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'll leave that dead horse there. If I could, a couple more questions. Rick, you mentioned cash drag in the quarter. I was wondering if you could possibly put a number on that since it sounds like you'll be fully invested at least some point during the second quarter. That seems to be the plan. And then I was also wondering, a competitor mentioned this, and I was wondering if you had seen this. Social security administration delays, maybe a lengthening in the time it takes for a decision. And if you'd seen that, how that affects you.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, why don't you take the cash piece, and then Kevin on the social security offset piece?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. On the cash side, what we saw in the quarter is a few hundred million. So you're looking $300 million-ish type range of excess cash that we wanted to put back to work. As we look out at how much we actually did put to work, it was a fair bit. Second quarter is a lot lighter in terms of incoming cash flow that we have coming in. So even if we do slightly less than we did in the first quarter, we'll be caught back up. But sitting on that cash, even for a short period of time does cause a little bit of drag. And we'll just have to work our way through that. But we expect to be caught back up, mostly because of the volumes that we see of cash coming in, in the second quarter and our expectation that our team will continue to be opportunistic and get that out over the course of the second.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on social security?","Kevin P. McCarthy","With respect to social security, there's been a trend of higher rates of approvals by Social Security over the last several years, and that's reflected in our strong offset performance. We haven't seen really anything with respect to generally delays in awards and the recognition of those awards. And in any event, from a pricing and reserving standpoint, we plan for that anyway. So even the awards were delayed, they would be awarded retroactively. And as long as that occurred according to our pricing assumptions, it would make no impact at all on our financials.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Randy Binner, FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to hit on STD again. I guess I haven't heard in all these questions if there was an explanation of kind of what the dynamic was with the higher claims there. And then also I was curious beyond raising pricing if there's any actions you're taking on the claim side to try and mitigate whatever the trend there is.","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. A couple of things. What we've seen is a general creep in incidence and prevalence in STD over the last several years. So it was a little bit more visible this quarter. As I said, the length of STD claims hasn't changed at all. Flow-through to LTD has not occurred. And so I guess what I would conclude from that is that it's maybe a higher volume of very short-term, short-term disability claims. Those -- that makes it somewhat harder to manage, because we're not trying to manage recoveries. A lot of times, we get short-term disability claims that are so short that by the time we find out about them, the person's already back to work. That said, we are taking a look at whether or not we can do something around the very, very front end of short-term disability claims to monitor the incoming to see whether we can get our arms around whether or not there's anything we can do about that. At the same time, I think the more practical answer is we just need to raise prices to reflect the incidence and prevalence level we're seeing.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And that's kind of across job classes, across geographies? There's no trend in that?","Kevin P. McCarthy","No. No trend that I can point to at the moment.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just one more kind of higher-level question on net investment income. I think people have hit it in different areas. And it was a little bit light versus our model, and I appreciate the comments on putting cash back to work. But I guess there's -- just to kind of clarify or make sure, there's no -- there's nothing you're going to do in the portfolio to take additional action, kind of different investment strategy, different asset allocation? It's the same asset mix and strategy you're looking for in the portfolio, just trying to get more cash to work. Is that right?","Kevin P. McCarthy","That's absolutely the case. I think we know the asset classes that we like, and on a relative value basis, we'll shift from one asset class to another, whether it's private placements or corporate bonds or commercial mortgage loans, and we'll go where we see relative value. But you won't see a move in the overall portfolio. It's been stable over the last several years, and you can expect it to stay there. It'll be marginal moves in each of those product lines or those asset classes depending on what the environment looks like.","Operator","From Barclays, we'll take a question from Eric Berg.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, I used to be at Barclays. Now we\u2019re at RBC. All joking aside, I wanted to return to the Long-term Care area. And I guess my first thing is, I wanted to clarify that the incidence, the pickup at incidence that you experienced in the March quarter is different from the issue that you addressed fundamentally in the large reserve increase that you took to exit the business. In particular, my understanding is that when you booked the large charge to exit the business, that was fundamentally about how long older people are living in or remaining in nursing homes -- essentially, they\u2019re staying alive -- before the claim ends due to death in the nursing home, that this was really about the length of stays in nursing home. And so my question is, first, are we really talking today about a new aspect to the claims? People entering nursing homes, the number of claims as opposed to the length of claims? That's my question.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. We think about -- I'll take you back to year-end. There were 2 fundamental things that we highlighted: one which you referenced which was termination rates, how long people are staying on-claim and what our long-term view is of that. The second is interest rates. So we did adjust for what our perception is of interest rates drifting down here over the next 3 to 5 years, and those are the 2 big aspects of that. What we saw this quarter is different than those items on the incidence side, and it's different than what we've seen over the last several years. So if you look back to some of the increasing loss ratio we had in the past, it was much more about lapse-ation or persistency of people staying on their parts [ph] as opposed to the utilization and incidence which we're seeing here. So we did see that blip up in the quarter, and we'll certainly keep a close eye on it. But at the moment, we think it's volatility.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And let me just ask a second and final question on this topic. It is sort of the same question but asked differently from the one that was asked I think by Ed and Tom, and it's this. Let's say you continue to experience elevated incidence. I know you don't. You've said that repeatedly. You're calling this volatility. But let's say you did experience it. My question, what would be the case -- what would cause you not to have to take a reserve charge in the face of ongoing elevated incidence? Others -- the other fellows asked you, wouldn't that lead to a reserve charge? I'd like to know what would be the set of facts and circumstances under which, faced with higher incidence on a continuing basis, you wouldn't take a reserve charge?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. I think that incidence is one attribute of the product line, and so we\u2019d have to look at all the other pieces, including the ones we adjusted at year-end to see if they play out that way. And the other thing that's important is we are able to increase prices in this line. And so we are actively continuing to raise rates in this line to reflect the characteristics of that block. And certainly an increase in incidence and utilization is brought [ph] would correspond with us continuing to raise rates. And so I think that's -- you mentioned what's the one offset. I'd probably highlight that as an important factor.","Thomas R. Watjen","And Rick, bringing into that the fact that we've really brought in some people into this exercise to be sure we've got resources behind this, including a very senior addition to the team. So Eric, I mean we just aren't taking this issue of how we reprice and rethink that block of business casually. There's an active process in place, as Rick said, to be sure that we're being as aggressive and as appropriately aggressive as we can be on pricing and repricing.","Operator","From Sterne Agee, John Nadel is up next.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess to beat the Long-term Care horse to absolute death, can you just update us -- Rick, you mentioned pricing. Can you update us on where you stand with respect to the pricing actions? Maybe guys give us an update on state-by-state approvals, the expectation for impact to premiums over what period of time again.","Richard P. McKenney","So I'll take you through what we've seen with regard to our filing process on individual Long-term Care. The plan's still on track. I wouldn't give you much more update than take some time to implement those once they've been approved, and they have to go through the process of notification, et cetera. I would say going forward, we're going to see where price stands. But it'll be on a much more -- on a continuum. These aren't going to be initially weighted to pricing. These will be ongoing to be ongoing discussions that we have with states with regard to the particular block of business that they have there. And so to go through a process of kind of an update and a status check, I think, will be different. We'll certainly let you know as the premium starts to flow in and what our expectations are around that going forward. But so far, we're still on track. I'd take you back to the metrics we saw in the fourth quarter, and they look very similar to that.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, helpful. I guess, separately, the change in your definition of operating earnings and treating these I guess pension-related costs as nonoperating item could -- I'm just curious, what precipitated that? And why are you making that adjustment? I'm just trying to understand the theory.","Richard P. McKenney","When you look at the operations of our business, we certainly try and be consistent across the board. And I would say this item that we're talking about -- we're not talking about our total pension expense. We continue to have the service cost running through, which reflects the increasing level of our pension. What we're talking about here is the movement in the actuarial gain or loss, which is very similar to capital gains and losses in the portfolio in that it will get marked and it will change and we'll see gains. And that today comes through the income statement, although over a longer period of time. But we think it looks much more like capital gains and losses. And we have seen other companies out there that do something similar, and we thought that was appropriate for our business.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Can you give an example of couple of companies that you've seen do this?","Richard P. McKenney","GE, IBM.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So nobody in the peer group, though? I don't believe there's anybody that I cover who has done this.","Richard P. McKenney","No. I don't believe there is. And so we're looking at it, but I would say there's an awful lot of folks out there that do look at capital gains and losses or things that are similar to that as nonoperating items and we put this in that category.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Understood, okay. And then 2 quick ones then. Did you see any benefit in the quarter from prepayment income? Was it in line with expectations, above, below?","Thomas White","Yes. I think, John, it was pretty consistent with what we saw on the first quarter last year and relative to the fourth. Actually, it was a little bit lower than last year and pretty much in line with what we saw with in the fourth quarter. The thing about it, it varies by line of business. It just depends on the bond that's called and what product line portfolio that we're holding it in.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last one is more for Tom Watjen. Just looking at the sales results in Unum UK. And if I go back in time when you made the management changes there, I think at least in part, one of the things that you highlighted was you weren't all that pleased with the mix shift that had been occurring in the U.K. away from disability, toward group life, and yet, this quarter, I see dramatic increase in group life sales year-over-year, not that disability didn't grow either. But is there anything we can take away from the quarter's results in that regard?","Thomas R. Watjen","No, I don't think so, John. I think we said across all of our businesses, we -- obviously there are parts of our business that are opportunistic. And occasionally, we're going to see things that if we can price the business properly, we're going to be opportunistic. And I think you saw that to a degree in the U.K. results in the quarter. There are a few cases, for example, that were reasonably large, but ones that again we could obtain on a very attractive price. And as Jack mentioned in his comments, other than this quarter, we've had a pretty good run of 3 quarters of pretty good results in the group life line in the U.K. So I think that discipline you referred to, we're very much staying with. Across all of our businesses, we can see opportunistic things come along, which can cause spikes. In Unum US, for example, you'll see the spikes in large case when you see those kinds of opportunities. So nothing has really changed there. Again, our fastball and our presence in the U.K. is dominated by our disability franchise, and we really have, with Jack's leadership, I think really brought more focus to that. We're very engaged in the public policy debate in the U.K. about the role private disability can play in the broader sort of public policy arena. So please don't misread that quarter in terms of a shift back to some things that I think, as you rightfully point out, we were trying to move away from.","Operator","Up next, we'll hear from Sean Dargan, Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Just following up in the U.K. I think the consensus now is that the U.K. is in full-blown double-dip recession. Does that change either the top line or bottom line guidance that was given for 2012?","Thomas R. Watjen","No. And Jack, maybe you can speak a little bit again to just how, if at all, you're seeing the recession impact your business.","John F. McGarry","Yes, clearly, the interest rate environment is having an impact on our business. Natural growth is weak in the U.K. as it is in the U.S. and isn't -- we didn't get the 0.5% lift in natural growth in the U.K. I think a full-blown double-dip recession is a little harsh. There was a small 2-quarter decrease, but it was like 0.2% dips. They expect low but growth for the remainder of the year. But actually in kind of getting back to John's question as well, I think the recessionary pressures are more than offset by a better competitive environment in the U.K. We felt much better about the 40% increase in our GIP sales than we did about what happened in group life, which was opportunistic. But those sales were actually across the board in all size, levels. We've seen in the U.K., particularly in the financial services industry, several major banks come out and request proposals to insure all of their bank employees, which is something that is new to the U.K. and a very positive sign for our business, because that's the direction our strategy is going. And a lot of companies look to what the banks and other major employers in the U.K. do, as they're thinking about their own benefit design. So we think that's a positive movement. We\u2019ve begun to have some success in selling additional -- in selling and convincing in-force customers to insure additional employees under their schemes, which is a really positive sign, again, consistent with our strategy. And so in the U.K., our growth story isn't necessarily as focused on the economy growing as it's focused on expanding the number of employees that employers choose to provide coverage to in the U.K.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one quick one on Colonial Life. The sales in Accidents, Sickness and Disability were maybe a little lighter than I was expecting. Is there some change in the competitive environment in that line?","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, you want to pick up on that? And even just maybe, as Sean indicated, just talk a little bit on the environment in addition to that one particular product.","Randall C. Horn","Not seeing any significant change in the competitive environment. I mean, it's been intense for some time now. And our real issue in the first quarter was on the new account sales side of things, where we just had smaller average case size on average. We were very pleased with our sales in all of our product segments in terms of existing account sales. So those were up nicely. So we're staying very focused on our core commercial market, and in public sector, we have excellent opportunities there, Sean. And really not seeing anything new there that's causing us not to be optimistic about the future in those lines.","Thomas R. Watjen","I think actually, operator, we'll maybe move to our last question. I think we're bumping up against our time limit.","Operator","Our final question today will come from Ryan Krueger, Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Sorry to ask yet another question on Long-Term Care. I'm not sure if you said this on the call. If so, I missed it. But was incidence elevated in both the group and individual businesses? Or was it more pronounced in just one area?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to take that one?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, certainly. It was actually on the individual side, which you would expect. We talked a little bit earlier about the age differential in 2 blocks, so that's what you\u2019d expect. And it was primarily on the individual side.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then just a general question on statutory reserving. Outside of New York, when you look at reserves at the end of the year and run cash flow testing for any business, do you then always compare on a holistic basis the reserve adequacy of the company, taking into consideration shortfalls in some businesses and redundancies in another? In other words, if you could just confirm [ph] at the end of the year that you maybe should add to Long-Term Care reserves, but then you thought some of the other businesses were redundant, would that necessitate a reserve increase on a stat basis?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick you want to pick up on that?","Richard P. McKenney","I don't want to end on that, but I think there's -- let me talk a little bit about that, which would be very similar to what we talked about at Investor Day, which is this is an entity-by-entity view of the business. In some entities, and the practices are slightly different, some of the entities, you are able to look across the company and when you do cash flow testing, as you would expect, because there are offsets that obviously happen. And some entities, you do it product-line-by-product-line in cash flow. So you would come up with different answers in terms of how you go through that. But I think as you look at our year-end results and how we go through, we're certainly feeling good about -- our statutory earnings are flowing across the board, and we expect that to continue.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And just to clarify, is New York the only subsidiary where you do look at it on an exact line-by-line basis versus consolidated?","Richard P. McKenney","I hesitate to be sure in aggregate. But that's certainly one of the entities that they do look on a line-by-line basis. That's the regulation. That would be true of everybody.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you. And thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. And this will complete the first quarter 2012 earnings call.","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

","And now, I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?","Tom Watjen","Thanks, Tom, and good morning everybody. The fourth quarter was a good one for the company, with operating earnings per share, excluding the special items outlined in our release, of $0.90 per share, an increase of 5.9% over last year. This brought our fully operating earnings per share to $3.55, a growth rate of 6.9%, in line with 5% to 10% outlook for growth we provided coming into 2014. These results largely reflect the positive operating trends we have been highlighting throughout the year; that is strong sales momentum, accelerating premium growth in our core businesses, and stable risk experience. This quarter we also took the appropriate actions necessary to deal with the impact of low interest rates on our businesses, particularly long term care, and we\u2019ll cover that in more detail in a moment. ","But for now let me highlight a few points before turning things over to Rick for his more detailed remarks. First, we again saw excellent sales results across all of our core businesses this quarter, continuing a trend we have been building throughout 2014. Unum U.S sales increased by 25% for the quarter and 21% for the full year, with strong results across all product areas and all sectors of the markets we serve. Likewise the Colonial Life, sales this quarter were also strong, increasing 15.7% for the quarter and 11.6% for the full year, again with solid performance across all market segments. And finally, Unum UK sales continued to rebound this quarter, increasing 27.8% for the quarter in local currency.","These solid results across all three of our businesses reflects the strength of our competitive position in our markets and today\u2019s generally more favorable conditions. Second, these strong sales trends over the past few quarters, combined with improved persistency in most of our business lines and our ongoing focus on managing renewals in our in-force block, has resulted in accelerated premium growth. For all of our core business segments combined, premium income grew by 5.7%, the strongest we\u2019ve seen in several years and each business contributed. Unum US premiums grew 5.8%, Colonial Life increased 4.2% and Unum UK increased 10.5% in local currency. This growth has not come from any meaningful economic recovery, but instead is primarily the result of adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers.","And finally, we continue to see strong, stable operating margins and returns in our core business segments. These results help us maintain the financial flexibility needed to both support our business needs, including support the growth we\u2019re having, while also returning capital to our shareholders. Our primary challenge and one faced by all those in our industry is present low interest rate environment, which we don\u2019t expect to abate anytime soon. This quarter we took steps necessary to manage through this environment, both with the Closed Block LPC reserve actions, as well as the new claim reserve discount rated adjustment in our Unum US LTD business. I would add that we do this from a position of strength, with industry leading operating margin and significant financial flexibility. ","Before I turn the call over to Rick, I wanted to take a moment to comment on the release issued yesterday announcing the leadership changes here at Unum. After 12 of the absolute best years of my life serving as the CEO of this company, I\u2019ve announced that I will be retiring at this year\u2019s annual meeting. This is something that we all are well prepared for. The board and leadership team has spent considerable amount of time on succession planning over the last five to six years. I'm very pleased that Rick McKenney, who as you know is our CFO and internally chairs our operating committee, will become president and join our board, April 1st and will succeed me as CEO at our annual meeting in May. And Jack McGarry, currently president and CEO of our Closed Block, will succeed Rick as CFO on April 1st and we have an excellent plan in place to fill Jack\u2019s current role as head of the Closed Block, which obviously remains a critical area of focus for the company. ","The board and I have great confidence in Rick, Jack and our whole team and I can assure you that we won\u2019t miss a beat. It will be a very smooth transition and I step back from active management knowing that Unum is in good hands and poised for even better things ahead. Now, to me, the board asked me to continue as part of the board for the next two years and to assume the chairman\u2019s role at the annual meeting. My focus will be on fulfilling my new role as chairman and helping to assure we have continuity at both the board and management levels. ","Now I'm happy to answer any questions you have here, but for now let\u2019s get back to the discussion of our strong fourth quarter and full year results and for that I\u2019ll turn things back over to Rick.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Tom and thanks for the comments and I very much look forward to the opportunity. As far as our investors are concerned, I expect a very smooth transition. You can also expect continuation of the execution on the strategy which you have become accustomed to with Unum, which is one of disciplined growth. ","Let me turn back to our discussion on what was a very good quarter. I\u2019ll start first with Unum US, where in total fourth quarter operating earnings declined by 2.2% to $212.4 million, with favorable premium growth that Tom mentioned offset by lower net investment income and our change in discount rate that we talked about. The overall benefit ratio for the segment was stable at 71.3%, which we will dissect by each business line. ","Operating income in our group disability business declined to $66.7 million from $68.9 million a year ago. Premium income increased by 5.7% on strong sales and improved persistency. While the benefit ratio increased to 83.7% in the quarter, from 83.2% a year ago and 82.1% in the third quarter. As we indicated at our investor meeting in December, we reduced the new claim reserve discount rate in our LTD line in the fourth quarter by 50 basis points, causing a reduction in operating earnings of $6.6 million and elevating the benefit ratio by 1.2%. ","Clearly, today\u2019s low interest rate environment was the driver of this decision and is also the driver of the lower net investment income as the portfolio yield continues to decline, given the lower new money investment yields. While the impact of lower yields was offset somewhat by higher miscellaneous net investment income this quarter, the interest rate environment continues to create ongoing pressures. As we had discussed previously, we managed this impact by gradually reprising our in-force business through the renewal process, which we\u2019ll continue to do in 2015 and also through pricing adjustments to new business. From an underlying risk perspective, we did experience slightly higher claim size in the fourth quarter that was consistent with our longer term expectations and experience. ","Group Life and AD&D results also declined slightly year-over-year. Premium income growth continues to accelerate, increasing 6.7% in the fourth quarter, but the benefit ratio was slightly higher at 7.8% compared to 70% in both a year ago and previous quarters. ","In the supplemental and voluntary lines, operating earnings were relatively flat at $85.3 million, compared to $85.8 million a year ago. Premium income increased 5% while risk trends in both lines were generally stable. Overall, despite the pressure from lower investment income and the discount rate adjustment, it was a solid quarter for the Unum US segment, with operating ROE remaining in the 13% to 14% range, well above industry averages in the group business. ","Looking at Unum UK, operating earnings were \u00a324.1 million for the fourth quarter, up almost 9% from the year ago quarter. Our risk results were solid in both the Group Disability and Group Life business, which helped the benefit ratio improve to 68.9% this quarter, compared to 73% in the year ago quarter. The margins remain in very good shape for Unum UK, which generated an operating ROE of slightly over 18% for the year. ","Colonial Life continued to generate strong, consistent results with operating earnings increasing 7.1% in the fourth quarter to $74.3 million. Claim experience remained generally stable with the benefit ration at 52.3% for the fourth quarter, compared to 52.4% in the year ago quarter. Net investment income benefited from favorable miscellaneous net investment income in the quarter. The underlying profitability of Colonial Life remains excellent, producing an operating ROE in the 16% to 17% range for both the fourth quarter and full year. ","Rounding out the enterprise with the Closed Block; with the completion of our reserve review and long-term care, we booked a reserve strengthening in line with the expectations we provided at our investor meeting in December. The addition to GAAP reserves was $698 million or $454 million after tax. The assumptions behind the change are consistent with what we discussed at our meeting back in December, with the net effect of the charge largely reflecting our expectation that interest rates will remain low over the next four to five years before gradually returning to more historic levels. In addition, the statutory impact from our year end LTC reserve work for $67 million. This is included in our capital position at year end 2014 and reflected on our 2015 capital plans. Excluded in the impact of the reserve charge, operating earnings for the Closed Block were $30 million in the quarter, compared to $26.8 million in the year ago quarter. ","Risk results were generally in line with our long-term expectations. In the LT block, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 89.6% for the fourth quarter, towards the higher end of our 85% to 90% range due to unfavorable mortality that we saw in the quarter. For the full year 2014, the interest adjusted benefit ratio for long-term care was 85.9%, reflecting the more favorable results we experienced in the block earlier in the year. ","In the Closed Disability block, we saw much better performance in the fourth quarter, primarily from lower claim incidents after experiencing a higher level of volatility than normal in previous quarters, with the interest adjusted benefit ratio at 81% for the fourth quarter and 83.6% for the full year 2014. ","I\u2019ll move now to our sales and growth trends across the company. As Tom highlighted in his remarks, we are very pleased with the results this quarter and for the full year. In Unum US, total sales increased by 25% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year, a very strong set of results. The growth was well balanced between growth in the core group market under 2000 employees, which increased by 23% this quarter, and our large case business which increased by almost 35%. ","It\u2019s important to note that the bulk of our large case growth came from existing customer relationships, where our understanding of the case is much better. The growth was also well balanced by product lines, with LTD sales increasing 39% on strong growth in the core market segment, Short-Term Disability increasing 10% and Group life and AD&D increasing by almost 27% on opportunistic sales in the large case market, primarily to existing customers. ","In addition, sales in Voluntary Benefits grew by 21% and by 3% in the individual disability line. In addition to the strong sales momentum, our persistency for Unum US remains very encouraging, increasing to 90.5% for our group benefit lines, which include long-term disability, short-term disability and life and for the full year 2014, from 87.7% from the full year of 2013. ","The net results, combined with our ongoing renewal pricing strategy, generated premium growth for Unum US this quarter of 5.8%m the strongest rate of growth in several years. I\u2019d also emphasize Tom\u2019s comments that we continue to see only slight improvements to premium growth from the economy and employment trends. ","Likewise the Colonial Life, we again had very good sales results in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by 15.7%, primarily driven by growth in the core commercial and public sector markets. Full year 2014 sales increased by 11.6%, the strongest annual rate of growth since 1990. New and existing account sales growth were both strong as we focused on recruiting and the development of quality sales reps, along with continually emphasizing reworking our existing account base. ","Persistency for Colonial Life primary product lines was stable to slightly higher for the year, helping to drive overall premium growth in the fourth quarter of 4.2%, the highest quarterly rate since 2012. ","Finally, in the UK, sales increased by almost 28% in the fourth quarter, following an increase of 15% in the third quarter. Group Disability sales continued to build momentum, while our group life sales are re-emerging off of low results while we were repositioning that business for better profitability. Also, we are seeing much better levels of persistency in 2014. Persistency for Group Disability improving to 90.1% from 82.2% the year before and persistency in the life block improving to 76% from 66.7% the year before. ","Overall, a very strong quarter and encouraging quarter for our growth rate in our core business segments. And importantly, we are also happy with the pricing we\u2019re getting on the business that we are selling today. As I said earlier, we are continuing to see some evidence of improved topline growth from better employment and economic trends. However, that benefit does not appear to be accelerating. ","My comments on our investment results mirror my comments from the past several quarters; that is continuous solid asset quality for the portfolio, but continued declines in our portfolio yield as new money investment opportunities remain difficult. While we remain disciplined in our asset selection, we also remain disciplined in balancing the decisions we make on discount rate changes and associated pricing actions. Our move this quarter with our long term disability business reflects that disciple as we put in place a 50 basis point reduction with an eye towards maintaining a healthy interest margin in new reserves. ","Looking at capital management, we estimate that the weighted average risked based capital ratio for our traditional US life insurance companies, finished 2014 at just over 100%, and our holding company cash and marketable securities was $575 million. This comes from statutory operating earnings of $680 million for 2014 that are within our range of expectations. ","Wrapping up, I want to affirm our 2015 outlook for growth and operating earnings per share in a range of 2% to 5%. I wouldn\u2019t say that with the sharp move down in rates we\u2019ve seen since our outlook meeting, it would pressure us to the lower end of that range, but we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out in the coming month. Also in closing, I'd like to remind you that as of January 1, we\u2019ve adopting new accounting standards for investments and qualified affordable housing projects, which will reduce earnings by $0.04 in both 2014 and 2013 restated. We\u2019ll post the details on our website by next week. Overall it summarizes a very good quarter with an improving topline. ","Let me turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.","Tom Watjen","Thanks Rick. Before we move to your questions, I\u2019ll close by just repeating that we\u2019re very pleased with our overall results this quarter and for 2014. Our strong sales persistency and premium growth, along with stable risk experience, set us up well for the future. Without question, the current level of interest rate is challenging, but we are confident that we are taking the necessary steps to manage effectively in this environment. Our focus hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to profitably grow our business to maintain strong margins through our disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management and to generate capital which we can continue to use to support the needs of our business, including investing where necessarily to support growth, but also obviously continue to return capital to our shareholders. ","Now this completes our prepared remarks and Debbie, let\u2019s move to the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Good mooring everybody. Congratulations, Tom and everybody. I want to talk about \u2013 I guess probably, Rick I should probably know this, but in the statutory operating earnings that you show and net earnings in your capital, is Unum included in there?","Rick McKenney","Yes, First Unum is included in there.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay, so my understanding, in the investor day, you talked about $150 million stat charge for First Unum for LTC reserves. I think came out a little bit bigger. How do you get to $149 million that came to operations with that kind of stat charge in First Unum?","Tom Watjen","Yeah. Actually the stat charge that we have in First Unum is a direct move to capital. So it doesn\u2019t flow through the operating earnings that you\u2019d see in First Unum .Although it is included in those results, that actually movement in reserves flowed straight through the capital line.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. And then following up the non-First Unum stat charge, the $57 million, it was my impression I think from the investor day that a stat charge was unlikely and that there was significant margin if interest rates stayed where they were for a long time. Do we take away from this that that\u2019s not the case?","Tom Watjen","Jack, you want to take that one up?","Jack McGarry","Yeah. We talked about it on investor day that this was largely a GAAP charge. As we work through and settled all the reserved numbers across the difference entities, this charge emerged. My view is it really doesn\u2019t change anything we said at investor day. We are still very comfortable with our GAAP reserves. We still have a decent margin between our GAAP and stat reserves. All these charges, First Unum and the $57million were built into our capital plans for 2015 and so were reflected in our estimates for share buyback and free cash flow generation.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. Jack, one more if I may on this topic and then I'll turn it over. The $57 million, was that claims reserves or ALR?","Jack McGarry","It was both.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","It was both. Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Good morning and congratulations from us as well to everyone that transitioned. I just want -- I had a couple of questions on that last night. Can you give us some perspective on why announce the transition now? I know it wasn\u2019t related to the fourth quarter charge, but if you just clarify that, it would be helpful.","Tom Watjen","Yeah, and I do run the risk, Jay of over answering a little bit here because I want to step you back a little bit. We as a company have spent an awful a lot of time on leadership development and succession planning actually for a number of years. And not just the management team, but obviously the board has been very heavily engaged in that process and while it\u2019s maybe not glamorous work, it's essential if you are going to have good continuity and continue to maintain the principles that are important to the company, which we believe strongly in. In fact, actually if you look back over the last couple of investor meetings, you would have seen windows into our thought process back in 2013 as you may recall. ","Kevin McCarthy has announced his retirement. We are going through a good, smooth transition of that responsibility to Mike Simonds. This past year we talked about Randy Horn stepping out of the Colonial C.E.O. position and a smooth transition to Tim Arnold. And so I guess my point is this has been a continuum of work that we as a management team and a board has done. And obviously over the years the succession of the C.E.O. has to be part of the discussion with the board as well. In this case it wasn\u2019t about age or health obviously. It really was more about when it just felt right. And just the three things I think that were important in my mind is when it just felt right were number one, feeling good about the leadership team and having a leadership team in play that has plenty of runway still ahead and they can run this business very effectively for the next five to 10 plus years. Obviously we feel very strongly that\u2019s the case.","The second thing is where the company actually is on a good trajectory and not just one quarter or one year, but an extended period of time of solid performance. And I think some of us feel very strongly that\u2019s been the case. But then lastly is how do you make the appropriate exit after having been in the role for 12 years? And that\u2019s where I think being able to find some way to stay connected to my board activity was a part of that discussion. I think the point was this is a continuum. It\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been heavy engaged in now for five or six years. And so there\u2019s nothing magic about this particular day other than feeling as though all the stars are properly aligned. Again I feel very good about what we announced yesterday. And as we all said in our comments, we are going to have a very smooth transition of leadership.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital ","Thank you for that. Okay. On the topic of fourth quarter, sales growth again was particularly strong year over year. I'm just wondering if your 2015 sales growth outlook might prove conservative if any of that momentum continues into this year.","Tom Watjen","It might be good to go business by business if we could actually, Jay because obviously the fundamental of each business is different a little bit. But maybe, Mike maybe just speak to Unum US sales outlook.","Michael Simonds","Yeah. I think the bottom line, quick answer, Jay is I think that the guidance is still a good guidance. We had a line of sight to what the pipeline for fourth quarter looked like when we established that. So I don\u2019t see the big changes there. Just as a quick refresher, we do anticipate good, solid 6% to 8% sales growth across most of our segments, in particular the core market group insurance segment and our long term benefits segment. The offset to that to a degree is the large case market. We had a very good year in 2014, but we do view that as an opportunistic place to write business.","We saw rates harden a bit as some competitors needed to re-price their books. We certainly have the capacity and the desire to repeat 2014 in the large case market if we can do so within our disciplined pricing parameters, though our business plan isn\u2019t built around that. We\u2019re anticipating a bit of a decline to the tune of about10% and the net is that sales guidance around 2% to 4%, which I think still holds true. We feel good about what we bring to market. It\u2019s really more where is the market itself going to be? And that\u2019s a little bit of a wild card. ","Tom Watjen","Tim, you want to touch on the Colonial Life?","Tim Arnold","Sure. Yeah, we feel very good about the results when we finished last year. As Rick mentioned it's the highest growth rate in the company since 1990. With the rate at the market conditions overall, we feel good about our sales team. We feel good about the value prop that we bring to the market and the receptivity there. Good progress across all of our market segments, but we still feel comfortable with the range we\u2019ve given before, 6% to 8% on the sales side.","Tom Watjen","And Peter, just last on the UK?","Peter O\u2019Donnell","Similar to Mike really, I think in terms of 2014, we actually outperformed a little bit in the fourth quarter. We had a large one off transaction which gave a nice clean through a round the claims buyout which gave us a bit of a following win for that fourth quarter. So that was a little better than we expected. When I look at the sales outlook, we had 7% to 9% in 2015. Still looking at that, I think that\u2019s still challenging particularly given the interest rate environment where our discipline and what we stand for is we will continue to put rate through and it depends on the competitor reaction on that. But How I feel that\u2019s good today.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital","Thanks so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next Suneet Kamath with UBS","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Good morning. Again our congratulations as well to the team. Just wanted to go back to the Unum US LTD sales growth, I think it was 25%. I know you guys manage the pricing of new business relative to the discount rate. But I just wanted to confirm that the discount rate adjustment that you are making here in the fourth quarter, was that already reflected in the pricing that you put out to achieve this 25% sales growth rate?","Tom Watjen","Mike?","Michael Simonds","Yeah. So we would -- if you think about the sales cycle, it depends on the market segment that you\u2019re in, but if you\u2019re in group insurance you think about the sales cycle in a three months range. Where we see interest rates three to six months back, that\u2019s where sales are coming on. But then we feel actually very good and Rick made it in the opening statements. We feel very good about the pricing level of new business that\u2019s coming on. But just as Peter was saying as we look forward into 2015 and we talked about this in our guidance meeting, we are going to move new business rates up. ","We have been thinking low to mid and I think probably mid is better in terms of where you\u2019ve been at with interest rates over the period of time since the end of last year. Again feel good about the business that\u2019s coming on. We\u2019ll move it up again and it will depend a bit on the market and the market conditions as how much that slows the sales growth. But again we feel pretty good about where we are at and the ability to price new business and to renew business over the next year or two to where interest rates are.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay, thanks. And then I guess on Group disability and the loss ratio, I think there was a comment in the prepared remarks about seeing higher claims maybe relative to the year ago. I just want to get some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, where it came from and whether or not you expect that will persist going forward","Tom Watjen","Mike?","Michael Simonds","Yes, sure. We saw a little bit of volatility in the average size of new claims, but actually pretty much within the long term expectations. Other key factors submitted incidents bounced around a little bit quarter to quarter, but paid incidents has been very steady. And then just recovery performance offsets have been rock solid. I'd say, overall we were actually pretty happy with that continued consistency out of the risk line for LTD.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay and then just the last one for me on your capital generation model, I guess for Rick or Jack. If sales are at a level that\u2019s persisting here, the $150 million of capital uses that you guys talk about between interest expense and growth funding, should we still expect that to be a pretty good number at these sales levels or could there be some upward pressure in terms of capital requirements if growth remains strong?","Rick McKenney","Thanks, it's Rick. Actually it's a very good question and we are seeing sales results. And I\u2019d go back to the some of the things we talked about from an overall capital perspective. The first place we want to put our capital is back in our business. We are doing that and I think that we\u2019re very happy about the premium growth. I would tell you that where we sit today, we don\u2019t see a noticeable difference in term of how that impacts the capital plan. We continue to grow at these type of rates and you\u2019ve heard that we are a little bit more metered. As we look out over the course of the year, you might start seeing some of that. But that\u2019s a situation that we want to have and actually put more capital right back into our business. But as we sit here today, I don\u2019t think that alters our capital plans.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning and congratulation, Tom. The voluntary benefits, the sales there are quite strong. How does that fit in or is there a connection with the economy pricking up perhaps a little bit, a little more flexibility in terms of insurance arrangements at a lot of small businesses. Is that momentum going to continue in 2015?","Tom Watjen","As you know, Mark, we\u2019ve got two windows into that business. And maybe Mike talk to the Unum U.S perspective and then Tim following on the Colonial Life piece.","Michael Simonds","Yes, sure. Thanks Mark for the question. On voluntary, we are seeing a little bit of tailwind on a couple of fronts. We\u2019ve seen participation at the plan level improved just a bit. I wouldn\u2019t say dramatically, but certainly as consumers have a little bit more disposable income as the economy improves, oil prices are a bit lower, that helps us. We are seeing good cross selling into our existing group insurance line. That\u2019s been a big driver to expanding voluntary through those relationships. And then new clients coming on to the voluntary benefits line. Sales were up about21% in the quarter. It was a good year. Overall I\u2019d say the pipeline looks good. That will be one of our faster growing businesses within that 3% to 4% range we talked about.","Tim Arnold","For Colonial Life, we are seeing improvement in the economy coming through in our sales results, especially in the small case market. We believe that small businesses are beginning to rebound a bit with hiring in the less than 500 life segment last quarter. Our sales growth was north of 22%. And so we are seeing more traction in that marketplace. We are also seeing a continued need for the products that we manufacture based on changes happening in the medical industry. High deductibles create a need for a lot of our products. And we also believe that our mission to protect America\u2019s workers is resonating in the field. We feel good about the marketplace and the momentum.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I think you made the comment and this is more macro, some evidence of better underlying natural growth, but not accelerating. Anything you want expand on that?","Tom Watjen","I was going to say, Mark from the comments we did say that. So you\u2019re thinking that the one percentage type of range, maybe even a little bit under that. We haven\u2019t seen it accelerating. It\u2019s been consistent. Mike, if you could add to that in terms of the natural growth.","Michael Simonds","Yeah. The two levers for us in coverage payroll are the number of employees going up and then it\u2019s salary that is covered for disability and life insurance that can be leveraged off of income. And as Rick said, we\u2019ve seen probably a little bit more on the number employed. We\u2019ve seen a little bit weaker in terms of the growth on income.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","On normal times that should be what, 3% maybe?","Michael Simonds","Yeah. We would see 2%, somewhere ranging around that, up or down a little bit.","Mark Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bob Glasspiegel with Janney Capital.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ","Good morning and congratulations to all as well. When you lowered your discount rates, interest rates were probably 40, 50 basis points higher than they are today. So, if we got the 10 year staying where it is, or 30 year, whatever rate that you look at that have come down from when you set the discount rate for this year, should we look for a headwind going into 2016?","Tom Watjen","Rick, you want to take that?","Rick McKenney","Yeah, certainly, Bob. What I would actually say is and that\u2019s what I was trying to articulate around our overall view o\\in the earnings, I think as interest rates stay here relative to what we talked to you about in December, there are headwinds and we view them as that. And so those are things that we will have to evaluate as we get out on the year because what we reflected in December certainly was the current environment, which was about 50 basis points different than it is today. We will have to evaluate that as we get out towards the back half of the year.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ","So it would be potentially you might do the discount rate again during the course of the year if rates stay where they are or you wait for the renewals, there\u2019s not much you can do over the year?","Rick McKenney","I think that\u2019s going to get an answer as we go through the year. It\u2019s still pretty early, Bob and we just got through that process of going through the discount rate adjustments. So it\u2019s early to speculate on what we are going to do in the back half of the year.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ","But I\u2019m saying you do have flexibility to adjust pricing midyear as well if you had to?","Michael Simonds","Bob, this is Mike. Absolutely. And so we actually -- we looked at it on a semiannual basis and frankly a little bit even more frequent than that on tactical changes. So that\u2019s certainly implied.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ","And the pound is also a headwind as well after being a helpful item for last year. Is that sort of baked into your accounts and how much of penalty for currency from UK do you see?","Tom Watjen","Rick, do you want to touch that?","Rick McKenney","Yeah. So we have seen that headwind. So we often talk about our results for the UK on a pound basis because it\u2019s hard to chase around the currency level. But as we roll that through in our EPS and what we\u2019ve factored in going into next year, is a level of 155 on the rate, which I think we are a little bit lower than that as we sit in today. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve factored into our forward look.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ","So slight headwind if it stays at 152?","Rick McKenney","Yes, slight.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Capital ","Okay. Got you, thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Jimmy Buhler with J.P Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","So you reported fairly strong sales across the board, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just competitive conditions in the US disability market as you\u2019ve gone through the January renewals and what you\u2019ve seen competitors do in terms of pricing.","Tom Watjen","Mike?","Michael Simonds","Yeah, sure. So it certainly remains a competitive landscape and I think that\u2019s true in group insurance and voluntary benefits as well. We still certainly see some players out there that are looking to grow share or in some cases actually recover some share using price as a lever, but on balance. And this is similar to what we would have talked about over the last couple of quarters. We have seen, I would say a gradual hardening in rates in the market. We\u2019ve got some sizeable players that are looking to improve the margins on their books and get their ROEs up from where we think industry averages are sort of in the mid-single digits. On balance it\u2019s actually been a more favorable environment, a completive one, but a bit more favorable.","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","And then on margins, your results have been fairly stable the last several years. But as the economy recovers, are you seeing any improvement in claims incidence trends, or recovery trends, what is your expectations are there?","Michael Simonds","I\u2019d say we work pretty hard to diversify the book. And heading into the downturn of the economic cycle, we begin to see a deterioration in our claim incidents, in recovery rates offsets. And so I think as things begin to improve albeit very gradually, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate a big swing towards a more favorable outcome. Consistency is probably the best guess,","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","Okay, and then just lastly a cross-section on your EPS guidance. I think you mentioned you are more comfortable with the low end of the 2% to 5% range given the environment. So I was wondering, are you -- when you talk about growth, are you talking off of the 355 for 2014 that you reported, or the lower number given the change in accounting for low income housing credits?","Rick McKenney","Yeah, it\u2019s actually -- Jim, when you look at that, it\u2019s actually going to be off of the adjusted number that we are looking at, but that\u2019s going to be re-casted for 2014. So we\u2019ll have that \u2026","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","You\u2019ll still be around 351 you are guessing?","Rick McKenney","Yes. So it\u2019s going to be the $0.04 cents so it should be roughly 351. We\u2019ll have that out there shortly for you.","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Good morning and congratulations as well from us here at Deutsche. So a couple of quick questions here. What took up the expense ratio across all the core business segments this quarter?","Tom Watjen","Rick.","Rick McKenney","Actually, it\u2019s a good news story Yaron when you look at it. Most of that is compensation given the higher sales levels that we saw. So that\u2019s one of those expense lines that we don\u2019t mind paying out there. We\u2019d like to see that as part of our higher sales.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then could you quantify the variable or miscellaneous investment income, what kind of impacted that?","Rick McKenney","Certainly. I actually talked about that across a couple of our lines. Just to give you a sense of that. We run roughly in the $15 million a quarter range, at least we have over the last several years. And so this quarter we actually saw an uptick of that in the $7 million, $8 million range, something like that. What I\u2019d remind you, last quarter we saw a down tick of $7 million, $8 million. It varies around that $15 million level. We did see a higher level in the quarter. Maybe a little bit north of that $8 million that I mentioned, but it\u2019s \u2013 we factored it through our results and we\u2019re just going to wait that volatility to go through, but nothing new to note there.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then one final one and I apologize if I missed this, but of the $700 million GAAP preserve strengthening in long-term care, how much of that was interest rate related?","Michael Simonds","The $700 million was virtually all interest rate related. There were some pluses and minuses on the liability side. Some of those, they went in opposite directions. They were largely offset. I think you can pretty much assume all of that is an interest rate charge.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Randy Binner with FBR Capital markets.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Hey, morning. Congrats too on the long term carry on Unum. I just wanted to clean up a question I think from Steve Schwartz which was a kind of getting into the element of this charge that moved out of GAAP and into stat. I apologize if I missed it. I haven\u2019t been able to parse that out from the disclosures. Was there an element of stat charging? Can you remind us of what that was versus the GAAP items that have been discussed?","Rick McKenney","Maybe I'll take a shot of that, Randy. When you look at the $57 million that we recorded that I mentioned, these are a lot of moving pieces as we went through that reserve charge process. On the GAAP side we articulated it and as Jack just said, it's mostly interest rates. As you move around the different pieces as well, you can have some stat impact fall out of that. It\u2019s nothing that I would know more than the amount of movement that happened as part of that charge and the $57 million was very much contemplated as part of our overall capital results in 2014, our capital plans in 2015.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","All right and that 57 is all in the First Unum, the New York?","Tom Watjen","It's actually in multiple of entities. That\u2019s just part of the noise that came out of the process with the different entities that moved around.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, but similar to the rates. And then I think one of the topics that\u2019s been discussed in the past is kind of sizing the delta between the GAAP and the stat reserves or capital, either one. And the long term carrier, is that something you can update us on just to kind of think about what the potential risk would be if there was another review? And maybe help us understand what the process would be for another kind of comprehensive review on long term care given that rates are lower than when you went through the planning process on this?","Michael Simonds","So the stat-GAAP difference we\u2019re talking about it being in the several hundred million dollar range at the investor meeting. That\u2019s still applicable. That\u2019s where it is. I would say in general over the last several years, statutory reserves have grown faster than GAAP reserves. And so it's likely over the pursuing years that that would continue to grow. We looked at the interest rate charge. There\u2019s a long term charge. We said interest rates would stay low for the next four to five years and then revert to the mean. The view is it\u2019s more of how long that charge lasts given the current interest rate environment which has moved against us even since. But we still think it's a stable place. It has a lot of factors in it including where spreads are, opportunities in different asset classes and things. We are comfortable. We talked about biting off a three to five year horizon. We are still comfortable with that. Clearly the current interest rate environment pushes it towards the front of that as opposed to towards the back.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Erik Bass with Citigroup","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Hi. Thank you. One of the factors that I think you\u2019ve mentioned that\u2019s been driving sales is additional product sale to existing customers. I was just hoping you could quantify the impact there and maybe talk about how much further opportunity you see?","Tom Watjen","Mike?","Michael Simonds","Sure. So we see about north of 60%. And to give you a sense, actually we see in the large end of the market a number even north of that in terms of the percentage of our sales that comes from existing client relationships. That\u2019s important to us for three reason. One, because we understand the risk of this better. Two, it tends to come in more favorably priced because they know us and we tend to have a good service relationship. And three is each time that we add additional lines of business into our client relationship, it drives the stickiness of that account up a bit. ","So if you take 2015 as we talked about low interest rates, certainly a product like LTD, we are going to be in there at renewal time with modest increases. Our chances of placing those increases in the context of a broad relationship are significantly improved. It's really the key strategic driver for us. If you think about the runway, it\u2019s actually pretty substantial. So we average right around three products per existing client relationship and we would see a fully integrated client be more like six or seven different lines of coverage as you think about the different demographics within the employee base. We feel like we\u2019ve got a long room to continue to grow within that base.","Tom Watjen","Like you were saying, that\u2019s one of the variables I think you and your team are focused aggressively on. Other ones would be increased participation, but you can get pretty granular in terms of operational things that we are doing. And I think that\u2019s probably part of your game plan for 2015.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, it's a great point. So in addition to additional benefit offered as part of the plan, you actually look at where you have employee contribute benefits or voluntary benefits in place and what\u2019s the participation level. Even without the additional cross sell, you can drive premium growth and improve the risk outcome that you get a better spread as you drive that participation up of that as well.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thank. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could ask one follow up on long term care. Just hoping you could go into a little bit more detail on the adjustments you made for mortality and morbidity. And I realize in total that was offset I think by assuming the re-rates that you\u2019ve achieved, but if you could just talk about the dynamics you\u2019re seeing there and how much of the adjustments you made are based on actually claims experience?","Jack McGarry","I would say that the vest major of our current assumptions are based on our own calms experience. We were informed by society studies. We had bought some risk guidelines from consultants. And so we measured our own experience against those, but we did look at every assumption, and I would say the vast majority of those assumptions are based on our own experience. ","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Got it, but is it correct to read that both mortality and morbidity in isolation were slightly negative versus prior assumptions?","Jack McGarry","Not necessarily actually. Things went in different directions within there, but they offset.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thanks. I guess just last on that, you\u2019ve given sensitivity to GAAP reserves for interest rates. Is there anything similar you can provide for either mortality of morbidity such as what a 1% change in either of those factors would mean for the GAAP reserve?","Jack McGarry","Yeah. It's clearly that the long term assumptions, so there is sensitivity. But I don\u2019t have a rule of thumb on 1% change.","Erik Bass \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Kruger with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Good morning. Congrats to everyone from us as well. On I guess back to the sales growth in Unum US, can you give us some underlying color on I guess if you think you\u2019re -- in general you\u2019re just the market is growing at a substantially higher level than it was or do you think it's more attributable to you guys gaining market share?","Tom Watjen","Mike?","Michael Simonds","Thanks, Ryan. Time will tell a little bit because the industry reports lag obviously the company level report. It will take a little bit of time to actually see what happens with the market. I\u2019d say I'm actually encouraged a couple of points on that front. One, we had seen a slowdown in the smallest end of the market and Tim alluded to this from a Colonial Life perspective as well. But we\u2019ve seen a persistent drag in the less than 100 employee market and that over the last couple of quarters has really started to come back. ","In fact we saw sales over 30% in that less than 100 life group insurance market. Those are often new lines that an employer is adding for the first time. So you\u2019re starting to see a little bit market growth on that front. The second component is we are seeing the addition of additional lines on the voluntary front as health plans, as consumers are buying down health coverage through higher deductible plans. That leaves gaps. And so we are taking what might be a traditional life in the facility client and you\u2019re in there with accident insurance and other supplemental health products. And that\u2019s almost always industry growth versus the swapping of business amongst carriers.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Got it, thanks. And then if I could one on long term care. Can you give us, or remind us what level of future premium rate increases that you guys are projecting within your long term care reserves?","Rick McKenney","We don\u2019t have an exact number for you. I would tell you as we did at the investor meeting that we are basing that level on final rate increases. And so the assumption we have going forward is based on filings that we\u2019ve already made related to rate increases. The assumption is also assuming that we get results on currently filed rate increases that are largely consistent with the results we\u2019ve had on previously filed rate increases.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. So just to be clear, your reserves do not to assume any additional rate increases beyond what you\u2019ve already file?","Rick McKenney","No.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Good morning and congrats Tom. Just had a question about how we should be thinking about cash flow generation if rates remain low here. The $220 million or some of charges if we add up the New York sub and fair wind, is that a number that we should expect to be recurring if rates remain at current levels and if you guys bake that into your capital plan, i.e. can you still do at least the low end of your buyback assumption even if rates remain low?","Tom Watjen","Tom, to answer that I think most succinctly would be to say that we\u2019ve factored in the current environment into all of our plans. So as we\u2019ve updated things and even as I talked about, some of the pressure we are seeing in the range, inclusive of our capital plans reflect what we\u2019re seeing out there today.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","But can we assume though, Rick, that we would see similar levels greater or less of that we\u2019ll call it $200 million or so cumulative for LPC on a stat basis. Is that a number that we should be thinking about as recurring or is there a reason to think that that might abate or change?","Rick McKenney","No, I actually expect that would be much lower as we get out towards the end of the year because a lot of what actually came out of what you saw in those results, both the 57 I mentioned as well as the First Unum moves, had to do with the re-shaping that we did over our overall reserves. And so I think interest rates their movement down outwards would be less impactful in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in First Unum and wouldn\u2019t expect things to recur in our other entities as well.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning Tom. Thanks very much. I just wanted to clarify, just to get an understanding of the difference between the 57 and what's going in your New York Company. Should I think of those two numbers, one a charge that went through your statutory income statement and one that I gather from an earlier response that went to surplus? Should I think of those two charges as independent?","Tom Watjen","Jack?","Jack McGarry","I'm not sure they are independent. In fact they all came out of the same reserve review, but the charge in New York was split. So a piece of it went through the equity line and a smaller piece in showed up in statutory earnings. ","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. My follow-up question, my second question, not a follow up question, but a separate question relates to your ability to increases prices and the speed with which you can do it. My understanding is that this is not like many businesses in the sense that once you decide that you need a price increase, my understanding is you can\u2019t do it the next day. You have to notify your sales people. You have to notify the customers. You have to notify your intermediaries and the brokers and then maybe, I'm not sure, maybe you can answer as part of, can you include this as part of your response there, maybe regulatory things that you need to do. There may be IP issues that you need to deal with from a price increase. My question, what's involved and how long does it take to raise process once it becomes apparent they need it?","Tom Watjen","Just to clarify Eric, are you talking about the group business or you are talking about the long term care business or both actually?","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","I'm really talking about group disability. ","Tom Watjen","Group disability, okay. Mike, maybe walk through just the pricing cycle processes actually because it's a great question.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, it's a really good question. I think it\u2019s actually sometimes a little misunderstood because I think the ability to place [injuries] within your in-force block is actually a competence that has to be built over time. And I think you actually nailed a number of the key pieces. First you have to understand within all the cells that make up a pretty diverse block of business, where do you want those increases to hit and at what level? So there is a fair amount of work that goes into that. But actually the real work comes once you\u2019ve decided where those increases are going to hit and it starts with as you said communication and the ability to effectively communicate with brokers and consultants and ultimately to that end, clients. You want to actually show up with not just a take it or leave it, but you want to have a set of options around changes that they could be making in their plan design that could offset some of those increases so the net is a profit improvement. But you\u2019re given the clients some options to work with. ","You want to have clear metrics in place so that you understand the balance between placing increases at various levels and risk of termination. And then you want to have incentives lined up. You need to have, as you put a lot of work into ensuring that we\u2019ve got a field force that is properly motivated and understands the importance of placing renewals and having a healthy book of business going forward. It takes some amount of work to build the confidence. I\u2019d say, we look at it. We go through every case, say over 500 employees. Every year that it\u2019s not in a rate guarantee, it\u2019s getting looked at and assessed. In the core business under say 500 lives there\u2019s a lot more transactions there. We are going to go through somewhere between 25% and a third of those cases every year. But you get a sense from the scale of the program.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","But as far as new business is concerned, interest rates are now what, 40, 50 basis points lower than they were just a few weeks ago. It\u2019s apparent I think that you need price increases on new business relative to what you were thinking about charging on new business just again two months ago. How long will it be before you can institute price increases on new business relative to what you had planned just a couple of months ago to charge on new business?","Michael Simonds","Yeah. You can move actually pretty quickly because you have underwriting guidelines in place that give you some flexibility. So what you do is you need to shoot towards the upper end of that range and effectively you\u2019re placing some increase there. And then twice a year we go through a thorough review of all of our manual files rates and make adjustments. And so again, it\u2019s not a long cycle to think about in terms of pretty quickly on underwritten business and actually getting to the full block within six months. ","Tom Watjen","And Mike, I think Eric referenced in his question too regulatory involvement. That\u2019s not necessarily the case I don\u2019t think in the group piece as you think about what\u2019s needed to be responsive to the market.","Michael Simonds","Yeah. Certainly it\u2019s a big compare and contrast to individual products of the long-term care business where it is much more the regulatory environment is the driver. Within group insurance you\u2019ve got much more discretion in typically ranges that you can operate within.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on the existing sales to current clients. Is there a general pattern of moving some specifics products lines where now they\u2019re say group LTD, the traditional entry way and then you\u2019ll see that flow through to other product lines or is it generally give and takes across the board?","Michael Simonds","I would say it is give and takes across the board. There is -- actually often there is a voluntary benefit relationship in place that we are bringing group insurance in or an employer paid component. Actually our multi life individual disability, which is disability income protection for higher earners tends to be a great place for us to do cross selling into those relationships as well. If you look at it in sum total, it comes from every direction, but certainly having a very large block of long-term disability that\u2019s the base that I\u2019d say most frequently we\u2019re cross selling into. And I\u2019d say most frequently we are cross selling voluntary benefits into those LTD relationships.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then one question on persistency, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the persistency that you reported for 2014, it doesn\u2019t account for any renewals that you may have lost January 1. I think you just quickly discussed the January 1 renewals and how those came through.","Michael Simonds","Yeah, sure. You\u2019re correct. So it\u2019s not reflected in that, but as we look forward and you would have seen premium guidance of growth in the 4% to 6% range for Unum US and that reflects on I think pretty strong continued persistency. We did 90.5%. That\u2019s a very high level, but certainly somewhere in that range which we feel really good about. ","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ken Billingsley with Compass Point. ","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","Good morning. One of the questions I think I heard the answer to if it was asked, have you disclosed what your new interest rate assumption is and what it was before? ","Rick McKenney","I think that\u2019s a broad question, Ken. I think what I would tell you is our assumptions in aggregate across the company would have been what we saw at investor day and they have come down now from that timeframe 40, 50 basis points. As you get to the different parts of the business, that\u2019s all reflected through. It will have different impacts in different areas, but I think the best way to look at it is we are reflective in our outlook for the year now based on what we see for current rates.","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","I guess another way to ask this and if you don\u2019t have an actual percentage, obviously the charge infers that you made some kind of adjustment. Can you talk about how many basis points adjustments you made from your original long-term expectations to where those expectations are now? Is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points change?","Rick McKenney","Yeah, I think you can back into it. The charge was a $700 million charge. It\u2019s largely attributable to interest rates. We\u2019d given prior guidance that 25 basis points change in the discount rate was worth about $400 million.","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","Okay. The other question I have is regarding the sales growth and what you saw this quarter and expectations going forward. You sound I'm positive. A lot of large brokers, even one today, talked about they\u2019re expanding their employee benefits footprint through M&A. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s impacting your future growth prospects? It sounds like a lot of the growth is coming from existing customers. But is there going to be an avenue maybe for even bigger growth in the latter half of 2015 into 2016 as some of these other distributors and brokers are committing to growing that part of their business?","Tom Watjen","Mike, maybe you can speak to the broker side, but also [indiscernible] also talk about the Colonial side of the distribution equation too because they are very different, but great dynamic. Mike?","Michael Simonds","Sure. Ken, we have seen that in consolidation that you are referring to. I would say it\u2019s been a dramatic acceleration, but a good steady increase in firms coming together. I think as they come together the rate we\u2019ll invest on scale and some of the capabilities that they need around compliance, advisory services, some of the technology components that they\u2019re bringing into employers to help them manage. Generally I don\u2019t see a huge impact for us. We tend to have a good, broad distribution, certainly strong relationships across all the major brokerage firms. But in general I would agree with your read that is that employee benefit in total. But then even outside of healthcare, I\u2019d say the focus amongst brokers and advisors towards things like voluntary benefits and financial protection products like we are in the business in, that level will have some focus and definitely increased the uncertainty around healthcare as well. But Tim is going to talk through that.","A \u2013 Tim Arnold","For Colonial Life, about 70% of our sales come from brokers. So 30% are on a direct basis. As we\u2019ve seen consolidation in the broker industry, we\u2019re beginning to see brokers migrating out of the really small end of the market and that gives us a huge opportunity to serve that marketplace on a direct basis. But we I guess 70% of our discussion with brokers we are consistently rated as one of the best businesses for brokers to do business with on the voluntary side. So it\u2019s still a very important marketplace for us, but increasingly see the opportunities to serve the small end on a direct bias.","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","And just say one point, causing a migration out of did you say the smaller accounts?","A \u2013 Tim Arnold","Yeah, especially the both 50 life market with the ACA middle marshal requirement and the impact that has on broker commissions. So we\u2019re beginning to see some migration out of that marketplace, especially as brokers consolidate.","Tom Watjen","Tim, that\u2019s why I see I think some good growth because your direct sales efforts are focused on that part of the marketplace where there's a void that\u2019s been created.","A \u2013 Tim Arnold","Absolutely. For last year in the less 700 life market we are up 23%. Very strong progress there and a real need in that marketplace too as brokers consider whether they can serve that marketplace on this. As we see some migration, those employees and employers in that segment still need advice. And so we are there to help them with that.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","And consolidation on either Unum US or with the Colonial Life has not \u2013 no one has been able to drive higher commissions or anything else to help \u2013 have you pay for obviously the compliance and technology that they\u2019re bringing to the customer.","Tom Watjen","No. We have definitely not seeing that.","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","Okay. And the last question, I may have dismissed comments at the beginning when Tom was talking about the chairman. I thought he was referring to himself for the next two years or was that in reference to Mr. Ryan?","Tom Watjen","No. I\u2019ll be staying on as chairman for two years actually, Ken. So again at the annual meeting I\u2019ll step up to the chairman role and stay on the board for two years. Our current chairman Bill Ryan will actually step into a lead director role until he retires at the annual meeting in 2016.","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","Okay. But your expectation is not to be on the board after two years or just not be chairman?","Tom Watjen","I think that\u2019s the thinking right now, yeah. But I think it\u2019s good governance. For a CEO to stick around at the board for too long I think is one of the things we very much don\u2019t want to do. I can serve in a very important role for a couple of years, both with the board and with management in terms of helping assure continuity. But I think right now we\u2019re thinking of it as a two year period.","Ken Billingsley \u2013 Compass Point","So I did hear that correctly. All right, well thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James for a follow up.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Hey again everybody. Just a quickie. Looking at the numbers versus my numbers and of course my numbers are estimates. I did notice that expense levels did seem kind of high. I was just wondering in general, Rick, if you can comment on where expense levels may be higher than normal because of the sales and changes in the deck rules that occurred in 2010 and what have you?","Rick McKenney","Yes Steven, let\u2019s come back to it. We actually see \u2013 our sales costs were higher. So I think growth you do see more sales out there and deck rule only have much to do with it because when we talk about our operating expense, we are not factoring the decking process into that. Good sales, pay a little bit more in expenses, that\u2019s a good history.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay, thanks.","End of Q&A","Tom Watjen","Thank you, Steven.

Rick?","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone.","The third quarter was another excellent for Unum with after tax operating income per share of $0.99, an increase of almost 9% over last year. For the first nine months of 2016 after tax operating income per shares also increased close to 9%. The performance exceeds the upper end of our outlook range for the year of 3% to 6% and is driven in large part by solid premium growth in Unum U.S., Unum U.K. and Colonial Life along with very consistent benefits experience.","I\u2019m very encouraged that we\u2019re delivering the strong results despite today\u2019s difficult business environment with historically low interest rates and more recently the sharp decline in the value of the British pound. The reason we\u2019re delivering these results begins with the leadership position we\u2019ve established in the employee and voluntary benefits marketplace over many years. These markets offer good opportunities for growth over the long term. And we believe that our longstanding and focus commitment to serving our customers and advisors sets us apart from the competition. Our industry leading expertise and our disciplined approach to the fundamental operations of our business have enabled us to grow our business with the high level of consistency and profitability. We\u2019ll cover these strategic points with even greater detail at our upcoming investor meeting in December.","This morning we will focus on the strong financial results we\u2019ve achieved in the third quarter as a result of an execution of this strategy. So, now let me move to provide a few highlights on the quarter. First, the premium growth we\u2019re generating on our core operation remains healthy at approximately 4%. This trend continues to be driven by strong persistency levels in all of our core business lines and the volume of sales we\u2019ve been generating over the last several years.","While new sale trends are currently challenging in the Unum U.S. markets due to competitive pricing conditions, we continue to see excellent sales trends at Colonial Life and experienced a strong level sales growth at Unum U.K. this year. Specifically Colonial Life sales grew by 9.3% this quarter and 12.7% for the year-to-date.","Next, I continue to be very pleased with the strong profit margins we\u2019re consistently generating in our core business segments. This demonstrates the discipline we employ in all aspects of our business including the pricing and underwriting of new business and the management of our enforced business relationships. All this helps to provide a good balance between producing top line growth and maintaining industry leading profit margins.","From the capital perspective these strong operating results have continued to produce a strong level of statutory earnings and capital which is the lifeblood of our financial flexibility. The third quarter was another excellent quarter for statutory earnings which increased 13% and now exceed $800 million for the trailing four quarters. This capital generation enables our capital deployment strategy which starts with the opportunity to grow our business both through the organic growth we\u2019re generating and the ability to capitalize upon attractive acquisition opportunities.","It also has resulted in delivering steady repurchases of our shares and annual dividend increases. On the acquisition side we closed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company during the third quarter providing the platform to grow what we believe will be a substantial dental business overtime. Dental is a good fit because it is a volume product that customers value. It is sold often at the workplace and as a voluntary product it fits well in our existing product portfolio and distribution channel.","Another indicator of our performance is the growth we\u2019ve seen in book value per share which for the third quarter is $40.33 an increase of 14% year-over-year. Book value excluding AOCI also increased 9.2% year-over-year to $38.39 at quarter end. So in summary, it\u2019s been a very strong first three quarters of 2016 as I said earlier, I believe the success is largely a result of our steadfast focus on disciplined execution of our business plan. This execution has multiple facets from underwriting and pricing to paying claims to helping people return to work, all the while serving our customers very well. The combination of both operating and markets provide good opportunities for growth and disciplined execution of our strategy leaves us very well positioned to deliver great value to our shareholders in the future.","So, with those highlights on an excellent third quarter I\u2019d ask Jack to cover our third quarter results in greater detail. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our third quarter results and now we want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we experienced in the quarter.","First, I\u2019m very encouraged by the composition of our after tax operating income per share growth of 8.8%, as after-tax operating income grew 3.7% over the year ago quarter and our share count declined by 4.9% due to our ongoing capital management initiatives. This continues the favorable trend of balanced growth to earnings growth and capital management activities we\u2019ve seen throughout 2016.","One of the primary drivers of our overall results this quarter was the performance of Unum U.S. Third quarter operating income was very strong at $231 million, an increase of 5.6% from the year ago quarter. Premium income growth continued its positive trend increasing 5.9% over the year ago quarter helped in par for the inclusion of our dental acquisition. The benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment improved to 69.4% in the third quarter compared to 69.8% in the year ago quarter with excellent results in the group disability line.","In addition our focus on disciplined expense management continued to contribute to the favorable operating results. The other expense ratio declined to 20.9% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the year ago quarter, the profitability of the Unum U.S. remains very strong with an operating ROE of 15% for the third quarter of 2016. Within the Unum U.S. segment operating income in our group disability business was exceptionally strong this quarter at $85.4 million, an increase of 20.6% over the last year.","Premium income increased 2.8% over the year ago quarter while pressure on net investment income continues as low new money yields pressure the portfolio yield. The benefit ratio was exceptional at 78.6% for the third quarter compared to 80.5% in the year ago quarter. This improvement in the loss ratio was driven by strong renewal results over the past couple of years and continues favorable in claim recovery trends. These results leave us well positioned to absorb any discount rate pressures that may arise from today\u2019s low interest rate environment while maintaining our group disability loss ratio and are expected 80% to 82% range.","Group Life and AD&D operating income declined to $53.4million for the third quarter down a 11.3% from the year ago quarter. Premium income grew 5.5% over the year ago quarter but the benefit ratio increased to 72.6% for the third quarter compared to 71% in the year ago quarter as a result of higher average claim size. Net investment income was negatively impacted by lower yields as well as lower asset levels resulting from reduced capital in the Group Life line.","Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines results are very strong at $92.2 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.1% over the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends remain very favorable particularly with the addition of the dental business increasing 12.1% in the quarter compared to last year. From the benefits perspective our overall results remain in-line with our expectations. Benefits experienced in the individual disability in the third quarter was generally consistent with the year ago quarter and benefits experienced by voluntary benefits was slightly less favorable relative to the year-ago quarter primarily driven by less favorable experience in the life product line.","Looking at Unum U.K. operating income was \u00a321.5 million for the third quarter an increase of 1.9% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter. The growth benefit of last year\u2019s Dental acquisition was partially offset by pressure on growth from existing customers resulting from the current economic uncertainty. The benefit ratio was 71.8% for the third quarter relative to a favorable 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. The majority of the increase in the benefit ratio was driven by higher IFTI adjustments which were offset by stronger net investment income on the investment portfolio.","We also saw some pressure to the higher average claim size in both the Groups Life and Group long-term disability line. Overall profitability of the UK segment remains very strong with an operating ROE of 20.7% for the third quarter.","It\u2019s still too early to tell what the long term impact of Brexit will be on our UK operations, the lower weighted average exchange rate of 131 in the third quarter compared 155 in the year-ago quarter adversely impacted the translation of UK earnings back into US dollars. We do not expect to see much if any impact to our client experience, however it\u2019s important trend and slowdown in the UK, and Sterling and interest rate remains under pressure we likely to see some negative impact to our premium growth and investment income trends.","We started to see some slowdown in underlying life\u2019s growth of weight inflation in the third quarter as companies appeared to be in a wait and see mode for further clarity on the details and implications of Brexit. We believe that the fundamental need for protection products in the UK is not changed as a result of the Brexit vote, but we will be monitoring very closely for any impacts in our markets over the next several quarters.","Colonial Life continued its trend of producing strong steady results with operating income of $79 million in the third quarter 2016 compared to $76.3 in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth accelerated to 6.3% and the benefit ratio was 51.6% for the third quarter compared to 51.2% for the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life continues to generate excellent margins with an operating ROE of 17.3% for the quarter.","Finally, the Closed Block, operating income was $28.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In the individual disability line the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.5% in the third quarter compared to 80.8% in the year-ago quarter reflecting normal volatility.","For the long-term care line of business, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 93.8% for the third quarter compared to 89.9% in the year-ago quarter. The long-term care loss ratio was elevated due to the termination of our largest group case which also had a unique auto portability feature. I will explain the impact of this termination in more detail in a moment. In the absence of this event, the long-term loss ratio would have been in the upper end of our 85% to 90% range.","Similar to the second quarter, we continued to see some pressure on new claims incidents and severity from rate increase notifications to policy holders that have been delivered recently. This impact was significantly diminished in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but we would expect and continue to see some impact over the next several quarters, also we experienced less favorable mortality experience in the long term care line this quarter. As I mentioned long term care results were negatively impacted this quarter by the termination of our largest group case. Normally, when Group long-term care termination occurs we experience a small positive benefit to our financial results. This case was unique and that had an auto port feature whereby employer funded coverage automatically ported and policy holders had to opt out in order to terminate their coverage.","As life support, we changed the persistency assumption underlying the reserves from the group assumption to a significantly lower individual assumption which results in a much larger reserve. The unusually large number of ports coupled with the corresponding increase in reserve adversely impacted our loss ratio this quarter. In the absence of this unique case termination our long term care loss ratio would have been in the 85% to 90% consistent with our long term expectations.","I continue to be pleased with the progress we\u2019re experiencing on achieving rate increases on our imports long term care business.","In addition in making good progress the state regulators and receiving several new rate increase approvals this quarter, we are continuing to see strong take up of the landing spot off chain. The landing spot has the same positive impact on reserves as rate increases but also has the added benefit of de-risk in the portfolio. Since future claims will be small amount at the lending spot, the reserves will be some of less than todays the future changes and reserve assumptions.","I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across our business this quarter. Starting with the UNM US, total sales declined 11.5% for the third quarter compared to a year ago. We continue to see competitive market conditions particularly in the core market segment where we have increased our rates to offset interest rate pressure. In total for LTD, STD and group life, we saw an overall decline in sales of 19.7%. Core market sales decline 13.7%, while large case sales were down 36.2% reflecting a very tough comparison for large case in the year ago quarter.","I will remind you that the third quarter is the smallest sales quarter for the year. So, quarterly volatility can be amplified. We remain committed to pricing discipline and maintaining strong margins in our business. The momentum in our voluntary and supplemental segment remains very encouraging with sales roughly in line with the strong year-ago quarter driven by continued demand for supplemental products in the Starmount acquisition. Our individual disability sales declined 23% against a very strong year ago quarter which benefitted from several large cases.","In the voluntary benefits product line, total sales were in line with the year-ago quarter. Persistency for here and in the US is at very healthy levels. The employee benefits launch combined, resistancy was 89.9%. This is important to us as we looked to move price increases into our enforced block and to offset the impact of low interest rates and pressure on discount rates.","Our salesforce client management in underwriting teams do an excellent job of managing this balance of placing rate increases with maintaining our enforced business. This is essential to our ability to grow while protecting the strong profit margins we have in our employee benefits block. Likewise, voluntary benefits persistency of 76.8% was favourable to prior year results as was individual testability persistency at 91.2%.","Sales in Unum UK, continue to rebound, increasing 15.6% in local currency with favourable trends across all segments. The inclusion of sales from last year's dental acquisition contributed 2% to this growth. Persistency was favourable at 86.5% helping to drive premium income growth of 3.9% this quarter. We expect sales to moderate in the wake of Brexit and we will continue to be disciplined in the UK market.","Finally, Colonial Life turned in another great quarter for new sales increasing 9.3% at the third quarter and 12.7% for the first nine months of the year. Growth remains well balanced between the core commercial markets sector and a public sector as well as what sales to existing customers and sales to new accounts. We have now achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales growth reflecting our continued investment in the business and a favourable environment.","Strong leading indicators such as new sales rep recruiting and new sales rep productivity give us confidence that we can maintain this positive sales momentum as we look to invest more on our colonial life distribution system to build our territories and expand our presence geographically. Persistency for colonial life was improved in the quarter to 79% from 78.6% last year. As a result premium growth continues to build momentum, increasing 6.3% in the third quarter compared to the year ago quarter.","Overall we remain pleased with the growth trends we see across our core business segments. We feel it's important that we remain disciplined in our new business pricing in order to sustain the profit margins we have in our core business lines, particularly in Unum US. Well, it can be tempting to push for sales growth, we do not believe that this is the appropriate time to do so.","Looking now in investment results, new many yields continue to come under pressure in the third quarter. Fortunately we were able to meet our new money yield target of 5% for our long-term care portfolio again this quarter, using our typical mix of investment classes and investment strategies and we have exceeded this target every quarter since the 4Q 2014 reserve review.","We conclude this year's reserve review for long term care of the next several weeks and currently believe that no special reserving will be necessary for yearend 2016. If interest rates remain depressed when extended period of time, we could see pressure in future years, but I have to remind you that we have a substantial cushion between our GAAP and statutory reserve for long term care, which means that any future reserve increase would most likely be a GAAP event with little or no impact to statutory reserves and then show a little to no impact on our capital deployment plans.","With respect to Unum US, long term disability business, well we continue to maintain a healthy interest margin in our reserves all in yield have formed significantly from year-end 2015 levels. On the other end, the underlying profitability of our group disability business has improved significantly as a result of rate increases and disciplined risk management. At the risk of standing redundant, we are confident that that business can absorb any potential discount rate changes while maintaining an expected loss ratio in the 80% to 82% range. We will provide more clarity on this at our December outlook meeting.","The overall credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. I'd like to highlight and further rebound in the net unrealized gain position of our energy holdings to 546 million at the end of the third quarter compared to 433 million at the end of the second quarter and 19 million at the end of the first quarter. I believe this validates the investment decisions in credit of valuation process we have followed for many years, not just for our energy holdings but for our management of the overall investment portfolio","Moving to capital management, we repurchased a 100 million of our shares in the third quarter, consistent with our repurchase activity in recent quarters. Our holding company liquidity position remains very healthy at approximately 600 million as of quarter end, which is at the higher end of our range for holding company cash coverage needs.","During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company and paid up 350 million of maturing debt on September 30th. Because of the higher debt level we have been carrying since our debt issuance in May of 6th, 2016, our interest expense which we put in the corporate segment was 7 million higher this quarter compared to the year ago quarter. With the debt maturity, our quarterly debt expense will decline by approximately $5.5 million in the fourth quarter relative to this quarter.","The risk based capital ratio for a traditional life insurance companies improved to approximately 395% to the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400% for this year. Statutory after tax operating earnings for our traditional US insurance companies were again outstanding at 211.5 million for the third quarter at 2016 compared to a 187.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. This continues as a strong trend in statutory earnings which on a trailing four quarter basis now toggles 806 million.","Throughout 2016, our outlook for growth and after tax operating income per share has been expected growth rate of 3% to 6%. For the first nine months of the year, we are beating that expectation with growth of 8.9% driven by good premium growth, solid risk results in a focused on expense management. Therefore for the full year of 2016, we now expect to be at if not slightly above the upper end of our outlook range. We will provide and outlook for 2017 at our December 15th Analyst meeting and while we're very encouraged by the operating trends we see in this year in the momentum it creates for next year.","We will face headwinds created by low interest rates on our portfolio yields and discount rates as well as the impact of the decline in the British pound. So, to wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with the results for the first three quarters of 2016. We're executing very well on our strategy particularly in critical areas such as maintaining pricing discipline despite increased competition in the US market, generating strong persistency in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewables to help achieve strong profit margins despite interest rate pressure and achieving rate increases and meeting new money yield targets for long term care.","I believe that our success in these areas positions us well to continue to generate value for our shareholders in today's difficult environment. Now, I turn things back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you, Jack. And as we move to questions, I'd like to conclude the prepared remarks by really iterating how pleased we are with our third quarter results. I continue to be encouraged by the good premium growth we are generating which along with stable benefits experience drives our strong capital generation. I believe these trends will continue to service well as we manage through this challenging business environment.","We'll now move to your questions and so I'll ask Kareena to begin the Q&A session. Kareena?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Humphrey Lee from Dowling and Partners. Please go ahead. ","Humphrey Lee","Thank you for taking my question. Maybe you can talk about the kind of the market competition that you are seeing in Unum US, it seems to be getting more competitive as coverage in your sales activities in the quarter. Can you just talk about the overall competitions from the competitors and the pricing environment in general?","Rick McKenney","Great, Humphrey. Thanks for your question. Mike you want to answer?","Mike Simonds","Sure. Thanks Humphrey great question. And I would start by referencing a point that Jack made in his comment and that third quarter is our smallest quarter, fluctuate a bit year to year but typically about 15% of the year. So it's subject to a bit more volatility. I think I would certainly take the sales results and put them into two buckets and the first would be around volatility and when we look at the large case group insurance business voluntary benefits and IDI, I think we saw little bit of volatility against some good large sales in the year ago quarter. I feel really good about the traction we have got in the market at our value proposition and how we are competing. On the other side though I would say core group insurance it\u2019s less about volatility and it's more about sustained trend we have seen over the last several quarters.","And to your question well we have been moving rates up on new business slowly over the past I would say two and half years. We have not seen the corresponding increase from the market and so we have seen closed ratios fall off a bit particularly around new client sales and while certainly we would expect that given low interest rate the market will eventually move to where we are. We just have not seen that yet and us well enough to know that when the market allows us to write business at sustainable rates in the core we will be there with all the capacity that's available.","Just in concluding what I would say is persistency remains really high. So not just to focus on new business, we are doing a good job keeping clients and that's helping to fuel some really nice earned premium growth almost 6% in the quarter.","Humphrey Lee","Well, you mentioned the your competition is not moving the rate as you guys are doing right now so do you feel like it is more of a timing issue or do you feel like there maybe some under pricing in the market in general?","Mike Simonds","Yes, I would say our point of view is that new business rates don't reflect the full impact of the low interest rate environment in the market. What I would say is we have come in to each of the last couple of years as I mentioned with plans to sort of gradually move new business rates up. We feel like \u2013 actually we pretty much arrived given low interest rates that where we need to be on new business so as we look at the coming quarters and we will spend time on this at our Investor Day. I feel more optimistic that the market will come in line as the quarters come and like I said we will wait until that occurs.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then just maybe sneak one more in. I think it's also question for Mike, you mentioned in the interview recently that you target to more than doubling the size of Starmount operations to kind of $500 million revenue over the next five years. Can you maybe share some of your thoughts in terms of how you can achieve that and then also kind of with some of the weaker sales in Unum US how would that play as a headwind since detail of pros tend to sell as a package?","Mike Simonds","Yes, we are really excited about the acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana felt like from the very set of management meetings we had great alignment around the focus on customers and on the people down there. So we are really excited about adding this platform to the portfolio and it's right on strategy for us. We talk all the time about delivering a strong client experience keeping clients and seeking growth through those existing client relationships. And we feel like with the addition of Starmount we bring a really strong growth opportunity to bring dental and vision insurance into those brokerage and client relationships over the next several years. It's going to take some time to get it to national scale. And we don't expect it to be a meaningful contributor to earnings as we continue to invest in that platform in the short term but we are excited about it for the mid and long term.","Rick McKenney","Thank you Humphrey.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on Unum UK, I guess from here maybe over the next intermediate term, do you think premiums will actually start to decline on it a year-over-year basis on a constant FX basis or given some of the pressures could you provide any more color on the outlook there?","Rick McKenney","Ryan, I would turn it to Peter O'Donnell on the U.K. Peter?","Peter O'Donnell","Ryan thanks very much for your question. So to give a little bit of background to what\u2019s happening in the UK as you know we have voted to exit Europe in June and since then there has really been what I would call an interim period where people have been trying to work out what that means. How that's impacting our business if you look at our results, sales going well, persistence going well. But natural growth which is really live and wage inflation as basic is anemic, which is actually a bit lower than the last year whereas when we were planning we saw the economy would be getting to sort of start to motor. And really that's what I see happening in 2017 as well. As people are uncertain about the future and I think the negotiations will go on in 2017. I think there will be discerning about bring new staff on and putting wage inflation into the economy and we will see that remain low. So we might get 2% to 3% on lives and wage inflation in a good economy. I think it will be 1% to 1.5% which is pretty much what we are seeing this year.","So I think premiums will be lower than we expected. But it will still get a better growth as we look forward on the scenario that we are planning. Although I would also say that it is uncertain. And it depends on how the market reacts to those price negotiations. So we are monitoring that. We are also taking action around the interest rates because they have dropped off a bit and again because the ten year fail quite significantly. And the most obvious example of where our competitors will be impacted is the exchange rates. So while on constant currency I think it will a lot lower than expected on an exchange rate we are going to see that to the one dollar 20 if it sticks there come through each quarter for the next two or three quarters when we do relative comparisons. So you need to factor that into your analyst models.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thanks and then could you give us an update on the delta between statutory and GAAP long term care reserves and then would you expect similar impacts in first Unum from year end testing as we had in kind of last few years?","Rick McKenney","Thanks Ryan, Jack you want to add to it.","Jack McGarry","Yes. So in terms of GAAP stat I think last quarter I said was around 800 million. It's grown a little bit. It tends to grow on a quarterly basis so it's a very comfortable margin particularly when you think about pretty much in the context of level of interest rate, discount changes we have taken over the past couple of periods. So a very comfortable stat GAAP difference we would expect. Any movements we take in long term care in the future could be logically GAAP adjustments as opposed to cash adjustment and will allow us to maintain our capital plans and share repurchase at its current level.","With respect to first Unum we will expect kind of similar types of adjustment in first Unum that we have seen throughout the period. We don't expect anything outsized relative to that and it's something that is built into our capital plans and our cash models and we are confident that it will be a pretty smooth transition that in the fourth quarter.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Nadel with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.","John Nadel","Good morning everybody. Mike I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the commentary around competition in Unum US and maybe pricing still needing to catch up a bit. We know that several carriers had to go through a process of sort of fixing their books of business and I guess that's the process that's been ongoing I thought anyway for the last couple of years. Would you characterize sort of the overall markets as still needing to take a lot of rate because it seems to me some of those companies were really taking significant rate playing some catch-up? I just wonder what your commentary is around that?","Mike Simonds","Yes. Thanks John good morning and I think your read is largely accurate. I think at any point in time you have got some carriers that are steady as it goes. Some that are moving to fix issues that have worked their way into their books and more aggressively moving up rates and some that are looking to take share by underwriting more aggressively and it's really when you have a condition like I would characterize the current market it isn't that everyone is out of whack. I think what we have is just enough carriers that are more interested in share than improving margins such that we are not seeing enough opportunity to show sales growth. We are still writing business certainly and as I said, I am probably more optimistic heading into the next year than I have been in the little while, but it will take time. And again we will wait to see how it plays out.","John Nadel","Without naming names I mean would you be willing to at least say those who are in your view more focused on taking share than they tend right now be publicly traded or private?","Mike Simonds","That's a clever way to get out John, yes so I probably would stick to avoid giving too much color on this specific names but generally I would say, when you are seeking growth and you show growth for sustained period of time purely on new clients coming in it can be very tricky to maintain margins. So we see a pretty strong correlation over the long run between new client sales growth and profit margins.","John Nadel","Okay. And then just a follow-up for Jack on group long term care case reported over to an individual case, should we expect that to have an ongoing impact on interest adjusted loss ratio or is it more of a discrete impact in the third quarter only?","Jack McGarry","Yes thanks John. Now that's done. We wouldn\u2019t expect that they have an ongoing impact.","John Nadel","Terrific. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Jack just first question on holding company cash just so I understand this so $600 million of whole co cash is that the total number or do you have an extra amount for planned contributions to the New York subs and Fairwind for the year. Is that all an extra amount sitting at the holding company or so anyway that's my first question?","Jack McGarry","Yes, Tom I think I noted in our Q that is net of anticipated contributions to our subsidiaries.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then Jack if I look over to the last three years you have averaged about 300 million of contributions between the New York sub and the LTC capital Fairwind. So is it fair to assume that the number would be in excessive 600? Would be closer to $900 million of whole co cash right now?","Jack McGarry","Yes Tom can I talk about that for a second because you looked over the last three years. That's 13, 14, and 15. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we re-domesticated our Bermuda captive into Vermont and when we did that we made a contribution because we stepped the reserves up on a statutory basis to the NAIC level. So we \u2013 so that was an unusual event in the fourth quarter of 2013 that recorded cash. In 2014, we took the reserve charge. And as a result of the reserve charge, there was a change in statutory reserves related to claim reserves and so there was an unusual contribution in 2014 resulting from that. So I think if you look at the three year average those aren't average periods. There were significant advanced that we identified in each of them and we don't have 300 million of cash needs in the fourth quarter or we are anticipating if you go back and you look at our cash holdings by quarter, if you back out those significant event sheet don't see a drop in cash in the third quarter. And also I mean in the fourth quarter and also note that the fourth quarter is a wider cash need from an interest expense perspective because most of our coupons are doing in the first and third quarter and so you can't just look at that funding. There is a reason those funding take place in the fourth quarter it's because we have other cash needs in the fourth quarter that offset.","Tom Gallagher","Just to be clear you wouldn't expect to have any cash needed Fairwind this year?","Jack McGarry","I wouldn't expect to have any extraordinary fourth quarter event that significantly changes our holding company cash.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. So between New York and Fairwind if I think about the amounts that would be needed there on a run rate basis you would not expect if I look at the last three years including last year there to be any meaningful amount that\u2019s need for Fairwind. Is that fair? ","Jack McGarry","It will be similar to our normal amount, clearly under a $100. The other thing note about of these things, we fund them over the year, it\u2019s not a fourth quarter event, you will see it for Fairwind in the fourth quarter because when the [indiscernible] gets filed, but it\u2019s something that happens on an unknowing basis.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks and then just my follow-up on the group case that got converted on the long term care side how big of portion of your total group business was that, was that \u2013 that was your largest case you said. What percent of the total was that?","Jack McGarry","Yes. It's like 5% of the total I mean it was a large case. It was four to five times bigger than our second largest case. In our average case size on the group business is like a 100, so it was a very, very big and relative to the block.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Alright. Thank you. ","Rick McKenney","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Thank you. Good morning.","Rick McKenney","Hey Mark.","Mark Hughes","Your benefit ratio on the US group disability business was quite low this quarter. Was that just some natural variability or is that has been trending in that direction and you finally just sort of getting more credibility? ","Rick McKenney","Thanks for noticing Mark. Mike you want to take that on?","Mike Simonds","Yes. Thanks. Good morning Mark. I think it's a little bit of both so certainly we had favorable new claims incidents and has had favorable new claimants over the last several quarters but maybe a little bit more so here in the most recent period, I do think probably proportionally those the bigger driver is just the continued impact of the strong risk management. So when we talked about new price discipline leading to a difficult new sales quarter for us I would link that directly to being conservative in our pricing and so as we have worked that through in terms of new business and through our renewal programs that has had the effect of lowering the benefit ratio and what I think is a sustainable way and if you put good risk management at the front of the business and we are really strong consistent high quality benefits organization at the backend of the process, I think we are really pleased with the outcome. And so sitting where we are at this point is really good and as we look forward to the fourth quarter and think about as Jack alluded to any necessary changes to the discount rate on new claimants occurs in LTD should that be necessary we feel really comfortable that the business is healthy enough to be able to absorb that and maintain that targeted range for us which is in the 80% to 82% loss ratio range.","Mark Hughes","And then, your natural growth kind of the wage headcount growth any body language on whether that was little bit better, little bit slower this quarter?","Mike Simonds","Pretty consistent with what was have seen over the course of the year. So muted from what we would see as a healthy and strong margin but it is a net contributor for us.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Mark. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from [indiscernible] please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning Unum. I am just curious if you had any reactions to January series of announcements specifically the charge for monitoring care related to more longer duration claims which I think you have commented you have been seeing to some extent but are they ahead of behind the curve in your view and do you have ruling interest on the success of their actions and any general commentary and their strategic move would be appreciated? ","Rick McKenney","Great. Thanks Bob. This is Rick, just we don't like to comment on other people's transaction obviously. I would highlight we have a very different business model but there are some things environmentally probably that's worth noting around the long term care market. We have been discussing for some time the transactions in the space particular it's a long term care will come in due course. We have seen some reinsurance transactions now, we see a situation where there is a buyer and a seller in the space and so this doesn't mean anything. Eminent for us, but I certainly think it does mean progress in terms of the capital markets, long term care and looking at different solutions.","The second piece I note is well in this environment we have been discussing the need Jack mentioned it again in terms of what we have been doing around rate actions in the market, the need for those rate increases in our book of business. We have been doing those actions taking that on and I think the environment given some of the things that we highlighted is becoming a least more knowledgeable about the need for rate increases and what's going on and I think that's the environment that we are looking for. So those are couple of things going on in that environment.","And the last thing I highlight is we also as a company have significant strength across the board. That gives us a whole lot of flexibility to do what we want to do any options to pursue either structurally, buying back our shares as we are doing consistently and making sure that we are taking actions ultimately benefit our shareholders. I think you had a question specific to some of the things they did, some of the things they are seeing in their long term care block and maybe Jack you can make couple of comments on who it would translate or it doesn't translate to our book of business.","Jack McGarry","Yes. And so I don't really going to talk about what Genworth is seeing. I will tell you what we are seeing and I think probably the most fundamentally important point is we are not scrambling to keep pace with long term care. We are working through the long term care issue and we are making significant progress as a company to doing that. We feel like we are still much in better shape today than we were even three years ago and a lot of that is because of that active management of the block.","So let me talk to you about what some of things have been. In 2014 we reset reserves assumptions. We placed those reserves assumption on a best estimate basis using our current phone experience and our experience since then has been consistent with those expectations. We also established those, when we established those reserves we built in currently filed rate increases using historical approval rates. Less than the third of those rate increase assumptions remain outstanding. We are making significant progress against them. And feel very good about where the assumptions lie with only a small portion remaining. That not only helps to support our reserve assumptions but it also gives us room in the future to react future adverse claim experience should emerge.","The third point I would make is that our block is unique and long in the long term care business is approximately half of the block is group longer term care with employer funding an extremely conservative planned designs. And because of that group coverage and employer funding, most employees terminate their employer funded coverage when they leave the employer. As a result our group long term care has a lapse rate of closer to 10% versus less than 1% lapse rate from those individual long term care policies. And our group long term care has substantially lower risk profile, but I think that the thing that really sets us apart as a company is the vibrancy of our company in its market leading position and strong profitability. We have great free cash flow generation from our core business. We have consistently over the last six years funded our long term care capital needs. We are still allowing us to increase our dividend and maintain consistent level of share repurchases. As a result our long term care charges have largely been GAAP events and not cash events and we would expect that to continue into the future.","Unidentified Analyst","Can we summarize Jack by \u2013 the earning guidance to the above the range and your answer to Tom and Ryan's questions on funding and accounting for long term care that probability of a charge in a way you are pretty high confident so you can get through the fourth quarter without an event?","Jack McGarry","Yes. We mentioned in the script that we don't answer. From what we are seeing right now we don't anticipate anything unusual in the fourth quarter with long term care.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Bob.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner","Hey good morning. Thanks. I just have a couple of follow-ups on the termination. First can you tell us what the circumstances were of that group case terminating?","Rick McKenney","Yes. It was terminated because of rate increases so we had filed group long term care rate increases in that state. They had been approved and they were being implemented over a three year phase approach it was significant rate increases. And so the customer once faced with their first line decided they don't want to fund the employee benefits any longer and so they terminated the case. But it was driven by the rate increases.","Randy Binner","Rate increases specifically on the LTCP spread than the other aspects of the case. Is that right?","Rick McKenney","Yes. It was rate increases on the group long term care.","Randy Binner","Then the other one there is just so I understand it is that you had a large auto port component and so you shifted a lot of folks to individuals versus group policies and so the persistency assumption there goes lower meaning you have a higher lapse assumption. So if I am getting all that right \u2013 ","Rick McKenney","Lapse assumption goes lower. So lapse is on the group side are on the 10% range. On the individual side they are well less than 1%.","Randy Binner","Got it. So as they \u2013 as each person individually goes to a lower lapse and then \u2013 that's the headwind. Okay got it. I had that backwards. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Rick McKenney","Okay. Thank you Randy.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. So my first question was just on the likelihood of discount rate reduction on the disability side. Assuming rates are where they are, how would you approach that over the next few quarters?","Rick McKenney","Jack you want to take that?","Jack McGarry","Yes. So I think we talked about in both the press releases as well as our comments that rates are significantly below where they were in 2015. If they stay where they are we will anticipate taking a discount rate change in long term disability. We feel very comfortable on that given the performance of long term disability of not only this quarter but over the past three or four quarters that we can take that discount rate change without well maintaining the loss ratio on that EBITDA 82% range. So we will talk more about that at our Investor Meeting in December 15th but given current conditions it's certainly something we are looking very hard at.","Jimmy Bhullar","And I think the last time you adjusted it was maybe on 50 basis points. So would you assume a similar reduction or would it be larger than that?","Jack McGarry","It's in the ballpark. It maybe a little larger, rates have fallen on the yields of practice they have recovered a little bit recently but spread just coming as well. And so that's one of the things that we will wait until we have a better idea of where rates are in the fourth quarter. What are our investment strategy is and we will act accordingly. But certainly we didn't believe that any action we will take no matter who big it is, we will take outside of that 80% to 82% range.","Jimmy Bhullar","On the loss ratio?","Jack McGarry","Yes.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then lastly just on long term care you did mention that you don't expect the charge this year. Assuming that rates don't move materially from current levels, how long can you go without taking charge based on your current assumptions? Would 2017 necessitate a charge given if rates are where they are given what your assumptions are on reserves?","Jack McGarry","It's so volatile because rates don't stay where they are. Rates move, spread moves, supply and demand in the marketplace move, assets classes don't all move in sync and so without it is really hard to predict exactly where your new money rates are going to fall in any year. Clearly, there is pressure but we do have a good margin currently and our discount rates for long term care versus our portfolio yield. We had the expectation that it would be 5% for 4-5 years. And 2017 will be three years into that. So it's going to be judgment call whether it's 2017, 2018 and a lot of it will depend on what the outlook is a year from now given that we can't even predict what the outlook is going to be at the end of this year.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Jimmy.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Kovak with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovak","Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to first on sales to maybe follow-up a little bit. As you looked at and as you begin to think about 2017 outlook that you are preparing for in the coming weeks and month, Unum US has obviously been weaker than you expected. Anything that changes sort of long term growth in terms of where you are expecting both sales and premium in that line given challenges in 2016?","Rick McKenney","Mike.","Mike Simonds","Yes sure. Good morning Michael thanks for the question. I think we are sticking with the strategy so I don't think your question is there are material change outside of the acquisition of Starmount I think we will begin to contribute first to sales growth over the course in particularly towards the back end of next year. And I will translate into top line growth and then ultimately into earnings once we get passed the first kind of series of investments into the platform. So that's going to play out over a really kind of a series of years and we are really excited about it and then in general we continue to feel very good about growth in the voluntary benefits market and our unique proposition there. So I would expect growth in voluntary to be there next year in individual disability that continues to be really strong contributor as well. And I think it just comes down to again given that we feel pretty good about our current position on new business pricing. We don't see need to move on that next year wherever the market be.","Michael Kovak","Okay. That's helpful and then if I could on long term care, with this group auto portability feature can you give us a sense of what percent of your overall group policies have this type of portability feature?","Mike Simonds","That was the only one. So there isn't another group policy holder in our portfolio that has that feature.","Michael Kovak","And then sort of a follow-up on that if I could so this sounds like you are kind of one time gap type adjustment that you made. Anything on the statutory basis given the lower lapse rates?","Mike Simonds","No.","Michael Kovak","Thanks for the answers.","Operator","I am sorry and we will take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. Good morning everybody. I have a couple of questions on the long term disability business. So assume the pricing action that you have taken recently already anticipation of the low rate environment and the potential decrease of the discount rate?","Mike Simonds","Yes, thanks Yaron it's Mike. I appreciate the question and you are correct. So we are trying to price forward for where we believe we need to be from an interest rate perspective. So when Jack talks about being very comfortable about maintaining that target loss ratio of 80% to 82% it's because we put the price renewal actions in place and feel good about that for the health of the business.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then conceptually I am still trying to understand why you would need to lower the discount rate. I understand that interest rates are coming down but at the same time if I remember correctly you have quite a nice margin, reserve margin there. So why can't you just see some of that margin erode while keeping discount rate unchanged?","Jack McGarry","Yes I think the reason is you don't the margin to erode because that's earnings. And so I don't think you don't want to see your earnings erode. You want to be able to maintain that margin and the way to do that is to price business based on a current environment you are selling it in.","Mike Simonds","Yes I wanted to add real quick. It's Mike is this pricing strategy links to the value of proposition in the market and so for us it is about keeping clients for the long term and growing those relationships so sustainability of pricing is really, really important to so we always want to be on balance conservative so that we don't end up on situation where we are trying to play catch up and disrupting relationships.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss","Hi, good morning. I just want to ask question on expenses Rick in your comments you mentioned that the expense ratio in the US was down about a percentage point. And you referenced the headwinds to the businesses that we are all aware of. Is there a more room on the expense side to help offset some of the business pressure that you are seeing?","Rick McKenney","Yes I think it's a fair question. And what we have seen over the last couple of years really actually is good management across the board by our teams on the expense side and we think about it as relative to our overall base. So the team has done a really nice job and that expense ratio has come down. I don't see that as a major driver in terms of how we take profits forward or how we run the company. I think it's something we have been doing very consistently and it's nice to see some of that come through over different period but make no mistake we are investing in our business as well and so when you think about the acquisition that we did what we are putting into our systems to connect better with our customers we are making a lot of investments in our business today. So don't take it as an expense story. It's much more a balanced efficiency and investment back in the business.","Seth Weiss","So what you think this expense margin that we have now is [indiscernible] run rate or should I read into your comments on investing in the business that maybe see that tick up a little bit after it's ticked down the last year?","Rick McKenney","No I think actually stay pretty consistent. It might come down a little bit lower. You know what I think that we benefit by as well as scale. So as our premium lines growing and the business continues to grow, we could do so little bit more efficiently. So it's flat probably down, you won\u2019t see it tick back up and I am talking about longer term trends not actually going to happen in fourth quarter or any particular quarter.","Seth Weiss","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we will take our next question from [indiscernible] research.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you. How much more room do you have to grow with existing clients in either cross selling or increasing penetration and how does dental on vision play into this overtime?","Rick McKenney","Mike you want to start?","Mike Simonds","Sure. Thanks. I appreciate it. So we got a lot of runway is the quick answer. So we average around three benefits per client and we feel like certainly we have got 5, 6, 7 relevant products depending on the client. So it's good opportunity there and the actually highlighted one of the other big opportunities. So the long term trend in the market is from employer funded to more employee choice and so deepening penetration into the employee basis is really important and I would say a big chunk of our product and marketing efforts has been around increasing participation in employee elected plans and we see today on a 100% voluntary plan you may have one in five employees fully participating and so we see a lot of run way there to find good sustainable and profitable growth as well.","Rick McKenney","So that's on the US side. I think I would add as well you have heard from Peter on the UK side. Now they are in dental business, they will be expanding their portfolio. But I\u2019ll also give Tim Arnold the chance on the Colonial Life side which has seen tremendous sales growth to talk little bit about his efforts too to expand the portfolio. Tim?","Tim Arnold","Yes. Thank you, Rick. And I think questions around growth from existing customers at Colonial Life about two-thirds of our sales each year come from existing customers we have a national footprint of benefit counselors you can go out and re-enroll existing customers each year which is a major competitive advantage for us. We are also seeing very strong growth in new customers which bodes well for the future as we go back out and re-enroll those customers as well. We feel great about this. The sales success we are having overall that's very broad balanced as Jack said in his comments. We have leading indicators that suggest that the strength we have seen recently in sales will continue lot of new people on the ground having good success. Lot of new officers will get success and also making investment in our existing offices. So a lot going well currently and encouraged about the future.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks for the question Eric. Operator any other questions. ","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Rick McKenney","Great, thank you, Karina. Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning, we look forward to seeing you at our outlook meeting, on the morning of December 15 in New York. So until then now we will talk you through, thanks. Bye, bye.","Operator","Once again that does conclude today's conference.

Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from these results suggested by these forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to 2018 with net income per share increasing 23% in the first quarter to $1.23. Adjusting for net realized investment gains and losses and the guarantee fund assessment from last year, our after-tax adjusted operating income per share increased 21.6% in the first quarter to $1.24, well within our range of expected growth of 17% to 23% for 2018. And that\u2019s over the base of adjusted operating earnings from 2017 of $4.24.","In the first quarter, we saw a continuation of many of the favorable operating trends we\u2019ve experienced in our core business segments over the past several quarters. Premium income grew 6.5% for our core businesses, while overall benefits experience showed a slight improvement. Our expense ratios remained in-line with the year ago quarter and they reflect the productivity and investments in our business to generate stronger growth and leading customer experience.","These investments are paying off and for example we\u2019ve seen strong growth from our recent acquisitions in the dental business in both the U.S. and U.K. We continue to look to acquisitions to supplement growth for our core business lines, which we executed on in Europe with our intended acquisition of a Polish operation and in the U.S. in a small leave management company.","Our Unum U.S. segment posted very good results in the quarter with premium income increasing nearly 6% and the benefit ratio continuing to improve year-over-year. Colonial Life's adjusted operating earnings were slightly lower relative to last year, but I remain encouraged by the growth we\u2019re seeing, plus the long-term value we\u2019re creating with the investments we\u2019re making to expand our geographic footprint. Unum UK continues to feel the effects of the sluggish UK economy and before tax earnings remained flat on a local currency basis.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the consistency of our performance in these leading businesses and it is a tremendous franchise that is executing well and driving strong returns and cash flow for our company. In the Closed Block, results continue to be volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis. In the first quarter, we saw very good performance in our closed disability block. This was offset by weaker performance in long-term care, which you can see in an elevated loss ratio.","The impacts from lower mortality in the fourth quarter settled down, but we did see a much higher level of claims in the quarter. This block can see volatility in this quarter was no exception. We will have to watch how these trends continue just as we did in the fourth quarter, but historically going forward we\u2019re taking the actions necessary to manage these businesses over their longer-term duration.","I would reiterate that we feel very good about the strategic direction of our business and our strong position in each of our markets. The performance of our core business segments creates significant financial flexibility for the company with strong statutory earnings yielding strong cash flow. This flexibility will allow us to continue to seek opportunities to expand our presence in our markets, find ways to better serve the needs of both employers and their employees, and return capital to our shareholders. This focus will enable us to continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Now, let me turn it over to Jack to cover the details of the first quarter. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Following on Rick's comments, 2018 is off to a solid start with earnings per share growth in-line with our expectations for the year. Now, I will provide detail on our financial performance. Beginning with Unum U.S., we saw another good quarter with continued positive growth trends in premium income and overall sales, very good persistency, and favorable benefit ratio trends across our major business lines. ","Within Unum U.S., adjusted operating income for the group disability declined by 6.4% to $83 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower net investment income resulting from a lower level of assets backing this line in a lower portfolio yield. The update of statutory reserves in the third quarter 2017 in the IBNR reserve update this quarter have resulted in less capital back in the line. This trend along with the steady pressure on portfolio yields puts pressure on the net investment income generated to this line of business.","Lower assets and yield pressures are expected to continue for the next several quarters. However, these lower capital levels are accreted to the adjusted ROE for the group disability line. We saw encouraging trends with premium income for the group disability line increasing by 4.3% given past sales trends in improved persistency, and also further improvement in the benefit ratio.","For the first quarter of 2018, the good disability benefit ratio improved to 75.6% from 76.6% in the year ago quarter with favorable claim recovery experience in the group LTD line more than offsetting the increase in claims incidence in the group STD line. The expense ratio for group disability increased slightly to 25% in the first quarter from 24.5% a year ago, primarily due to additional operating investments in our business that we believe can generate more positive customer experiences.","The group life and ADND line had a very strong first quarter with adjusted operating income of $64.6 million, an increase of 15.4% from the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 8.3%, driven by good sales trends and improved overall persistency. The benefit ratio improved to 70.7% in the first quarter from 71.9% in the year ago quarter, due primarily to improved waver of premium experience in the group life product line. The supplemental and voluntary lines produced another solid consistent quarter with adjusted operating income increasing by 2% to $96.3 million in the first quarter.","Premium income continued to grow at a healthy pace increasing 5.4% for the first quarter, due to growth in our voluntary benefits business in the rapid growth we\u2019re seeing in the dental and vision product line. These increases were partially offset by a slight decline in the individual disability line. Risk experience was favorable in the first quarter in our individual disability and dental and vision lines, while the benefit ratio for voluntary benefits line was generally stable year-over-year.","Sales for Unum U.S. in the first quarter increased by 4.2% over the year ago quarter, driven in large part by the growth in our voluntary benefits in dental and vision lines. Sales in our group lines were mixed, group life and ADND news sales increased 19.9% for the first quarter, while sales in our group disability line were lower relative to the year ago quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that our first quarter sales for our group lines are typically the lowest of the year and therefore the most subject to volatility. ","We\u2019re especially pleased to see the stronger levels of persistency in our group lines to start the year. With group LTD persistency increasing from 88.1% in the year ago quarter to 90.8% this quarter, while group life improved from 87.4% last year to 89.3% in the first quarter. Unum U.K. continues to be impacted by the sluggish economic and business environment in the U.K. In the first quarter, adjusted operating earnings remained flat year-over-year at \u00a321.4 million.","Premium income increased 2.5% on a local currency basis this quarter, generated largely by favorable persistency we saw at 87% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 84.5% last year. The Unum UK benefit ratio was 71.9% for the first quarter of 2018, up slightly from the 71.4% last year. While we saw an uptick in claims experience in the group life and critical illness product lines we were encouraged to see more favorable experience in the group disability business in the first quarter of 2018, relative to 2017.","Unum UK sales for the first quarter declined 22.6% in local currency, driven primarily by one very large LTD case sold last year that made for a difficult comparison. Excluding that single case, we saw improved sales trends in the core LTD market and across the group life and supplemental lines. Colonial Life again produced solid adjusted operating income for the first quarter of $81 million though this quarter was 1.7% below the first quarter of 2017. Top line growth trends remain very encouraging at Colonial with premium income increasing by 6.4% for the first quarter.","Benefits experience was slightly elevated in the first quarter at 51.6% relative to the favorable 50.8% in the year ago quarter as we saw unfavorable experience and the life line of business partially offset by favorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability line. In addition, the operating expense ratio for colonial life was unfavorable for the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of expenses in the cost related to our territory expansion efforts. ","Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be quite strong increasing 7.6% in the first quarter. Sales growth was evident across the board with growth in all product categories and market sectors. We look for continued momentum with our sales growth as we accelerate our investments in territory expansion and initiate the rollout of the dental and vision products to our Colonial Life distribution system.","For our core business segments, Unum U.S., Unum UK and Colonial Life we remain encouraged by the consistency of the trends we are generating over the past several quarters, highlighted by favorable growth trends through disciplined sales management and strong persistency levels, well-managed expenses as we make strategic investments in our future growth in overall stable risk experience. These businesses are generating strong returns for us with an adjusted operating return on equity of 17.5% for the first quarter of 2018.","Moving to the Closed Block, adjusted operating income declined to $28.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $31.6 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability product line, the interest adjusted loss ratio improved significantly to 77.1% in the first quarter, compared to 83.6% in the year ago quarter, due to the benefit of lower average size in new claims. The long-term care business line had a more challenging quarter as the interest adjusted benefit ratio increased to 96.6% in the first quarter this year, compared to the favorable year ago first quarter of 88.6%. Benefits experience this quarter was driven by new claim maintenance that ran much higher than expected, which was partially offset by favorable claim resolutions due to mortality.","In addition, the higher loss ratio this quarter was negatively impacted by lower level of policy terminations. We continue to experience a high level of volatility in this line and expect it will continue in the future. I\u2019m confident that we have the appropriate strategies in place to manage these businesses. We continue to see good overall trends with our long-term care rate increase program, which we believe is the most effective way to manage the long-term care block over the long term. The new money yields we are realizing for the long-term care portfolio continues to exceed the expectations we have embedded in our reserves.","However, we're getting closer to the time when these new money yield assumptions will begin to grade higher. Interest rates in bond spreads were more favorable for us in the first quarter, but this remains a watch area. We continue to feel good about our progress to date in obtaining approvals of long-term care premium rate increases with state regulators. We monitor this progress in two ways, both of which relate to the actual approvals received, compared to those assumptions we included in our 2014 assumption revision for GAAP reserves.","First, we quantify the present value of additional premiums and lending spot elections we will realize in the future based on actual approvals received. For this measure, we are on track with the estimates in our 2014 assumption set. However, it is important to note that the timing of implementation and the number of years over which increases may be faced in as a minimal impact on the total value we recognize over the life of the block. The second measure is the actual premium we will recognize in any specific year for approval rate increases, compared to the premium pattern incorporated into the GAAP reserve expectation. ","For that measure, we have not received approvals as quickly as originally estimated and those approvals received have been phased in over a longer-time period than originally anticipated. This has had the effect of increasing our reported loss ratio in the recent past by 3% to 4%. Based on our current best estimate for the implementation of improved premium increases and our forecast of approvals in the near future we believe this loss ratio pressure from rate increase timing will reverse over the next 3 years to 5 years. We remain optimistic that regulators understand the need for actuarially justified premium increases and we will work with carriers to manage these blocks prudently.","So, in total, we view the first quarter as one consistent with the results we have seen over the past several quarters. Our core business lines continue to operate well, while our Closed Block results, particularly the long-term care line remain volatile. Moving on, we continue to deliver healthy levels of statutory earnings from our traditional U.S. insurance companies. For the first quarter, statutory after-tax adjusted operating earnings totaled $242 million, compared to $180.1 million in the year ago quarter. This year's results benefited from lower tax rate and an IBNR update and long-term disability, while last year was impacted by the guaranteed fund assessment, but overall, it was a solid start to the year from a statutory earnings perspective.","Our capital position remains in very good shape. At quarter end, the risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. traditional life insurance companies was slightly above 380%, while cash at our holding company's totaled $887 million. Our annual need for interest expense and shareholder dividends is approximately $360 million. So, we continue to maintain very strong coverage ratios. Our return on of capital to shareholders of remained on pace as we repurchased another 100 million of stock in the quarter.","Our board will be considering an increase to the common stock dividend at the upcoming annual meeting. There is a lot of interest in RBC ratios and target levels going forward given the potential impact of tax reform. We have had good dialogue with the rating agencies on this topic since year-end on what we believe the appropriate RBC levels are for our company. We and they continue to wait final decisions from the NAIC on any changes over revisions to the formulas and remain closely engaged in those discussion. ","I will remind you that most of the agencies often use their own model for capital adequacy that typically use pretax rather than after tax assumptions. In which case, the proposed factor changes will not materially impact their views of our capital adequacy. In short, we really have a strong capital level and enhance capability to recover from stress scenarios given our stronger projected cash flows, due to tax reform benefits and healthy financial metrics, which will enable us to maintain our targeted financial strength rating of A. I\u2019ll wrap up by reiterating our expectations of growth and adjusted operating earnings per share in the 17% to 23% range for the year. I\u2019ll also remind you that the base of adjusted operating earnings from 2017 is $4.24 per share.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you, Jack. All-in-all, it was a solid first quarter for the company. We\u2019re encouraged by the operating trends we are producing in our core businesses and we\u2019re excited by the growth opportunities we see in our markets and are confident in strategies we have in place to continue to be successful.","We will move now to your questions. So, I\u2019ll ask the operator to begin the question-and-answer period.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will now to our first question from Eric Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bass","Hi, thank you. I had a couple of questions on the long-term care side. Guess first you provided some sensitivities for long-term care reserves to changes in interest rates, I was just hoping you could provide some similar sensitivities to changes and claims trends or changes in mortality or morbidity to just give us a sense as how things change there, what the impact could be on reserves?","Jack McGarry","Yes. We do sensitivity testing. We have not come out with the same, a lot of it depends not only on the level of persistency and mortality and morbidity, but also on the shape of it. So, it is a significantly more complicated question in the interest rate change and we have not publicly disclosed those.","Eric Bass","Got it. I may be thinking about it a different way. I mean you've disclosed I think a cushion of about $1.1 billion between your GAAP and statutory LTC reserves, which seems pretty large, given the size of your total reserves, so what I'm trying to gauge is what would have change in your assumptions to exhaust that question, and if claims, incidence remained elevated levels like you saw in the first quarter, mortality experience was consistent with what you saw in 2017 and rates were kind of trending the way they are, is that still only a GAAP issue do you think?","Jack McGarry","I mean we need to go through the work, so it\u2019s a process we\u2019re going through. We\u2019ve started our annual process. We will be doing a thorough review of experience and assumptions. I want to look at the first quarter as being indicative or overly material. I mean there was volatility in both directions. We actually had very favorable mortality results in the first quarter for particularly our claim mortality, our on-claim mortality results. We had a very unfavorable new claim volumes in the first quarter both of those were aberrations that went in different directions and I certainly wanted to draw a line through the first quarter and say that is where the world is forever.","We do have significant margins between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves, we would expect those to build to the $1.3 million to $1.4 billion range by the end of the year. I\u2019d also point out that over the last couple of years we\u2019ve exceeded our investment bogey\u2019s which is based on current assumptions has built additional margin in to our GAAP reserves. And the third point I would point out is that we still have room from a rate increase perspective. We would expect \u2013 we're pretty much on plan with the approvals we\u2019ve seen historically, as well as what we anticipate from those states that give regular ongoing small approvals.","We still have a lot of outstanding rate increase request in that original 2014 stage filing. We expect to get additional benefits from those filed and as we update assumptions we will be looking at another round of rate increase request. So, there is a lot of room there. So, I feel there is a gap [ph] between where the reserves are, rate increase opportunities, and our stat to GAAP margin there is a very good margin in there, but we got to go through the work before we can solidify where we end up.","Eric Bass","Thank you. And just on the last point you made on the rate increase side, can you just provide an update on sort of how far through the approval process are, are you on the round of rate increases that has been filed for?","Steve Zabel","This is Steve Zabel. We\u2019re just over 90% kind of the way through what we had originally anticipated in our 2014 program, measured by kind of the present value of the additional premium and any benefit adjustments that we may receive. So, we feel pretty good about that and that\u2019s about what we had assumed, how far we would be through on the approval process in the original reserve construct.","Jack McGarry","Yes, I\u2019d note though on the top of that there is still probably 0.5 billion plus outstanding request that we are yet to receive word on.","Eric Bass","Okay, thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. ","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi good morning. First, just a question again on long-term care, if you think about the uptick in the loss ratio given your comments on the pace of getting the price hikes, do you expect that this the stay, is it more reasonable to expect that to stay around of the current level versus the 91-ish percent level that you saw over the past couple of years?","Jack McGarry","Yes, I think we expect, given the impact of the rate increase timing that probably in the, higher than that 91 level, frankly it is so volatile at this point that I would have ventured that predict exactly where it is going to be. The thing I would remind you though is what happens in one quarter or two quarters is really muted relative to what happens on a reserve assumptions basis and what that means for reserves.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, but more likely it showed sort of track higher than where it was last year, just given the pace of price hikes on those, like obviously the number moves around every quarter and [indiscernible].","Jack McGarry","Yes, I think it would track higher and we have seen an uptick. I would expect that probably to continue.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then you are achieving your assumptions for the investment deal and actually I think you have been doing a little bit better than that even recently, but the assumptions do grade up a decent amount over the next few years beyond this year, how are you thinking about maybe adjusting your assumptions or at least adjusting the steepness in which your assuming yields will go up, and if you are thinking about it when would we see you adjust those?","Jack McGarry","You know, I mean that would be part of our annual review process. You know that would be one of the last things we lock in because it will have a lot to do with where interest rates are at the end of the year and where credit rates are and what we view the future to be. It is encouraging that interest rates have been rising, credit spreads have shown some signs of returning to more normal levels with which has helped us, but again that\u2019s going to be one of the last things we peg because it will depend on the environment.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just lastly on, if you could talk about just market conditions and competitive trends in the disability market, a lot of companies have been raising prices the last few years, it seems like they are done with their repricing cycles, but what are you seeing in terms of competitive behavior in the market?","Rick McKenney","Yeah, Jimmy, let me turn it over to Mike to talk a little bit about the market?","Mike Simonds","Thanks Rick. Good morning, Jimmy appreciate the question and I would agree it is competitive market out there though I would say our value proposition continues to resonate, I\u2019d take you to first the persistency and the increases that both Rick and Jack highlighted, also the 4% sales growth that we saw in the quarter, which is good to see, but as you cited, do you think it is a competitive market? ","If I had to pick a spot, I\u2019d say that middle market mid-sized employers and two data points there, that\u2019s certainly where we saw the most group insurance sales pressure was that midmarket, as you know we're not going to chase new business, we don't think that is in our best interest of frankly in the best interest of our clients where they are looking for stability and predictability in cost. And also, where we did have terms and lost clients we saw high single digit loss on the business that we lost in that mid-market.","So, we are probably feeling most acutely there, but overall, I would say, our outlook is one of cautious optimism. 1Q is our light sales quarter for us in the group insurance line. We're really encouraged with the growth in our dental and vision business. That\u2019s really helping us as we package in the smaller end of the employer market and we\u2019ve rolled out some new capabilities in the large case market as well and the pipeline there looks quite encouraging. So, competitive market, but I think we\u2019re more than holding our own.","Rick McKenney ","Yes, I think one thing I would say Jimmy is, it is always competitive market, but you don't see anybody that\u2019s way outside of the norm in terms of being overly competitive or too aggressive in the market. That\u2019s a good place for us, I think given the value proposition that Mike highlights, we do very well and we\u2019re within a range of pricing and that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s where we are today.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just to follow up on long-term care. Jack, in your prepared remarks you talked about the elevated loss ratio will reverse over the next 3 years to 5 years. So, do you mean that the loss ratio will kind of remain above your 85% to 90% range over the next 3 years to 5 years as you implement these rate increases?","Jack McGarry","Actually, what I was talking about is that 3% to 4% pressure on the loss ratio that we\u2019re feeling now from the lag and which we\u2019re actually seeing the premium from approved rate increases, that would dissipate over the next 3 years to 5 years. So, it is 3% or 4% pressure.","Humphrey Lee","So, the 3% to 4% pressure to your loss ratio, I guess above your 85% to 90% target, so do you mean it will remain above 90% over the next 3 years to 5 years?","Jack McGarry","Yes. You know, again, we're going to look at assumptions, we're going to look at reserves. I mean, we will see where the loss ratio goes. I am not going to try and predict a specific range that will be in, but no matter what the loss ratio is the underlying pins of it will be 3% to 4% better, 3 years to 5 years from now because of the catch up and rate increases.","Rick McKenney","I think Humphrey we\u2019re trying to isolate that one issue where we\u2019re getting the value that we expected, it\u2019s just a little bit of a lag and that lag comes through a media loss ratio, but from an overall long-term value perspective it will be there, and I think that\u2019s a little pressure now and we will get that back over the next couple of years, but it is just isolating that one aspect that most people would know.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Got it. And then shifting gears to expenses you talked about in the quarter there is some high investment-related expenses in group visibility and Colonial Life as well as supplementary and voluntary, how should we think about these expenses like what would be, I guess as an ongoing basis as opposed to a one-time nature, I guess in general just how much of the elevated expenses in the quarter would remain in the near-term?","Rick McKenney","So, what we\u2019re trying to highlight Humphrey is looking at the overall expenses we\u2019re investing in our business and so that\u2019s an important part. That will continue. So, when we look at the opportunities we have out there, the ability to spend money to grow the business to run it more effectively to serve our customers, we will continue to invest money there. So, I will highlight that at the macro level. On a very specific level, we\u2019re investing and maybe we will go around to each of our businesses and talk about the areas of investment because I think it\u2019s interesting in terms of how we\u2019re continuing to grow the company. Mike, maybe you start with Unum U.S.","Mike Simonds","Yes, thanks Rick, appreciate it. Good morning Humphrey, and from an expense perspective for Unum U.S. you are seeing sort of a gradual improvement over the last several years. I think in the quarter here we were flat year-over-year, and I actually feel very good about that given the level of investments that we're putting back into the business and I take you to the continued investment and expanding the dental and vision business we\u2019ve gone from about half the country two of our sales regions to the full country rollout, we continue to invest aggressively in our network of provider build out strategy, which is great you see that kind of surfacing in our sub-fall expense ratio. And then in group disability, you continue to invest in the client experience, particularly around the services we provide for helping to plan and manage leaves, as well as sort of relive the administrative burden on employer, and I think both of those are sort of good solid ongoing investments that we see sort of the benefits of already starting to materialize in our position in the market and our growth pipeline. And I know Tim Arnold that Colonial Life is making some similar investments around the client experience, so maybe Tim I\u2019ll flip it to you.","Tim Arnold","Yes, great, thank you Mike. We are making investments in the client experience and investments and technology to support that. We're really pleased with investments that we're making in our distribution expansion, we\u2019re seeing nice results flowing from that, and then in the first quarter we had a number of expenses related to the ramp up of the dental offering, which we kicked off in late first quarter seeing very good market adoption thoroughly for the dental product, but very good market adoption there. So, we also think first quarter was influenced a little bit by some timing issues and we would expect our expense ratio to moderate over the balance of the year.","Rick McKenney","Great thanks Tim and Peter in the U.K.","Peter O'Donnell","Yes. I like my colleagues obviously from the core business perspective continuing to perform strongly and we are investing for the future, so we have a number of initiatives running looking at both efficiency and growth. Actually, our expense ratio performed very strongly in the quarter. We actually have a little bit of the opposite of what Tim talked about, little bit of positive timing, so we expect that to be a bit of a low point come back a little bit in-line with expectations but continuing to invest prudently I guess given the economy out here.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Peter. I think overall Humphrey to answer your question, I think we're talking about all the investments, but you're seeing us pay for those with a lot of efficiencies, so you're not seeing the loss ratios move they\u2019ve been coming down for most of our businesses, all of our businesses over the last several years that may moderate a little bit, but efficiency is still a big part of creating that room for investment that we're going to continue to make.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thanks.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Humphrey.","Operator","Next, we will move to Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR.","Randy Binner","Hi thanks. I have a couple of follow-ups in the long-term care area. First of all, there's a comment earlier that the mortality and new claims trends were an aberration in the first quarter. So, mortalities understood you've have been unusually high, due to flu in the first quarter. But what about the claims trends? Would that make you characterize those as an aberration in the first quarter?","Jack McGarry","Yes, so I would say first of all the claim aberration didn't come in levelly over the quarter. It was highly concentrated in the month of February. Our new claims submissions in the month of February were outside of two standard deviations from the main, so less than 100% chance of being there. They actually settle down. It is still above the May but settled down in March. And it continued to settle down since. So, that you would spike and in fact most of that spike happened in a two-week period in the middle of February. That would be the thing that would make me say it\u2019s an aberration as opposed to a trend.","Randy Binner","Okay. but there's no \u2013 you don't know why? It was just an unusual two-week period? ","Jack McGarry","No. And you can speculate that just as the flu improved mortality, people at the margin and they have \u2013 it had tipped the scales there, but we will never be able to. So, it is already there with certain [indiscernible].","Rick McKenney","It is hard to pinpoint Randy, I mean if you look at history we have seen spikes in the past. Sometimes those spikes and we were speculating at that time too can be caused by rate increases and what comes through and things in the news, there\u2019s a lot of things it\u2019s hard to pinpoint it, but as Jack said, it was a spike, we saw a tick-up and it has come down a little bit since then.","Randy Binner","But flu, may be on the margin flu pushed some folks in?","Rick McKenney","Could be.","Randy Binner","Okay. And I just, I wanted to, I think Jimmy mentioned the kind of the yield assumption on the LTC block that was set in the fourth quarter of 2014, I think it was, if you look back to the fourth quarter 2014, the 30-year treasury yield was pretty similar level, maybe it was a little bit lower than it is right now. So, you know if we use that as a risk-free rate and then you would earn something higher. When would that need to start inflicting higher, because if you fast forward to kind of the end of this year that would be four years and then it would be five years and at the end of 2019, is it, you know, do you need to have like one-year visibility on that trending up or can you wait for that to start trending up in year five?","Rick McKenney","I think Randy Jack answered in kind of the path we picked back in 2014, and that we would stay flat and move up, we exceeded that. We started to see interest rates move up 30 years similar credit spreads or wider, but you certainly see in the 10-year and so you have a very tight 10-30 [ph] spread, which should change over time hopefully. And so, we have to stand here today and look forward, and so it is not beholden to that path in 2014 that we picked. It says we sit here and look forward and what\u2019s the path that we choose for the future, and so I think that\u2019s what goes into our assumptions every year as we go through it, we kind of give you a track as to what we saw then, what we're seeing now that would stay flat for a period of time, and then we will start to trend up and we\u2019re hopeful that we will, but we continually look at that as we do every year in terms of what a go forward path might look like.","Randy Binner","So, is this 30, minus 10, something to think about there or probably then just 30?","Rick McKenney","No, I think it is very still a right number. I am just indicating that that 10-30 spread is unusual in terms of how tight it is. So, if that 10 continues to move up, you might expect the 30 will actually gain some spread as well and out of the 30 you might see a little bit wider credit spread then you see in the 10 as well. So, it\u2019s still very much a 30-year treasury view that would be.","Randy Binner","Okay. Thank you very much. Got it.","Operator","We\u2019ll next move to Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Can you comment on the favorable mortality in the quarter on the long-term care benefit ratio? Can you quantify at least ballpark how much of a benefit you thought that was for the quarter?","Jack McGarry","Yes. I mean we are not going to get into talking about specific assumptions by quarter and how far they benefitted or didn\u2019t. You know as a partial offset to what we saw around incidence in policy hold the terminations.","Tom Gallagher","But I guess Jack my question is, if the elevated claims submission continues for little bit here and we see normal seasonal mortality and the - I think you described this very favorable, if that goes away in 2Q, are we looking at a loss ratio north of 100 or do you think it\u2019s still below that?","Jack McGarry","I mean, I\u2019m not going to speculate on that. It\u2019s, it\u2019s hard to think that bad things stay forever and the good things go away. So, we\u2019ve had volatility around bunches of assumptions by quarter and would expect that to continue?","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then just from a rate increase standpoint, would you say based on what you\u2019re seeing right now, would this prompt you guys can consider a big new fresh round or where, I know you are still in the process of completing the bigger 2014, 2015 plan, but what are you thinking right now, is it still kind of wait and see to see how this plays out before you consider strategy with rate increases or are you considering accelerating something there?","Steve Zabel","Yes, Tom, this is Steve. It is just part of our assumption review, we go through, we look at all of our action to expected, compare that frankly back to previous filings that we made with the states to understand what has changed against those because they do need to be actuarily justified with the states and so we would not develop a new strategy until we have that whole picture, because it may influence what part of the block we may want to rate, as well as any potential magnitude of those rate increases. So, I would say it\u2019s wait-and-see and if there is another round, we will finalize that in conjunction with our assumption review.","Jack McGarry","Yes, I would reiterate that Tom that to the extent that assumption review creates a situation that\u2019s adverse to where we are currently, I would expect there would be refreshed ground of rate increases to go along with the new assumptions.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And just in terms of the holding company cash that is it a strong level, just curious what you're thinking there, is that, you know considering your options and your alternatives here, is that would you say you are taking more of a wait and see approach or, you know is there any contemplation that you could do something more aggressive on capital return depending on how the rest of the year shakes out with given how much holdco cash you have?","Jack McGarry","Yes, it\u2019s great to have the cash that puts us in a very good position with a lot of flexibility. You know given the uncertainty in the environment around, you know particularly around what\u2019s happening with risk-based capital factors, what the NAIC is going to do, how the rating agencies across the board are likely to react to that. My feeling is, this year probably isn't the year that would be more aggressive on returning capital, but it\u2019s great to have it and it puts us in a good position to respond to whatever happens from a capital perspective with the rating agencies.","Rick McKenney","I think the buildup of all the company cash is more a factor. We\u2019ve seen really good statutory earnings. Our capital return to shareholders has been pretty consistent on the share repurchase side, and we\u2019ve been increasing dividends on the common stock dividend side and so it\u2019s more a factor of that and watching our core businesses generate that cash. It has built-up. I think Jack articulates it right as, it is good to have that flexibility and as things move throughout the year we will maintain some of that.","Tom Gallagher","That all makes sense. Thanks, and just one last one if I could sneak it in. The, just curious if you could comment on just looking through the 2017 long-term care supplements, for Unum and several others, looks like incurred claims went up a lot in 2017 both for Unum and for the industry. It was like a double-digit delta year-over-year. 2016 was much less of an increase and then for whatever reason incurred claims just went up a lot in 2017, any thoughts about what\u2019s driving that in terms of underlying factors, anything anomalous or any help you can give on that?","Jack McGarry","Yes, if you look at those forms and you look at the annual periods, 2016 is the outlier. 2016 for us was I think like a 99% actual to expected. It has been running around that 110%, 115% pretty consistently for the years before 2016 it returned to that in 2017. So, when I look at the stat forms, I would pick out 2016 as being the outlier. I wouldn't really pay too much attention to the increase of over 2016 because if you look at the trendline we were pretty consistent with that. I would say a couple of other things on the statutory forms.","First of all, the run out of our disabled claim reserves, that run out over the entire period was about 330 million, negative. We also increased strength and reserves by 340 million during that same period, and so if you offset those two based on our current reserve level for claim reserves, things are working out pretty good and very steady.","I think the other thing on those forms you can see the impact of rate increases are gross to net ratios. Show a 42% increase. So, we\u2019re running in a kind of 70% range on gross to net. And so, I think if you look at, I mean and you take 2016 into consideration with things have been pretty steady.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks.","Rick McKenney","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Rick McKenney","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Scott","Thanks. Good morning. First question is just on the LTC premium rate increase environment, could you discuss just how the regulators look at, I guess the long term care business and in the context of the legal entity and some of the other businesses that you have in there, are you finding that they are looking at a purely isolated to the long-term care and sort of what\u2019s going on in the [indiscernible] captive, or is there any pressure to potentially offset some of it with the very positive results you have had in some of your other core businesses?","Steve Zabel","Yes, this is Steve and thanks for the question Alex. I think a very positive aspect of the conversations we\u2019ve had with the regulators is they stuck to the letter of the contract and the regulations, which really says you need to look at this on a standalone basis from a product perspective. The products need to stand on their own, you need premiums that are sufficient for those products. So, sometimes we will hear comments from consumers around that, a little bit more around some of our more favorable profitable businesses and how that might influence these rate increases, but the regulators strictly look at how is a long-term care block performing, how do we project that to perform, what does that mean to lifetime loss ratios and what does that mean to premiums efficiencies. ","So, I think conversations by and large have been very constructive around looking at it on a standalone basis. I do think generally the environment with regulators has improved over say the last 3 to 5 years, where regulators are very engaged in the discussion around long-term care and understand the need to approve significant rate increases for this line of business.","Alex Scott","And the second question I had was just on the individual long-term care, I think you are getting sort of deeper into sort of the lifetime of the block and getting closer to where you have peak claim levels, so could you just discuss the level of statistical significance that you have with new claim activity that\u2019s coming in relative to when you're looking at in 2014 or could you, is the experience much greater, the amount of data you have much greater now than it was a few years ago?","Jack McGarry","I mean certainly the data is greater now than it was a few years ago. I think there is still a long way to go. You know particularly when you talk about claims experience and trends in the 80s and 90s, there\u2019s not as much known about that either on the claim side nor on the active life reserve side around what mortality will actually be in those later durations. So, credibility in the long-term care business is building, but it\u2019s a long haul. And particularly at the very old ages.","Alex Scott","Thanks. And maybe if I could sneak one more in on just the group disability, when I think about the benefit ratios and how favorable they have been, can you characterize at all the amount of that that\u2019s sort of coming from favorable development on the claims reserves as opposed to current period claims and how that\u2019s trended and sort of if you have any visibility on when you would expect some of the favorability from the claims deserve to slow down?","Jack McGarry","Yes, I mean, I think particularly kind of historically there was some favorability and claim development, claims assumptions have pretty much caught up with that. So, I think we are well in-line in terms of where our loss ratio is, and where our reserve assumptions are. So, I wouldn't expect it to reverse, but I don't expect it to get any better either.","Rick McKenney","I would add one thing to that. The team is, we have talked about the last several years is also and a low rate environment has been taking price, and so that has come through and working closely with our customers to justify that, but we have been increasing prices. Over the last several years, and I think what you are pointing now we're very happy were those prices are.","Alex Scott","Thank you very much.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","Hi, good morning. So, I guess more of a big picture question, last quarter Jack I feel like you were really specific about all of the reasons why Unum\u2019s approach to the long-term care business was still vastly different from GE and what occurred at GE in terms of more than doubling of their long-term care reserves is just not something that we should think could happen for Unum this quarter, you know we're seeing some elevated near-term loss ratio on higher claims instance and I don't know may be that cost you guys a couple of pennies, versus expectations, but the stock is down 15%. I don't think that has anything to do with a couple of pennies. I think investors are adopting, your reserve adequacy and so far, my sense is that you are not exhibiting that same level of confidence with the quality of your reserves that you did last quarter. So, with that as the back drop like what underlying reserve assumptions are you currently most concerned about as you start this annual review or robust review process and clearly it sounds like premium rate increases are coming in a bit slower, but where else are you seeing things diverge from your underlying assumptions?","Jack McGarry","Yes, as I said John, my position on this has not changed at all, the marketplace's position may have, but I think still think there is a vast difference between us and GE, difference between being a direct writer and a reinsurer, the difference between the age of our business, the fact that were more than half of our business in increasing share of our business is in the group long-term care space as opposed to the individual long-term care space. And even on the group side we\u2019re unique and that the bulk of that business is employer funded, paid premiums has a very different lapse expectation, it has very conservative plan designs, you know in terms of the history of how we\u2019ve managed it.","We\u2019ve put more than 4 billion of margin into our long-term care block between rate increases and reserve charges, you know GE came out with this one-time review, we\u2019ve done two comprehensive reviews in 2011 and in 2014 we keep after it on an annual basis, and we actively manage the block both from a rate increase perspective from a reserve margin and investment perspective, as well as we\u2019re continually talking about our long-term care block, we bring you up to speed on it on a quarterly basis and our expectation is that we will continue to do that over the life of the block.","John Nadel","Okay. I appreciate the response, I really do. If I could just ask one more specific question on LTC reserving, you know can you tell us whether you assume morbidity improvement weather in your cash flow testing or premium deficiency testing, and if you do assume morbidity improvement, how much improvement do you assume and for how long?","Jack McGarry","I\u2019m not going to get into those specifics of what we assume for morbidity improvement. We actually assume both morbidity improvement and mortality improvement, which goes against us and our reserve assumptions, but I'm not going to get into the particulars on it.","John Nadel","Okay. So, would it be fair to assume that if you're reflecting mortality improvement then you\u2019re also reflecting morbidity improvement that the two might generally or they might wash out over time?","Jack McGarry","It\u2019s not a washout, but they go in different directions.","John Nadel","Yes, understood. Okay thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will next move to Suneet Kamath with Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Hi, thanks good morning. I just want to follow up on Humphrey's question first. The 3 points to 4 points related to the timing of the premiums that should reverse, was that, I\u2019m assuming that you knew about this so that was embedded in your kind of low 90% loss ratio that you gave, I guess at the outlook Investor Day, is that correct?","Jack McGarry","Yes, you know I think a low 90s was more around a historical trend of where they have been of parsing of what the drivers were. We knew about, you know there was some pressure, I think we have done more work to quantify that both in terms of what the level of that pressure is and how we would expect that to wind out over the next coming years.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. All right. So, then just to go back to the Investor Day, I think you were making two points if I recall. I think one point that you\u2019ve made and I know this is all fluid, but one point you made Jack I think was that, if you were to take a charge this year, next year, it would be sort of similar to what you have kind of taken in the past, order of magnitude, which I believe you said was around 450 million on an after-tax basis, and then relatedly I am pretty sure you were suggesting that if you took a charge it would be on a GAAP basis only and then it wouldn't be any kind of statutory impact. So, I just want us, and we are a few months away from that, but just want to make sure that, a, I\u2019m right about those two statements; and b, that you're still kind of stand by them?","Jack McGarry","I made those statements, you know we're going to have to go through the work, what I would reiterate is there is good margin between where our GAAP reserves are right now in the statutory front and that comes from three different places. One, we\u2019ve exceeded our interest rate assumption. So, our portfolio rate today is well above where we expected it to be in our reserve assumptions at this point that creates margin. The second one is, we have, we still have room in our rate increase assumptions both in terms of expectations of the rate increases that have already been filed as well as the opportunity to refresh and refile new rate increases based on any new set of assumptions that we might come up with.","And we have, you know expected at year-end $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion difference between our stat reserves and GAAP results. So, I can\u2019t tell you right now what the answer is because we\u2019ve got to go through the work, but I would reiterate that there is a lot of margin between where our current GAAP reserves are and where our stat reserves are.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, and then maybe just one last question to think about it, and again, I know these things are moving around, but if we think about that extra margin that you\u2019ve built because you\u2019ve been investing over your 5% bogey, and we kind of think about the investment return assumption kind of grading up, if rates don't grade up, how long would it take to sort of all else equal, how long would it take for that additional investment margin that you have on the balance sheet to get eroded, is it two years, is it five years, I mean just any sense of time it would be helpful?","Jack McGarry","Yes, I mean I would say that\u2019s difficult to say. So, the margins there, those investments are there. They will continue to be there. It\u2019s the impact of new money rates and cash flow that will have an impact, I mean that\u2019s one of the things that we will consider, but you know it has been meaningful and has created a decent margin that we have to work with on interest rates.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. I mean, I think just to John's point on the stock, I mean, I think any additional color that you could give on some of the trajectory of these assumptions, I think would certainly be helpful.","Jack McGarry","Understood.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next move to Ryan Krueger with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks good morning. I guess I have somewhat of a similar question. As John and maybe Suneet, but in the past you pretty confidently said that any changes to long-term care reserves over time given the margin you built upon a statutory basis would not be affected to have any impact to your capital management plans going forward, I guess I just want to confirm that you're still confident in that view going forward?","Rick McKenney","Again, we're going to need to react to the experience that we\u2019ve been seen emerging. We would reiterate that there is a lot of space for our reserve for assumption fine tuning between where we are right now and where we will be, but again we need to go through the work before we can define the answer.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Rick McKenney","Yes, thank you. It is Rick. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We hear your questions on long-term care. We have, we\u2019re working through it as Jack has said. We will articulate best we can, all of the factors that we see out there, the trends that we see and just as we\u2019ve done in the past we will continue to do that. We're going to be out and about number of insurance conferences and make sure we\u2019re answering your \u2013 continue to answer your questions at those as well. So, thanks for your time this morning and that will complete our 2018 earnings call.","Operator","And once again that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone for their participation.

Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ, appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as well as our subsequently filed Form 10-Qs.

Net income in the year ago third quarter included a net realized after-tax investment gain of $7.8 million and an after-tax reserve increase of $593.1 million in the long-term care product line of our Closed Block segment.","Excluding these items after-tax adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2019 was $282.7 million or $1.36 per diluted common share compared to $300.6 million or $1.37 per diluted common share in the year ago quarter.","Participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Zabel as well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US; Peter O'Donnell for Unum International; and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life and now I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for his comments.","Richard McKenney","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone.","The third quarter of 2019 was a solid quarter overall. It was one to demonstrates the consistency and resilience of our business model and serving customers at the workplace. From a market environment perspective, there is no doubt that it was one presented a volatile picture. We saw a long-term interest rates move lower. But we still see a positive important picture with a strong consumer.","We did see some headwinds this quarter with an unusually -- low level of miscellaneous investment income. This was mainly lower bond call that negatively impacted a number of our business lines, relative to the year-ago quarter and slightly impacted the good trends we saw in our core business segments, as a result of, Tom mentioned, our after-tax operating earnings per share declined by $0.01 per share to $1.36. So we are still confident reaching our outlook for the full year.","Looking at third-quarter results. We continue to be pleased with the growth in premium income we are experiencing in our core business segments, which was 4.5% overall. This growth, not only represents added revenue but also additional customers who benefit from the protections and services we provide.","In the employee benefit space markets continue to be competitive, but our offerings are meeting real customer needs. This is also aided by an environment characterized by low unemployment and more recently wage inflation.","For us, specifically we are leveraging years of relationships with customers and distribution partners who count on us to understand and consistently serve the employee benefits market. We think this gives us a meaningful competitive advantage.","In our segments, Unum US premium income increased by 3.9% benefiting from our disciplined approach to sales, continued strong persistency in our group lines, and growth from new product lines such as dental and vision. Colonial Life is very consistent performer for many years and premium growth this quarter was 5% despite relatively flat sales year-to-date.","And finally, our Unum International segment produced premium income growth of 10.5% on a US dollar basis benefiting from the Unum Poland acquisition but also growth in Unum UK in local currency from good persistency results and effective in-force block management.","Across each of our business lines, we continue to see a strong need for our products and services in their markets and are investing broadly in the capabilities to meet these needs.","Next I'm also pleased with the overall margin trend we saw this quarter across our business lines. Steve will cover these trends in detail in his commentary. But broadly our benefit ratios remain within expectations. This reflects the consistent discipline we bring to product pricing and underwriting, as well as in-force block management through renewals. As pleased as I am about the growth, I am equally happy about our ability to do so while maintaining good profitability.","Expense management trends in our core business segments, also continued to be favorable. We are focused on effectively managing our expense base, while investing in new capabilities and in the growth areas of our business, such as lead services. Keeping expenses in check as we grow the top line has helped our overall productivity, expense ratios, and the profitability of our business.","In aggregate, these favorable operating trends continue to drive strong margins in our core business segments, which in combination produced an adjusted operating return on equity of 17.6% for the third quarter. Our core businesses also continued to generate healthy statutory earnings and cash generation to fund our growth and support our capital deployment initiatives.","Touching on the Closed Block the individual disability line continues to be stable and the 12-month loss ratio for long-term care was in the middle of our range, which Steve will touch on in a minute.","So to wrap it up. We're pleased with the results for the third quarter. Our market positioning offers good opportunities for profitable growth. As a company, we have an important and relevant purpose and we are focused on making the investments in technology products and enhance services to meet this growing need.","So now I'll turn it over to Steve to cover the details of the third-quarter results.","Steven Zabel","Thank you, Rick and good morning to everybody on the phone this morning.","I'm pleased with the quarter and the overall trend we continue to see in our businesses. In my comments this morning, I will provide additional detail on the performance of our business segments and provide an update on our capital position and outlook for the full year. Third-quarter after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share were $1.36, $0.01 below the year-ago quarter.","As I take you through the operating trends the common theme you'll hear is that miscellaneous investment income was unusually low this quarter. In fact it was below our historical averages by approximately $12 million and substantially below the year-ago quarter by approximately $24 million.","As we have discussed in the past this is a relatively small part of our overall net investment income, which this quarter was just under $600 million. However, it is volatile from quarter to quarter and the decline this quarter was most notable in our Unum US group disability line and in the Closed Block segment. Looking at Unum US we continue to see solid underlying results from these business lines.","In the third quarter adjusted operating income declined 3.5% to $261.4 million in large part due to miscellaneous investment income coming in approximately $15 million below the year-ago quarter, again primarily impacting the group disability line.","Premium income increased 3.9% over the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by the continuation of strong persistency levels in our group businesses. Our recent sales trends and the growth of our dental and vision business.","Benefits experience in this segment was generally favorable with the benefit ratio declining slightly to 67.2% in the quarter. The adjusted operating return on equity for Unum US remain quite strong at over 18% in the third quarter.","Within Unum US adjusted operating income for group visibility declined by 10.8% to $83 million in the third quarter. We continue to experience good premium growth and excellent benefits experience though net investment income remains under pressure.","Premium income increased 3.8% as the in-force block increased from strong persistency levels and higher sales of both LTD and STD products in recent quarters. The benefit ratio improved to 74.2% in the third quarter from 76.3% a year ago driven by favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line and favorable claims activity in certain of our group short-term disability products.","Consistent with recent trends, net investment income in the quarter declined by 11.9% driven by the ongoing trends of reduced assets back in the line and lower portfolio yields on those assets, as well as lower miscellaneous investment income relative to the year-ago quarter.","The increase in the other expense ratio relative to the year-ago quarter was largely driven by the rapid growth of our leave services. Keep in mind that the fee income related to those services is included in the other income line.","Adjusted operating income for the Group Life and AD&D line increased by 6.9% in the third quarter to $68.4 million. Premium income increased 4% primarily from prior period sales growth. The benefit ratio of 72% was generally consistent with the year-ago quarter of 71.8%.","The expense ratio improved due to the focus on expense management and operating efficiencies. Sales for these group lines of business in Unum US were good in the third quarter, increasing 3.4% over the year-ago quarter.","The group disability lines increased by 2.3% while the group life and AD&D lines increased 5.1% primarily driven by stronger large case sales. Persistency in the Unum US group lines remains strong at 90.6% for the first nine months of 2019 and 2018 and continues to be an important source of our premium growth.","Finally, the supplemental voluntary line adjusted operating income was $110 million for the third quarter a decline of 3.4% relative to the year-ago quarter. Premium income grew by 3.8% primarily driven by prior period sales and the growth in our dental and vision product lines. Looking at benefits experience for each product line. The benefit ratio for individual disability was lower relative to last year due to favorable claim recoveries and lower average claim size.","The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits line was higher, primarily due to the very favorable experience across most of our -- product lines in the year-ago quarter. Finally, in the dental and vision line, the benefit ratio was higher relative to the year-ago quarter, due to business mix changes and unfavorable reserve development.","So generally consistent with our expectations for this product line as product distribution shift to the group products as we discontinued sales of products for the individual market last year. Similar to group life the expense ratio improved relative to the year-ago quarter from our focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.","Sales for the supplemental and voluntary lines increased by 8% for the third quarter with strong growth in the individual disability product line, which increased by approximately 35%.","New sales increased slightly in the dental and vision line while sales were slightly lower for voluntary benefits. Our Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of $24.2 million for the third quarter, a decline of 7.3% from the year-ago quarter. The decline was driven by an unfavorable exchange rate and lower operating income from the UK line of business in local currency, which more than offset inclusion of the financial results of Unum Poland.","In local currency, the Unum UK line of business produced adjusted operating income of GBP18.7 million in the third quarter, a decline of 6.5%. Results for the UK business included growth in the premium income of 2.8% relative to the year-ago quarter from continued strong persistency, recent sales growth, and the benefit of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line.","Net investment income for Unum UK declined 9.4% to GBP18.3 million in the third quarter due to, in part, lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds that we hold to support the claim reserves associated with our group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits.","Benefit ratio for the UK business declined 73.4% in the third quarter compared to 74.2% a year ago, primarily due to favorable claims experience in the group critical illness product line and lower inflation-linked increases in benefits. This was offset in part by unfavorable claim terminations in group long-term disability.","Unum International sales in US dollars increased 16% in the third quarter with sales in the UK in local currency, increasing 3.8% in addition to the inclusion of Unum Poland this period. Persistency for the UK business continues to be quite good even if we have successfully implemented renewal rate increases over the past two years.","The Colonial Life segment produced adjusted operating income of $87.2 million for the third quarter, an increase of 3.6% from the year-ago quarter. Growth in premium income remained solid at 5% for the third quarter, reflecting growth in the in-force block from sales growth in recent quarters.","The benefit ratio of 51.4% was generally consistent with the year-ago quarter of 51.5% with favorable experience in the lifeline of business, mostly offset by unfavorable experience in our cancer and critical illness line of business.","Sales at Colonial Life are relatively flat in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter with declines in the large case and core commercial markets offsetting improved sales in the public sector. We're encouraged by the actions we've been taking to rebuild our sales momentum and anticipate the fourth-quarter sales will show an increase over the year-ago quarter.","Moving to the Closed Block. Adjusted operating income was $26.9 million for the quarter compared to $32.2 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the increased long-term care reserves.","As expected premium income for this segment continues to decline, down by 3.9% in the third quarter, primarily due to the ongoing policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line, which is partially offset by premium rate increases within the LTC product lines.","Net investment income declined by 0.2% in the quarter with the increase in the level of invested assets, offset by a lower yield and a lower level of miscellaneous investment income, which was approximately $9 million less in the quarter compared to a year ago.","In the individual disability product line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 79% for the third quarter compared to 80.5% last year, primarily driven by overall favorable claims activity. In the long-term care business line the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 89.8% for the third quarter compared to 87.5% in the year-ago quarter, excluding the impact of the third quarter 2018 reserve assumption update.","The increase in the benefit ratio was primarily driven by higher submitted new claims relative to the year-ago quarter. However, overall results remain within our expectations with a benefit ratio in the 85% to 90% range.","Given the inherent volatility in the product line we still -- it is important to look at the benefit ratio over a longer period of time than just one quarter. Over the past four quarters, the interest adjusted benefit ratio for LTC has been 87.2% again in line with our expected range of 85% to 90%.","I'll finish the Closed Block discussion with two other important topics related to LTC. First we made additional progress with premium-rate approvals quarter and are now slightly over halfway to the $1.4 billion assumption. We are encouraged with this rate of progress and our ability to achieve this goal in the coming years.","Second, we have exceeded the new money yield target of 5.5% since July 1, 2018 including the third quarter of 2019. As we have often caution, we are taking a long-term view of the assumptions back in this business line given its potential volatility, but we are satisfied with how the trends had evolved over the past four quarters.","Wrapping up with the Corporate segment, the adjusted operating loss which excludes $25.2 million of costs related to the early retirement debt was higher in the third quarter at $48.9 million compared to a loss of $47.1 million in the year-ago quarter, due to lower net investment income, higher interest expense from the debt issued in June and higher pension expenses.","Statutory earnings for our traditional US insurance company have remained at healthy levels for the third quarter with statutory after-tax operating earnings that totaled $261 million compared to $253 million in the year-ago quarter. Our capital metrics remain in good shape with the risk-based capital ratio for our US traditional life insurance companies at approximately 368% consistent with our plans for the year.","Cash at our holding companies totaled just over $1 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of the low rate environment and issued $450 million of a 30-year senior notes with a 4.5% coupon.","The net proceeds were used to purchase and retire the $350 million of notes we had maturing in 2021 and tender for approximately $83 million of higher coupon debt with longer-dated maturities, not all of the tender and redemption transactions were completed in the third quarter to approximately $95 million of the quarter-end cash balance has been used to complete the transaction early in the fourth quarter.","The transactions were intended to generally leverage neutral and cash neutral and we are pleased with the execution of results. Share buybacks in the third quarter were $100 million, consistent with previous quarters and our outlook for the year.","I'll wrap up by reiterating our expectation of growth in adjusted operating income per share in the 4% to 7% range for the full year 2019. Now I'll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments and look forward to your questions.","Richard McKenney","Great, thank you, Steve.","I would reiterate it was a solid quarter overall for the company and one that I believe shows the benefits of our strong position within our markets. The team is here to respond to your questions. So I'll ask Angela to begin the question-and-answer session. Angela?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Mr. Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.","Jimmy Bhullar","So I am going to ask you a couple of questions. They're both relatively short. So first on Colonial, you've had a couple of quarters of down or and flat sales, and some of your competitors haven't reported good sales as well. So I'm wondering how much of this is just because of difficulty in recruiting and retaining given the good labor market versus just sort of normal volatility in sales volumes.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Jimmy. Tom, you want to answer that?","Thomas White","Yes, sure. Thank you. Jimmy, certainly, we see a much more competitive environment, especially in the large case market. In addition, remember that the comparisons on a Colonial Life business to last year were pretty challenging with 13.5% growth in the second quarter of last year and 13% growth in the third quarter.","The impact of the recruiting fall off we experienced in the last half of 2018 beginning of this year, certainly is also having an impact and we suggested last quarter that the environment is challenging, that remains true, but I would point you to a number of reasons for optimism in the voluntary benefits business.","The comparisons do get easier going forward. Last year, fourth-quarter sales growth at probably like was 2.6%. We made some changes in our recruiting model and approach in the first quarter of this year and those are beginning to yield benefits in the number of new agents that have joined Colonial Life and we saw recruiting rebound in the third quarter, of course, we are optimistic that we can sustain the levels of recruiting need for success going forward.","We introduced a new technology over this year to support our agents which includes lead generation and customer relationship management capabilities and we're seeing improved productivity from agents as a result.","That would remind you that our distribution model is fairly unique and allows us to serve both the brokerage market where we see about two-thirds of our sales and in-force premium, but also the very important direction full-year market where we have the ability, I believe somewhat uniquely to serve the less than 100 lives segment and as a reminder there are almost 6 million businesses in the US that have more than one employee and fewer than 100 and we believe that our distribution organization is very well equipped to serve that marketplace.","We continue to make investments in the customer experience, and we believe those investments will yield improvements in persistency over time. We are also piloting a couple of scenarios, which will help us understand and potentially serve the growing freelancer market, which we see as a new opportunity for us and we're introducing new products and capabilities next year that we believe will enable us to even more effectively serve the large case market.","So it's been a challenging environment this year. Some of that's due to the success we had in 2018 but we're still pretty optimistic about the future. And we'll update you more just a bit.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just on long-term care, the loss ratio ticked up this quarter, if you could give us some details on what really drove that and then it's sort of within your range but at the top end of the range and assuming that or if it actually goes above your range, to what extent does that sort of automatically cause you to review your results or would you have to see it cover above that for a number of quarters before you take any action?","Steven Zabel","Jimmy this is Steve, I'll answer that one. So, yeah, just reiterating what you said, we are within our range for the quarter. This is the first quarter that we've actually had a comparable comparison on the new reserve construct in the new assumptions. Our fourth quarter average has been 87.2% over the last four quarters.","And so we feel good about being right in the middle of the range and if you think about those four quarters we had one quarter, fourth quarter of last year where we were quite a bit below the range, got a couple of quarters where we are right in the middle of the range. And then this quarter with the higher end.","So I wouldn't say that as we think about a rolling average we're right within our expectations of where we'd want to be. The current quarter was really driven by some elevated claims incidents. We didn't see anything concentrated there, just an overall higher level of claims incidents and yes, we would definitely need to see several quarters that would be above the range before we start to think about kind of unpacking the reserve assumptions again and thinking hard about those longer-term assumptions.","So this business has a lot of volatility. We've seen it over the last four quarters, it's gone both ways. And we'll just continue to monitor it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now take our next question from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Looking at your operating expenses, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about expense discipline has been an impact in your overall expense level. I was wondering, do you think the current results would likely be tradable in terms of expense level or do you still have any more kind of disciplined initiatives, obviously that you could drive some ball bottom line improvement?","Richard McKenney","Yes, thanks Humphrey. Thanks for the question. I think you step back from on our expense ratio. This is something that we've talked about for a long period of time. It's about being efficient, we focus on that operating expense ratio, as we grow revenues grow premiums. We want to make sure we're not growing expenses at the same rate, while still making sure that we're investing in all the right areas for that future growth.","So I think it's one that will continue to focus on overall as you get line by line, you'll start to see some of the things that happened quarter-to-quarter business-line-by-business line given where we are investing in those type of things.","So I think that you have to -- you really have to look at all the different pieces, I just stay at the high-level expense. Good expense management is something that we're focused on, have been for many years. We'll continue that. But maybe I'll give a sense, we'll go to each of our business lines talk about some of the things that we're seeing more near-term and then some of the areas we're investing, Mike.","Michael Simonds","Thanks Rick and good morning Humphrey. So I think Unum US is in many ways sort of similar to the trends that, Rick, spoke about to. So if we look at it, overall in the current year and look at it over the last four years, you see a pretty steady improvement in the operating expense ratio and to your question, I would say is if you look at our portfolio investments we do have a good number that are designed to drive continued expense efficiency out into the future.","And like Rick said, you look segment by segment it's slightly different. So I would take you to the group disability segment where we did see a higher expense ratio and what underpins that is actually the continued growth of our fee-for-service, and in particular our management of our clients protected in pay lib business.","And we see that as really important and big opportunity of managing statutory leads, and particular, has become an increasingly complex undertaking certainly up in a way at the federal level, but now with many states having passed their own statutes and some states at the municipal level adding to that complexity.","So that's not insured premium coming in and therefore expenses are much bigger share of revenue. So it's a mix shift in that group disability line and a good amount of investment like Rick said in hiring as we prepared to bring a number of more clients on board for those services in the first quarter of next year we got to get ahead of that.","Richard McKenney","Steve [indiscernible] expenses.","Steven Zabel","Yes, sure the strong sales growth and premium income growth we've generated over the last 5, 6 years has allowed us to continue to invest in the business, certainly a lot of investments in growth over the last years and investments in the customer experience, which are paying off for us. I think over the last couple of years, we've seen our OE declined by about 70 basis points and yet still have the operational flexibility to invest where we need to invest to continue to support growth and keep those improvements in customer experience coming.","Richard McKenney","And Peter, you want to talk about the expense management in the UK with our acquisition of Poland as well?","Peter O'Donnell","Sure. So, I mean obviously the expense ratio in the third quarter '19 is different when you compare it against third-quarter '18 because we're adding in the Poland business. So, but we look against our plan actually, we're slightly below where we expect our plan to be. Quarter-to-quarter expenses are affected by timing of expenses. So if you're doing big projects, they tend to come through and sort of move the ratio around tend to look at it year-to-date.","And when I look at the year's date expense ratio, when I compare it against prior year for the UK and the before it's gradually coming down, so most important thing is you're growing premiums faster than expenses, as Rick says.","What we're trying to do is get efficiencies in the way we service our customers, in the way we go to market and looking to invest -- to do that in things like digital. So for example, this quarter, we've just launched a digital servicing ability for our brokers and over time as more of our brokers we've onto that digital servicing, we'd expect to be able to reduce our ongoing operating expenses and perhaps invest that in more digital capabilities. So it's always a balance, Rick.","Humphrey Lee","So it sounds like expense ratio or should continue a similar trend given the discipline that you have. Shifting gear with the enrollment period around the corner can you talk about your expectation for Unum US and Colonial Life specifically will you be able to push through any rate increases for this cycle, especially to address lower interest rates?","Steven Zabel","And it's, as you know Humphrey from following us for quite a while. It's a pretty standard practice. So we're always looking at the book of business and making adjustments and even with a business that's performing very consistently in the high teens from a return on equity point of view, there is going to be pockets where we need to make adjustments and so renewable plans are right in line with expectations, both in terms of the placed increases and really importantly the persistency of that book coming through.","And so we're running just a tick above 90% on the group insurance side for disability and life insurance and as we look forward to work through this, really important fourth quarter, I don't see that really materially change in one way or the other.","Richard McKenney","Tim?","Timothy Arnold","Yes. So, as Steve mentioned, we expect to return to growth in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by the pipeline cautiously optimistic.","Operator","I will now take our next question from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","I had a, first a follow-up on renewals. And could you talk a little bit more broadly about how renewals are going, what competition looks like? And also I guess any preliminary thoughts on kind of new business trends with year-end renewals?","Steven Zabel","Thanks, Ryan, and good morning. So just as we just had I'd say the renewals, particularly in the mid, in the large size business is really pretty much something that we've done for the January 1st effective date, which is a really important one for us and I would just say there, then the trends that we've seen around being able to place rate where we need to and be able to persist those clients is really is holding strong, which is great .","And then as we look at the pipeline for new business again I think we've been able to create a bit of differentiation with some of the investments that we've made in technology, we've talked about over the last several quarters.","I would really highlight, we've done a fair amount of our digital investments on the HR platforms that our clients are increasingly adopting and so Workday was our first and most prominent platform that we started to build our capabilities on and we've really seen nice growth there and I think with a new platform rolling out just here in the next couple of weeks that focus is more on the core market. I suspect that that growth will continue.","Ryan Krueger","And then, Steve, you had previously mentioned that cash contributions for long-term care could be more in the $300 million to $400 million range over the next couple of years. Could you just give a little bit more detail on the drivers of why it will be a little bit more elevated near term versus the typical amount and then if you still feel good about kind of the typical buyback around $400 million a year in light of that?","Richard McKenney","Yes. So I think a couple of points of perspective, if you go back the last couple of years. Our contributions to the subs have been elevated compared to what they were previous to that they've been up in that $300 million to $400 million range, last year they were even a little bit higher with the reserve charge we took, we had to contribute a little bit more capital. We're coming into the fourth quarter and looking at first Unum specifically around cash flow testing and looking where that's coming in with the interest rates, but kind of a line of sight we have right now, I would say that full-year capital contributions would be in that $300 million to $400 million probably closer to the $400 million. It's in our capital plan right now.","We have already made some of those capital contributions during the year. So that will not all be going in the fourth quarter, but we need to wrap up our fourth quarter cash flow testing before we have that finalized. I would say, I won't speak to next year, we'll talk about that more in the Investor Day in December, but we haven't changed our capital appointment plans for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Want to follow up on Jimmy's question a little bit earlier about the flat sales at Colonial and I think also in Unum US there were some pressures, I think group long-term disability was off about 6%. And so as I think about the sales and you did a great job of talking about recruiting and your efforts to kind of grow, but I also think about Colonial and Unum US and the fact that their ROEs are roughly 18% and so the question is what's the competitive landscape out there? Is it allowing you to continue to get those 18% ROEs in both Unum US and Colonial and with that competition, even with all of these efforts that you're going to find it very difficult to grow?","Richard McKenney","Unum US and Colonial Life, Tim you want to talk about the first?","Timothy Arnold","Yes. Thank you for the question, Andrew. On the Colonial Life side, as I mentioned earlier, we see most of the heavy competition in the large case segment and I will say we do see some competitors behaving in that segment in ways that we think may not be sustainable longer term.","We still see tremendous amount of opportunity down market, especially in the mid-market in the small case market, we believe, especially in that less than 100 life segment that market is tremendously under-served and the employees in that space are under-educated regarding their benefits.","We have unique enrollment capabilities in the industry to allow us to educate people on benefits either face-to-face across the nation or with technology or telephonically and so we see that as another competitive advantage that will allow us to continue to maintain the margins we have while serving an underserved part of the market. So for us, we still believe that maintaining our margins and growing as possible but we recognize that the competitive landscape is becoming more challenging, especially in the larger end of the market.","Andrew Kligerman","Mike, a little bit on Unum US?","Michael Simonds","And thanks for the question. You highlighted the LTD and just I think folks know but third quarter tends to be it is generally our smaller sales quarter. So it's a little bit of volatility, we did see. I don't think sales were off a bit during the quarter, but if you look at year-to-date basis, the were over double digits and feel good about group disability in the business overall up 6% sales for the quarter, which is great.","Your question is a good one, it's a high performing business with high-teens ROE. And in terms of competition. We do exist in very competitive markets, no doubt about it, but I - if I had to sort of narrow in I would say that large case voluntary benefits market that Tim just highlighted, I think we see that on the Unum brand as well. Our strategy there is increasingly to integrate our voluntary sales with the rest of our group insurance and leave businesses.","And as I just mentioned, the investment that we made integrating into our clients' HR technology, as well as building out those leave management services. I think that provide a really important differentiator that allows us to pull along things like the life insurance in the voluntary benefits over time.","So we look out over the to the future. Certainly, there's going to be some volatility and growth quarter-to-quarter, but boy, there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us.","I think, Andrew, you think about the overall profitability. Yeah, Andrew. Just a little bit more on the overall profitability maintaining the what are very good returning levels in the business and one thing to just characterize the market, particularly as you get higher margin in the key size there is some irrational competition. I'm taking a longer-term view to that, some of that has come out of the market. And so as you look at that our ability to maintain those high returns is what we're focused on.","We're not sacrificing our discipline around underwriting, around case selection, around how do we go to market and sell. From a macro perspective, we still look to maintain those high returns.","Andrew Kligerman","And just along the same lines, just on a more micro level with your dental and vision business and the star Mount efforts I've noticed Aflac is kind of taking a similar initiatives and so the question here is what kind of growth trajectory do you expect and what kind of returns do you expect along the way?","Richard McKenney","Yes, so start in the US. I will talk a little bit about, more of the voluntary space Colonial Life. And so, but I think it's important in the large group or just the group business, how we're growing sales. Mike.","Michael Simonds","So thanks for highlighting that is an important part of our growth story going forward. And we're really pleased with that business, what you see on the surface is really good strong premium growth when you - which you can see though is underneath that actually has a really nice pull effect on other line.","So of the group, dental and vision that we wrote in the quarter over three-quarters of it came with other lines or went on top of existing clients. So that really does serve to secure that relationship and drive additional growth. And when we do need to make adjustments through renewal pricing for things like interest rates, a broader client relationship is really helpful there.","It's - it is a growth prospects that have a lot of runway in front of it. So even as we've had a really good success over the last three years since the acquisition and really two years actively in the market still we are about 10% of our in-force clients that we've brought back dental and vision solutions. So we have a long ways to go in terms of what that growth trajectory looks like.","Richard McKenney","Tim on the Colonial side?","Timothy Arnold","Yes. So for us the acquisition start now certainly been a strong catalyst for growth. We saw great growth last year. And as Mike mentioned, along with the dental products we typically see a couple of other products that are being purchased at the same time. We appreciate start mounts experience and serving the commercial and public sector markets in the past and that's certainly been beneficial to us as well. As Mike mentioned, we had about one-year delay after year in the US, starting with start - so with less than 5% of our in-force customers currently have our dental product and we see tremendous opportunities there. We remain excited about the growth prospects.","Operator","And we'll go ahead with our next question from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","A question for Rick. I guess it seems to me that no matter how good the core businesses it all comes down to long-term care in terms of driving the stock inclusive of the stocks doing this morning. So I know it's unfair but it sort of is what it is. So any updates in terms of third party solutions for long-term care. I think in the past, you talked about, interest rates being the primary headwind, but is that still the case or is it more interest rates and uncertainty over to claims trends just an update on that would be helpful?","Richard McKenney","Yes. Suneet. I think I raised a point which is with our Closed Block both - both sides of our Closed Block individual disability side, in long-term care side. These are businesses we're not actively marketing today. And so we think that strategically, we would rather be out of them. I think the reality is the market over the last few years, particularly to the long-term care has been challenging, as we look at solutions externally. You have seen a couple of smaller solutions in the market.","And so we watch those carefully, but it also is difficult to find counterparties that we'll will take on this risk in the way that we think is appropriate for our company overall. I think it's both. I think it's actually interest rate, but I would also say it's also just getting credibility within the data around long-term care is still gaining credibility across the industry, that's going to be important for parties to get together and work through a transaction and lower interest rates.","Our barrier as well, but I think it's both of those in concert. So we do recognize and why we have the best core business, we can, we think the team is doing a tremendous job on that front. But we're going to continue to work through long-term care. A year ago we came out with good transparency around all our assumptions where they're trending et cetera. And that's the most we can do at the moment, but we will continue to look diligently for solutions to our entire Closed Block.","Suneet Kamath","And then just maybe just a follow-up. And again, I know it's frustrating for you guys. But would you think about anything more dramatic like possibly slowing the buyback program kind of conserving some capital to kind of throw at a solution. Is that - are you at all thinking along those lines or is that just off the table at this point?","Richard McKenney","I don't think anything is off the table Suneet. We're looking at all options and model out many different scenarios about what we can do to be able to allow our very strong core businesses to shine through. And so I don't think there is anything off the table. We're focused on how do we create value for our shareholders and whatever type of solution that would entail will be on the table. And when we will very - very carefully look at.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Nadel of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","I have two questions unrelated to each other. The first - I just wanted to talk about miscellaneous investment income. I think historically or at least, it looks like most of the pressure relative to historical averages, it looks like that was mostly in the Closed Block. I know some of the other segments were impacted, but I thought historically when you guys have higher miscellaneous investment income, in particular in the Closed Block it tends to fund reserve build that largely offset that.","Do I have that right, is there really any meaningful bottom line impact from the lower investment - miscellaneous investment income?","Steven Zabel","Yes, thanks for the question. John, this is Steve, I'll take that. So just a couple of points of comparison. First of all, if you look year-over-year in the change in miscellaneous investment income the variance in closed block is about $9 million year-over-year, but in Unum US it's about $14 million or $15 million. So the significant portion actually of that year-over-year difference that's what was in Unum US.","I'll tell you, we don't really adjust discount rates in our Closed Disability Block, I'm sorry, in our Unum US that's more of a longer-term view of what to do with discount rates, also in long-term care we would not adjust for claim discount rate there either. The one place that we have done it is in our Closed individual disability income block.","What we have done that overtime where we have kind of very significant maybe single bond calls that are able to move the overall discount rate. We have done that, but I would say, all things being equal, for this quarter. If you look year-over-year. The majority of that difference went through to the bottom line.","John Nadel","Thanks, Steve. And then my second question, just coming back to the idea of uses of cash relative to sources of cash. I think you're probably given your earnings power right now generating somewhere in the range of $1.1 to $1.2 billion of cash from your earnings. I'm just wondering with the uses of cash, in particular Steve with your comments about the statutory capital contributions being much larger related to the long-term care block at this point, it looks like you're effectively utilizing a 100% of your sources of cash via dividends, interest expense, capital contributions in your buyback. How much - how long do you think you have the flexibility to be able to do essentially a 100% deployment before the buyback maybe has to be cut a little bit to maintain some flexibility?","Steven Zabel","Yes, I would say the perspective given there in the last two or three years the cash calls on the holding company from the subsidiaries has really been greater than we had historically seen and going forward, what we expect to see. If you recall, when we went through tax reform that had a pretty dramatic impact on the level of required capital we had down in our insurance.","But it was really just the stroke of the pen of change in the tax rate and how that change the RBC factors. So that created more contributions down of the subs than we had historically seen. The other thing is we did have our reserve charge last year there was a disabled life reserve impact of that, which drove some statutory capital requirement.","So I would say the last two years have been a bit of anomaly. I'd say that we're going to be able to navigate through this year. We do view that to be kind of a decreasing call on capital and call on cash at the holding company as we go forward. So we'll monitor it though and obviously we look at our capital plans every year and we'll just have to evaluate that as we go.","John Nadel","Yes, I guess the tax reform impact was the discrete one-time item. I'm just wondering about the - in particular, the capital contributions you might need to make if rates remain this low for the long-term care block. If rates don't move from here all else equal, Steve, should we be thinking about capital contributions for the next few years being in that $400 million range?","Steven Zabel","No, I think the other thing to think about there is a lot of that capital contribution related to rates is in first Unum and how cash flow testing works. There is, - - it's kind of a spot rate and so wherever you end up towards the end of the year, you kind of build that is not forever, but you build in a pretty low-interest rate and you need to almost funded at relatively quickly.","And so, it's not like when you think about our GAAP interest rate assumption, where we do have kind of a reversion to the mean, how first Unum works you kind of take a spot rate and you're funded.","John Nadel","So the incremental in year two or year three is not that much.","Steven Zabel","Not necessarily. Yeah.","Operator","I will now take our next question from Thomas Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Just to kind of follow up, on the whole, the question about how you are thinking about long-term care and potential solutions. The - our estimate today is the market describing something like $5 billion valuation discount for long-term care. That's certainly subject to a high degree of margin for our but the - if that's directionally close and there are opportunities, possibilities for you to kind of crystallize that at a much lower level. Is that something that you'd be prepared to do and how are you thinking about it now. Would it like the things that are on the table I know the buyback could come up, but would you consider doing something more substantial like selling your IDI Closed Block or even selling a core asset like Colonial? I just want to get a sense where your head is at with the whole topic.","Richard McKenney","Yes, certainly Tom, this is Rick. I think it goes back to Suneet's question as well, which I won't describe the discount that you're relating to, but when we think of the business we do model out different scenarios. I'd be very quick to say when we look at core assets those are what actually were intended to take us forward.","So take that out of the equation, but when you look at our restructuring certainly with reinsurance other counterparties what that might look like we're going to evaluate it and you haven't seen us do anything to date, but it's not because we're not out there modeling it relative to where our shares are today, relative to where the perception and the LTC businesses and we'll continue to do that.","So I think that the actions that are required to do that are ones that we're active on, but I don't see any dramatic change in terms of our core business where we think the growth in our business having a very good franchise certainly where we're going to continue to push.","Thomas Gallagher","And then just a question on the core business for my follow-up. Can you unpack a bit, what's happening to the disability benefit ratio 74.2 the best that I can remember how - now I presume you're getting some benefit. And I think you indicated favorable claim recovery, but can you talk about where new business is priced and what you would expect that to - how that would expected to flow through relative to the 74.2 like would you expect you can maintain the 74.2 based on where you're pricing new business today or would you expect that to revert somewhat to a mean?.","Richard McKenney","Sure, thanks Tom. Good question. So just a quick caveat. So we're in the risk taking business and there's always some chance of volatility, but if the question is what's our best estimate. I'd say where we are in the quarter, which is very similar to where we are in a year-to-date basis. When it comes to the group disability loss ratio is probably our best estimate for going forward as well.","Thomas Gallagher","So the 70 - low 74 is based on what you know today. You think, will - is run ratable in terms of current trends. ","Richard McKenney","Again, I wouldn't try to take any quarter, but over time and then to your question about what do we targeting. I think that's 74 to 75 range is a good one.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","First question I had also related to long-term care. I guess first Unum, when I look at the reserves there is a pretty big asset or actuarial AAR reserve. Yeah, it looks like it's nearly maybe like 80% of the size of just the regular way statutory requirement. And I'd just be interested to hear for Unum Life Insurance Company of America I don't think there is an AAR reserve at all. So, like - what's the difference, I know part of it is just the New York domicile, but is there a different in the products, does it have to do with the reinsurance of Fairwind? Like how should I think about that difference?","Steven Zabel","Yes, this is Steve. Thanks for question, Alex and I think there is a couple of things to think about first Unum is under kind of a traditional strict cash flow testing regime and within the New York interpretations of that, there is a couple of things that are, we believe are much more conservative than really the economics of the business. One is that they don't allow you to build into kind of your future cash flow unapproved rate increases.","And as you know, that's a pretty big part of how we think about the economics of the business going forward that there are rate increases, going forward that we think we will get approved and be able to factor into the profitability, New York doesn\u2019t allow you on that New York business to incorporate that.","I would say the other thing is they cap credit spreads, not just on your new money portfolio going forward, but they look at your existing portfolio and almost cap the yields on what you're able to factor in the economics when you do your cash flow testing and so that obviously decreases the yield, we're able to use for that evaluation and then I'd say the other thing, something I mentioned earlier for new money, they use more of a spot yield, where the best estimate perspective, we think it more as a reversion of the mean.","And we talked about in our best estimate we have a 5.5% that increases over time up to 6% in a quarter for Unum cash flow testing that would be a spot rate of where we are right now.","So those three things just in the methodology build a much more conservative view in how we do our asset adequacy testing. I would say generally when you think about the business itself and really differences there we had a little bit more maybe individual business in New York, but by and large, it's the same type of business, same type of policy construct. So I think it's more than methodology.","Alex Scott","And then I guess Fairwind I think you guys update annually the statutory net income on a consolidated captive basis and it's been a little negative which I guess high level suggest that maybe reserves are quite high enough to be generate a profit there. But I mean could you update us on how that's been going year-to-date and if that's been negative or positive?","Steven Zabel","Yes, I would just say normally Fairwind where the Unum America LTC business is reinsured to, we have had historically statutory losses that we've had to fund that's been in kind of our run rate of capital contributions and to the conversation earlier that factored into the comments that I made and we see that being pretty consistent this year.","Operator","And your next question comes from Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","You mentioned, I think that your target \u2013 or you're above your target 5.5% new money rate for LTC in the quarter. How much of this was helped by new allocations to alternative investments. And can you talk about how much appetite you have to continue increasing the allocation?","Steven Zabel","Great, thanks for the question. So just to step back about our investment strategy for long-term care. A couple of things I think are important one. It's obviously a very long duration liability. So when we think about asset allocation. What we're looking to 30-year bonds alternative asset strategies fit very well with that type of liability, so tobacco or LTC business it's I'd say it's a combination of investment grade bonds high-yield bonds and then some of the alternative asset classes.","Right now, we do have less than $500 million in all behind the LTC business. We feel good about that program, and that's something that we'll continue to use as a tool to back that business. The one thing I will tell you is we take a macro view to the type of credit risk that we're taking and we kind of look at high-yield bonds, alternative assets together and think about it trying to manage around 8%, 18.5% of our total portfolio in those types of assets.","So if we decide to grow the old asset portfolio, we would, we probably reduce our high-yield portfolio to keep that overall kind of guideline in place. So that's how we're thinking about it.","Erik Bass","And then when you look at the level of miscellaneous investment income. I guess, do you think looking at the historical average is still the right comparison or given how long rates have been low. And how much debt is already been refinanced could we be moving into kind of a cyclically lower period for bond calls and prepays?","Steven Zabel","Yes. As we mentioned earlier, I mean, your guess is as good as ours in that these tend to be very volatile very episodic they are hard to predict. I would say, using a historical run rate is a good place to start. But it's tough to predict these types of things. I think what we'll do is try to be transparent around that as far as what we're seeing in quarter-to-quarter earnings. So you can kind of understand what that looks like.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to hand it back over for closing.","Thomas White","Well thanks Angela. Thanks all of you for taking the time this morning. Angela, this now completes third quarter 2019 earnings call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas White","Great. Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from these results suggested by these forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.unum.com.","I remind you that the statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. As we discuss our financial results this quarter, I'll remind you that our prior period results have been adjusted for our retrospective adoption of the accounting standards, update for tax credit partnership investments and qualified affordable housing projects. Adjusted prior period results are available on our website in a supplemental exhibit. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our website also in the Investor section.","So participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; CFO, Jack McGarry; as well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S.; Peter O'Donnell for Unum U.K.; and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life. And with that I'll turn the call over to Rick.","Richard McKenney","Great. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We finished 2015 on a strong note, with fourth quarter operating income at $0.95 per share. That's an increase of 6.7% over last year, brining the full year EPS to $3.64, which is an increase of 3.7%. We ended the year in the middle of our outlook range of 2% to 5%, which we were tracking to all year.","I'm especially pleased with the balance performance we continue to show on our core business segments, with good levels of premium growth complemented by stable benefits experienced across all lines. This combination helps to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the company.","Our financial flexibility continues to be an important asset to us, as we move into 2016, as we look to take advantage of the opportunities for profitable growth and to expand our leadership positions in the employee and voluntary benefits markets. I'll cover a few highlights for the fourth quarter, and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail.","I'll start with premium growth in our core business segments, which continues at a healthy and well-balanced pace. For the fourth quarter, premiums in each of our three core segments, Unum U.S., Unum U.K. and Colonial Life all increased by more than 5%.","For Unum U.S. fourth quarter's sales had a difficult comparison given the 25% jump we saw in the year-ago fourth quarter. But for the full year 2015, we generated an increase of just over 4%, at the top end of our expectations coming into 2015. In addition, Unum U.S. persistency trends remains favorable and our ongoing focus on renewals help drive the 5.5% increase in premium income.","Unum U.K. sales in local currency improved in the fourth quarter, with growth of 11%, driven largely by strong results in the core market long-term disability sales and large case group life sales. Combined with improving persistency and the benefit of a recently acquired dental business, Unum U.K. generated 5% growth in premiums in the fourth quarter as well.","Finally, at Colonial Life, sales growth continues to be quite encouraging, increasing 5% for the fourth quarter and almost 7% for the full year, helping to generate premium growth of just over 5% for the quarter.","Next, it's important that we have not sacrificed the profitability of our core businesses to generate this premium growth, as our benefits experiences remain stable across all three business segments. In fact, the benefit ratios for the three core business segments improved for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. Jack will provide additional detail on these trends in his commentary.","Given these operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of capital, which provides us substantial financial flexibility. This flexibility allows us to fund the capital required to grow our business, while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as we bought back $427 million of stock in 2015.","In addition, we have continued to grow our book value per share, with book value now at $35.90, an increase of 8.4% for the year, consistent with the growth we have generated since 2008.","And finally, the macro-environment, including the ongoing low interest rate environment, continues to present challenges. Interest rates and investments spreads remain below historical levels and below our portfolio yields. Our focus remains on actively managing through this environment by steadily talking pricing actions, but in the near-term, it does continue to dampen our profit growth.","So with these highlights on our fourth quarter performance, I'll have Jack cover our results in greater detail. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results, and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating and business trends we saw in the quarter.","I'll being with Unum U.S., where fourth quarter operating income was $214.2 million, an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter of $209.5 million. Premium income growth remains very healthy, increasing 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, while the benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment improved slightly to 71.1% in the quarter compared to 71.3% in the year-ago quarter.","The profitability of Unum U.S. remained strong with an operating ROE of 13.1% for the fourth quarter and 13.3% for the full year. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our group disability business was $66.1 million, an increase of 0.3% from the year-ago quarter of $65.9 million.","Premium income increased 5.5% over the year-ago quarter, but we continue to see pressure on net investment income, which declined by 5.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by lower asset levels, lower portfolio yields and lower miscellaneous investment income.","Benefits experience improved in the fourth quarter relative to the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 81.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 83.7% a year ago, driven primarily by lower claims incidents rates and favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product line, as well as favorable benefits experience in our group short-term disability line.","Group Life and AD&D operating income was $54.3 million for the fourth quarter, a decline of 8.4% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow at a favorable levels, increasing 5.2% over the year-ago quarter.","The benefit ratio was 72% for the fourth quarter compared to 70.8% in the year-ago quarter due to a higher average paid claim size for the group life line in the AD&D line of business. While, the benefit ratio was higher on a year-over-year basis, the portfolio experience was generally consistent with the 71.8% benefit ratio for the full year 2015.","Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $93.8 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11.3% compared to $84.3 million in the year ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong for this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter compared to last year.","From the benefits perspective, results were in line with our expectations. The fourth quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 33.8% on an interest adjusted basis and 48% for the voluntary benefits lines.","Looking at Unum U.K., operating income was \u00a324.4 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.2% over the year-ago quarter of \u00a324.1 million. The benefit ratio was 69.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 68.8% in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher interest claim incidence trends in the group long-term disability and group life lines of business, which were partially offset by improved claim recoveries. Overall profitability of the U.K. segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE at 20.6% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year.","Colonial Life continues to generate strong consistent results with operating income of $77.6 million, a 4.9% increase over the year-ago quarter of $74 million. The benefit ratio improved to 51.2% for the fourth quarter compared to 52.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experienced in the accident, sickness and disability product line. Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE at 16.4% this quarter and 16.6% for the full year.","Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $29.4 million in the year-ago quarter, excluding the 2014 long-term care reserved charge. The benefits experienced for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations.","The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 87.2% in the fourth quarter compared to 81% in the year-ago quarter, was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of miscellaneous net investment income. For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 89.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 89.6% for the year-ago quarter, excluding the reserve charge.","The underlying risk experience for long-term care was consistent with our long-term expectations for the full year 2015 interest adjusted loss ratio of 87.6% within our expected range of 85% to 90%.","Regarding, the reserve position for long-term care, we feel good about where we finished 2015 in terms of reserved adequacy. For the year, our new money yields exceeded our interest rate assumptions and risk results remained within our long-term expectations. In addition, rate increase approvals and implementation are tracking in line with our reserve assumptions.","One additional comment on long-term care, the cash flow testing reserve addition we recorded for our New York subsidiary First Unum was $68 million at yearend 2015.","I'll now move to the growth trends we experienced across the company in the quarter. Again, starting with Unum U.S. total sales declined by 3.7% for the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected, as we had very strong sales results from the year-ago fourth quarter and we continue to increase rates during the year. For the full year, Unum U.S. sales increased by 4.2%, which was solidly above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth.","Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the fourth quarter, but increased 7.2% for the full year. STD sales declined by 20% for the fourth quarter, but grew slightly for the full year increasing 5.8%.","Our Group Life and AD&D sales declined 2.5% for the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. Also, within Unum U.S. we had strong sales results in individual disability for the fourth quarter, increasing 30.4% to $21 million, driven by success with large case enrollments. Full year sales growth for the individual disability line was 18.8%.","Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 7.4% for the fourth quarter. Core market voluntary benefit sales showed very good growth, while large case sales were lower, against a very strong large case quarter last year. Full year 2015 sales and voluntary benefits increased 10.3% with good balance between the core market and large case sales.","Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum U.S. calls for growth rate in 2% to 4% range again. It's likely that we'll see quarterly volatility, as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility of timing of large case sales.","Persistency for Unum U.S. continues at healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was 90.3% for the full year 2015, which was stable with the 90.5% for 2014. Given these sales trends and persistency levels, along with the underlying management of in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth for Unum U.S. this quarter of 5.5%. Full year premium growth was 6.4%, consistent with our long-term outlook for this segment and our strongest rate of growth in many years.","Sales in Unum U.K. rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter, increasing 11.2% in local currency with favorable trends in the core market group long-term disability product line and in group life. For the full year, sales grew by 6.2%. Persistency in the group disability line was 89.2% for the full year of 2015, up slightly from 2014 levels, but in line with our expectations.","Persistency for the group life line continues to recover at 80% for full year 2015, up from 76% in 2014. Premium income growth for the U.K. this quarter was 5.4% in local currency, including the impact of the acquisition of the dental business in the third quarter and 2.3% for full year, above our expectations of 0% to 2% growth.","Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on a positive trend, increasing 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 6.9% for the full year. Growth this quarter was again well-balanced between the commercial market sector, both the core market sales and large case sales and the public sector. In addition, each product line showed positive year-over-year growth.","Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower for the year at 78.5% compared to 79.4% for 2014, but premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.1% in the fourth quarter compared to year-ago quarter. Full year premium growth was also 5.1%, well above the top end of our expectation of 2% to 4% growth. Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see in our core business segments, as well as the profit margins we're maintaining.","Looking now at investment results, new money yields were slightly better in the fourth quarter compared to the first nine months of 2015. However, to date, new money yields remain below our current portfolio yields, so the downward pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability. We're actively raising prices in our markets to help manage this impact.","The credit quality of our investment portfolio remains in very good shape. Our overall default experience relative to the Moody's index was again very favorable at 15 basis points for full year 2015 compared to 80 basis points for the index.","I'd like to give you an update on our energy-related holdings, which totaled $5 billion or 11.6% of our total fixed maturity securities at yearend 2015. The severe widening of credit spreads in the energy sector during the fourth quarter reduced the net unrealized gain from $302.8 million, as of September 30, 2015, to a net unrealized loss of $51.4 million at December 31, 2015.","We saw relatively more spread widening in the oilfield services and independent oil and gas sectors of our portfolio. As we discussed with you on our Outlook Meeting at December, these sectors tend to be the most sensitive companies to oil prices. The sectors represent 4% and 29.8% of our energy holdings, respectively, and had a net unrealized loss of $114.9 million as of yearend.","The remaining two-thirds of our energy holdings are in midstream companies, integrated oil companies and refiners. These holdings are much less sensitive to oil prices and have a net unrealized gain of $63.5 million at yearend.","Our exposure to below investment grade energy credits declined slightly in the quarter to 14.1% of the energy holdings compared to 14.8% at the end of the third quarter. Approximately three quarters of the below-investment grade exposure is in the more highly rated BB category. Realized losses in energy holdings from both losses on sales and from impairments were $20.1 million pre-tax for the fourth quarter.","We have thoroughly reviewed our energy holdings and looked at a number of stressed scenarios. While downgrades of holdings and some impairments may happen over time, we feel the impacts are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans.","Moving to capital management, we continue to see very favorable trends. We repurchased $100 million of our stock this quarter, bringing the total repurchases to $427 million in full year 2015, which is approximately 4.9% of our yearend 2014 outstanding shares. We estimate, we closed the year with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies at approximately 400% consistent with the levels we've held throughout the year, and towards the higher end our expected range for the year.","Holding company cash and marketable securities was $475 million at yearend and statutory operating earnings were $182.4 million for the fourth quarter and $689.2 million for full year 2015, a strong sales level of earnings in an 11.5% increase over 2014.","Finally, I'll note our tax rate in the fourth quarter of 28.5% was favorable relative to the 30.9% rate that we've recorded for the first three quarters of the year. This was primarily driven by a reduction in deferred tax liability related to our U.K. operations, as a result of the enactment of future reductions in the U.K. tax rate. And also the benefit of the extension of active financing in the fourth quarter that reverse the tax expense we've recorded in the third quarter.","Wrapping up, our expectation for after-tax operating income per share for 2016 has not changed from what we previously discussed at our Outlook Meeting in December. We did finished 2015 with a higher level of income than we had anticipated, so the growth rate for 2016 off of the $3.64 up 2015 operating income per share is expected to be within a range of 3% to 6%. So overall, it was a very good fourth quarter and a very strong full year performance for the company.","Now, I'll turn things back to Rick for his closing comments.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Jack. And just to wrap up before we go on to your questions. I'll reiterate from a company operating perspective, it was a very good quarter and year for our company. We've seen the resumption of topline growth for our core businesses and done so without sacrificing our profitability.","Our statutory earnings are strong, which helps to generate capital to not only maintain a very healthy balance sheet for a troubling macro environment, but also a flexibility to grow and also return capital to our shareholders. This all positions us very well, as we move into 2016.","We'll move now on to your questions, so I'll ask Cynthia to begin the questions-and-answer session. Cynthia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","In supplemental and voluntary, the benefit ratios were a little bit higher than they have been running recently? And then DAC amortization was lower. Can you talk about what drove those two things? And if they were, I guess, related to each other?","Jack McGarry","There is some relation particularly in the voluntary benefit lines. Some of the products within those lines have active life reserves. And so if those policies terminate, you release the active life reserve and you write up the DAC associated with them. Actually, our persistency was a little better, particularly in those product lines that have those active life reserves and so that resulted in a little bit higher loss ratio and a little bit lower amortization of the DAC balance and net-net the earnings impact was very minimal.","Ryan Krueger","And then on long-term care, can you remind us what interest rate trajectory you're assuming in your GAAP long-term care reserves at this point?","Richard McKenney","Jack, do you want to take that?","Jack McGarry","Yes. So as we told you -- actually its been a year ago now in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had assume that interest rates would stay level with the rates they're at somewhere around the 5% range all in for the next years and then would gradually revert to a long-term average over the subsequent five years.","Ryan Krueger","So the 5% is a new money rate?","Jack McGarry","Yes, all in.","Ryan Krueger","And then, Rick, you said new money rates were bit better than that in 2015? Do you know where they are now?","Richard McKenney","I mean, it's hard to tell with treasury yields have clearly gone down over the last couple of weeks, spreads have widened since the end of the year, so I wouldn't have a spot rate for you.","Operator","And next we have John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.","John Nadel","I guess, Rick, a bit of a philosophical question for you. I find it kind of staggering, I guess, the market is somewhere around 10% off of its all time highs and yet Unum's shares are trading 30%, 35% below your 52 week high, and sort of staggering discount to book-value per share. I am just curious how you think about the pace of capital management in particular when you think about a 400% risk-based capital ratio relative to your business mix and that coming off of a very strong year of statutory operating income in 2015?","Richard McKenney","Sure, John. Just to give you some perspectives on that, I think that one of the things that I'd bring you back to very quickly though is we operate this company in the same way we've been operating it, very consistent. We're growing the company now, margins are still very good. And we as a team here are focused very much on that.","In terms of what's going on in the market around us, so there's a lot of things out there in the news, continued lower interest rate environment, questions about the economy, there's so many things that impact our stock price, we try not to focus on that from an operating perspective.","Well, it does actually meet up with how we think about managing the capital of the company, as we are buying back our shares and have been doing so for the last several years. So when you look at that, you think about where we're buying back shares today relative to where we were, even in the fourth quarter and for over the average of the year, and how does that impact for our thinking.","And what I take you to, and this gets to your philosophical point is, we actually on that front stay very consistent as well. So we think about ourselves as being a steady returner, more capital to our shareholders. We'll buy a little bit more when prices are down and a little bit less when prices are up, but consistency of return is something that we focus on as a general philosophy of the company, but also with regards to capital management.","So as we look at where our share price is today, we would be buying a lot more shares in terms of the actual dollars that we're putting out, you'll probably see a pretty consistent level to what we've done in the past.","John Nadel","So no significant -- if we think about it relative to your outlook for 2016, I think you had formally indicated that dollar amount of buybacks would probably be pretty similar to the level spent in 2015, no significant adjustment there then, Rick?","Richard McKenney","I think that's probably fair. And when you think about it, we're buying back shares with the capital, with free capital we're generating, so this isn't something other than as we generate that capital, which we've done so very consistently, we're returning that to our shareholders through share repurchase, and as a result of that our steady operating performance would say that we'll be pretty steady in terms of returning capital as well.","John Nadel","And then a quick one on the tax rate. Just is there any implication, as you look out to 2016, Jack, as a result of the U.K. adjustment or do we stick with the 31% to 32% range that I think you guys have expected for this year?","Jack McGarry","No, I think that 31% to 32% range that was kind of a one-time shift. It's not going to really move when you've got that much going forward.","John Nadel","And then last one is maybe for, Mike, and that's just a question about January 1, very important, obviously, sales and retention period. Any color you can offer as to what's going on in the U.S. market there?","Michael Simonds","So first would be, you're right, it is an important date for us on the renewal front, a good news there. So persistency is in line with what our expectations are. That's great, that the big driver of the topline. But also, as you know, we've been putting gradual price increases into the market about every six months over the last 18 months to 24 months.","So sticky business is always good, but particularly, when you're gradually increasing rates, particularly in group insurance to account for the low interest rate environment that we talked about, so feel good about that.","On the new business front, you'd sort of see a slight decline in sales this year. I think we're down about 3% in the fourth quarter. But as both Rick and Jack highlighted, actually 4Q came in right in line with our expectations. We faced a really difficult comp, up 25% a year ago. So good to finish for the full year, right at or just over to top of the range we laid out to you guys at the beginning of the year.","Operator","And our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","First, if you could discuss the potential for reductions in the disability reserve discount rate, given what's happened with interest rates? And maybe, if you could provide us some sort of sensitivity on what a basis points change in the discount rate would do to your benefits ratio in the U.S. disability business?","Richard McKenney","Jack, do you want to pick up?","Jack McGarry","Yes, so we've seen reductions, we've seen the interest rates fall since yearend. This is very similar to what happened last year, actually too, during this period. It doesn't mean they're going to stay there for the full year. We've also seen spreads widening. I'd point you back to the fourth quarter, where actually our new money rates were higher than we've seen in quite a while. And we're supportive about reserve assumptions in both disability lines, as well as long-term care lines. We keep track of that.","We keep raising rates in response to the lower interest environment. We look for opportunities to book money to work at good yields. And it's something we'll look at during the year. I'd say that we're pretty comfortable right now that throughout 2015 that we won't be forced to take a precipitous action, because we have a good margin and interest margin now in our reserves, but its something we continue to look at and decide, as we do our reserve reviews.","Richard McKenney","And the sensitivity is about 25 basis points, is about roughly $12 million in BTOE on an annualized basis.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then, on long-term care, obviously rates are challenging, but how are the other things going, as the claims trends your success in achieving price hikes versus what you might assumed when you took the reserve charge in the fourth quarter of 2014?","Jack McGarry","Yes, so actually, since we took the charge in 2014 things have been pretty much in line with our expectations. There has been some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but client trends has stayed in that range of the 85% to 90% loss ratio. And we continue to make good progress on our rate increase assumption, so both the rate of approvals and the actual implementations are pretty much in line with the underlying reserve assumptions.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just lastly on long-term care. As you mentioned, you're assuming stable rates or you assumed stable rates for five years and then an increase in rates thereafter. So philosophically, if rates remain lower through this year or maybe even next year, you would have gone two to three years into that. Would you review your assumptions again or would you just wait for the first five years to go through and then review them?","Jack McGarry","We consistently review our assumptions. So we do reserve reviews at the end of every year based on the assumptions, and I think the question we would ask ourselves when looking at that is has our outlook for the future changed. And it's not going to change rapidly, but certainly something we continue to look at as we do our reserve reviews.","Operator","And our next question is from Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner","I guess, I just want to follow-up on Jimmy's question there because I guess the mean reversion, I guess, by definition gets worse every year that rates stay low. So just to paraphrase that, are you saying that the mean reversion hasn't changed enough for you to unlock now, but if we're sitting at the similar or lower level rates from a year from now, would that kind of technically lead to an unlock, just because the data is changing?","Jack McGarry","No, I wouldn't say, it would technically lead to an unlock. Again, it's something we will look at what our view of the future is when we do our reserve reviews at yearend, but there is no magic kind of we have to do this if this happens associated with it.","Richard McKenney","I think unlike, you mention the word unlock, and this is not an unlock. So when you look at it, this is also not a mean reversion. So this is a view on path of interest rate, so over a 10-year period of time. And as Jack said, that's an outlook that we had last year, going to through the process, and it really hasn't changed as of now. And so it's not something that we look at a mean reversion, as you think about traditional method.","Randy Binner","And then just jumping over to the credit side. Is there any update -- the disclosure around your energy exposure is very good relative to your peer, so we appreciate that. And as you mentioned in the opening remarks, the unrealized loss really is not that big, at least as of yearend.","I'd be interested in any update kind of on what year-to-date activities look like there from an unrealized position? And if there has been any action by Unum to de-risk energy or any other credits that are moving out or if conversely you're seeing this as maybe an opportunity to add more at wider spreads?","Jack McGarry","We're certainly not starting with the last thing first. We're not viewing this as an opportunity to add more at wider spreads. We always actively manage our portfolio. So we are a credit shop. We're looking at our energy things. Spreads have widened since yearend, so that unrealized loss would be somewhat bigger. We haven't fully valued the portfolios yet, so we don't know what the size of that is.","But again, probably the important thing to note is we are all over our energy portfolio. We looked at, we stress tested it under a number of different scenarios. When we look at it, we consider both the realized losses that we may have to take, as well as the RBC impact of any downgrades that we would foresee. And because of the strong financial position we go into 2016 with, we view this as a very manageable issue for us. There is nothing we see right now that would change our outlook for capital plans for 2016.","Randy Binner","On the stress test is there anything you can share with those? You're talking about ratings migration down and RBC ratio, and then just, I guess, straight credit losses. Is there anything you can share on what you've run from a stress case scenario?","Jack McGarry","I mean, we start with an oil price trajectory and a set of assumptions around that. I'm not going to go into the specifics of what that trajectory is, but it's actually consistent with, if not, more conservative than kind of overall market estimates and we've taken some downside scenarios from there. And throughout, it's not that -- there are some things that come up there, but they're very manageable within our capital plan.","Operator","The next is Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik Bass","I guess, as you went through the yearend enrollment season, did you see any material change in consumer behavior, particularly in terms of election rates for voluntary products?","Richard McKenney","Mike, you want to start and then we'll go to Tim.","Michael Simonds","In general, actually, we saw it's slightly higher participation rates. And while we're still debriefing and understanding, I think a couple of things contributing. First has been across both the Unum and Colonial Life brand continued investments in our enrollment and education capabilities that we always want to be a little bit better each year at what we do.","And then the other piece was we certainly saw disposable income. You look at where the price of oil that created a little of capacity I think for the average consumers, so that played through as well.","Richard McKenney","Tim, on Colonial Life?","Timothy Arnold","Yes, absolutely. We saw the same trends. And the only thing I would add aside from what Mike mentioned is we continue to believe that both the Affordable Care Act, as well as employer behavior around deductibles on medical plans are helping drive some increased participation in our products as well.","Erik Bass","And then, can you just remind this how much exposure you have to the energy sector or to related sectors from a client perspective?","Richard McKenney","Yes, sure. So I think we look at it across all the product lines, but probably most acutely in the long-term disability product line. We've got about 2% of our block in energy. And we've actually gone back and looked at the cycle of energy prices over a couple of decades and haven't really seen much for a correlation with incidence, and we're certainly not seeing any misbehaving risk from this point, but we look at pretty much every industry sector all the time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just a follow-up on the investment yield. You talked about 2015 being a little higher. What are you seeing in terms of value right now, kind of getting you to that 5% range, especially for supporting the long-term care?","Jack McGarry","I think it's driven by two things. One of the big ones is spreads widened. And although, the yield curve has flattened at the front-end, it's still stayed pretty steady at the long-end, so the spread between the 10 year and the 30 year is still in that 75 basis point to 85 basis point range.","And so when you invest in longer maturities, which as a result of some of the M&A activity, there is a lot more long tranches available. And you put the widened spreads on top of those you get up above the 5% range through the end of the year. There is also alternative investments, we put a portion of the portfolio -- have continued to put a portion into high yield where spreads have widened as well.","Humphrey Lee","And then some of your peers talked about there is some disruptions in a group insurance marketplace, because of company's exiting the business or consolidations going on. Can you just talk abut in general the overall market environments for Unum U.S. and Colonial Life?","Richard McKenney","Mike, you want to start?","Michael Simonds","Sure. So we have seen a bit of consolidation with a few names, I'd say, sort of mid-sized coming together and\/or being required by an international player. I wouldn't say that that has led to a significant disruption. So if we look at things like, again, the renewal rates for us have been right in line to slightly favorable.","I think the proposal activity has been generally in line with what we've seen across the segment, so not a big disruption I would point to. But I do think if you think about the market in general, there's sort of the capabilities that are offered and we have seen a few new entrants into the market, but the good news for us is capabilities in terms of the process, the technology, and the people, they take a substantial amount of time to build, so we feel pretty good about the head start we have there.","The pricing environment, just to give you some color, I would say is pretty typical. We've got a few carriers that are having stepped back and repriced to improve margins. And then we've got a few that are probably leaning a bit more into growing their books, and I think that kind of balances out, so a pretty typical pricing environment.","Timothy Arnold","Yes, I think the story is similar. We are now seeing any disruption based on consolidation. Blocks have been very stable. And where I think they will show up first will be in our large case block and we're not seeing any disruption there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovac","A technical question here. I'm thinking about the bond portfolio. When we look at some of the unrealized los positions that have been there for over a year and that grew obviously in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, how do you determine when you take an impairment on those bonds? Is it well, sort of the level at which they're trading below fair value or is there certain time horizon? Just maybe if you could give some help in terms of thinking about when you would take such a charge?","Richard McKenney","Jack, you want to share our views on that.","Jack McGarry","So, there is no hard and fast rules around when you would recognize an impairment, but there are some guidelines, and we consider four things. The first is, is it money good, so do we believe that we're going to get principal on interest payments out of it. The second thing we'll consider is do we intend to hold it to recovery, and so if we do, that would keep it at book value.","The third thing you consider is, are they current on interest on principal payments. And then beyond that, it tends to be a security-by-security analysis, its a judgment about whether we believe over time this will recover and be money good, and so there is no hard and fast rules. We work with our investment department, we work with our auditors, and we come to judgments on the securities.","Michael Kovac","And then switching gears a little bit, thinking about the environment for rate increases in long-term care, it sounded like it came in sort of in line with your expectations. Are you seeing any change in tone from regulators, as we continue to be in a low interest rate environment, both in terms of your position in the market and in terms of seeing some other companies, maybe we consider whether they are writing new business in long-term care?","Jack McGarry","I think we've continued to see a positive tone from regulators. It's certainly better today than it was three or four years ago. Even some of the kind of late adopter states like New York are seem to be coming along and considering rate increases in a different light, given the environment. So I think it continues to get better over time.","Operator","Our next comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg","Jack, in the Investor Day that you held back in December, I was really interested in the whole discussion about how the Closed Block of individual disability business is increasingly looking like a lifetime annuity. And I was also very interested in the distinctions that you drew in the risk characteristics of your group LTC business that is closed versus your individual business.","My inference was that maybe these businesses could be sellable, re-insurable or that somehow you could free up the capital this year. Was that the right inference? You answered no on that. And was that the right inference? And if it was the right inference, what would be the process that would follow this year to move forward on that front?","Jack McGarry","Clearly, looking at capital management opportunities on both of those blocks is something that we actively do and consistently. Whether those opportunities can actually come to fruition this year, it would be really hard to say. So it's something we look at and we're in constant communications with alternative sources of capital, but being able to predict whether something will actually happen or not would be beyond what I could do.","Eric Berg","And if I could just ask one follow-up question and that would be to Rick. Rick, if the company is as flexible and as an opportunistic as you say it is, if you have the capital strength to be flexible and opportunistic, then why wouldn't you -- going back to John's question, why wouldn't you with the stock price where it is step up your dollar amount of share repurchase to take advantage of this opportunity?","Richard McKenney","Yes, it's a fair question, Eric. I think it gets back to the pace at which we're doing that. We do have that flexibility. We could do that if we so choose. But it comes back to the philosophy we have in the company around, as we generate the capital we're going to return it to the shareholders. Some of the excess capital positions we hold, we think about it using and how we could deploy that to grow the company in different areas. And so it's been much more on that philosophy.","You have to remember, we've been doing this now, if you go back for the last seven years. And so over that period of time, we've seen our stock price move up and down. Often times it's not related to what's going on in the company. And so we've taken advantage of some low stock prices and at the same time we bought back shares when we were at a higher price.","And so I think now is the right time to pile in, to buying a whole a lot of shares, I think that that's atypical for our company. We're much more disciplined, much more consistent in how we look at things.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James.","Steven Schwartz","First for Jack, I apologize I got cut out on Randy's question with regards to energy. Jack, do you know or did you say, what the market-to-market loss would be on the below investment grade energy portfolio at yearend?","Jack McGarry","No, we did not say that.","Steven Schwartz","Could you share?","Timothy Arnold","The high yield, let's see we were trade out -- yes, so just to breakdown the numbers, we have $51.4 million of unrealized loss at yearend, right. So on the investment grade side it was an unrealized gain of $138.3 million. And so the high yield is trading in an unrealized loss of $189.7 million.","Steven Schwartz","And then another numbers question. Jack, that was a $69 million charge that you took at Unum New York for long-term care at yearend?","Jack McGarry","Very close, $68 million.","Steven Schwartz","And could you remind me is that in the statutory operating earnings that you show in the supplement?","Jack McGarry","No, I believe it's a capital adjustment, yes.","Steven Schwartz","And then for, Mike, maybe you could talk about kind of fourth quarter, kind of natural growth trends. I know you said elections were up a little bit, but maybe employment as well. Talk about that, any other thing, and also obviously for Colonial?","Michael Simonds","Yes, sure. So pretty actually consistent with the last few quarters where it is a positive, but it's a very modest positive, and probably a point or a point-and-a-half lower than what we would see in a healthier part of the cycle. We definitely have been looking at the macro numbers. See good unemployment change and good employment growth. Unfortunately, a fair amount of that is coming in lower benefited part time and non-benefit eligible type employees.","So it's not flowing through at a commensurate level into our book. One would have to believe that overtime if we're able to sustain reasonable GDP growth and continued strong employment numbers, that will start moving through all the tranches on the employment base, but little bit modest at this point.","Timothy Arnold","I think, probably not specific to natural growth, but we are seeing nice results in the small case market, as we shared at the Outlook Meeting. We see a lot of opportunity in that market with almost 6 million employers in the list in the less than 100 states. And we certainly think that that group is benefiting from the economic environment. We think they're growing their employee base, but we're seeing nice results there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet Kamath","So I guess to echo John Nadel's question, I mean, segment results here remain pretty strong, but you've not been able to tell from the stock price. So clearly there's something else going on which I think is based on the questions asked is the investment portfolio. So maybe would be helpful, if you give us a sense, as we think about that capital generation model that you shared with us last December, what sort of credit loses do you build into that model?","Jack McGarry","Yes. In that model, we gave an outlook on the capital plan. We didn't specifically in building out that model put the capital losses in there. We have stressed the model, however, with capital losses under various scenarios and basically the tenants of the model particularly around free cash flow generation and share repurchase hold up very well under the stresses.","Suneet Kamath","We focused a lot on the energy portfolio today, but as you think about just the overall portfolio, your high-yield exposure, your BBB exposure, any more color in terms of your watch list and what you're seeing as things develop here?","Jack McGarry","The watch list has been pretty consistent. It is mostly energy and commodities at this point. We feel extremely good about the rest of the portfolio.","Suneet Kamath","And the last one is again maybe more of a philosophical question. As we think about your capital allocation across your businesses, it seems like the portion that's allocated to the Closed Block is, I don't know, almost a little over a third of your capital, maybe 35%, 36%. Is that factored into your thinking, n other words, is there a limit in terms of how big you want that allocation to be?","It would seem to me that most of the capital that you're using for share repurchase is coming out of the operating segment, so naturally there would be some upward drift in that allocation. Just want to get a sense of how should we be thinking about that number? Is it a binding constraint at all? Any guidance would be helpful.","Richard McKenney","I'm not sure if it's philosophical. When we think about the capital allocation to our Closed Block, that's not where we want to be putting our capital today. So the numbers you see here today are higher than we want them to be. And I think that gets back to the question that Jack was answering is how do we free up that capital, how we reduce the capital behind those lines of business, so that we can continue to do what we've been doing in funneling more capital to our operating companies.","We're also in a fortunate position that we are generating enough capital as a company that our business lines, our main operating companies are getting all the capital that they need to continue to generate growth. I think the only constraint is more in the market and making sure that there's good profitable growth as opposed to the amount of capital we can put behind it.","So as we tell everyone inside the company is we want to funnel as much capital as we possibly can to continue to grow our lines of business. And what we haven't found is actually a shortfall to do so and that's one of the reasons we're buying back a lot of stock is because we actually can't put as much capital as we want to behind our growing lines that are generating very high returns.","So back to original question, I think that the capital allocating to our Closed Block is one that we want to reduce over time. And as we talked about different settings, that's something we're actively working on as a company.","Suneet Kamath","And then just on the IDI to follow-up on Eric Berg's question. If you were to pursue a solution, just trying to get a sense of how much capital you think that could free, would it be wrong to assume that would be $200 million?","Jack McGarry","Yes. I mean, I don't think we can speculate on that until we have a better idea of what a solution might look like.","Operator","And our next question is from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher","First question just on long-term care. So the interest adjusted loss ratio is in the high 80s? And I know that's in kind of the high end of the band that you all have looked at.","I guess, just a follow-up, as we think about whether it's 2016 or 2017 and potential risk of another reserved charge, is it fair to say that if this moves north of 90%, is that where you'd be potentially vulnerable for a possible reserve charge, which I presume would be more on the claim side, in terms of, if you saw an escalation of claim trends or adverse reserve development. But can you help us think about the numbers, the interest adjust loss ratio and then potentially additions to reserves?","Jack McGarry","I would say that it's a lot more complicated than that. The reserve basis of long-term care is very detail. There is a lot of sensitive assumptions that interplay. We're thinking guidance that if you were above 90% for a long period of time that would be an indication of pressure on the reserves. But it wouldn't react to one or two quarters in that range and it would really depend long-term on what the factors were that would driving you above 90%.","Tom Gallagher","So I think in the past, you guys have been able to say or give some indication about what at least the next year's outlook would be? Would you say based on what you know today, there would be very low likelihood of a reserve addition in 2016 or is it too early to tell?","Jack McGarry","I mean, I don't think we've actually provided outlooks on our reserve position today at yearend. I would say we feel comfortable with where we are today. We just went through a reserve review that culminated in the quarter we're talking about. So we're as close to our ending reserve review as you can get. We feel good about that reserved review and where it ended, but I'm not going to speculate about what next year's reserve reviews are going to generate.","Tom Gallagher","And then, just back on the energy portfolio $372 million of growth unrealized losses, it was the number at yearend. And I know year-to-date spreads have obviously gapped out further. Do you have an update on where that would be? And then can you also just talk a little bit about your process of looking at bonds that trade, say, less than $0.80 on the dollars. How does that process work internally? Is there further due diligence at certain levels? Is it $0.80, is at $0.70? Anyway, those are both questions I had on it.","Jack McGarry","So clearly, the spreads have widened in the energy sector since yearend, so that $370 million would be wider. We do monthly evaluations on most of the bonds in our portfolio, that's not complete right now and so we don't have a number for you that we can share.","With respect to what we look at, again, I bring you back to the first one we look at, is it money good. Do we tend to hold it through recovery? And then are they current with interest and principal payments? You talk about the review of bonds that are under a certain percent of market to book. The fact of the matter in our energy portfolio today, we are consistently reviewing those bonds.","We're looking at all the high yield bonds. We're looking at those bonds on an ongoing basis and actively working to manage through this, so I don't think there's anything special about bonds necessarily by where they're trading relative to book, because we're looking at that entire portfolio on a constant basis.","Tom Gallagher","Well, just as a follow upon that, I thought the concept of OTTI was that even if bonds are money good, but it's determined to be trading at an impaired level on a permanent basis, that's where bonds are impaired, at least from a gap accounting standpoint. That sort of what I was getting at from the standpoint of, not so much are you writing it down from a statutory standpoint, but from a GAAP standpoint, the concept of OTTI is a price-driven concept, not a loss-driven concept, if you know what I mean.","Jack McGarry","And our view is it's not a bright line loss-driven concept. The big question there is, as you said, is it temporary or not? And so the question we have is do we expect it to -- if its money good it's going to recover, because ultimately it's going to pay off and you'll get all your proceeds.","And so, again, it comes back to those things, is it money good, do we intend to hold this, is it current? And clearly the longer and lower it trades, kind of the more pressure and the more work you need to do to demonstrate that those first three are actually true and believable, but it is not a bright line issue.","Operator","And our next question is from Seth Weiss from Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","Just to approach the question on sensitivity to capital on the investment portfolio, if we look at that 45% of the portfolio that's at Baa, could you help us think about how much of that may be at risk to moving to below investment grade? And then on sensitivity to the risk-based capital level, is there a rule of thumb that if you could gave us in terms of every percent increase to below investment grade? And what that may do to RBC, as we have some ratings migrations?","Jack McGarry","I can give you a couple of things to tether to. One is if we look at the portfolio, and said, if every single bond in our energy portfolio was downgraded a single notch, so Baa2 went to Baa3 and Baa3 went to BB, what would be the impact be, that's a four point impacts on our risk-based capital. The second tether point I'd give you, if everything dropped a full letter, so all our BBB's went to BB's, all of our AA's went to BBB that would be a 15 point impact to our risk-based capital.","Calculating the impact on risk-based capital is more complicated than just looking at the change in the RBC factors, because C1 capital gets tax affected and so that reduces the burden. There is also a significant diversification benefit with C1 capital that further reduces the impact relative to those numbers. So it's something that that we really need to don't work through, but it's far less of an impact then just looking at the change in the percent capital holdings and multiplying them by 3.5.","Seth Weiss","And then one very quick follow-up on just the interest margin and on LTD. I think last quarter you were at around 85 basis points in terms of that margin. Could you just give us an update of where that stands today?","Jack McGarry","It's in the low 80s.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.","John Nadel","So thanks for extending and taking the follow-up. So there's a lot of questions and a lot of focus obviously on given what rates are doing on the long-term care block. I just want to make sure I had a couple of data points accurate. If I think about when you took the fourth quarter 2014 charge, it would have been based on -- if I understand it correctly, it would have been based on where interest rates were at right around that time in the end of the year.","So the tenure was at 2.17%, it averaged 2.54% for 2015, and it's now down at 1.84% or so. I mean spreads have widened enough to well offset that 30 or so basis point reduction in the tenure, have they not? I mean, it sort of seems to me like this issue of a potential long-term care charge driven by rates necessitates a view that rates fall significantly further from here, is that reasonable?","Jack McGarry","Yes, I would say that's reasonable. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are right now.","John Nadel","And then the last one I have for you is just a follow-up on the mechanism for the IDI Closed Block. There is a elevated level of prepayments income I believe in the Closed Block in the fourth quarter. And then if you look at the interest adjusted individual disability benefit ratio that was up, that is a mechanism by which you're essentially recognizing the faster payment of that investment income by shoring up the reserves with that investment income today, is that right?","Jack McGarry","Yes, because that money is going to be invested at new money rates, so it's going to put pressure on the portfolio rate underlying the discount rate. And so we reduced the discount rate to likely offset that impact.","John Nadel","And then last one is just if I go back to your Investor Day presentation, I think I'm looking at something around $950 million, maybe slightly less than a $1 billion of cash flow to invest in 2016 for the total Closed Block. And I recognize that a 1% difference in the new money yield has more than a one-year impact, right in that investment income, but we are talking about $10 million difference in a single year for 1%, is that right?","Richard McKenney","The $1 billion is roughly right, so depending on how it comes in over the year and what rates do over the year, that's pretty rough math.","Jack McGarry","But it's also that $1 billion will be invested over the year, so it's not invested one-one, so it would be less than $10 million.","John Nadel","I understand, but the differential between investing at a rate 1 percentage point lower on average is literally $10 million pre-tax in a year, correct?","Richard McKenney","Correct.","Jack McGarry","Yes.","End of Q&A","Richard McKenney","John, thanks for that follow-up. And actually, we're over time now, so I think we'll cut it off here, Cynthia. I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this morning. Actually, we look forward to seeing many of you at investor conferences in the weeks ahead. And so that completes our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas White","Great. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call for Unum. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause the results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the section titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, as well as our subsequently filed Form 10-Q. Our SEC filings can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.unum.com.","I'll remind you that statements in today's call speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found on our website also in the Investors section. Participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, our President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; and also the presidents of our 3 business segments, Kevin McCarthy for Unum US; Randy Horn for Colonial Life; and Jack McGarry for Unum UK.","And so now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning. As you saw from our announcement last evening, operating earnings per share grew by 3.9% this quarter and despite the headwinds, I'm pleased with the performance of most of our businesses.","Let me highlight a few points. First, Unum US and Colonial continued to generate solid results, striking a good balance between growing the businesses while maintaining strong, predictable profitability. The Unum US premium grew 4% as we continued to see strong sales growth, especially in our core markets and voluntary benefit lines and persistency was solid across most of our product lines. When combined with a stable benefit ratio, this business continues to generate a consistent ROE of between 13% and 14%. At Colonial, premium grew at about 5% this quarter. And while sales were relatively flat year-over-year, the margins in this business continue to hold up quite well, and the result is that this businesses continues to generate a consistent return on equity of between 16% and 17%. You'll see that the earnings for this business are down slightly year-over-year and this is due to extraordinary high investment income last year and not a weakening the underlying business.","Next, with all that said I am generally pleased with our operating performance but more exceptionally with our Unum UK business. While it remains solidly profitable and generated a return on equity around 12% this quarter, the level of profitability and the volatility of our results in this business are below our expectations. While this is our smallest business, it is a business and marketplace we like a great deal and I am confident that we can, over time, improve the performance of this business through pricing actions, rebalancing our mix of business and more consistent operating performance, and Rick will touch on that further in his remarks.","We you'll also -- you will see too the results for the quarter in our Closed Block segment improve somewhat over our first quarter results. That was the case for both our Individual Disability business as well as our Long-term Care business which, as you may recall, was added to our Closed Block segment in the fourth quarter of last year. New claim incidence in Long-term Care returned to more normal levels this quarter from the spike we saw in the first quarter. We said at the time that it would take a few quarters for the Long-term Care block to settle down and that seems to have been the case. That block will continue to be a challenge though, and Tom and Rick will both touch on this further in their remarks.","Now turning to our investment results. This past quarter was another strong quarter despite what obviously remains a very challenging investment environment. Today's extremely low rates will continue to pressure our investment income results, but we are working to mitigate this impact by implementing rate increases on new sales and renewals. While interest rate pressure will likely persist for some time, our credit quality remains strong and we are not going to deviate from the disciplined investment strategy which has served us so well through these difficult financial and economic times. We will sacrifice yield as need be to maintain a solid high-quality investment portfolio.","And lastly our capital position remains in very good shape with our risk-based capital level at 404%, above our target range of 375% to 400% that for the year, and all-in company cash was at $564 million. We continue to buy back stock repurchasing around $125 million this quarter, which brings our total repurchases over the past year to $550 million. You saw that our board approved a new share repurchase authorization and Rick will touch on that in his comments. I might add that in addition to repurchasing stock, dividend actions remain a part of our playbook as evidenced by the 24% dividend increase we announced in May, the fourth consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend.","So in summary, I continue to feel good about our position. Our overall operating trends are solid; our business unit returns are well above industry averages; our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape; and our capital position exceeds our long-term targets, providing us with significant financial flexibility. And looking ahead we expect cash flow to remain healthy allowing us to continue to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases, something I continue to believe has great value in these unsettling times. Given the weakness we have seen primarily in our U.K. business, we are adjusting the outlook we provided last year at the Investor Day meeting. We now believe that it will be slightly below the target range of 6% to 12% growth in operating earnings per share and Rick will touch on that more in just a moment.","Now I'll turn things back over to Tom for an overview of our operating results. Tom?","Thomas White","Great. Thank you, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday, we reported net income of $216.4 million for the second quarter of 2012 or $0.76 per diluted common share compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $227.6 million or $0.74 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the second quarter of 2012 are after-tax, nonoperating, retirement-related losses of $7.5 million and a net realized investment loss of $1.4 million. Included in last year's second quarter are nonoperating, retirement-related losses of $5.2 million and a realized investment loss of $2.2 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $225.3 million this quarter, or $0.79 per diluted common share compared to $235 million, or $0.76 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.","Turning to business segments, operating income for Unum US segment increased 3.5% to $212.7 million in the second quarter, with premium income increasing by 4.2% and both the expense ratio and benefit ratio showing improvements relative to the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the Unum US Group Disability line was $70.4 million dollars in the second quarter compared to $78.7 million last year. While premium income increased 1.7% over last year due to favorable sales and persistency trends, total revenue did decline fractionally or by 0.2% as net investment income declined 7.5% due to a lower level of miscellaneous investment income, lower assets allocated to this line and a slight drop in the investment yield. The benefit ratio was 84.7% in the second quarter, up slightly from the year ago 84.4%, but down slightly from the first quarter of 84.9%.","In the Group Life and AD&D line, operating income increased 10.2% to $57.3 million in the second quarter benefiting from an increase of 7.2% in premium income and higher net investment income due to a higher level of miscellaneous net investment income. And this offset an increase in the benefit ratio to 71.9% from 70.3% in the year-ago quarter. In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, second quarter income increased 13.5% to $85 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by solid growth in premium income which increased 5.7%, as well as favorable risk experience.","Moving to Unum U.K., operating income in this segment declined to GBP 19.1 million from GBP 34 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio increased to 85.4% in the second quarter from 69.8% in the year-ago quarter, while premium income in local currency increased 1.5%. Results in both the Group Disability and Group Life's business lines were below year-ago levels.","Concluding our core operations, Colonial Life reported a decline in operating income up 6% this quarter to 67.6 million. Premium income increased by 5.3%, which is generally consistent with the rate of premium growth we've seen at Colonial Life over the last several quarters. In addition, the benefit ratio of 52.5% is in line with our expectations for this business segment.","The results of the Closed Block segment showed a decline in operating income to $25.7 million from $30.4 million in the year-ago quarter with a strong improvement from the first quarter operating income of $15.4 million. Premium income declined by 1.4% due to the ongoing wind down of the Individual Disability Block. For the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $25.9 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $17 million in the second quarter last year. Net investment income is lower due to lower asset levels, a lower portion of assets invested at long-term interest rates and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships. The interest in debt expense was stable at $32.2 million in the second quarter compared to $32.3 million in the year-ago quarter. And finally, the tax rate in the second quarter is lower this quarter due primarily to the release of an $11 million tax liability related to unrecognized tax benefits.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis. Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Great, thank you, Tom. This morning I'll cover the margin trends we experienced in our business segments this quarter, a view on our growth trends and we'll also provide an update on our investment results and capital position and outlook for the second half of the year.","First, on our operating results in the second quarter, I'll start with Unum US. It was another very good quarter for the Unum US segment, with operating earnings growth of 3.5% and generally solid risk experience. Sales growth and persistency continued their positive trends as well. Starting on risk results for Group Disability, the benefit ratio was in line with the average of the past 2 years at 84.7% in second quarter. This quarter compares to the first quarter ratio of 84.9% and 84.4% in the year-ago quarter. Submitted new claim incidence trends for long-term disability were slightly higher, but with an average smaller claim size and higher claim recoveries, the financial impact was neutralized.","These favorable trends in LTD continue to be offset by somewhat weaker results in our short-term disability claim experience. We again saw higher paid incidence rates and higher average weekly indemnities. We believe the actions we are taking with pricing will firm up these results in STD over time. Importantly, we have not seen these trends in short-term disability claims trending through to our long-term disability results.","On the investment side, the interest reserve margin for this line declined 91 basis points -- 90 to 91 basis points this quarter from 97 basis points in the previous quarter. And we expect this margin to continue to gradually decline over the next several quarters given today's extremely low new money yields. Given the environment, it's also likely that we will work in reductions to our new claim discount rate like we did in the third quarter of last year. We'll balance this against a very healthy margin that we built up over the past several years on our inforce block and our ability to adjust pricing as business renews. Overall, we remain very pleased with our Unum US Group Disability results and the strong, consistent profitability that this business line continues to generate.","The Group Life and AD&D line was a very strong earnings contributor this quarter at $57.3 million, up 10%. Premium income increased by 7% and net investment income benefited somewhat from a higher miscellaneous net investment income this quarter, which together produced revenue growth of almost 8%. The benefit ratio was 72% in the second quarter, consistent with the first quarter, but up from a year ago level of 70%. Due to higher average claim size, which was somewhat offset by lower submitted claim incidence. The Supplemental and Voluntary line within Unum US produced its highest quarterly earnings this quarter with earnings of $85 million, an increase of 13.5% from last year's second quarter. Premium growth this quarter was 5.7% driven by almost 9% growth in the voluntary benefits line.","Risk experience was also very good with a benefit ratio of 49%. In the Individual Disability recently issued line, we saw a stable risk experience with lower paid claim incidence rates and higher claim recoveries. In the voluntary benefits line, we experienced lower claims and a lower average claim size for the voluntary disability line. The Supplemental and Voluntary line remains an attractive growth opportunity for our company, as well as a significant source of earnings.","Turning to the U.K., our results were weaker than we expected with operating earnings declining to GBP 19 million with unfavorable risk experience in both the Group Disability and Group Life lines. For Group Disability, the unfavorable risk experience was driven by a combination of higher average claim size and a lower average size of claims recovered -- claim recoveries. New claim incidence trends were generally flat but we did experience a lower level of declines. Group Life experience was driven by both higher volumes and average size of claims. Clearly these results are well below what we believe this business segment can generate and what it has historically generated. Again in this quarter, we saw different types of volatility which added to the challenge. But there are underlying pricing challenges we have seen in recent years that we need to address. We've talked about our pricing on the Group Disability side in last year and we continue to take price to return to profitability to the levels we've seen. The Group Life business has been more challenged in most recent quarters. It can inherently be more volatile given the size of the policies we write. But to restore the baseline profitability, we have come to expect it comes back to raising prices.","Overall, our outlook for the U.K. remains positive, but we do have work to do over the next several quarters and years to restore ROEs back to the 20% level from our current level of 12%. In the near-term, we expect quarterly earnings targeting a range of GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million, but we may continue to see volatility outside those bounds as we work to improve performance and contain this volatility.","Moving to Colonial Life, this segment produced another solid quarter. Results were lower than last year which benefited from unusually high miscellaneous and investment income but in line with our expectations. The loss ratio was slightly elevated in this year's second quarter, but they also are in the range of expectations. This is a very solid result that produced a 16.5% ROE for this quarter. Concluding my comments on margins, we're pleased to see the results of the Closed Block Long-term Care line of business improve from the result of the first quarter.","New LTC claims return to a more normal level this quarter after the spike we saw in the first quarter and the interest adjusted benefit ratio declined to 87.8% in the quarter from 91.2% in the first quarter. The contribution from our Long-term Care line remained below what we feel this line can generate over the longer term, but this quarter's performance was a strong improvement from the first quarter and indicative of what we expect from the Closed Block in total over the near-term.","Moving on to our sales trends, we remain very pleased with the trends we're seeing across our business line. Unum US continued the strong trend we have seen for the past few quarters with total sales for the second quarter increasing 9%. For the Group Disability and Group Life and AD&D combined, sales were also up 9%. With sales in the under 2,000 life core market increasing 11% and comprising about 3\/4 of the sales mix. Voluntary benefit sales were also good at increasing 8% for the quarter.","Persistency was also very high for Unum US at 91.7% for Group Long-term Disability and 91.6% for Group Life for the first half of the year. Given these strong trends, we produced 4% premium growth for the Unum US segment again in the second quarter with minimal help from the external environment or natural growth in the marketplace.","In the U.K., we continue to see somewhat better pricing trends in the market and with that, we are seeing better sales results particularly in the Group Disability line. Group Disability sales increased by 10% in local currency with positive trends in both the core and large case markets. You'll note that our Group Life sales were flat this quarter as we firm our pricing in this line as part of our strategy to improve the profitability in this segment.","And finally, premium increased 5.3% in Colonial Life this quarter consistent with the growth trends we've seen in recent quarters. New sales in total were essentially flat and we are slightly more encouraged with the core commercial market sales increase by 2%. The sales trend this quarter were consistent with the trends we've seen in the recent quarters. Sales to existing accounts remain generally strong while sales to new accounts are more of a challenge.","Moving on to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, we continue to be pleased with the excellent credit quality of our portfolio. The net unrealized gain position for our fixed maturity securities stands at $6.4 billion at the quarter end and our watch list of potential problem credits remains very low. Net realized after-tax investment, gains and losses on our portfolio was essentially breakeven on the quarter. Currently in the investing world, the challenge continues to be the low interest rate environment, there is no question it's difficult to put money to work at attractive yields. We continue to be selective in our asset purchases and as a result, the overall portfolio yield continues to hold up relatively well. The portfolio yield now stands at 6.59% compared to 6.67% at year end.","Similar to the first quarter, we continued to maintain higher-than-normal cash balances for our product portfolios as we search for the best possible investments. We think that is the right decision, but it does create a drag on our net investment income relative to our expectations coming into the year. We would like to catch up and be fully invested in the second half of the year, but we will remain selective and be opportunistic as possible. As such, net investment income for the balances of 2012 is likely to run below our initial outlook coming into the year.","With regard to the balance sheet, our capital position continues to be very healthy. Statutory net income was $158 million for our traditional U.S. life insurance company this quarter. Our run rate remains very solid and continues to support our capital model that generates about $500 million of free cash flow for the year. So weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies is approximately 404% above our 2012 target range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $564 million in quarter end in line in the first quarter level of $575 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased $125 million of our stock. So for the first half of the year we have completed $300 million of our $500 million plan.","We also announced yesterday that our board has authorized a $750 million share repurchase program. Our previous repurchase authorization is due to expire on August 2, today, and this new authorization will cover our expected repurchases for the balance of 2012 and give us flexibility as we develop our capital management plans for 2013.","And closing with a comment on our outlook, as we included in our earnings release and Tom mentioned earlier, we now believe that growth in operating earnings per share for 2012 will be below the range of 6% to 12% we originally discussed at our Investor Meeting last November. The primary driver for the lower outlook is the underperformance of that Unum UK segment that has emerged in 2012 and likely will continue for the balance of the year. Our outlook for Unum US and Colonial Life has not changed. Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. In closing and before we take your questions, as I said earlier, I'm generally pleased with our results this past quarter. We have continued to generate strong profitability and growth in Unum US and Colonial Life and have maintained a solid investment portfolio and capital position and continue to generate good cash flow that we can continue to return to our shareholders with dividends and additional share repurchases. There is no question that we work to do to improve our Unum UK performance. But I'm confident that our team has the solid plan in place that will lead to gradual improvement in the performance of this business.","Operator, this completes our prepared remarks, let us move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jamminder Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a couple of questions. First, on the U.K. business, you've been expecting a recovery on the business but the margins have actually progressively declined. So what gives you the comfort that results have bottomed and if you just talk about how long it will take you to reprice the book and if you're seeing competitors repricing as well as you're doing it? And then secondly on Long-term Care, just talk about your comfort with Long-term Care reserves. Part of the reason you took the charge was low interest rates have declined further since the last time you took the charge. So just your overall comfort level with Long-term Care reserves?","Thomas R. Watjen","Let me start to answer the first and then ask Jack to certainly pick up. But it think it is important to -- as you're alluding to put the U.K. business in context because there have been some questions raised in the past. And I think that there's no doubt we have a lot of confidence in that business, in that market over the long term and again even in a quarter when, frankly, it didn't meet our expectations. We still generated 12% ROE in that particular business. But I'll come to that in a second, we certainly have some work to do and Jack will talk further about that. But I think this past quarter has caused a few of us just to step back and look at the performance actually of that business over a little longer-term, for example, the last 6 quarters. If you look over the last 6 quarters what you see actually in our BTA, and you probably know this, is unfortunately a fair amount of volatility in our performance, where it ranges -- a high BTA of about $34 million all the way down to a low of $19 million that we saw this past quarter and frankly that will level the volatility in BTA is very inconsistent with what we've seen in other parts of our business and so again that's why if we step back a little bit, just a look at that business again, each quarter, each issue is explainable, as Rick mentioned in his comments. Sometimes it's around incidence, sometimes it's around recovery, sometimes it's around one product versus another. But again that level of BTE volatility in my opinion isn't consistent with what we want to do on the rest of the company. So again we've actually taken a hard look at a few actions that we can take in that market, which Jack can expound on in just a second. Some of those actions relate around pricing increases, some of those actions relate around rebalancing our business in terms of the product selection, the segmentation of the market, the capital allocation we have to put in those products. So we will have some room to improve in terms of just adding more consistency in our operating performance. And so we think we got a good game plan to address those performance issues. Again, is not just about this quarter but it's about looking at this as a trend that we've seen here which, again, on one hand for us is a 12% ROE at a low point. On the other hand, it's got more volatility than we'd like to see in over the long term. I'd also put this business in context as well. Again, very important strategic is us, we see growth opportunities. But if you look at just this past quarter, the BTA in the U.K. is about half of what we produced in Colonial. It's actually less than any one of the 3 operating lines within Unum US, so again to give a sense of context. So with that, Jack, maybe just talk a little bit more about just some of the things that we're doing and why we have confidence in our ability to turn the ship and create less volatility in this business.","John F. McGarry","Great, we are confident in the business. We are already implementing significant price increases in the business. The U.K. business renews, generally has a 2-year rate guarantee, so it takes 2 years to go through the block of business. We started renewals in the Group Life block in the first quarter and ramped them up. In the second quarter, we'll continue to ramp them up through the remainder of the year. We're targeting double-digit rate increases in the block. Through the first half of the year, we've achieved a 9.5% rate increase and that has improved quarter-over-quarter. The market is taking very similar actions to us. They've seen the same increase in underlying mortality that we have. Double-digit, 10% rate increases in the life market are common. We're being successful in implementing them. So we're very positive about that, the competition is reacting similarly, they have reacted similarly by the way on the way down as prices went down and admitted commitment, I believe, to restore prices. We're also looking at other things to control volatility, looking at our business mix, the relationship between income protection and Group Life, the size cases that we write, retention limits upon cases that we keep. So we're going to continue to implement actions to improve both the overall results with rates, the volatility that we see and try to lessen that and the effectiveness of our operations to implement actions to correct it.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, if I could turn to you on the Long-term Care.","Richard P. McKenney","First, I think it's important, Jimmy, to talk about the context of the interest rate environment in the broader business. As you heard from Jack and I mentioned in my comments, we do have the ability to reprice much of our business to reflect the very challenging interest rate environment that we're seeing. We're taking very aggressive action across all of our product lines to reflect the environment that we see ourselves in today. More specifically to your LTC question around reserves, I'll take you back to year-end in terms of the process that we went through. At year-end when we look at the business, and we will talk about at the time we saw the adjustments that we were making reflecting the interest rate environment and the go-forward of that will take us kind of about 3 to 5 years. In terms of that, I'd tell you, in the current environment, although the first half we did a pretty good job on that front as we sit here today. And the real challenges is that it probably takes you to the shorter end of that range but I think we're still out there in that type of time horizon how interest rate impact as is in the our GAAP reserves and Long-term Care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Question for Rick, if I could, on the discount rate. I just kind of want to understand how you're thinking about that because I think you said, on the one hand, you have a pretty healthy margin. I guess it ticked down a little bit this quarter but it's still above your target. But then you also suggested in your comments given the sort of the challenge in terms of new money rates, you might be looking at a discount rate reduction at some point later this year. So I was just hoping if you could maybe frame that up a little bit in terms of order of magnitude and then update us on any guidance in terms of what a 25-basis point change in the discount rate would do to sort of, I guess, annualized earnings or EPS.","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. Let me put a little more color on the commentary I gave. I think we're working with a couple of different items here. One, is the challenging investment environment we have. And we want to, in the market, reflect that challenging environment in our pricing on a pretty rapid basis. We're balancing that with over -- over different times, we actually let that margin build up quite a bit. So we're balancing those 2 items. But as we did last year, I'd point you back to third quarter of last year, we were early in that process to actually reduce our discount rate. We did it by 25 basis points and those were the kind of things we were looking at as we get in towards the end of this year because we have seen, the all-in invested rate has come down pretty precipitously, not just treasury yields but our investment yields at the kind of credit quality that we like to invest in. So we're looking at that with no prediction as to exactly what the timeframe would be. But I'm just pointing back to third quarter in terms of the type of actions we've taken, the type of size and looking into the future on that. And by the way, we referenced 25 basis points as it was last year, is about a $3 million impact to the overall company.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And I think you told us your portfolio yield was -- I think I wrote down 6.59%. Can you just tell where you're investing new money, what rate today and I don't know if you mentioned which actual asset classes you're investing in. If you could do that as well, that would be terrific.","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. When you look at that portfolio, that does reflect a fair bit of what we've been able to do over time. In the longer end of the curve it certainly support of that. Putting money to work today is quite difficult especially on the short end of the curve as you look at spreads of the 10-year treasure rate, we think A, BBB type investment. You're looking right around 3%, 3.25% maybe. Where we've been putting money to work today where we can most effectively has been in other asset classes such as commercial mortgage loans and private placements. And so we've actually done that reasonably effectively. As you get up to the long end of the curve, those types investments that you make would be more opportunistic. Different deals come to the market at different times and so it's hard to really give a general rule of thumb there as you get out towards the 30-year end of the curve, but we're still being opportunistic on that front. But very, very challenging.","Thomas R. Watjen","Actually maybe if I add, to actually anywhere talking about the parallel pricing actions we're taking too, because certainly, the discount rate and the interest rate environment is certainly piece of the equation. But we don't believe sitting on our hands either because there's a set fair amount of activity going on to be sure that we reflect this lower rate in a business where there are certain parts of our business that are interest-sensitive but there's also a lot of parts of our business that are actually not interest-sensitive either.","John F. McGarry","In the case of the discount rate change, 25 basis-point discount rate change affects LTD rates by about 2%. We were in the process of putting mid-single-digit rate increases into the LTD market place during the course of this year to reflect both the interest rate environment and the sort of slight but steady volatility that we've had in incidence. As we look into 2013 in our renewal program, I expect it to be pricing in the mid- to high single-digit range increases for the LTD again to reflect those same claims trends and also the expectation that low interest rate environment will continue and that we might need to take a change in the discount rate. So we are going to price ahead of that. Most of our other lines don't have that kind of interest rate effect at all. STD and Life don't really get hurt at all by interest rates. When we will look at that in the STD line of business though as a deterioration of industry-wide experience. So we're are placing 10% to 15% price increases on STD. But basically we'll offset this deterioration on STD prevalence. So a lot of pricing activity going on and we think, on the pricing side, we're ahead of the curve in terms of low interest rates.","Richard P. McKenney","It's Rick again. If I come back around on the interest rate side, so I gave you some benchmarks of spot rates. I think it's important to look at what happened with actuals too in the second quarter. We actually put money to work at about 5.3%, including some of the hedges that we have out there as those hedges roll off. So those spot rates are tough. I think in the first quarter, as in the second quarter, we've actually done a pretty good job of finding the right investments out there to back our portfolio. I don't want to leave you the sense that everything we putting out there today is at 3%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Spehar from Bank of America.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on the U.K. Group Life business. And I'm just wondering I believe April is the big renewal season and it seems like the recognition that you need to make some significant changes in Group Life has happened pretty recently. I understand that you're putting rate increases in, but I believe as recently as early May, you had been looking for the U.K. business to be sort of flattish in terms of earnings this year. So I'm wondering if you could help us understand how quickly you're going to be able to sort of get the profitability back to targeted levels given that we kind of missed, I think, the big renewal season.","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe I'll ask Jack to start with that. It's not just the renewals, I think, Jack will speak to but there's also certain segments of the market where you can change. I think you are doing some work to change your strategy. We don't need to get into too much detail there it's not just rate, I think, in Group Life that's sort of entering in the picture. And maybe, Rick, if you could follow up just a little bit with just some of the outlook commentary.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, we are looking to change the business mix. There are segments of the market that we pulled away from in selling new business. On the renewal piece, we were responding to this trend before it actually emerged, so we were already doing rate increases, they were a little bit lighter in the first quarter but we -- and during the second quarter, which would include that renewal cycle, we put double-digit rate increases into the market. As I said, we're right at the edge of double-digit. Now we expect that by year end, we'll be well into double digits. We expect to continue that through the 2013 renewal season and we'll be optimistic from there going forward as the marketplace and competitors allow. So I think we got a good jump on it. We didn't wait until May or June before we started to do renewals. A part of that is because the marketplace actually, I think, saw the blip in claims experience last year that we saw in the first half of this year. And so the marketplace had already begun to respond with rate increases last year and we followed suit on that. So I think we're -- excuse me, we're in a better spot than you might otherwise think. In addition, even though April is the big month, it's not like January in the U.S. Things are much flatter in the U.K. There's a good -- there's probably 40% of your renewals are still outstanding at midyear going forward. So we're optimistic that we caught the curve.","Thomas R. Watjen","And I think just, Rick, in terms of outlook, I don't think we're making -- we're assuming it takes some time to get back to the levels. But that's the thing I add to that.","Thomas R. Watjen","I'll sort of just take you back to our comments, we expect the second half of the year will be starting to run right between GBP 20 million to GBP 25 million which is down, as you know, relative to what we would have thought coming into the year. That reflects really more of the volatility coming out of the book and just the natural fluctuations we've seen. Pricing will take some time and so that's where -- even the actions Jack has taken thus far is going to be a process that works out really over the next couple of years, although we are on top of it right now.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So should we assume to get back to the 20 ROE we're looking at 2 years out?","Thomas R. Watjen","I think that's probably a fair assumption. We'll come back and talk about it again next quarter but I think that from what we see right now, that's probably a fair assumption.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Most of my more technical questions have been asked. Just wondering if you could give us an update on your view of the M&A landscape. I mean, it sounds like most of the activity at least that we're all pretty well aware of that's out there is sort of outside your core. But I'm just wondering if what the outlook looks like, what the opportunity set looks like within your mix?","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe Rick, I'll start and ask you to supplement a little bit it too. But I think John, we really don't see a lot in our core. I want to come back to you with core is we very much just stay in to the focus of the things we do well and not getting too distracted by obviously some of the other things which, as you point out, there's an awful lot of activity in some of the better areas. There's enough places where, obviously, we want to play and have the characteristics of the things we can add value in. So again, we're staying very close to the marketplace, I think if there are things to happen that are close to our space in the marketplace we're aware of them, but it's a pretty quiet period of time right now because we don't see a lot of things that sort of fit within our sweet spot in terms of where we are as a strategy. But I do think, Rick, again, we're very much viewed I think both in the U.S. as well as maybe even the other markets around the world as a potential buyer for properties, which is a good thing. But that patience is very important.","Richard P. McKenney","I would just add to that, when you look at the processes there, we're pretty much involved with anything that's -- and it's going on. We're certainly introduced to most situations that are out there. It's true that much of it does not meet our core. I think the business line that we're in are very much favored by the markets today and so I don't think we'll see that much in the near term, it's something we'll keep an active eye on. And the second is, as we look at M&A, it's relative to purchasing our stock. It's a very, very high hurdle to actually go and do there and relative to where our stock is. So I think that's still our primary choice, although we'd want to see a good acquisition that fits.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Certainly. And then just a quick one on Colonial. So I think your commentary has been and it's been pretty consistent now for it seems a couple of quarters. But sales to existing accounts has been -- it's held in there pretty well. Maybe we could even characterize it as reasonably strong. But new client creation has been extremely difficult. Would you characterize that pressure on the new client creation as still primarily economically driven? Or do you see that as more competitively driven because it appears,, at least from my vantage point, that Aflac is doing a little bit better on the U.S. side, and maybe I'm wrong. But I'm just wondering if Aflac and Allstate and a few others are becoming a bit more competitive in that respect?","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, let me ask you to on touch that, but maybe just to sort of set the framework a little. Just -- we didn't go into in-depth in our remarks but glad you raised because certainly Colonial, as Rick said in his comments, has been a steady contributor to the results of the company. But as you know, we think about the market really in 3 segments, our core commercial, it is a small business, was actually up about 2% or 3% for the quarter. Our large commercial actually is up pretty nicely for the quarter. The decrease was really more on the public sector. So as always, there's a segmentation process that applies to our core when it comes to market and I think some of the work that's been done certainly has improved our positioning. For example, in the core commercial marketplace we continue to see good results there. But with that, Randy, maybe you could add a little color to the market and what we're seeing, because I think sometimes the headline result doesn't necessarily translate into what's really happening in the market place.","Randall C. Horn","Sure, Tom. From an economic standpoint there certainly are still some headwinds out there for everyone. There is no question about that. I mean one of the key things we look at is consumer confidence and levels of discretionary income and that type of thing. But we're working through that just fine. So that's not a huge and not a new issue for us by any means. There is rising levels of competitive intensity out in the marketplace with a lot of different carriers getting into the voluntary space. But as Tom said overall, we feel comfortable with the activity levels and the success we're having in our core commercial markets. The real pressure this quarter was on new public sector sales and we just had a couple of real tough comparisons with the second quarter last year where we had a couple of larger cases on the public sector side. So really, John, no fundamental concerns. We feel like we're getting the right products and services out into the marketplace. We have good steady growth in our agent account and new offices that we're opening, new sales offices, et cetera. So we feel pretty good about the fundamentals and in the market overall and where we can take things. So again, economy is still not our friend, but we can overcome that and feel like we have good prospects going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question just on capital management, I guess I was a little surprised by the buyback activity in the quarter. I guess, one, just given where the shares were trading. And two, just given the smaller window you guys have in 4Q, so should be thinking that you guys kind of get through the rest of your $500 million authorization in 3Q?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to pick that up?","Richard P. McKenney","Certainly, Chris. Actually when you think about the buyback activity, we've done $300 million year-to-date. Our second quarter actually looks quite active. When you think about the rest of the year, another $200 million to deal. I won't tell you exactly when we'll do it. We certainly see value in our shares today and where they're trading so we will be active. But right now we are sticking to our $500 million for the year, so that is our expectation. We still look back to our capital generation model and say, in still quite an uncertain environment, that we want to spend excess that we're generating and we also keep some pretty healthy capital levels behind that. So I think that's how the layout plays out between third and fourth quarter. I'd love to see how that goes.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the tax rate was lower due to the tax accrual. Curious, as we look to the back half of this year, is there any other kind of onetime tax items that kind of are on the horizon?","Richard P. McKenney","There's always a lot going on in the tax line. And so we -- there's still some of that. I think as you look out to the year, probably lead you to an overall tax rate for the full year of right around 30%, which we'd say is a little bit lower in the third and fourth quarter than our expectations. We think there may be some couple of small onetime items that come through which bring that tax rate down, maybe in 29% to 30% type range.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just quickly for Jack on the U.K. book. I guess the Group Life, I wanted to see if it's at all possible to kind of split out the legacy, kind of your older Unum clients in the U.K. versus the book of business that grew a bit more substantially when AEGON maybe exited the business a few years back.","John F. McGarry","Yes. One of the things in the U.K. is the entire block tended to be priced on a consistent basis. And so as rates in the marketplace fell and we followed that trend, we were renewing old cases, as well as younger cases. So if you look at the cases, rating is pretty similar across the block, similar opportunities for rate increases across the block. So it's not like in the U.S. where you might get more aggressive on new sales and have a higher rate on your existing cases.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Krueger from Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I had a follow-up on the discount rates. Rick I wasn't sure if I correctly heard the earnings impact from a 25 basis-point change because I think in your investor presentation last year you said $14 million annually, is that correct?","Richard P. McKenney","That is correct annually. I gave you a the quarterly number of $3 million.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And then you also made some discounted changes last year on the newer Individual Disability Block and I think you also made some changes in the U.K. Should we be expecting some adjustments there as well?","Richard P. McKenney","I'm not sure what you're referring to on the Disability Block in the U.K. Hard to predict and will reflect the interest rate environment there as well. But we don't see the same kind of pressure we see in the U.S. for similar pressures on new money investing. But in terms of adjustments and discount rates, it's not of the same magnitude as in the U.K.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And then just lastly, when I look at the reserve real forwards in your supplement, the group disability recoveries has been pretty favorable now for a few years and then this quarter was even better and I think, probably the best you've had. Can you just talk a little bit about what factors are driving this, if you can continue around these levels?","Richard P. McKenney","In the recoveries, as you said, we've been outperforming on the recoveries for quite a number of quarters now. But even there, you get some degree of volatility. You quarters you are running at 110% actual expected recoveries. Some quarters, 113%, other quarters 108%. I think for the most part, we're right on the money pretty consistently in terms of number of recoveries that we expect to occur but you always get sales volatility around the average size of the claim. With the [indiscernible] you see bounce around this quarter. I think we had a little bit more favorable performance on the recoveries side, both in terms of price of recovery and number of recoveries. But I do expect it to continue.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. Just what's changed versus a few years ago? When I just look at the disclosure, seems like there's a significant improvement relative to what it was a few years ago. Is it that you're making more conservative upfront assumptions on recoveries or is it that recovery rates have actually improved?","Thomas R. Watjen","I don't think there's much of a process change or anything like that. I think we've got a very seasoned and well-oiled organization and that organization consistently performs. I think, I don't want to speculate but the economy begins to put consistent pressure. And the economy probably baiting just people to return to work a little bit more aggressively perhaps, but that's pure speculation. But I don't think we've made any internal process changes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess just to Ryan's question, I had similar thoughts, why shouldn't claim recovery patterns start to taper off over time? I mean, they've been very strong for a fairly prolonged period of time and just it's just things revert to the mean and you price for some of the improvement over time. Why shouldn't it start to taper off?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, I can turn around and say why should it taper off? Yes, I guess recoveries are about sort of consistent, disciplined management of your claims processes, consistent and disciplined interaction with the claimants, with the claimants' employer, with the claimants' physician. And so it's a process and I just don't see any reason that we should expect it to move.","Thomas R. Watjen","Okay, I think you touched on it, but we made a very consistent steady investment in that part of our business. I mean that's maybe stating the obvious, but that is at the heart of what's stepped to this more consistent performance once the claim comes into our hands.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, and I mean, exactly right. And I do think, Mark, you're talking about reversion to the mean. We've been performing at these recovery levels for 20 quarters, 16 quarters, whatever. But it's a long time that we've been performing at this level. And I think back 5, 6 years ago when we started to put a lot of these properties in place, we ramped up our organization for a lot of inventory control, standard control, all properties in place to measure we could have consistent performance and we've delivered on it, but don't see any reasons for it to move.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Rick, you made an interesting comment in your opening remarks and it related to the Long-term Care business, and I'm not going to get the words exactly right, but you kind of alluded to longer-term improvement in LTC. Near-term, this is kind of a sustainable level of earnings that we should be looking for. And I guess when I look at that business, loss ratios have been trending higher, obviously, despite rate increases. Interest rates are obviously lower, who knows what happens to those 3, 4 years out? But I guess what gives you the confidence in making the statement about margin improvement in a business that has really only gone one direction for you and pretty much everybody else?","Richard P. McKenney","That is a fair. I think, Mark, when you look at it -- this is Rick. When you look at the LTC business, that statement really stems from the fact that we're very active in terms of raising rates in that business. Been talking for that now for a couple of years but those premiums are just starting to flow. So as you go back to when we started to raise rates, the process of actually getting premiums to start to flow will take some time. We'll be starting to see that now. All the pressures you talked about are still challenging. I mean, when I talk about improvement, it's slight improvement over time. It's nonmaterial improvement. But that will come from the repricing environment.","Thomas R. Watjen","And, Mark, if I could add to Rick's comments, I think I just would underscore the importance of having chosen to get out of that business completely, put it into Closed Block and the focus that brings in our organization. So I think to your point, Rick and Kevin, it's involvements as well. Once you make that decision and put into a Closed Block, it doesn't just sit there. There's an awful lot of focus on many things, including rate increases. And I can assure you, Mark, that we recognize this as a substantial portion of our capital supporting that part of the business. And there's not many new levers, but there are levers that we can use to, as Rick said, slightly improve the performance there.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just one final question in the U.K. I mean if you look at this business historically, obviously very high returns, 20%-plus, you benefited from acquisitions you made a while ago that you put them on your own claims platform, they performed well. Obviously, the last few years, or the last couple of years have been much more disappointing. I guess my question is, how do we think about the true returns of this business longer term? I mean, is this really a 13%-, 14%-return business similar to kind of maybe what you'd expect in the U.S. Or is there reason to think that it should structurally be higher in the U.K. over the long term?","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe I'll speak, maybe I'll ask Rick to speak too. I don't think Mark, that we, we've been saying actually for the last year or 2 -- those rates of return in the upper 20s and sometimes even into the 30s were not sustainable for any number of reasons. I think, obviously, we've been trying to bring people\u2019s expectations about the returns in this business. I for one, I think we believe, as a management team, this is still a business produce well above industry sorts of ROE. That's why it's not going to get to those kinds of levels we saw before. But you have to -- Jack and his team too. The hope is that we're also doing is reducing the volatility of the BTA contribution, as I mentioned in my comments, just looking at the last 6 quarters was a low of 19 and high of 34 and bounced all round in between there. So part of it is also just getting to the right above industry average kind of ROE. There's also doing it at the business model that has more predictability in terms of its ability to produce a more consistent BTA performance as well. Rick, I don't know if you'll add anything.","Richard P. McKenney","I'll just add that when we look at that business we see things we can improve. I think that's a key thing. We've gotten to 12% ROE, we see action items we can take to improve the business. We see ability to take price into the marketplace and make risk selection and that differs from where we are today so I think that gives us confidence. We can be higher than here today. Jack, I don't know if you have a follow-up on that.","John F. McGarry","My view too is that the market is different in the U.K. There's only 4 major players in the business. That business tends to be a very small part of what they do overall. And there's a kind of market expansion opportunity in the U.K. So the dynamics of the business in the U.K. aren't the same today as they are in the U.S., where you have 25 carriers, you have deep penetration and there's a lot of fighting back and forth between carriers. So as long as those dynamics are still in place, I think you should still be able to get above industry returns on it.","Thomas R. Watjen","It looks like from the queue we've exhausted our questions. And so let me just thank you all for taking the time to join us. I think, as a couple of you mentioned, there's an awful lot of reporting companies here in a relatively short period of time. So we appreciate people taking the time. Obviously, we're all available for any follow-on questions. And operator, this will complete our second quarter 2012 earnings call.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

And now for opening remarks and the introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas A. H.

And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen, Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning. I want to touch on 3 areas in my comments this morning before handing things over to Tom and Rick for more details on our quarter. These include our solid underlying operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011, our decision to exit the long-term care business and finally, our outlook for 2012, which is, as you see from our release, has not changed from what we outlined at our November investor meeting. ","First, regarding our fourth quarter and full year operating results. I'm very pleased with the results and the momentum that implies for 2012. For the quarter, we reported operating income, excluding special items, of $0.78 per share, versus $0.66 per share in the fourth quarter last year, or an 18% increase. For the full year, we reported operating income, excluding special items, at $2.95 per share against $2.69 per share in 2010, or a 10% increase. We continue to benefit from both the solid operating performance across all of our core operating businesses, including the improvement in the fourth quarter results for our Unum UK business, and from our lower share count as we repurchased 25.4 million shares this past year. It was generally a solid quarter across all of our operating areas. At Unum US, we continue to see stable risk results across all lines of business, while also growing the business lines we have targeted for growth. I'm especially pleased with the very strong sales and premium growth in our core group and voluntary businesses. The Unum US business segment, which now excludes the Long-term Care line, produced solid operating earnings growth of 7% in 2011, and a 13% return on equity. Unum UK's operating results recovered nicely from a weaker-than-expected third quarter, as claims activity returned to more normal levels. We are also encouraged by the pricing trends we are seeing in the U.K. which has opened up more sales opportunities than we have seen in previous quarters. New sales grew 15% this quarter in persistency, which was below year-ago levels, remained above our expectations. Despite a difficult environment in the U.K. and the third quarter shortfall, Unum UK produced a 20% return on equity in 2011. ","At Colonial Life, results remained steady, with operating earnings rebounding nicely from last year's fourth quarter. Premium growth was just under 6% this quarter. Sales trends remained positive with overall growth of 4% this quarter and 8% growth within the core commercial market. Margins remained very strong in this business segment, and this business segment produced a return on equity in 2011 of 16.5%. In addition to these strong operating quarter results, our investment performance in the quarter remains solid. The credit quality of the portfolio remains strong and we continue to effectively manage through this difficult low-interest rate environment. ","Finally, our capital position remains very strong even after the actions taken in the fourth quarter, which I'll discuss in a minute. We closed 2011 with risk-based capital at our traditional U.S. insurance companies, slightly above the 400% level, and withholding company cash and marketable securities at $756 million. Our capital position continues to be an asset and gives us a great deal of financial flexibility. ","Now turning to my second point, our decision to exit the Long-term Care business. Hopefully this is not a surprise to anyone. As we indicated back at our investor meeting in November, we've been reviewing the Long-term Care business for some time to determine if it fits with our business and financial objectives. As you can see from our announcement last night, based on our review, we have elected to discontinue selling any new group Long-term Care policies and place all of our Long-term Care business into a closed block, much the way we handled our older Individual Disability business back in 2004. While there is no doubt a tremendous market need for Long-term Care coverage, in an extended period of low interest rates and at a relatively immature product with difficulty in projecting future loss costs, it simply does not have the risk and return characteristics we find so attractive in our other businesses. You can see from our release that we took a $561 million after-tax GAAP charge this quarter associated with this decision. Rick will touch on this further, but I would just say that it's important to keep in mind that this action has no direct impact on our statutory capital position or the cash generation capacity of our company. Also remember that a portion of that cost is the write-off of DAC, a portion of which would have been written off with the accounting change to be implemented in the first quarter. ","With the decision to exit the Long-term Care business, which represented less than 5% of our operating earnings, our strategy is to focus our attention on our core businesses, which as you can see from our fourth quarter and full year results, are performing very well. These businesses offer both good growth opportunities and favorable profitability, and have the risk characteristics we, and I think the market, find very attractive. ","My last comment relates to our 2012 outlook, which despite some serious external challenges, particularly low interest rates, remains the same as we discussed at our November Investor Day meeting. That is, operating earnings growth of 6% to 12%, with targeted capital management levels of 375% to 400% for risk-based capital and $500 million to $800 million of holding company liquidity. We expect capital management to remain a source of value to our shareholders and continue to plan on $500 million of share repurchases in 2012. ","In summary, I'm very pleased with our operating results this quarter and for the full year. We continue to have a balance sheet and capital position which gives us tremendous flexibility. It's nice to have the Long-term Care decision behind us and our strategic focus even more centered on businesses, which I continue to believe, as evidenced by our 2011 results and our 2012 outlook, present tremendous opportunities for our company and shareholders. ","Now I'll ask Tom to provide an overview of our operating results this quarter. Tom?","Thomas A. H. White","Great. Thanks, Tom. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $425.4 million or $1.45 per diluted common share. This compares to net income in the year-ago quarter of $225.8 million or $0.71 per diluted common share. There are 4 items which are detailed in our press release and will be discussed more fully by Rick that help bridge from the reported net loss to operating earnings of $0.78 per diluted common share for this year's fourth quarter. ","First, in the Long-term Care business line, we strengthened reserves and wrote off the deferred acquisition costs. Together, these 2 charges decreased fourth quarter net income by $561.2 million or $1.92 per diluted common share. Second, in our Individual Disability Closed Block line of business, we've strengthened reserves, which decreased net income by $119.3 million or $0.41 per common share. Third, we recorded net tax benefits of $22.7 million or $0.08 per common share, resulting from a reduction of taxes from a settlement of tax issues from tax years 1996 to 2004 net of taxes paid on subsidiary dividends. And fourth, results for the fourth quarter 2011 include net realized after-tax investment gains of $4.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share, compared to net realized after-tax investment gains of $17.2 million or $0.05 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2010. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $227.6 million for this quarter, or $0.78 per diluted common share compared to $208.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter. ","You will notice that with the fourth quarter we have reclassified our segment reporting. The results of the Long-term Care line of business have been reclassified from Unum US Supplemental and Voluntary into the Closed Block segment. In addition, we have reclassified several other smaller insurance products no longer actively marketed, and this includes the individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, group pension, health insurance and individual annuities from the Corporate and Other segment, also to the Closed Block segment. In prior periods, segment results have been reclassified to reflect these changes, and we've included those in the fourth quarter statistical supplement.","So now turning to the operating segments, Unum US operating income increased 7.5% to $208.6 million in the fourth quarter, driven by strong growth in the Supplemental and Voluntary line of business and generally stable results in the Group Disability and Group Life and AD&D lines of business. Within Unum US, operating income in the Group Disability line was $77.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $77 million last year at a lower level of premium income and an increase in the benefit ratio were generally offset by lower expenses. Premium income declined by 0.6% to $511.1 million in the quarter, largely due to the ongoing effects of the weak economy on headcount and salary growth at existing customers.","The Group Disability benefit ratio increased slightly to 84.7% from 84.2% in the year-ago quarter, due primarily to a reduction in the discount rate for group long-term disability new claim incurrals, which was implemented in the third quarter of 2011. Our submitted claim incidents and claim recovery experience was generally favorable in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the year-ago quarter. ","Within the Group Life and AD&D line, operating income increased 1.3% to $53.9 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from an increase in premium income, which offset a slight uptick in the benefit ratio. In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, fourth quarter income increased 21.5% to $77.5 million. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by solid growth in premium income, 7.4% growth in the recently issued individual disability line and 8.4% growth in the voluntary benefits line and lower benefit ratios in each of these lines of business due to favorable risk experience.","Moving to Unum UK. Operating income in this segment increased 11.6% to $53.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating income increased 12.1% in local currency. While premium income in local currency declined fractionally in the fourth quarter, the benefit ratio improved to 69.1% compared to 71.7% last year. In wrapping up our core operations, Colonial Life reported an 11.2% increase in operating income compared to the year-ago period, driven by premium income growth of 5.7% and a lower benefit ratio. The benefit ratio declined to 52.5% in the quarter, compared to 53.4% in the same period last year, due primarily to improved risk experience in the Accident, Sickness and Disability line of business, as well as stable risk trends in the Life and Cancer and Critical Illness lines. ","Looking at the results of the Closed Block segment this quarter, we reported a loss of $1,014,900,000 compared to operating income of $29 million in the year-ago quarter. These results included the impacts of the Long-term Care reserve strengthening and DAC impairment in the Individual Disability reserve strengthening. Adjusting for these items, the Closed Block segment reported operating income of $32 million in the fourth quarter 2011. And finally, for the Corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Included in the other income in the Corporate segment, is approximately $17 million of interest income, which was related to the tax settlement. But this was mostly offset by higher-than-usual level of corporate expenses totaling approximately $14 million related to increase in expense accruals and an increase in operating expenses related to corporate initiatives. ","So now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for further analysis of this quarter's results.","Richard McKenney","Great, thank you, Tom. In my comments this morning I'll cover in greater detail the assumptions backing the financial actions taken in our Long-term Care and Individual Disability Closed Block businesses. I'll also cover the operating trends in our core business operations, which were quite encouraging this quarter, combined with an update on our investment results and our capital strategy. First, on the actions we announced regarding our Long-term Care business. As we discussed at our November investor meeting, we have been reviewing our LTC business for some time, and with the our fourth quarter release, announced that we will discontinue new sales of group Long-term Care products and reclassify the entire Long-term Care business line to the Closed Block segment. This decision recognized the difficult risk management characteristics of this product line, but also will allow us to concentrate resources on our businesses with more favorable growth, risk and return potential. LTC has been a small contributor to our overall earnings. As we strategically have moved this business to a Closed Block, we also looked carefully at certain assumptions where we were seeing emerging pressure in the current environment. As a result, this reserve strengthening is reflective of areas where current conditions and future patterns have deteriorated. First, during the third quarter, long-term interest rates fell precipitously with EU challenges, actions by the Fed to lower long term rates, and the Fed publicly stating its desire to keep interest rates low for a prolonged period of time. While our current portfolio rate has held steady due to our interest rate hedges and limited new cash flows to invest, exposure to interest rate risk over the intermediate term has increased. As a result, our best estimates now reflect how our discount rate might trend over the next 3 to 5 years. This accounted for roughly half of the $560 million after-tax impact. A second major factor was that new experience studies released by the Society of Actuaries mid-year in 2011 continue to show a declining trend in claim termination rates. Long-term Care is a relatively young product and we have been a smaller player, which limits our own credible experience. So we used a blend of our own experience with industry data to set our reserve and pricing assumptions. With this emerging industry data, we modified our claim termination assumptions used in setting our reserves. This accounts for the majority of the other half of the impact. The before-tax GAAP accounting impact is $863 million or $290 million for the DAC piece of the impairment and $573 million for the reserve increase. Again, this only impacts our GAAP financial results and does not impact our statutory accounting, which we already have on a more conservative basis. ","As part of our Closed Block, we intend to aggressively manage the Long-term Care business. This will include continuing our practice of seeking rate increases on the inforce business where warranted and also exploring opportunities for capital management. Also in the fourth quarter, we increased reserves for the Closed Block Individual Disability business. This reserve strengthening totaled $184 million or about 1.5% of the reserve base subsequent to the charge, and impacted net income in the quarter by $119 million. Unlike Long-term Care, the driver of this reserve increase was very specific to this block of business. The emerging experience we are seeing develop has shown a continued improvement of life expectancies for the older age, longer duration, disabled claimants, which lengthens the time that a claimant will receive disability benefits. Our claim to data has become more credible in recent periods and we have the majority of the data in these lines of business, so we are now able, with a higher degree of confidence, to assess our own experience for older ages and our long-duration lifetime claim block. There is very little industry experience for lifetime disability benefits, as our insurance companies were the primary disability companies in the insurance industry at the time these products were offered. By way of history, these products were offered during the 1980s and early 1990s, recent enough that claimants with lifetime benefits are just reaching these older ages. As a result of these disabled claimants living longer, we've adjusted our mortality assumptions. This reserve charge only impacted our U.S. GAAP results and did not impact the statutory results because our assumptions are already within the statutory prescribed assumptions. So let me pause there for a second and move on to the quarter, which we think was quite good and bodes well for 2012. ","Moving on to operating results in the fourth quarter, I'll start with Unum US. It was a good quarter in many ways for the Unum US segment, with operating earnings growth of 8% and solid risk experience, as well as good sales growth in the core businesses we have targeted for growth. For Group Disability, we were encouraged by the improvement in the benefit ratio in the fourth quarter to 84.7%, compared to the third quarter ratio of 85.5%. Submitted and paid new claim incidence trends showed improvement between the third and fourth quarters and claim recovery trends remain favorable. These positive trends offset the ongoing impact of the reduction in a new claim discount rate we made in the third quarter. We made no additional change in the new claim discount rate this quarter, and the margin between our portfolio yield and the aggregate discount rate was unchanged. ","For the Group Life and AD&D line, results continue to remain stable and profit margins very healthy. The benefit ratio is 70.7% for the fourth quarter, was fractionally elevated from the third quarter and year-ago quarter, but the earnings contribution was again solid at $53.9 million this quarter. Looking to the Supplementary and Voluntary lines of Unum US, we saw a very good overall earnings results, driven by solid risk experience and premium growth. Operating earnings increased by 21% on an 8% premium growth, and the benefit ratio improved 51.9% from 54.4% in the year-ago quarter. Unum UK's results showed a strong rebound from a challenging third quarter, with operating earnings of $53.7 million or at GBP 34.2 million. The unusual claims trends we experienced in the third quarter that negatively impacted results reverted back to more normal trends in the fourth quarter, and the benefit ratio returned to a more normal level of 69.1% for the fourth quarter, compared to 78.8% in the third quarter and 71.7% in the year-ago quarter. ","And finally, Colonial Life produced another good quarter as operating earnings increased 11% from a soft year-ago quarter, with premium income increasing almost 6%. The benefit ratio compared favorably with a year ago at 52.5%, compared to 53.4% in the year-ago quarter. Driven by improved risk experience in the Accident, Sickness and Disability line and stable risk experience in the Cancer and Critical Illness lines of business. So after what was an elevated third quarter across each of our businesses, we saw risk experience for the fourth quarter settle down nicely. ","Across the board, we were also happy with our sales trends. Sales trends within Unum US were quite encouraging, with sales in total increasing 12% in the quarter. Group Disability and Group Life combined showed 12% sales growth this quarter and 10% for the full year. Within that, sales in the under 2,000 life core market increased 10% for both the quarter and the full year, and our mix between core and large case sales was approximately 70% core and 30% large case for the full year, a very healthy mix for us. Voluntary benefit sales were also strong, increasing 11% for the quarter. ","We continue to be encouraged by the pricing trends we see in the U.K. market, with a general firming of the pricing continuing to emerge. This trend has helped our sales activity, and our fourth quarter sales in Unum UK increased by 15%. And finally, new sales in Colonial Life increased by 4.2% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by higher sales activity in the core commercial sector, which produced an increase of 8.1%. Recruiting trends at Colonial Life remained positive with new rep contract growth of 10% this quarter and just under 7% for the full year. ","Shifting to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, we continue to be very pleased with the results. The credit profile of our investment portfolio remains in excellent shape with a net unrealized gains position in our fixed maturity securities portfolio at $5.8 billion at year end. This quarter, we reported net realized after-tax investment gain, excluding the mod-co derivative impact of $14.6 million, which was the fifth quarter in a row with gains generated and our portfolio watch list remains quite small. While the quality of the investment portfolio remains strong, the challenge remains in investing new cash flows at attractive rates. This is nothing new and I will refer you to our November Investor Day materials for more in-depth discussion. In short, we benefit from having a low level of new cash flow to invest relative to the size of our existing portfolios, as well as the hedges we have in place on our long-duration Long-term Care portfolio. This allows us to be selective in our asset purchases, and as a result, our portfolio yields have held up well despite the low-rate environment. The aggregate portfolio yield was 6.67% at year end 2011, a decline of only 4 basis points from the beginning of the year. And we put new money to work at 5.99% in the fourth quarter. The yields on the investment portfolio that support each of our various product lines also showed similar stability. ","Our capital position remains in a very healthy position. Statutory operating earnings for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies continue at good levels: $178 million in the fourth quarter and $644 million for the full year 2011. This falls in line with our capital model that is generating $500 million per year of free cash flow. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies eclipsed the 400% mark and ended at an estimated 405% at year end, above our targeted range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities were equally strong, totaling $756 million at December 31. We did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter, but it was an active 2011 with full year repurchases of $620 million. We look forward to being back in the market shortly. ","Finally, as Tom Watjen outlined, our outlook for 2012 remains the same as we outlined in our Investor Day in November. Given today's environment, our higher cash level holdings at year end, we would see ourselves currently in the lower end of the range of 6% to 12% earnings growth, but we remain optimistic about our core business operations going forward. And now I'd like to turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. As I mentioned earlier, I'm very pleased with our operating results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2011. Our investment portfolio remains solid and our capital position remains strong, and the 2 remain significant assets in today's challenging business environment. While there was a cost in doing so, exiting the Long-term Care business allows us to sharpen our strategic focus on our core businesses. As evidenced by our recent performance, these businesses are far less volatile and provide us with sustainable, profitable growth opportunities and attractive returns for our shareholders. This completes our prepared remarks, and operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Bob Glasspiegel with Langen McAlenney.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","I was wondering how sensitive your assumptions are on the charges you took to interest rates. And specifically, how many years would the tenure have to stay where it is where you might have to take another charge?","Thomas R. Watjen","Well, let me ask Rick to speak. I think you'd talked to that briefly, I think, in some of your comments, I think, Rick. So maybe just pick up on it if you could,  please.","Richard McKenney","I will. When you think about sensitivity, first I'd say with regards to the Individual Disability, this is not about interest rates, that business actually in Closed Block status, the claims are running very similar to the new cash flows, so there's no interest rate sensitivity that we really see in that line of business. On the Long-term Care side, I think the way you framed it up is the right one, which is to think about how many years this will run out for. What we did is lower the discount rate, keeping in mind what we see in the lower interest rate environment and how our portfolio yield might trend down over a period of time. And we think about it, we think about the next 3 to 5 years, and that framing actually is quite consistent with what we hear from the Fed and outside markets. So that's the way that you would need to think about it. Now that's our current assumption. Our team has done a great job in terms of exceeding expectations with regards to how they put money to work over that period of time. We do have some cash flow hedges in that process as well, which will come into play. So think about it over a 3 to 5-year period of time, that we would see that come through in the discount rate potentially.","Robert Glasspiegel - Langen McAlenney","Okay. And just the follow up is, it looks like about half of your liabilities reserves are associated with the Closed Block. What is the capital associated with the Closed Block?","Thomas R. Watjen","Tom, yes, I think it's roughly about 25%, 27%, something like that, I think, Bob.","Richard McKenney","Yes, Bob, I think the number's 25% on a GAAP basis. Yes.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a question first just on pricing trends. We've heard from a lot of companies in the U.S. disability market that they intend to raise prices, wondering if you've actually seen that in the market. And then second, on share buybacks, just if you would discuss why you didn't buy back stock in the fourth quarter given your capital position. And as you're thinking about 2012, are you going to buy at an even pace or should we expect you to be more opportunistic, depending on where the stock price is?","Thomas R. Watjen","Good question. Let me ask Kevin here to pick up the first one on pricing trend.","Kevin P. McCarthy","I would say the pricing trends in the marketplace are pretty stable. I wouldn't say they've softened at all. They've probably hardened a little bit. We have a very solid fourth quarter in terms of sales, very solid closing ratios, persistency for the full year, as well as entering 2012 is very solid. So my instincts are based on all that data that prices have stabilized and might be creeping up a bit, depending upon which company we're talking about.","Thomas R. Watjen","And maybe just an extension, too, Jimmy, that is as you know, we've also -- we're experiencing some interesting pricing trends in the U.K. Maybe Jack, you want to pick up on that just in terms of the U.K. pricing trends?","John F. McGarry","Yes, actually we too had very strong sales results in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We had improving persistency results through most of the year. There's a lot of carriers that are talking about raising rates in the market not only because of aging, but interest rates and other factors. And we believe we're actually starting to see some of that. Now we don't believe it's a going to be a steady trend every quarter going up, but we do think that the prevailing trend is upward.","Thomas R. Watjen","And then maybe Rick can pick up your question on share buyback.","Richard McKenney","Certainly. When you think about the fourth quarter, there are a couple of things going on and I think we had mentioned that in the Investor Day. There are a limited windows. We like to be in the open market purchasing our shares. There are a limited windows given our Investor Day and a lot of things in the market. Liquidity is a little bit less, so that's one aspect to it. But I think you need to this fourth quarter and given some of the strategic reviews that we were going through and understanding the different pieces of that, we do not think it to be a good time to be buying back shares in the marketplace. It was not denoted by our capital position. We certainly had the ability to do so. And we'll look, as we get into this year to be, as you say, opportunistic throughout 2012. I would not think of it on a level basis. I think when our share price is low we tend to be in buying more. And as our share price is higher, we'll buy a little bit less. So think of that flexing over the course of the year dependent on how our share price is behaving.","Operator","Moving on to Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you give us some more insight on the last comment where you think you'll be at the low end of the EPS growth guidance range of 2012? What gives you confidence that you can hit the low end of the range?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to pick up on that?","Richard McKenney","I certainly will . When you think about our Investor Day we had gone out and highlighted 6% to 12% growth coming into the year. As we got through the end of the year and looking at how our year ended up a little bit, certainly, higher than external expectations about our fourth quarter, combined with the fact that we were sitting on a little bit more cash at year end in a low interest rate environment, it put a little pressure on that range. We're still very much in that range and committed to it, so I don't want to lead anyone out of that range. We still feel very committed to being in that range. I just want to highlight the fact that when you think about it right now, there's a little bit of pressure in the market which won't be a surprise to you, and we're being reflective of the world around us, but still staying in that 6% to 12% range.","Thomas R. Watjen","And if I could add to Rick's comments. I think as we talked about it in Investor Day, too, you think about the 2 sources of growth for us, one, obviously, is operating earnings, the other is share repurchase activity. And there's no doubt, I think, in 2012 we'll continue to be a little more skewed to growth coming from share repurchase activity, but still that doesn't undermine the fact that each of our 3 businesses are expected to grow as well in 2012.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on a separate topic. What are your views to the ROE profile for the major operating businesses going forward?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, I'll start it. I think about a couple different product lines, I think if you think about Unum U.S. now, it's probably a little north of the 13% ROE. Really, the principal pieces to that puzzle, as you know, are the strong group returns as well as some of the voluntary's returns continue to be very strong. So that's sort of -- think of that as a 13%, 14% return. I think as you heard in my comments, Colonial's operating at about a 16.5% ROE, and the U.K.'s at about a 20% ROE. So again, that's why when you compare any decision like Long-term Care against your existing portfolio of businesses in terms of growth and returns, it's got a pretty high target to meet, and those 3 businesses continue to be producing we think some pretty good returns and expect that to continue in 2012.","Operator","And now we'll move to the next question that will come from Chris Giovanni, Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question is in terms of potential for reinsurance transactions with the Long-term Care Block and maybe some of the other pieces that you moved into the Closed Block?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, let me start and introduce it, but I think, Rick, if you could pick up. I think Rick mentioned in his comments, Chris, that once it's in a Closed Block status, we don't just ignore it. It's actually going to be very aggressively manageable in terms of rate activities, as well as capital management. You think about, again, go back in history a bit, when we put the Individual Disability block into Closed Block status whereas we couldn't do much with rates, we did a lot to manage the capital effectively in that business over time. And I think, certainly, times have changed considerably since 2004, but I'd say, Rick, it's a big priority for us to continue to be sure that we're actively managing that block.","Richard McKenney","Yes, and I'd just add to that. There is capacity in the marketplace that we want to tap into today. We're going to run pretty hard at it. It's a little bit more challenging on a LTC-type block than it would be against a shared mortality-based life block, but it's something that we want to look at. And as we close it and take through price increase and things like that, that we think there may be opportunities to alleviate some of that capital for reinsurance.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms the reserve strengthening that you guys did. Can you talk a bit more in terms of getting investors comfortable that there's not a material charge to come further? And then I guess somewhat of an elementary question, my understanding is the reserves on a GAAP and stat basis are now comparable, and with stat accounting and reserving more conservative than GAAP, why should we expect that there shouldn't be some differentiation between higher reserve on the stat basis versus GAAP?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, do you want to pick that one up?","Richard McKenney","Yes, let me take you through, maybe it will give you a sense on the reserve structuring that was done. I talked about the interest rate. That should give you some perspective in terms of how we're looking at it. It's taking a full review of how something that might happen in the interest rate side. It was a large part of the change that we made around our reserves and we're going to see how that blends in over, as I said, up to the next 5 years on that front. The second piece of it was looking at termination rates. It's very much using industry data which helps to inform our decisions with our own data. And these trends are actually becoming a lot more credible as the Society of Actuaries has a lot more data out there. So it's not just something we're seeing internally, it's how we're blending that with what we're seeing externally on those 2 different fronts. When you think about the reserves, the GAAP reserves are more closely approximate the stat reserves in aggregate today. There are multiple pieces underlying that, but I think that when we look at that today, the actions that we took, the actions of closing the block as well as looking pretty hard at the reserves on a best estimate basis take us close to those statutory reserves as well, and we feel comfortable today as we've said on those 2 fronts.","Operator","And we'll now move to Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I wanted to follow up a little bit on the difference between the GAAP and stat reserve assumptions. The discount rate is pretty self-explanatory, so I guess I'm more interested in the claim terminations and recovery assumptions, but it seems like all the GAAP charges were caused mainly by emerging industry and Unum-specific experience, so guess I'm a little surprised that, that was already reflected in the previous statutory assumptions even though understandably those are more conservative to begin with. Can you just walk me through that a little bit please?","Richard McKenney","Sure, I'll look at the -- I mean specifically, I think the only one that really you should be looking at there might be the terminations. The interest rate, as you said, as you go into -- they start off on a more conservative basis, on a statutory basis from a discount rate. And we've reflected a more conservative basis on our U.S. GAAP best estimates as well relative to what we had had previously. And so when you look at termination rates on a statutory prescribed basis, those are actually established early on and trend over that period of time. When you take all those things together and looking through it, as we said, the statutory reserves would look more similar to the GAAP reserves, doesn't mean they're one for one across every different attribute, but in aggregate, they look to be about the same today.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I guess what was the key initial difference between the stat assumption and GAAP in terms of terminations? Was it just more conservative morbidity assumptions, was it high mortality -- I mean, I guess, if you're living longer, I guess just looking for some more specifics.","Richard McKenney","Yes, Ryan, you're isolating one aspect of the total reserves and you can't really do that relative to the overall. They look at it on an aggregate basis as opposed to attribute by attribute and comparing the 2. So I would caution you from doing that, particularly on just an isolated claim termination rate. It doesn't really work like that. And you need to look at the reserves in aggregate, the different pieces, how it looks together. And at the best estimate reserves on a U.S. GAAP basis are more consistent with the more conservative originally set up. And understand, there are many, many cohorts that go into part of the statutory reserving process over many, many years where the original assumption set up on stat has continued to run and have trended over time. So I'd caution you from trying to isolate any particular piece to the reserves. Just know that in aggregate, they're consistent and we feel comfortable with them.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then just one quick one. Do you know how much statutory capital is associated with the Long-term Care block of business?","Thomas R. Watjen","We need to get back to you on that one.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Mark Finkelstein, Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Let me actually tackle that question in a slightly different way. At year end you would've been subject to year-end asset adequacy or cash flow testing which would've looked at, obviously, the assumptions. How meaningful was the cushion above the level at which you would've had to have taken a statutory reserve hit?","Richard McKenney","Mark, let me give you a little bit on that. One is that you'd have to look at it on an entity by entity basis, cash flow testing is done for each individual statutory entity. With some netting, actually, you can look across multiple product lines and so we'd say in those entities where we are writing multiple product lines, there's certainly a high degree of sufficiency across those lines. Some entities you have to look at it product by product where things were tighter. But when I take it back in aggregate in our statutory entities, the cash flows associated with those statutory entities at year end netted down, and you can see from our first base capital ratio up at 405% that they're in a very good position. So it's a more complicated question than you're asking and not one that I want to get into it at this moment.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, let me just ask it slightly differently. I know that there's the ability to kind of cross fund within legal entities and it's an overall testing, but is your best guess that if you just isolated Long-term Care that the assets would've been sufficient based on the scenario testing, or is there a lot of benefit from the LTD or what have you?","Richard McKenney","Yes. It's really not an isolation test we do on many of our entities because it is a netting across the board, so I don't know if I'd want to get into isolating every specific attribute of our entities.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess you talked about the reserve being a blend of your own experience, but largely incorporating the most recent Society of Actuaries factors. I guess I'm just curious, if your own data isn't viewed to be credible, why wouldn't you fully reflect what the industry factors are looking like, and if you did that, how meaningful would the difference have been in what we saw this quarter?","Richard McKenney","Yes, when you look at it, actually, a lot of the data that we're needing to use from the external world are get out into longer durations where we just don't have the data. In the nearer term, as we have more credible data, we're actually reflecting more of our own experience and looking at the 2 of those. So I think we actually are looking, relying on external data for some of the long durations already, and some of the shorter durations closer to the products that were originated, we're using our own data. I'm not sure if I'm answering your question, but I think that credibility has come through, and in some of our own data, we're using that, and where the Society of Actuaries now has credible data in their most recent study, we'll use that as well. So when I say blend, it almost deals more with the blend over the horizon of different claim patterns.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just finally, the last question is, you talked about the reserve assumptions being based on kind of interest rates at where they are for a 3 to 5-year timeframe, is the answer the same on stat as GAAP? So if rates stayed where they are, you wouldn't really need to make an impact for that variable alone under either stat or GAAP, or is that just a GAAP commentary?","Richard McKenney","That was very much a GAAP commentary. If you think about the stat, those are prescribed rates and the tests that govern those reserves actually are more holistic than looking at any particular attributes on the stat side.","Operator","And now we have Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets in the queue.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm very interested in exploring this whole mortality issue just because -- I was telling Tom White last night, I don't think this is the first time this has happened. I think we're going to go back a long ways. But I think, call it 10 years ago, Unum took large charges in LTD because of issues related to cardiovascular care and separately related to the effectiveness of HIV-related drugs. Now we have 2 more mortality-related charges. Granted, a long time has passed since those last charges, but because we don't hear this sort of thing, a company being -- competitors being challenged by mortality. I'm just wondering, have you concluded that -- do you feel like you are keeping up with medical developments as well as you should to understand mortality, or do these 4 charges that I referenced, cardiovascular, HIV, Long-term Care-related mortality, Individual Disability-related mortality, do they point to an effort to perhaps improve your understanding of what's happening with life spans?","Thomas R. Watjen","Eric, let me start on that and maybe ask others to chime in as well, but I'm probably one of the few historians that can actually relate back to some of those times, actually. And Eric, I guess as you recall back to those times when we talked about updating mortality studies, I think frankly, there wasn't a rigor at the company back then to do that on a regular basis. So the mortality studies, I think, were outdated. And as a result, when we did put the combination of the businesses together, we had a chance to make some assumption changes and update some of those mortality studies and that's what you're referring to in terms of the company strengthening reserves back there at some of those early days. Needless to say, we're actually much more timely in terms of updating our mortality studies. So I think, a part of your question was is this a brewing issue that's broader than the one we're talking about here now. The answer is no, because I think there's a much rigorous process of updating the assumptions and reflecting that, not just in reserving assumptions but pricing assumptions and other things that affect that business. But again, I look to my colleagues, anything you want to add to that, Kevin? I think your team is very actively involved in making sure that we continue to keep all the studies that are associated with making these critical underwriting decisions current.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, I mean we update our underwriting processes all the time based on emerging medical data. We update our pricing on all our products that we can at least -- on that same data and then we update our reserves as well. The one thing I'd point to, Eric, is that this particular block that you're talking about was written back in the 1980s and 1990s. It's a Individual Disability, non-repriceable block and those claimants are just now in their lifetime benefits which we no longer sell, and haven't sold for some time. So this update is just as we see emerging experience based on policies that were written 20-plus years ago, and they're just now reaching sort of that extended duration, disabled life status and we thought it was appropriate to update it.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","One more quick one for Rick. In the news release, you referenced the fact that in Long-term Care, in the Closed Block, if you didn't have the reserve charge, your interest adjusted loss ratio in the quarter still would've been higher than the year-ago quarter, due primarily to an increase in active life reserves. How could you have an increase in active life reserves if you, under I guess what used to be called the FASB Statement 60, I thought the reserves are locked in and the only time you have an increase in the active life reserves, if I understand the bookkeeping correctly, is when you do a loss recognition study. So what is this increase in active life reserves and how can it happen, absent a formal loss recognition study?","Richard McKenney","When you look at the active life reserves, actually they're increasing giving the lower persistency. That's been a trend we've seen over a number of years, so that's what caused and has been causing, actually, the loss ratio kind of on a non-adjusted  basis to increase. We have now gone through loss recognition, so each of the assumptions across the reserving processes have been reset. So you shouldn't see that same deterioration because we are reflecting our current experience around lapse rates on a more updated basis, and we've unlocked those effectively, those FAS 60 reserves as we've gone through loss recognition.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just to clarify, and I'll be done at this point. This unlocking in the increasingly active life reserves, are we referring to the group business or to the closed down individual Long-term Care?","Richard McKenney","It's in the -- you're referring actually to the closed down Long-term Care business, which includes both individual and group.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And there is a policy or active life reserve on both types of policies or only on the individual?","Richard McKenney","They're on both types of policies. Actually, the group looks very similar to the individual as you go through the accumulation phase until you hit claim somewhere down the line.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Another question with regards to interest rates, just wanted to clarify either the rate assumptions you're using for Long-term Care are the same as what you're using for all other products you offer, or if not are we potentially looking at similar charges elsewhere in the organization if rates remain low. Second, with the IDI charge, I understand that, that reflects increased life expectancies for active claimants, can you discuss why that would be -- also affect the influencing your reserves for Group Disability claimants. I'm guessing is that group policies only provide benefits through retirement date rather than lifetime benefits, but perhaps you can clarify that.","Richard McKenney","That was a little bit rapid fire, the second question, but certainly, let me talk about the first in terms of rates in our other lines of business. I think we've talked a fair bit about how interest rates impact our other lines. It's actually quite different, I think when you look at our LTD business, we've talked about actually our portfolio yield has been above what we've seen on the discount rate side. We would've talked about last quarter, actually reflecting some of the interest rate environment that we had, and decreasing the discount rate on that, and we've been feeling that impact coming through. Although I would tell you in the quarter, our margin or the difference between our portfolio yield and that discount rate didn't move. So we actually still sit with a very, very large margin on that front. And our closed disability block, when you think about that, new claims, that are claim payments that are going out or matching up with cash flows coming in on premiums, so really the interest rate risk there is reflected and it's been very stable on that front. And those are really the 2 big pieces. I think the difference you would have had particularly to Long-term Care is that as we've gone through loss recognition and updated those estimates, we're giving a new best estimate relative to what the interest rate environment looks like today and how we see it potentially transpiring over the next several years.","Thomas A. H. White","Nigel, it's Tom White. On your second question, I think the key thing is that we don't have lifetime benefit provisions for our other products. We don't have it in the Individual Disability recently issued. We don't have it in LTD. So what we dealt with in the Closed Block is very specifically tied to that particular benefit provision, which we don't have elsewhere.","Operator","And next, moving to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Any opportunity for kind of the underlying in the U.S. business, the headcount, the salary growth, the pickup here? Any signs of life in the first quarter? You think the job market is showing some movement, if it continues to be relatively healthy, would you start to see more of that natural growth?","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe I'll let Kevin speak to that. Kevin, and maybe at the same speaking to job growth, also just to new case count growth which actually has positioned us well when we do see some job improvement.","Kevin P. McCarthy","A little early, I think, to see a sort of market and sales reflection of recent job reports, but I think if those continued, you'd expect to see some increase in natural growth. As you know, we were disappointed in 2011 that natural growth didn't come back where we had hoped it would. For 2012, we're not planning on it coming back. So any improvement in the economy, in the employment economy or in wage inflation would benefit us relative to our performance and relative to our planning. We did see some improvement in the second half of 2011 in what we call NBOC or updating of benefits by existing employer accounts. And we did see some increase in re-enrollments in existing accounts. Both of those would seem to reflect an improving economic environment for our customer base. And of course, we acquired over 20,000 new lines of coverage with new customers during the course of 2011. And so any improvement in the economy across, either job creation or wage inflation, would definitely benefit us on the top line.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Talking to the sales strength in the quarter in the U.S., were there more opportunities, more RFPs out there, more people were looking for new providers, was that an important driver?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I think we were pretty consistent throughout the year in terms of increasing our activity levels, explaining our value proposition in terms of our ability to package both group and voluntary products together, and I think that momentum just carried through into the fourth quarter. I think our sales and service organization out in the field did a terrific job reaching out to customers and brokers and explaining our value proposition. And our closing ratio is quite strong in the quarter but I wouldn't sort of turn that over and say it was because market activity in total changed very much. I think it was more a reflection of the diligence and effort of our sales organization.","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe Kevin, to add to that, I think that the growth you saw was probably most prominent in your core commercial and your core group and your voluntary which have been 2 areas where you put a lot of resources and focus on the last several years.","Kevin P. McCarthy","That's right, Tom. Over the last several years, we've worked hard in our field sales and service organization to what we call integrate our ability to deliver both voluntary and group products together in packages. We've talked about that in the past in terms of our Simply Unum value proposition and I think the effectiveness of our sales organization in delivering that showed up during 2011.","Operator","Now, John Nadel with Sterne Agee has the next question.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question about the New York sub and the Long-term Care business there. I know the New York sub houses maybe 14%, 15% of your LTC reserves and would be subject in New York to a more stringent cash flow testing at year end. Is there any need, based on that cash flow testing, to raise reserves in the New York sub?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, do you want to take that one?","Richard McKenney","Sure. John, as I was mentioning to Mark in going through that, it is a sub by sub type of evaluation you need to go to. New York, you isolate it specifically. We don't like to necessarily do that, but it does have different cash flow testing. As interest rates have dropped, we have looked at that sub and it has needed some strengthening reserves, given that they are not the offsets that you see in some of our other subs. We reflected some of that through the third quarter and saw that coming. So I think that, that is -- if you want to isolate one sub, I think that you can do that. I would go back to when you looked across all of our insurance subs, the net cash flows that we saw over the course of the year end, actually were netted to basically a neutral number, and that's why you saw the 405% RBC level.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if, and I know this is a big if, but if the entirety of your statutory book of business were subject to the New York, more stringent cash flow testing, can you give us an estimate for how much higher the statutory reserves would need to be?","Richard McKenney","It's a big if, and I don't think we would do that. We look at each of our entities and certainly abide by the statutory rules in each of those entities and go through that process. And when you think about it from managing the company, I think on netting basis across, I mean, there are pluses and minuses in anything that you look at, and I think that the fact that we are able to use excess margins we have in some products relative to other products which are more challenged, actually makes a whole lot of sense. But we don't deal with that state by state.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then if I can, just to -- I saw Fitch last night reaffirm their rating, no change in outlook. As of right now, I haven't seen any of the other 3 rating agencies out. Do you have any expectations that any of the rating agencies will sort of negatively respond to the quarter's charges?","Richard McKenney","Tom, you want to speak to that?","Thomas A. H. White","Yes, John, I hate to kind of front run what a rating agency would announce. I would say that we went through extensive discussions with all the rating agencies and just as we've talked today, talked about how the fact that this is a GAAP-only event, it's not statutory, it doesn't impact risk-based capital, cash flow generation or, in effect, the credit quality of the company, with the exception of our leverage ratio moving up, and also the fact that we had very strong operating results. So you see how Fitch interpreted all of that. I think the other rating agencies are basically in the same spot, but to the extent that they're going to make announcements, you'll see those coming out over the next handful of days.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. And then just finally, with all the reclassification, the 3 segments that were impacted, supplemental, voluntary, the Closed Block and Corporate, at least from a operating earnings perspective x the noise associated with the charges, is there anything in those 3 segment results that you would characterize this quarter as perhaps non-trendable?","Thomas R. Watjen","No.","Operator","And now we'll move to Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just on the Long-term Care runoff now. I think you had talked about re-rate plans, or price increases on that block, bringing in $25 million or $30 million of premiums by mid-2012 and 2013. So it's kind of a 2-part question. One, now that, that's in runoff, do you feel like you could put a little bit more pressure on re-rates. And the second question is, we have kind of a confirmation of overall earnings guidance, I guess, should we think of the Closed Block as kind of being our plug to get to that earnings guidance, or is there any update you can give us on the guide for the Closed Block going forward?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to touch the rating action, the pricing action?","Richard McKenney","I'll touch on both of them. When you look at what's going on, you talked about what we've actually -- the actions that have already been taken across our individual block of business. And I think when we look at managing this, and as I mentioned in my notes, we're going to go after rate where it's warranted, wherever that might be, and I think it's something we'll continue to look at. And if you see deterioration in these blocks, we'll continue to raise rates on them commensurate with that. So it will be an actively managed block. It will be a closed block but when it comes to rating actions and reflecting that, we'll certainly be active on that front. When you think about the Closed Block and the earnings outlook that we've put out there, 6% to 12%, I don't think that it's really changed. One of the things as we went through this process, the emergence of earnings that will come out of it looked very similar, than it would've looked on a run-rate basis anyway. I think it should look stable going forward, you won't see deterioration in that earnings profile, and so that's why it doesn't impact our earnings outlook for the year.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That's helpful. So a quick follow-up then, as far as the group business goes, there's no re-rates kind of specifically or implicitly baked into that guide?","Richard McKenney","No. Understand that when we go through pricing actions it takes more than 18 months for that to come through, so it's not going to impact our 2012 at all. But I wouldn't take off the table is that we would be looking at pricing actions across both books of business, the individual which we've already taken multiple pricing actions on, as well as the group business going forward. So that's out there, but certainly that doesn't come into play as we look at 2012 -- our 2012 outlook.","Operator","Next will be Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go first to the U.K. You talked in the press release about some impact from implementing new claim management processes. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on just kind of where that process stands. I mean Jack's been there, I think, for over a year and a half, I would've thought you're pretty far into that process, but can give us a sense of whether there's still a ways to go there, please?","Thomas R. Watjen","Hey Jack, do you want to pick up on that? In your response, Jack, it would be good to remind everybody the way the U.K. market works is a bit different than the U.S.","John F. McGarry","Yes, we are pretty well into that process. It took a long time to get up and going. I would say that the technical aspects of the claims management process are fully in place. We expect that there's some potential for modest improvements going forward as we fully embed the process and work on the culture and the management of the organization. I think that's baked into our 2012 plans, and it helps offset some of the pressure that we're going to feel from interest rates in 2012.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then I want to come back to the U.S. I think Rick just touched on this if I understand correctly. I guess I'm wondering about how the significant balance sheet charges in this quarter would impact earnings going forward? I would think at the very least, the fact that you've written off Long-term Care DAC would mean that we'd have an absence of DAC amortization, for example, going forward. But can you just clarify to what extent earnings will be different than if you hadn't taken the charge at this point, or maybe different than earnings would've looked historically in 2011?","Richard McKenney","Yes, I'll give you that, Jeff. It's actually mentioned in the last -- it actually was very similar in terms of where it is. Now, it comes from different geographies. So, yes, there is no DAC amortization, but there are different claims costs associated with how that works in the future. And also, as I mentioned, on the interest rate side we're now reflecting a lower discount rate. So there's a restructuring effect to how that earnings profile will emerge, but it actually looks strikingly similar to what it would've looked like in previous years or even as the result of our outlook for 2012, absent the charge.","Operator","And now, Steven Schwartz with Raymond James Associates will have the next question.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just about everything was asked already that I was going to ask, but Jeff's last question was something I wanted to ask about. The change or the write-down of the DAC in LTC has no effect on the ASU 2010-26 charges. I think you showed $14 million to $16 million on a pro forma basis for 2011.","Richard McKenney","Yes, actually, I should be clear about that with our outlook. We have changed our outlook around the DAC change that we'll have in the first quarter as a result of this Long-term Care charge. About $90 million of our DAC write-off would have been written off as part of the process. So now if you went to, actually, our outlook for the DAC accounting change in the first quarter, that impact we had previously a range of $400 million to $600 million is down to $400 million of our expected impact in the first quarter. So that actually is a change in our outlook with regards to looking forward to what we'll see in the first quarter.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right, but there's no effect pro forma on the earnings impact of the new standard?","Richard McKenney","There is not, no.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So the less DAC to be amortized is basically offset by, I guess, less commissions to be capitalized?","Richard McKenney","You have that and you have interest rate changes -- oh, you're talking about specifically about the DAC? Yes, that would be the case.","Thomas R. Watjen","Actually, operator, I think we'll just do one more question.","Operator","And that final question will come from Ed Spehar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to clarify something on the rates that you're assuming for the Long-term Care charge, are you assuming the continuation of current interest rates, or are you looking at some sort of forward curve measure?","Richard McKenney","When we look at that actually, we're looking at the current interest rates over the next 3 to 5 years. And what you would see in that, Ed, is the portfolio rate would come down effectively. We're setting the discount rate as to how we would see that come down. And there's a lot that goes into that, it's not just about forward rates, which are actually, as you look out 3 to 5 years aren't that steep anyway. But I think taking that into account, you're looking at credit spreads and everything else. So there's a lot of pieces in there, but our best projection would say that as we look out 3 to 5 years, that's how the discount rate would come down with our team performing at a level consistent with what they've done in the past.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Given the inherent difficulty in forecasting interest rates, and I don't think anybody can do it, can you just give us some sense of what the sensitivity is between if you assume current low rates for the next 3 to 5 years versus if you did follow something like the forward curve?","Richard McKenney","I can't do that off the cuff, and it'd be something we'd take you through, but I think 3 to 5 years, within that range, you wouldn't see much different on the forward rates. So we like to look at today's rates. I mean, forward rates are a tougher thing, particularly as you're only looking out 3 to 5 years in terms of how that might move. It actually can move around a fair bit. So we more look at the overall modeling of our portfolio. Rates we see today, credit spreads we see today and take that out for the next 3 to 5 years.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just one thing on your comment on opportunistic buybacks. I mean, even before the stock declined today, you're trading below book value, you talk about high returns on equity in your core business and I think that while maybe it's too early to declare victory, you certainly have had some better numbers on the U.S. economy recently. I mean, how much more opportunistic -- what's more opportunistic than right now?","Richard McKenney","I think in my comments I actually said we look forward to being back in the market, although I had not seen the share price, where it is today. I think even where it was yesterday, we see that as good opportunity to buy back our stock below book and we're going to take advantage of that.","Thomas R. Watjen","Well, again, thank you all for taking the time to join us. We know there were certainly some complexity in our release yesterday, but hopefully over the course of today's conversation, we've helped separate the strong underlying operating performance from, obviously, the important strategic decision to exit the Long-term Care business. And as always, we stand ready. If there's any follow-on questions, please don't hesitate to give us a call. And with that, I think, operator, this will complete our fourth quarter earnings call.","Operator","And that will conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas White","Great. Thank you, Divonna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call for Unum. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2012.

Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Our first quarter results were off to a good start to 2013. With year-over-year operating earnings per share growth of 9.6% and book value per share, excluding AOCI, increasing 11.9%. Let me touch on a few of my observations for the quarter.","First, our operating performance again remains quite strong. We continue to generate solid underwriting results across most of our businesses resulting in a stable to lower benefit ratios for each of our major business segments. As a result, we again delivered strong profit margins across most of our business segments and an operating return on equity of 11.7% for the company and 14.1% for our ongoing operating businesses.","Second, as it relates to revenue growth, it remains a difficult environment. And you saw that in our company-wide sales, which were down 5.2% for the quarter. Not to make excuses, but when you look more carefully at the results, you'll see that the decline is driven by 2 things, a significant year-over-year decline in U.K. group life sales and pressure on our small case U.S.-based business. The U.K. group life sales results should be no surprise as we have taken significant pricing actions in this product area.","In the U.S., the general environment remains challenging, which has been compounded by the fact that many brokers and agents and employers are focused on the implementation of health care reform, thus, delaying the implementation of new workplace benefit programs. This headwind may be with us for much of 2003 -- 2013, but is no cause for us to change our disciplined growth strategy. We continue to feel that we are very well positioned in our markets.","The third thing I'd point out is that we have continued to deliver very solid investment results and our asset quality remains excellent. We have not changed our investment strategies to stretch for yield but instead, have continued to take the actions necessary to manage through this low interest rate environment, including raising prices in those product areas most impacted by today's low rates.","In addition, our balance sheet remains in very good shape and our book value per share, I said earlier, excluding AOCI, grew by almost 12% to $30.24. At the same time, we have maintained a solid capital position, which when combined with our strong first quarter statutory results, continues to provide us with a great deal of financial flexibility.","Our risk-based capital ratio of 396% continued to be at the upper end of our expected range for 2013 and our holding company cash position of over $650 million is off but well within our guidance.","We repurchased another $95 million of our stock as part of our plan to repurchase $500 million for the year. We have now repurchased approximately $2.3 billion in stock since we initiated this program in 2008. Later this month, our board will consider an increase to our common stock dividend, which they have increased in each of the past 4 years.","Last, let me also touch on a couple of other areas that have, in the past, not performed as well as we had hoped, both of which I am happy to say continue to show steady improvement this quarter. I'm, of course, referring to our Unum UK group life business and our Closed Block. Our Unum UK group life business result is stabilized and we continue to have -- we continue to make progress executing our planned repricing and repositioning of this block of business. While more time is needed for these results to be fully realized, I am pleased with what we are seeing thus far.","And within our Closed Block segment, our long-term care interest adjusted loss ratio improved in the first quarter compared to both the year-ago period, as well as the previous quarter. This line continues to present longer-term challenges, but we are pleased with the improved risk performance we have seen in this line in the most recent set of quarters.","So in summary, the first quarter represents a good start to the year. While we continue to have a cautious view of the business environment for 2013, which may slow the growth of the business, we continue to believe that the disciplined approach we have followed in the past will allow us to continue to generate solid margins and returns in our businesses. That, along with our commitment to returning excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases, we think will assure that we continue to create value for our shareholders.","So with that brief review of the first quarter, I'll now turn things over to Tom for a brief review of the operating results. Tom?","Thomas White","Great, thanks. As you can see from our press release yesterday afternoon, we reported net income of $212.6 million for the first quarter of 2013 or $0.79 per diluted common share compared to net income in the year-ago quarter of $213.9 million or $0.73 per diluted common share. Included in net income for the first quarter of 2013 are after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $9.7 million and after-tax net realized gains of $6.7 million. Included in the first quarter of 2012 were after-tax nonoperating retirement-related losses of $7.6 million and after-tax net realized investment gains of $8.3 million. So excluding these items, after-tax operating income was $215.6 million for the quarter or $0.80 per diluted common share compared to $213.2 million or $0.73 per diluted common share in the year-ago quarter.","Moving to an overview of our business segments. Operating income for Unum US segment increased 1.1% to $208.1 million in the first quarter with premium income increasing by 2.5%; a lower benefit ratio, 70.9% in the quarter, compared to 72.5% in the year-ago quarter; and a lower expense ratio, were off somewhat by higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs in the supplemental and voluntary business line due to higher level of policy terminations.","Within the Unum US segment, operating income in the group disability line was $77.9 million compared to $74.7 million last year. Premium income increased 2% over last year due to sales growth and the impact of rate increases. The benefit ratio for this line was 84.3%, down from a year ago of 84.9%. This line includes a before tax gain of $4 million from the purchase and retirement of the debt associated with the Tailwind securitization.","In the group life and AD&D line, operating income increased 10.5% to $57.9 million in the first quarter, benefiting from an increase of 3.5% in premium income, as well as favorable risk experience, which lowered the benefit ratio to 70.6% in the quarter compared to 72% a year ago.","In the Supplemental and Voluntary line, operating income declined by 8.2% to $72.3 million compared to $78.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The primary driver of the lower earnings was a higher level of DAC amortization, which resulted from unfavorable policy terminations, primarily in our voluntary benefits product line.","Underlying risk experienced in both the individual disability recently issued and voluntary benefit lines was favorable relative to the year-ago quarter.","Moving to Unum UK Operating income in this segment declined to GBP 20.2 million from GBP 24.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio improved to 69.5% in the first quarter compared to 72.4% in the year-ago quarter, while premium income and local currency declined by 14.5%, primarily reflecting the group life reinsurance program. We saw favorable risk experience in the group life and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which were partially offset by less favorable results in the group long-term disability line.","Wrapping up our core operations, Colonial Life reported an increase in operating income of 8.2% to $75.4 million. Premium income increased by 3.6% and the benefit ratio remained generally stable at 52.5% compared to 52.1% year-ago quarter. Net investment income increased by 11.5% in the quarter and included approximately $5 million of miscellaneous net investment income above the level we normally experience in this segment.","In the Closed Block segment, operating income totaled $27.3 million compared to income of $15.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The interest-adjusted loss ratio for both the individual disability and long-term care blocks improved from the year-ago quarter.","For the corporate segment, we reported an operating loss of $33.7 million for the first quarter compared to a loss of $20.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Net investment income is lower due to lower yielding assets and a decrease in investment income attributable to tax credit partnerships.","Interest and debt expense was higher at $34.8 million compared to $32.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses were higher in the first quarter compared to a year ago due to less favorable expense accruals.","So now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick McKenney for a further analysis of the quarter. Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Thank you, Tom. This morning, I'll spend a moment on profit trends we saw in our business segments this quarter, including detail on our growth trends. Then we'll comment on the investor results and our capital position.","First on operating results in the first quarter, Unum US operating earnings increased just over 1% with favorable risk experience across each of our major product lines. Focusing on risk results first and beginning with our group disability business, the benefit ratio continues to perform well at 84.3% for the first quarter of 2013, which compares favorably to the 84.9% in the year-ago quarter and 84.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The underlying experience this quarter was favorable, with stable overall claim incidents, continued strong claim recoveries and the ongoing benefit that we realized from the pricing discipline we show on new sales and renewals.","Also recall that we reduced the new claim discount rate for Group Long-term Disability in the third quarter of 2012. This line of business continues to perform very well as we seek to balance growth but maintaining strong profit margins. The group life and AD&D line had a very strong first quarter as well. The benefit ratio improved in the quarter to 78.6% compared to 72% in the year-ago quarter, which led to earnings growth of over 10%. The improved risk results were driven by a favorable average claim size while claim incidence was slightly higher.","And finally in Unum US, the Supplemental and Voluntary line produced $72 million, which is lower than the run rate we have seen. We saw a higher level of policy terminations in the voluntary benefits line than we have seen historically. This causes more DAC amortization, which was partially offset by reserve releases as these cases leave.","As for the underlying risk trends for the Supplemental and Voluntary line, both lines of business exhibited favorable risk experience relative to the prior year quarter. The fundamental trends for both of these lines continues to be quite positive, providing the company with a strong long-term growth opportunity. This comes as we leverage our traditional employee benefit relationships to increasingly provide employee-paid financial protection products. Our markets are increasingly moving in this direction and we remain well positioned to serve those market needs.","Moving to Unum UK, earnings on a pounds sterling basis were GBP 20.2 million. This result is consistent with our expectations and we are pleased with the underlying business trends in the first quarter. The benefit ratio for the first quarter is 69.5%, showing improvement from the fourth quarter of 76.2%. The group life reinsurance program we initiated on January 1 causes a decline in premium income but will add more stability to this line of business over the course of the year. We did see some noise in the quarter with a small amount of prior year life claims that were not covered under the reinsurance program. But I would say otherwise, the 2013 group life claims experience was stable this quarter.","Beyond the claims experience, we continue to make good progress on repricing and repositioning our group life block and tactically increasing renewal rates for our group disability business. Average rate increases for group life will continue to run in the low-double digit range and persistency remains within our expectations. First quarter group life persistency was 83.5% compared to 82.5% for all of 2012. It will take several more quarters to fully implement our repricing actions, but as I said, we're pleased with the progress we are making so far.","Colonial Life, again, produced solid results for us with earnings of $75.4 million for the first quarter, an increase of just over 8%. The benefit ratio of 52.5% was consistent with the trend we've experienced over the past several quarters and is within our range of expectations. We saw a less favorable claim experience in both the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness and disability product lines, which was mostly offset by an improved risk experience in our life line of business. This quarter, we did see a higher level of miscellaneous net investment income in this line that helped earnings by about $5 million.","And finally, overall results in our Closed Block improved to $27.3 million this quarter compared to $15.4 million in the year-ago first quarter. Operating earnings in the individual disability line were generally consistent with the year-ago quarter. The interest-adjusted loss ratio improved to 81.5% this quarter compared to 83% a year ago, reflecting lower submitted claims.","Looking at long-term care results, we saw improved results with the interest-adjusted loss ratio at 89.5% for the quarter compared to 91.2% in the year-ago quarter and 89.9% for the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting more favorable recovery and mortality experience.","Now I'd like to move to a discussion of our sales and growth trends, first looking at Unum US. Overall sales increased by 1.3% in the first quarter with sales in the supplementary and voluntary lines increasing 3.6%. Our group sales declined by 1.6%, with sales in the under 2,000 life market declining by 12% this quarter as the market environment remains competitive and we think our corporate customers are distracted as they focus on the implementation of health care reform.","Growth in the group large case market increased by 21%, primarily driven by sales in new lines of business to our existing customer base. Our mix of group sales is within our longer-term objectives as 62% of sales were in the core market and 38% were in the large case market. Premium persistency for our group lines was slightly lower than last year's first quarter but remains within our expectations at 88.9% for both group LTD in group life. We continue to see little to no benefit to premium income from the marketplace. And in total, premium growth was 2% in the group disability line and 3.5% in group life and AD&D. While we would certainly like to see an acceleration in these levels, we remain diligent to protect our profit margins.","In the U.K., sales results again this quarter reflect the actions we're taking to improve the profitability in this business. Sales were down 46% in total with a sharp drop of 75% in group life sales. Clearly, this reflects our aggressive rate actions and decisions to pull back in certain market segments.","Sales in group disability were flat this quarter at GBP 7 million. Total premium income for the overall business declined 14.5% in the first quarter, largely reflecting the 50-50 quota share reinsurance referenced earlier that we put in place beginning this quarter in the group life line of business.","Finally, at Colonial Life, sales began in 2013 with a 4.9% decline. Sales declined by 3.8% in our core commercial market, but did increase by 5.6% in the larger commercial sector of the market. Persistency for our 3 primary product lines all showed a slight improvement over the first quarter of 2012. Premium growth remains positive at 3.6% for the quarter.","Transitioning to the balance sheet and the investment portfolio, there's little change to our recent trends of strong credit quality in the midst of an ongoing challenging environment for new money yields due to the low level of interest rates, as well as tight corporate bond spreads. On credit quality, the net realized gain position of our fixed maturity securities portfolio stands at $6.8 billion. Our credit quality remains in very good shape with a minimal level of credits on our watch list.","New money yields, however, continued to present a challenge, and for the first quarter, we had a 6 basis point reduction since December in our overall portfolio yield to 6.41%. We continue to manage through this environment by being selective in our asset purchases and look for the best relative value with the cash flow we have to invest. We have been running a higher-than-normal cash and marketable securities balance, which created a drag on our net investment income for the first quarter as we look for the best possible investment opportunities.","Additionally, we continue to make pricing adjustments on our new sales and renewals to reflect the lower interest rates. As we mentioned at Investor Day back in December, we estimate that the low interest rate environment will impact our operating earnings growth by 6% to 8% in 2013 at which we expect to recoup 1\/3 as price increases work their way through our books.","A good example of this is our U.S. LTD business. We did experience a widening in the interest reserve margin of 5 basis points from 87 basis points at year end to 92 basis points at the end of the first quarter. Given the low level of cash to investments portfolio this quarter, the portfolio yield remained stable while the aggregate discount rate declined as a result of the reductions we made to the new claim discount rate in the third quarters of 2011 and 2012.","Moving onto an update on capital. We continue to be in a very strong position. The most important driver of capital management is statutory net income, which totaled $175 million for our traditional U.S. life insurance company in the first quarter, an excellent start to the year. Given this strong performance, the weighted average risk-based capital for our U.S. traditional life insurance company was consistent with the year-end level of 396%, at the top end of our 2013 range of 375% to 400%. Holding company cash and marketable securities totaled $652 million at quarter end. And share repurchase activity in the first quarter totaled $95 million and we continue to expect approximately $500 million of repurchases for 2013.","Finally, we have no change to our 2013 outlook and continue to anticipate growth in operating earnings per share to be within the range of 0% to 6%.","Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. As we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating my opening comment. We're pleased with our financial and operating results for the first quarter. As a result of our strong risk results, we again generated solid profitability and returns and positive cash flow at the company. While generating profitable top line growth remains challenging in today's environment, we are maintaining our disciplined growth strategy which has served us well in the past.","Importantly, too, our balance sheet and capital position remain strong, which enables us to continue to supplement our operating performance with consistently returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend increases.","This completes our prepared remarks. And operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to drill in a little bit on some of the market dynamics, I guess, in the U.K. and the U.S.. In the U.K., I think you said the group life sales is down 75%, but persistency sort of hung in. So I guess, that might suggest maybe that the rate increases are maybe sticking up some of the renewals but things are pretty challenging, I guess, on the sales front. So I guess, the sales down 75%, very good to see you're disciplined but is there any -- do we see any hope that the market is going to start following you at some point?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to touch on that?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. I think the persistency does reflect that rate increases, so far at least, are sticking to a reasonable degree. I think that the decline in sales is primarily driven by 2 things. One, we discontinued sales of certain products within our group life portfolio that we deem to be just too unprofitable for us to continue to pursue. And we significantly ramped down our large case group life sales, where we saw significant profit deterioration during 2012. That's primarily what's driving down the sales comparison.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you weren't necessarily losing head-to-head, you just weren't competing for as much business essentially.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Right. I think we're very competitive still even though we're moving rates up in the core market but I think we've, much like we did in the United States, backed away from the more volatile and more difficult profit picture of the large case market.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","But then once again, kind of get back to the key points, so you do see there's some hardening of the life rate across the market?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, to some degree. I mean, we're certainly moving them up and other competitors are moving them up to some degree as well, although not to the rate or the extent that we are.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then in the U.S., I was interested, I think the group sales being limited, I think you attributed to the uncertainty around reform and I guess the idea maybe is that business maybe isn't churning as much. But then, I guess, if that's true, I would have thought maybe that would have been a kind of a help to persistency. I think persistency was a little bit off there. So is there actually less market churn or what's going on there?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Persistency is off but not by very much. And when you take into account that is driven by the fact that we're moving rates up in the sort of mid- to upper-single digit range, I think we sort of expected that. Last year's persistency also was sort of incredibly high. I mean, maybe historically high over the last 7 or 8 years. So I think it's operating pretty much in the 88% to 89% kind of range or 87.5% to 89% range that we expected to operate at. And I think we're feeling quite good about our ability to place rate increases. But then in the marketplace, in terms of health care reform, most of the pressure, I think, is in the smaller end of the market and that shows up in our sales results. Our small case sales were down 19% but our mid-market sales were up 6% and our large case sales were up 18%, primarily driven by the vast majority of new sales to existing large case customers. And so I think -- and I think that the dynamics that we're talking about are reflected in other competitors' results as well. Small case market, I think, is a little bit sort of under the gun in terms of what are we going to do by January 2014 around health care reform, how are we going to work with exchanges. And I think that's driving activity levels down. And that's probably increasing some inertia in terms of movement of sales.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","This is pretty much a 2013 phenomenon that kind of has to get sorted out by the end of the year, is kind of what you think about it?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, I would think about it that way, yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I wanted to start with the benefit ratios across your segments. I mean, if I just look year-over-year, it looks like pretty much everything is moving in the right direction. And we've had a couple of other companies report last night and I would say that things have been much more mixed on the underwriting side at some of those names. So I guess I'm trying to understand if what you're seeing is sustainable or did you just have a really good quarter and maybe things just start to revert a little bit as we move through the year.","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, why don't you start with that one.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. I think it's a mixed -- in answer to your question, Suneet. I think on group disability income, that was a particularly good quarter, sort of everything went well, submitted incidence are slightly down, paid incidence remained flat, actuals expected incidence was better than pricing assumptions, STD incidence was moving its way down. Hopefully that continues. But I think the loss ratio, we've always said, would be sort of in the 84% to 85% kind of range. And there might be little movements here and there inside of that range, but we're pretty happy with the quarter, that's for sure. In group life, we had favorable mortality and favorable severity and that helped us out and moved that loss ratio down a bit. But again, that loss ratio tends to be in that 70% to 72% range. And it's sort of at the lower end of the range but above we expect it to be. And then in voluntary, the loss ratio was lower than we would normally expect. We'd expect it to be closer to the 50% to 52% range, but that was primarily driven by the, I think, the life reserve releases as result of the large case terminations of voluntary.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then are you expecting, on the voluntary, I mean, as you peer in the second quarter, this issue around large terminations, I mean, is that going to persist, do you think?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I think we'll get some of that throughout the year. We're trying to be more disciplined in our underwriting, particularly around large accounts that have high employee turnover rates and low re-enrollment rates, and where profitability starts to decline and we can't get it back sort of on the volume side, we can't get it back on the repricing side either, so we're just not interested in continuing to pursue those accounts. The majority of that, I think, would be more focused in the first quarter in terms of renewal activity than throughout the rest of the year. But you'll see some continued effect of that throughout the year, I think, in voluntary as we work our way through that. And I also think, on the voluntary sales side, the voluntary market is going to experience some of that same health care reform pressure as companies -- I mean, employers and voluntary carriers try to figure out what exactly is the nature of the voluntary wrap-around sales is going to work with a yet undefined health insurance exchange program. So I think in both cases, you're going to see that kind of pressure.","Thomas R. Watjen","Maybe, Kevin, I could add to -- I think if you look at both our Unum US performance, as well as the Colonial performance from a persistency point of view, I think, historically, we've always had a much higher persistency than the marketplace. And I don't think we see any changes in that as we look forward.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Right. I would suspect that the persistency will eventually revert back to the median, close to the 79%, 80% range as the year goes forward.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then a question for Rick on the long-term care Closed Block. So good to see that interest-adjusted loss ratio kind of came -- stayed below 90%. I think it's in line with what you guys built into your reserve build at the end of 2011. I guess my question is are we yet seeing the benefit in terms of the price increases in the denominator of that calculation? I know in the past, Kevin's talked about being x percent of the ways through the price increases but I think there's also been this commentary around it's going to take a while for that premium to actually emerge through the income statement. So I just want to get a sense of where we are on that.","Thomas R. Watjen","Good. I think you characterized it well. I think we are tracking that process to our expectations and working with our regulators to go through that process. So to date, that's working reasonably well. But you're right, it does take some time for that to come through the premium line, through implementation and the different things that have to happen there. So we haven't really felt that impact yet. And in fact, some of the benefit we see is from previous price increases going back several years. So this is a longer-term trajectory that we have to work through, but I think that, in terms of actions that we can take, we're doing reasonably well and tracking to our expectations.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Hughes with SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","In Colonial Life, what is the outlook for recruiting and the overall size of the sales force in 2013?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Randy, you want to touch on that? And maybe even, as you do, to maybe talk about just some of the strategy adjustments we're making I think in terms of how to position the sales force.","Randall C. Horn","You bet, I'll do that. We have ratcheted down our recruiting, Mark, here in the first quarter, that was intentional. We were dropping it from roughly around 1,500 agents recruited in the first quarter a year ago down to -- it was in the 900 to 1,000 range. We think that's a much better balance of quantity and quality. We're very focused on training these new reps effectively and getting the best possible return out of that effort. So I really see the size of our sales force stabilizing in that probably 11,000 to 12,000 range by year-end. Don't see any dramatic decreases but won't see it significantly increasing either. But I think, well, really our strategy is around getting better return, higher levels of productivity per rep. And I think that's going to serve us well over time.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. How about on the U.S. Group business, you said there's some delay-related health care reform. How about competition? You've obviously taken some pricing actions? Do you think you're ahead of the market now in that and it may take some time for the market to catch up with you?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. Mark, I mean, I think we've been consistent over the last several years in moving prices up. I think a number of competitors, in the recent 12 to 18 months, have started to move prices up as well in response to some of their deteriorating loss ratios. But I think we were certainly ahead of the game. And I think when you look at industry pricing statistics, we still tend to be sort of priced somewhat higher than the majority of our competitors in the core market. I think every carrier is faced with the same low interest rate environment and ought to be moving their rates up to some degree. Everyone's, I think, faced some deterioration in loss ratio, except for us pretty much, and so ought to be taking that kind of action. And everyone's got the same sort of effect of an aging population with the expectation at least of claims sort of following the aging of the population and if you can continue to price for that, then you can stabilize your loss ratios and continue to generate your proved return. So competitively, I think, the market is, I think, a little bit harder than it was maybe 2 years ago, well, but I still think we're ahead of the market on that.","Thomas R. Watjen","And, Mark, if I could add to that, too. I think, as you know, you have to think about every carrier has a different starting point as they think about repricing. And I think, Kevin, in Unum US, we have about a 13% ROE for the group disability line of business. So therefore, when we talk about price adjustments, they're really to reflect primarily the increase, or the lower discount rates that we have and the lower interest rate environment. I'm not sure if every carrier is finding -- find themselves in that same situation as they talk about repricing strategy.","Kevin P. McCarthy","Right. I think if you looked at the industry margins, they're considerably lower than the margins that we're throwing off.","Operator","We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first, a question on buybacks. I think you did $95 million this quarter. That's lower than what you've done in the last few quarters. So is there any reason for that? And how do you expect buybacks to ramp-up as the year goes on? And then on the sales, you discussed this a little bit in the past few questions, but how much of the sales weakness is because of just a disruption on health care reform or is part of it that, there are still competitors out there that are somewhat aggressive on pricing?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rich, you want to take the first one?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. When you look at our buybacks of $95 million in the first quarter, one, we're very happy with that. We think relative to our market cap, we still continue to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. When you look at our trend line, what we've done in various quarters, we've been in and out of the market and so I wouldn't read anything into a $95 million a quarter other than that how we get into the market. But the bottom line is we still look at $500 million for the year. We think that's consistent with our capital generation model. And that, in conjunction with dividends, we think is a very effective way to return capital to our shareholders.","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, want to pick up on the sales question?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Jimmy, it's hard to quantify how much of it is from health care reform. I expect...","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just not -- just in general terms, is that more or is it that you're like in some parts of the market, you're losing share or losing cases to other companies?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes, activity's down about 10% year-over-year. So you'd expect that, the stable closing ratios to sort of translate in that similar kind of pressure on your sales. There certainly are some aggressive competitors out there. I don't think we're winning or losing much more than we have been in the past. But always in this marketplace, regardless of how many carriers are acting some of the prices up, there are always several carriers that are acting to take advantage of that and trying to drive their sales up. And you just got to look at sales numbers to see that.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then in the U.K. business, what was the benefit? And then what would the results have looked like had you not had the reinsurance contract in place? And what are your intentions as to potentially renew this for next year?","Thomas R. Watjen","Okay. Certainly, when you look at the reinsurance contract, in the first quarter, I'd say it's kind of a wash so the underlying results in the quarter were actually pretty good in our group life line, so all else being equal, I think we may have a lost a little bit by having that reinsurance but I think we still are very happy that we're in that structure going throughout the year. As we mentioned, we did have a little bit of carryover from previous year claims that came through that weren't covered, so it elevated the loss ratio a little bit. But that's the structure that we like relative to our business and the size of our business and the volatility that we want to see. So I wouldn't speculate in terms of how we take that out over time, but certainly still happy it's in place here in the first quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I just wanted to touch on the UK and see how we should be thinking about earnings once we sort of get through the pricing changes. So -- and the reason I asked is the reinsurance transactions appear to be doing what you've really targeted, which is reduce some of that earnings volatility we've been seeing the past couple of years. But presumably, it's going to give up some of the upside so when profitability improves. So versus sort of the low $30-million-or-so you're trending versus maybe what we saw a couple of years ago, which was consistently in the $50-million-or-so of quarterly range there. I mean, I guess, where should we kind of end up here once you get through all your pricing actions?","Richard P. McKenney","It's difficult to talk about in terms of where we end up much longer term when we talk about this year or maybe as we get out into next year. This year, we expect the business to be flat relative to year-ago period. So as we take through price, as we take through driving stability, and as Kevin mentioned, these lines that we are not continuing to write in that business, we'll see 2014 -- or '13 to be relatively flat. As we get past that period of time, and I'm not sure exactly where that inflection point will be, we'll start to see those price increases come through in the overall profitability of the business. So as we get out to 2014, we expect to see that trend line starting to increase but I don't want to leave the expectation that we'll get back to those levels that we were at several years ago. It will be one that's slowly increasing beyond 2013 as prices take hold and growth takes hold in that marketplace.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then your guidance, I guess the operating earnings piece you kind of pointed to down 2% to 5%. And then that would be offset by 6% to 8% of accretion from buybacks. So just trying to think how we should be thinking about the guidance given, I guess, the more measured pace of buybacks in 1Q. But then less, I guess, accretion and reduction of share counts based on the 30% increase in the share price here year-to-date. So should we be thinking about  towards the lower end of that range, just given less accretion from buybacks, or am I missing something in terms of the moving parts?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","I think those are all the right moving parts when you look at it, Chris. But I think when we take all those different pieces together, I think we still expect to be squarely in that range. So as we buy back over the course of the year, and as I mentioned, a little lighter this quarter but we expect to catch up on a reasonably quick pace, we still expect the benefits coming through on that front. And we will buy back a little bit less shares. The share price sits at these levels but nothing that will materially alter what we see over the course of 2013.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can just sneak one more quick one and just in terms of the sales mix for Kevin. Obviously, you'd wanted to see -- you'd want the mix to be better on the core piece but, obviously, you've pointed to a number of the competitive dynamics there. But I just want to try and get arms around how we get comfortable that the larger end of the market that you have -- what -- how do you basically assess the business that you're putting on to make sure we don't see loss pressures down the road from maybe greater share within a more volatile segment of your group business?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. As we've always talked about our large case business, we're pretty disciplined about how we go at it. We're opportunistic when we see the chance to get the price we want. And we tend to have off quarters when we can't get the prices we want. This quarter particularly was driven largely by new coverages added to existing accounts. So we're already familiar with the profitability of those accounts and we're pricing the new lines of coverage consistent with what we already got on the books. And so to the extent that they were already profitable customers, we're adding lines of business. If they weren't already profitable customers, we probably wouldn't be adding those lines of business unless we're adding them at a higher pricing than we'd have in the existing lines. So actually I'd view the quarter as quite an opportunistic and successful quarter in that regard.","Operator","And we'll go next to Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just one on kind of the health care reform. I'm assuming that, that is also a pressure for Colonial. But could you talk about maybe what you see as the potential impact on sales and demand for voluntary products once health care reform is implemented? And do you see this as a potential catalyst or, vice versa, a challenge for sales?","Thomas R. Watjen","Actually, Randy, why don't you get started on that because again, I think, you've, as Eric mentioned, you have a window into that with your business as well. And then I'll maybe ask Kevin to pick up from that.","Randall C. Horn","Yes, absolutely. Yes, certainly, some choppiness, as Tom and Rick and others, Kevin, have talked about in the current timeframe. But we're doing a lot of work in terms of training our field force who are providing guidance for employers regarding the overview of the health care reform requirements, we're providing recommendations on how employers need to prepare and respond, doing a lot of benefit counselor, certification type training in terms of public exchange requirements in their respective states. So you pull all that together, once we get through this implementation period, help employers get over the hurdle of just understanding the legislation or what the requirements are, we really see a very robust opportunity in terms of product solutions, benefit communication needs, that type of things. So yes, some challenges in the short-term but a lot of opportunity, a lot of need for what we provide and just a lot of opportunity for the BB market in the post health care reform world.","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, you want to add to that, too, especially, again I think we have some company-wide initiatives that we should -- we actually developed a strategy which I think is a little different than some other companies around making sure we can connect with some of those new emerging distribution channels within health care reform.","Kevin P. McCarthy","All right. Randy covered it really well. I would say that I agree with Randy, I think the opportunity -- the situation right now is sort of choppy because of a little bit of confusion and the need for education and the need to understand how exchanges are going to work and there is not going to be just one size, there's going to be many sizes and differences in exchanges depending on federal versus state versus private. In that context, I think there's a real opportunity to design wraparound products that fit with those exchanges. We're going to be introducing a new group of hospital indemnity product during the course of 2013, for example. I think there's a real opportunity, as Randy said, for new enrollment support and benefit communication support. And Unum US, in working with Colonial, we're now in the process of connecting on a plug-and-play basis to over 40 different platforms out there for benefit administration and health exchange administration and enrollment management. So I'm really optimistic about the future for voluntary given health care reform.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And is it right to think about you see the opportunity primarily in sort of supplemental products and kind of gap fillers that supplement what major medical would do?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yes. I would say the greater opportunity will be there. I think I don't see much disruption effect longer-term on the traditional group insurance marketplace. I think that will continue to sort of operate the way it has. Although you'll see I think a steady shift of employer-paid to employee-paid products over time, much as what we've already experienced. But the big growth opportunity I think is in voluntary.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick follow-up on voluntary as well. Are you seeing any changes in the number of people that are electing voluntary benefits that, I mean, you could possibly attribute to the economy? Or, I guess, just generally, has there been any change you've seen in election rates over the past few years?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I'll answer for -- maybe Randy can supplement but participation rates have been very steady for us during the course of 2011, 2012. And actually in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had quite high participation rates in our voluntary enrollment, so we haven't seen any deterioration in that at all.","Randall C. Horn","Yes. And, Eric, on our side of it, the same story. We've seen very steady participation rates. In the first quarter, saw a little bit of pressure in terms of the sales premium per application. I think there was some pressure there just with the general economy. The payroll tax increase had a little bit of an impact on things. But in terms of overall participation, very, very stable. It's even up a little bit.","Operator","We'll go next to John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two maybe different -- I think we've sort of beat sales and that sort of stuff to death at this point. I'm interested in the pace of the Closed Block disability premiums declining? That pace of decline has really slowed down versus what we've seen in prior years. And probably, at least I think it's slowed down versus what you guys were expecting to see. Any explanation there? Is that something that's just an anomaly here?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to touch on that?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, certainly. I'll give it a try here, John. In terms of closed disability block slowdown, what you're going to see at that time, and we're talking about a pretty long timeframe, so nothing you'd see in any particular quarter, is as people go through that process and stay on claim for a longer term, you will see a little bit of slowing but I'd have to go back and look. I wouldn't expect you to see anything dramatic here over the last several years. I believe you will see it slow down as you look out over the course of 5 years to a decade. So we'll have to go back and look at that, John, and get back to you on at the same point. There shouldn't be anything particular that will cause any quick deterioration in the runoff. We'd expect them to be pretty steady.","Kevin P. McCarthy","So Rick, if I can add to that. I think as everyone knows, the Closed Block includes the IDI business, as well as the long term care, and each different characteristics from a premium point of view. The IDI business was continuing to, and has continued to decline. At the same time, the long term care business is actually continuing to grow. So you've got 2 sort of offsetting activities actually within that block.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe that's just what I'm missing is focusing on one versus the other. The other question I have for you is just, a lot of moving parts, right? I mean -- and rates and new money rates are lower now than they were, let's say, most of last year. You're getting some pricing approvals on the long term care Closed Block business. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for, with all the variable inputs here, how we ought to think about the risk of some sort of reserve strengthening later this year? I know your 10-K indicated that there was potential for as much as about a 7% reserve strengthening based on a lot of different factors. As we get through 3 or 4 roughly months of this year, how is the combination of all those factors trending?","Randall C. Horn","Surely. John, if I were to take that and talk about where the reserves are relative, they really hasn't changed from what we've been talking about over the course of the last year. The pressure that we're seeing on interest rates is one that will take place over a period of time. We talked just over a year ago about a 3 to 5 year time horizon. And I think we've consistently said we're probably on the shorter end of that given where rates have gone, back to that initial look. But that still take us out a couple of years from now. With regards to other things that we're seeing and the morbidity, we've talked about our range of loss ratios in the 85% to 90% range. And as you've seen this quarter and last quarter, we're in that range. So its a dynamic business but I wouldn't give you anymore there that would say that there's something imminent in the course of 2013 different than anything we've been talking to you about over the course of the last year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sorry to do this. Back to health care reform and the impact on small case. We haven't really seen any impact, at least noticeably, on persistency. Do you have a view on whether there should be any persistency impacts?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I think so far, it's probably positive generally speaking in the sense that activity levels are down and therefore, take over account possibilities are down. And I think that's probably even a help maybe to persistency in general as brokers and employers focused their attention on health care. They're not necessarily focusing on moving their ancillary lines of coverage. So it's probably been a marginal benefit. Down the road, it's hard to tell, I think you might see, as I said earlier, some shift down the road as health care reform gets put in place from employer-paid products to employee-paid products and that may move lines of coverage from what we call our group lines to our voluntary lines even though we're retaining the customers so you may see some voluntary growth offset a little bit by some group persistency pressure in the industry in general. But right now, I'd say it's probably a net positive.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, interesting. And then I guess just on the sales side, does it get worse before it gets better?","Kevin P. McCarthy","No, I don't think so. I mean, I think it probably sort of stays as it is at the moment. It depends a little bit of course on competitive pricing dynamics too. And it depends on how much emerges. There's going to be a lot of activities during the second quarter from HHS and all those around health insurance exchange regulations getting sorted out. And as that happens, the pressure on brokers to communicate will increase. Hopefully, by the time we get into the third and fourth quarter, brokers will be starting to pay attention to understanding what's going to happen with their client base and what kind of health insurance coverage they're going to put in place and what exchange. And then they'll start to take a look at what they want to do with the group coverages. So I'd expect that this phenomenon might last for the second and into the third quarter, but hopefully, hopefully reverse itself in the fourth quarter.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the voluntary side, if you've already addressed this, but what is the follow-on effect beyond the first quarter of the surrenders? And is there a way of framing out kind of an earnings impact normalizing for all the kind of the one-timers, just kind of an ongoing impact?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to touch on that?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. The ongoing impact that you'd see, Mark, of that is most -- basically like any other premium loss. I think it was just a little bit accelerated in the quarter and that's why you'd see that onetime noise coming through as you wrote off the deck and as you wrote off that. So we'll use the margin on those cases that are left, and we'll replenish it with the new 2 cases that we bring on. So I don't think there's anything special going on there between -- except for just general block migration that you'll see.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just, I guess, continuation beyond this quarter on that activity?","Kevin P. McCarthy","I probably wouldn't look at that activity relative to I'd look at the overall premium size and the good margins that we see coming through on that. So, yes, there will be a little bit less margin that we would have anticipated but we want to replenish that with new sales and good margins as well.","Operator","And we'll go next to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So on the voluntary area, what is causing this attrition of business? Can we start there? Was it, again, was it a pricing and competitiveness issue? Or what exactly happened that led to this large loss of premium?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, why don't you start on the strategy side a bit because I think that's really where we're...","Kevin P. McCarthy","I mean, just basically for the most part comes down to being disciplined about where we want to play in the voluntary market. And we had several large accounts that we were -- that had high employee turnover rates and if we weren't going to get the necessary re-enrollment premium to bring the cases back to profitability. So it's not very different than the process that we've gone through on the group business. We're just -- we're focused on managing our in-force business effectively and making sure that we're focusing our in-force management and our sales management toward where we think we can get the best participation level, the longest sustainable relationship with the client and the most lines of coverage to deepen that relationship with the client. So strategically, that's where we're focused on.","Thomas R. Watjen","And, again, Kevin, I think when you start with the fact that this reporting segment had a 12%, 13% ROE. We're not -- when you talk about going through some of those initiatives, they're not really designed to deal with the real fundamental issue. This is more strategic about positioning in the marketplace and with certain customers.","Kevin P. McCarthy","And basically making sure that we can maintain and even grow those margins by having the right mix of business.","Thomas R. Watjen","Absolutely.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My second question relates to long term care. And I think you've touched on this in detail so I'm just looking for modestly more perspective. My question is this. When you originally, I think it was end of 2011, decided to exit to the individual long term care business and took your large reserve increase, you cited the fact, I believe, that your data were not statistically credible because of the small number of individuals on the claims. And you referenced a Society of Actuaries study that came out the prior summer that it provided a basis for the reserve charge that you took. Where do things stand now? And by that, I mean, what percentage of your policyholders are on claim? And in particular, would it still be the case that the data is not statistically credible, Unum's data alone is not statistically credible?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, Eric, I think the short answer to that is that it's still the same. The statistical credibility of our data is quite small. We're a small piece of the market and I think even the market is still working into statistical reliability so that has not changed at all. And that won't change for many, many years into the future, so we will look to the overall industry, Society of Actuaries, to give us some guidance in terms of how the world is shaping up on that front but don't expect that, that will take days for us in the near term or even in the medium to long term.","Thomas White","I think out of respect to the fact, we know there's another call coming up beyond this, we'll just -- we'll limit it to one more question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe to follow up on Chris's question earlier about the growth in the large case business. If I understand correctly, the growth is also, and even in the core business, it's in the larger case businesses. So should we expect some additional volatility going forward through that in underwriting results?","Kevin P. McCarthy","Yaron, no, I don't think so. I mean, the large case business, the national client group business as they said a vast, vast majority of that was sales of new lines of coverage and expansions of benefit coverages to existing clients. So I wouldn't expect any volatility, in fact, from that. The growth that we're seeing in the mid-market, which I'll characterize as sort of the 100 to 2,000 life or so kind of marketplace, that's strategic for us. We want to focus our sales authorization where we can get the best sort of productivity return for the sales ever given the margins that we have in our business. And so we tend to try to focus our efforts more in that sort of over 100 life marketplace. And I wouldn't expect that to have any negative effect on the risk side of the equation.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And maybe one more. Listening to the call today and your answers especially around health care reform, sounds like if everything else holds kind of the status quo holds employment levels, interest rate levels and so on but health care reform goes through and there's this release of pent-up demand, sounds like there should be potential for both revenue growth and earnings growth next year from that alone. Is that a fair way of thinking of it?","Thomas R. Watjen","Kevin, why don't you think about it from the sales point of view, and just the market acceptance point of view?","Kevin P. McCarthy","As I said earlier, I do think that when health care reform gets sorted out, the relationships that we are building with exchanges and benefit administrators, the products that we're designing to wrap around health care reform ought to generate upward trend, I think, in the growth curve for our voluntary lines of business. And I think that's -- I mean, the marketplace is confused right now. And in a state of confusion, it's sort of disrupted and there's lots of scrambling around and there's a lot of inertia. I think once health care reform gets put in place, I think there'll be brokers that will move more aggressively into voluntary. I think companies like ours that are well positioned on the enrollment communications and product portfolio side will be well positioned for growth.","Thomas R. Watjen","And I think many have heard me talk about this before but I think there remains a significant need for the things that we sell actually. And that very basic need for that protection hasn't changed with health care reform. I think what we're seeing at both with Unum US and with Colonial is it's obviously distracting brokers, agents and those that are involved in making the buying decisions. But that very basic need still exists. And I think it's becoming more clear to the market to public policymakers and others to that effect. And so that's why I think if you could sense some optimism beyond some of the disruption we're going through, it's because the basic need is still very much there.","Well, thank you, all. We know it's certainly -- as I said before, there's been a number of companies that have recently reported which creates challenges for all of you. So we thank all of you for taking the time to join us this morning. And this will complete our first quarter 2013 earnings call.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results and the strong close that we have for the year. Operating earnings per share, which excludes investment gains and losses, as well as certain pension and reserve adjustments, increased 3.7% to $0.85 per share, bringing full year operating earnings to $3.32 per share, an increase of 5.4% for the year, which is towards the upper end of both our plans and the outlook we had provided the Street at the start of the year. Importantly too, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, which I continue to believe is a strong measure of enterprise growth, increased 9.4% year-over-year to $32.32 per share, which is slightly above the 8.6% compound annual growth rate that we achieved in 2009.","Now let me touch on a few specific items before turning things over to Rick. First, we continued to generate strong results within our ongoing businesses, Unum US, Colonial and Unum UK.","Unum US had another strong quarter, driven again by favorable risk results across all of our business lines. For the fourth quarter and for the full year, each of our Unum US business lines reported improved benefit ratios, a result of our long-standing focus on disciplined underwriting, pricing and risk selection, sometimes at the expense of top line growth.","Colonial Life also delivered solid operating results with a stable -- with stable risk results and sound expense management driving another good quarter for this business.","And lastly, Unum UK continued to show solid margin improvement driven in large part by our aggressive group wide repricing and repositioning actions. Overall, these ongoing business segments are generating consistent solid margins, with an operating return on equity of 14.7% for the fourth quarter and 14.2% for the full year.","Secondly, the results of our Closed Block remained steady and were in line with our expectations again this quarter. The loss ratio in the long-term care line improved this quarter, and we continue to make good progress in our ongoing repricing initiatives in this line. There's still more work to be done, but I am encouraged by the work that our new team has done to bring greater focus and attention to this business.","Third, following on some improving sales trends that emerged from the third quarter, we saw strong sales growth in both of our U.S. operations in the fourth quarter. In Unum US, total sales increased by 5%, with especially strong results in our small and midsize employer markets, which are employers with under 2,000 employees. Group sales in these segments grew by 9.4% over last year, and our voluntary sales in these segments grew by 24%. We also saw a strong improvement in sales at Colonial, increasing 10.4% for the fourth quarter, which is up substantially from the levels we are seeing earlier in the year. We saw a generally good balance in our sales results, but that -- led by strong results in the midsized segment of that market, which are employers with 100 to 1,000 employees. Our commercial sector sales at Colonial grew 12.3%. We in the industry are still experiencing some challenges in the very small end of the market, but even there, there were signs of improvement in the quarter.","Lastly, our Unum UK sales declined 9.4% in local currency this quarter. Much of that decline though was attributable to tougher comparisons in the larger case market, and our group life sales were even, as you know, raising prices.","Next, moving to investments. Our investment results continued to be strong, particularly the credit quality of our portfolio. Interest rates and investment yields remain a challenge, with improving treasury yields in the fourth quarter mostly negated by tighter investments spreads. We have continued to -- maintain our investment quality standards and are continuing to adjust our prices in those products that are most interest-rate sensitive.","And finally, we closed the year on a very strong capital position. We estimate that our RBC ratio finished 2013 just above 400%, and our holding company liquidity position finished the year at $514 million, both well within or exceeding the outlook we provided for the year. I might add that these year end capital levels incorporate the completion of the redomestication of our Bermuda-based captive, which was not contemplated when we initially provided our 2013 outlook in December 2012. Even with this, we have retained significant financial flexibility and in the quarter repurchased $50 million of stock, bringing our total for the year to $319 million, and Rick will have more on this in just a few moments.","So to summarize, we are pleased with the overall results we saw in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2013. As I discussed at our outlook meeting in December, we believe that we are in good businesses and markets, and we are well positioned to continue to deliver solid results in our ongoing businesses in 2014. We are also -- we also remain intensely focused on actively managing our Closed Block segment, both the operations and capital investment in this business. And our solid financial foundation continues to give us significant financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders, all of which I'm confident will continue to allow us to create value.","Now I'll turn things over to Rick for a review of our operating results. Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Great. Thank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned in his comments, for the fourth quarter, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.85, which is up 3.7% from last year. This brings our growth in operating EPS for the full year to 5.5%. It's a good conclusion to the year where we expected 0% to 6% going into it.","Looking first at Unum US, operating earnings increased year-over-year, driven by good experience in the group life and the AD&D line and the supplemental and voluntary lines. Group life and AD&D produced very good results this quarter, with operating income increasing by 13% to $62 million. The benefit ratio was improved in the quarter at 70%, reflecting favorable underlying experience. Also, the supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $85.8 million for the quarter, up from $83.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Here, too, the benefit ratios for the primary lines of business were also slightly improved from the year-ago results due to more favorable risk experience.","Turning to our group disability business, we did see lower operating earnings, but this was driven primarily by a reduced level of miscellaneous investment income, which was about $7 million lower year-over-year. The item to focus on is that the risk results in group disability remains quite strong, but the benefit ratio declined to 83.2% this quarter from 84.5% a year ago, as the underlying experience showed stable to lower overall claim incidents and continued favorable claim recovery performance. This has been a positive trend we have seen over several quarters. Overall, it was a good quarter for the Unum US segment overall, with operating ROE for the segment at 13.7% and good momentum going into 2014.","Moving to Unum UK. Operating earnings were GBP 22.2 million for the fourth quarter, improved from both the year-ago quarter, which was GBP 21.8 million, and up from the third quarter, which was GBP 20.1 million. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are seeing with our UK business, particularly with the repricing and repositioning of the group life business. The operating ROE for the U.K. has improved to 14% for the full year 2013. We still see room for improvement and we are encouraged by the direction of this business. In the fourth quarter, the Unum UK benefit ratio improved to 73% from 76% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was largely driven by improved performance and margins in our group life line of business. Risk experience was slightly weaker in our group disability line, reflecting slightly higher claim incidents. But overall, I'm pleased with the momentum we're seeing as we go into 2014.","Colonial Life continues to produce solid, steady results, with operating income at $69.4 million for the fourth quarter. The benefit ratio was stable at 52.4% for the quarter as we experienced favorable risk results in the life product line, which offset some volatility in the cancer and critical illness and accident, sickness and disability product lines. Overall, the underlying profitability of this business continues to be excellent, with an operating ROE for the full year of 16.5%.","And finally, the Closed Block generated operating income in the fourth quarter of $26.8 million, consistent with our expectations for the segment. The improvement in the interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the LTC line was primarily driven by a lower level of new claim incidents. The increase in the interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the Closed disability block was largely attributable to a slight reduction in the claim reserve discount rate, which did not impact the bottom line.","I'd like to now move into a discussion of our sales and growth trends. The positive sales momentum that we began to see in the third quarter following the sluggish first half continued into the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased with the sales results we saw in the quarter in our U.S. operations. Beginning with Unum US, total sales increased by 5% in the quarter. The challenges we experienced earlier in the year from the political environment and disruption in certain sectors from health care reform implementation seem to be lessening but are still having some impact in the very small end of the market. Persistency for our primary U.S. business lines remain well within our expectations, but did decline slightly year-over-year. Overall premium growth for Unum US was up 1.4% for the full year. And similarly, our 2014 outlook calls for premium growth for Unum US in the 0% to 2% range.","In the U.K., sales were down 9% this quarter in local currency. Persistency in the disability line remained relatively stable at approximately 82% for 2013. However, persistency in the UK group life line continued to reflect the pricing actions that we're implementing. And what we have seen is that the lapses are skewed to more poorly performing cases. Also taking into account the group life reinsurance implemented at the beginning of 2013, our UK premium income was down 19% for the full year.","Our outlook for 2014 is for premium growth of 0% to 2%, with some improvement in persistency in the group life business and overall sales growth for Unum UK in the 4% to 7% range.","Finally at Colonial Life, we saw a very strong sales for the quarter, an increase of 10.4%, which brought the full year sales growth to 1.6%. Persistency declined slightly for our major business lines, but premium income increased by 3.2% for the full year. Our outlook for premium growth and for Colonial Life in 2014 calls for growth to again be in the 2% to 4% range.","Having covered our operating trends, I'd like to now review the 2 reserve adjustments we reported in the fourth quarter, beginning with the reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. You've probably seen over the last several years discussion with regards to the use of the Social Security Death Master File and how insurers are using it. During 2012 and 2013, we began proactively addressing the use of the Death Master File to identify life insurance claims for death within the current year so that we can identify and pay owners of unclaimed life insurance proceeds. In 2013, we also looked at using the Death Master File to search for our potential claims from previous years. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed our assessment of benefits, which we estimate will be paid under this initiative and established additional reserves of $95.5 million for the payment of these benefits. Our earnings release details the allocation of these reserves by our various life insurance business lines with Unum US and Colonial Life.","The second reserve adjustment is a reduction of reserves related to the group life waiver of premium benefit. Again, for some background, within our Unum US segment, we offer group life insurance coverage, which often includes provision for waiver of premium if one becomes disabled. The group life waiver premium benefit provides for continuation of life insurance coverage when an insurer is no longer paying premium because the employee is not actively at work due to disability. Our emerging experience and that which continues to emerge within the industry, indicate an increase in life expectancies, and at the same time, reflects an improvement in claim recovery rates, which also lessen the likelihood of payment of a death benefit while the insurer is disabled. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed a review of our assumptions and modified our mortality and claim recovery assumptions, which resulted in a reduction of claim reserves of $85 million.","Touching now on the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, and the watch list of potential problems continues to be quite low. In the fourth quarter, we saw treasury rates rise, however, that was largely negated by a continuing tightening of corporate credit spreads. So all in all, it continues to be a difficult investing environment, certainly better than this time last year, but we expect to see continued gradual pressure on our portfolio yields. As we have said before, we're not stretching our quality standards to reach for yields, but are working on careful asset selection while adjusting pricing on our liability to reflect the current environment.","Moving on to an update on capital management. Our statutory operating results continued to be strong. This quarter was impacted by the unclaimed death benefit reserve adjustment. But for 2013, after-tax operating earnings as of this item for our traditional U.S. subsidiaries was $680 million, consistent with our capital generation model. The underlying trend of solid statutory operating earnings remains very much intact. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was estimated at 405%, above the upper end of our target range of 375% to 400%. And holding company cash and marketable securities was $514 million at year end.","2013 was an active year on the capital deployment front. We bought back $319 million of stock, including $50 million in the fourth quarter, and raised the dividend by 12%. We also did some things that position us well for the future. This would include freezing the qualified pension plan, which is now in an overfunded position, and the redomestication of our Bermuda sub back to a U.S. domiciliary. This was all done while meeting or beating our capital targets we laid out at the beginning of the year.","And finally, our 2014 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share is a range of 5% to 10%. No change from our outlook meeting back in December, and many of the results of the quarter reaffirm these views.","Now I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating how pleased we are with our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. We have good momentum going into 2014 with our ongoing focus on continuing to profitably grow our business through disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, along with equivalent to maintaining sound risk management and managing our investments and capital; capital that we will continue to use wisely to support our business and return to our shareholders.","Now this completes our prepared remarks. And operator, let's please move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Mark Hughes of SunTrust.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on your exchange strategy, how many exchanges you may be on, and then maybe some discussion about how many other providers you might be competing with, how your pricing strategy, how you're approaching this distribution.","Thomas R. Watjen","Be happy to, Mark. Maybe I'll ask Mike to sort of lead that discussion. But certainly, obviously, Colonial is also part of that too because both businesses are certainly are connected to that whole developing area. But Mike?","Michael Q. Simonds","Thanks, Tom. Activity and interest in the private exchange market, which I assume you're referring to, continues to increase. But I'd have to say that actual volume of business that's coming through still remains relatively small to date. And the last -- so I think about it as regardless of the pace for the absolute level of adoption that it ends up occurring with our product line on private exchanges, actually, we feel pretty well positioned for a couple of reasons. The first is we've got about 40 plus connections into the benefit administration and enrollment technology platforms that are now forming the basis for the majority of private exchanges. So having put those in place over the last 3 or 4 years, we've actually gotten a good head start. So to your specific question, there's probably about 0.5 dozen to 1 dozen exchanges that we're either on or in the process of getting on.","A couple of important points. First, in each of those cases, the employer remains heavily involved in selecting the carrier and the types of benefit choices they're making available to their employees. That's important to us. And then, second, and to your question, the product forms and pricing parameters that we're using actually look very similar to what we've got through more standard channels. So we feel good about our ability to manage that risk on a go-forward basis.","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, would you like to add anything further to that? Because again, I know we're working -- both businesses are working closely on strategy and implementation.","Randall C. Horn","Yes, sure, Tom. We -- first of all, I want to emphasize we are looking at this from an enterprise perspective. So my team is working very closely with Mike's on this in terms of looking at potential partners. A lot of activity, as Mike said, out there, but we are collectively being very selective, very strategic and looking at exchange partnerships. We have somewhere in 0.5 dozen to 1 dozen range actively underway right now. But again, it has to align strategically with our distribution and service strategies. I want to emphasize also, as Mike said, that we are staying very connected to the employer. And the employer's going to be making the selection of carriers and coverages. So again, a lot of activity. We think flexibility is the key. But we feel like we're well positioned in that area going forward.","Mark D. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then a quick follow-up, Randy. On the Colonial commercial, a nice increase. Why is that looking so much more active lately?","Randall C. Horn","Well, I think it really is kind of a process, Mark, where we've been building momentum throughout the year, so really saw some good results in that 50 lives up to 1,000 lives segment in the third quarter. So really, it's just getting good results from the work we've been doing all year. Our field force is very active. I think things are loosening up a little bit at this point. In terms of the Affordable Care Act and implementation there, still some pressure in the very small end of the market, under 50 lives. But again, we're seeing things open up, a lot of interest in voluntary benefits. And I think a general awareness that voluntary benefits fit very well into longer-term benefit strategies.","Operator","We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, on just your comfort with long-term care reserves, obviously, you took the charge a few years ago in fourth quarter of '11. And at the time, I think you'd assumed that rates would be stable for about 3 years or so and then begin to go higher, but in fact, they haven't. So maybe talk about how you think about your long-term care reserves if rates are close to these levels around at year end this year. And secondly, on persistency in most business lines declined. I'm wondering whether that's because of price hikes you're trying to implement? Or is it just that activity is picking up and more business is being put to bed overall in the market?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, do you want to pick up on the long-term care piece first?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure happy to do that, Jimmy. I think when you look at -- one, we're just coming out of year end in terms of looking at the overall reserves, and so I think that's a marker we'd put out there. We talked oftentimes about interest rates and how we're managing through that across all of our business lines, including long-term care. There is pressure in that line. And if I took you back to 2011 when we first made those comments around interest rates, we talked about the horizon we'd have and the pressures we've seen out there. I think today, we've actually done probably better than we anticipated at that time, but those pressures are out there and real. And I think that what you see in the market today is reflective of that. But I'll also tell you that, I think, when you look at long-term care reserves and as we look forward, there are multiple aspects that we need to look at in that product line, both on some of the things that might be pressures. And you mentioned interest rates, as well as the things that we're doing from an operational perspective to actually mitigate that. And the biggest thing there is, is price increases. Jack, you want to make any comments around the operations in LTC and what we're accomplishing there?","John F. McGarry","Yes, so we continue to focus on the operations. We've actually strengthened the claims management process in long-term care, had a very successful year, which you saw are in kind of the steady loss ratio for the year. In addition, we've had great success on rate increase strategies. We're ahead of the goals we set for ourselves in the QTD when we set it up, in particular, that strong results on the group long-term care side, which is important because those premiums go on for a lot longer. And so getting an increase on the group side actually worked more to us over the long haul than getting individual. So we've made progress on the operational fronts and we're continuing to make progress. We'll be filing additional rate increases both on the individual side as well as the group side and are optimistic about our chances of continued growth there.","Thomas R. Watjen","And Jimmy on your persistency question, frankly, the answer differs a little bit by business and by product within business. Maybe what we'll do is just go around the horn a little bit and each ask -- each business had to speak to it. But Mike, you want to talk at first on the persistency trends in the quarter?","Michael Q. Simonds","Absolutely. So we saw persistencies in the high 8s, which, in an absolute sense, actually, we're pretty comfortable with. It did come down 1 point or 2 depending on the product line for Unum US from a 90% plus level. I'd say that was abnormally high. And it's a little bit the same -- different sides of the same cords -- coin where we saw a slow -- sales slowdown in the market, that hurt us a bit early in the year from a sales point of view. But it helped us from a persistency point of view as business was moving less frequently, played to our advantage in the renewal program. But if we look at it, persistency in the high 8s to us feels very good. As we look at our renewal inventory headed into next year, we feel good about maintaining to slightly improving that level. And I think, maybe the last point is, importantly, the business that is coming off the books is at substantially lower margins in the business that we're retaining. So in aggregate, we feel pretty good about it.","Thomas R. Watjen","And maybe, Randy, just to pick up on the persistency trends in your business.","Randall C. Horn","Yes, okay. We're continuing to see generally very stable persistency in all of our product segments. It's kind of staying in that high 70s, 79% plus to 80% range, ticked down just a little bit in the fourth quarter, but nothing we're concerned about. Again, very stable by each product segment.","Thomas R. Watjen","And I think lastly, Peter, I think, you have probably the most do with some repricing actions. And maybe just speak a little bit of how that's affected some of your persistency, especially in group life.","Peter G. O'donnell","Thanks very much, Tom. Yes, I would sort of put the persistency into 2 different categories. So I think on income protection, our persistency was bang in line, actually, a little bit better than we expected. We got the rate we wanted. We got the persistency we wanted, and that's gone pretty much almost spot on to plan. On group life, it's a different story. We had more to do on the discipline we had to apply there. What we've done is actually we've outperformed on rates, so we've done better than expected on rates. But our persistency hasn't quite made where we wanted it to get it to. But we have lost the schemes that were most poorly performing, and the competition has picked those up, pick up at the rates that they were going in the marketplace.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And the U.K. book, about 2\/3 is repriced as of right now?","Peter G. O'donnell","I would say that's about right. I would say the income protection book is pretty much there. The group life book is about 2\/3 priced.","Operator","We'll go next to Erik Bass of Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment for voluntary benefits, particularly as more insurers are focused on the voluntary opportunity and are introducing new products?","Thomas R. Watjen","Do that, actually, again -- maybe lead us off actually, Randy, as it relates to the things you're seeing your marketplace. And Mike, if could pick up a little bit what we're seeing in the Unum US marketplace.","Randall C. Horn","Sure. Good morning, Erik. Very dynamic marketplace without question. There is a lot of competition, a lot of new entrants into the voluntary space. But that just tells us it's important to stay more focused than ever, which we're doing on our core segments. And we just keep introducing the right types of product updates and new product introductions. Our pricing stays very stable. We're not changing that to try to meet competition or buy share. I want to assure you of that. So again, very, very dynamic market, a lot of competitive intensity. But still a lot of opportunity, especially in that smaller end of the market and not nearly as much competition there. So outlook in general is very positive, again, due to growth in the overall voluntary space, and we like our chances in our target segments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Mike?","Michael Q. Simonds","I would echo Randy's comments and you'll see that reflected in the numbers. So in the core market for us, we saw voluntary benefits sales up over 20% in the quarter. I think, importantly for Unum US, we're seeing 33% to 40% depending on the size segment of all our new voluntary customers coming in on top of an existing or new group insurance client relationships. So we feel like that's a unique position that we've got on the -- got in the market and it's helping us with what Randy said is an increasingly competitive market. We do feel though that the outlook is good. And as health continues to change and deductibles continue to go up, that creates the need and the demand for a number of these voluntary products, which is a trend that I think is here for the long term.","Thomas R. Watjen","And Erik, if I can just add one little piece to this, as you know, we certainly, like everybody, we worry about competition coming into marketplaces, and certainly, we do have some very strong competitors in our market today, and certainly, new entrants into our market. I'll just remind you, we made a commitment to really accelerate our development of this business 5 or 6 years ago and put significant resources into everything from product to distribution to communication tools that I think you're beginning -- you're seeing some of the benefit of that now. So again, not that we don't want to ignore the focus of increased potential in this segment, but we've also been at this for a while too. And we -- as I said, we built some pretty good infrastructure and capabilities in both Unum US and in Colonial. And yes, the reason we chose to focus more energy here back 5 or 6 years ago is we saw the movement from a defined benefit to a defined contribution world, which has very much has played itself out, and so a lot of our focus has been around a theme which has really played itself out and I think it plays to the strength of this company.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I guess to follow up on that last point. As you're seeing more plan sponsors shift to a defined contribution model offering benefits, how does that affect how Unum has to think about both winning employer benefits contracts but also marketing its products to consumers?","Thomas R. Watjen","Mike, why don't you take that up? Because again, we spend a lot of time thinking about that. The focus throughout the company is because of what you just said and we believe strongly that, that is the case. That needs to be a much greater focus on understanding consumer and consumer tendencies both buying and why they don't buy actually. And so we're playing that out in both of our U.S. businesses. And Mike, you want to speak a little bit to that.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, the 2 points I'd make are, it actually calls for more active engagement with employers. So when you have a simple DB or employer-funded plan, it can be of more of a transactional business, particularly in the core. As you move to defined contribution, you involve the employee. It means you've got to have stronger relationships. So we've made pretty big investments in our client management team to make sure we're actively consulting with employers on how to design each plan, how to put the right resources in place to educate and handle enrollment. And a big piece of that is what Tom was referring to, which is investments that we've made on understanding consumers in the different segments, putting together product packages and hitting price points that play through those various groups of consumers. So that's probably the biggest stream of investments that we're making is in those enrollment, education and consumer capabilities. I think we're starting to see some of the benefits of that.","Thomas R. Watjen","I'll just add one more piece. So the other part of it is too -- and this is, again, where we can -- we have 2 avenues to get to those customers. We're also investing very heavily in that benefit communication and enrollment capability. Because obviously, the more the consumer is being asked to make choice and make decisions for themselves as opposed the employer making them for them, that's an important part of our deliverable too. And so that's actually one of the key things that differentiate, I think, both of our voluntary efforts in the marketplace from some of the new competitors that have come into the market.","Operator","We'll go next to Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I just wanted to follow on a similar line of questioning as it relates to exchanges. I guess in the past on these calls, from time to time, you've talked about the more traditional health insurance companies being more aggressive in terms of price in group life, group disability, et cetera. And as we start to think about the role exchanges may play in group life, group disability, and maybe voluntary benefits, I guess I'm trying to figure out, is there a risk that we might start to see some of the health insurance companies try to bundle a lot of these products on the exchanges and maybe offer a discount to customers or something like that in order to get demand and essentially take some of the business away from companies that don't have sort of a bundled approach?","Thomas R. Watjen","Mike, you want to take the lead on that one?","Michael Q. Simonds","Sure. I think there's always a risk that -- you got a new technology or new distribution platform that you want to stay close to and understand a couple of things. First, it's easy to go quickly to how could this displace current distribution channels. So I think it's important to note that in the lines we're in, it's a very underpenetrated market. So today, our industry is only getting to about a coverage level if you take income protection of about 1 out of every 3 workers. So as exchanges come on and they enable you to get to different parts of the working population, I think about hourly workers, I think about part-time workers, those are largely new opportunities and are growth opportunities for us. So there is an interesting angle around overall industry growth through some of these exchange platforms. But to your specific question around health carriers, I think what we're working to do is be part of the major exchanges as they come up, including those that are coming up through health insurers. So we've got a well-established partnership with UnitedHealthcare, for instance, and staying close to developments on that front is a big part of our strategy. If you think about the group and voluntary benefits between Colonial Life and Unum, you've got major market players in major share. And so as exchanges are being constructed, they're looking to the industry leaders to be a part, and that puts us in pretty good stead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Understood. I guess, I'm just trying to -- and I know we're learning about these exchanges more and more each day. And so, if we don't know the answer to this, then that's fine. But is there anything that prevents a health insurance company, let's say, from just offering a bundled product that does everything, right, health insurance, group life, group disability, voluntary benefits and sort of -- because of volume discounts or something like that, essentially can undercut pricing in the market because they make it up on volume? I just don't know if that's even possible on these exchanges.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, good question. So first thing I'd say is health carriers have always done that. And now, we're talking about a consumer frontier and, but we've been at the employer frontier over several decades. And yes, there is always an interesting sort of bundling story on the health care front. But specialist carriers like us have been very successful in pointing out a superior value proposition. I think, the second point is having a big database that includes a lot of information about how different employees buy and helping to sort of also shape the offering on the front end, but also managed the risk on the back end is a big advantage. So while you could sort of simply discount, if you don't have a good line of sight to okay, for this type of an employer with this type of employee base, you're going to have a hard time. I think, building the right product combinations and managing the risk on the back end.","Thomas R. Watjen","And Mike -- if I can add to what Mike just said. I think, if you look back to history, there's been time and again discussions of bundling. As Mike said, even today before the exchanges were developed, group carriers -- group health carriers on occasion were getting into the market very aggressively, trying to come in market with in many -- in retrospect, very underpriced offerings to their customers with a set of bundled products, and it just doesn't work actually. And so not that we don't worry about those things, when we think about the competitive landscape. It's obviously a changing competitive landscape. I think you've heard us talk about this on previous calls. We do believe, we need to have a plan for how we've actually connect with the exchanges. As both Mike and Randy mentioned, we certainly do have plans for those. But we also can't ignore the fact that this is probably is not going to substantially change the landscape for distribution, how we communicate with employers and the individual employees. And if it does we're in a good spot, but also we don't want to miss the fact, as Mike said, there's an awful lot of good connections we have right now into the marketplace through distributors, through employers. And frankly, those conversations are continuing businesses as usual, and there's not a fundamental shift actually in how that business is being done. If there is, I think, we're going to be in a good spot. But also, I wouldn't overplay the fact that this is going to be a dramatic change in how things are done in the next several years.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. Just wondering if you can just shift gears to capital, maybe for Rick, just reviewing your 2014 outlook specifically around RBC. Can you just remind me, why the expected RBC ratio in 2014, is expected to come down versus 2013? I think, you actually were a little bit above the high end of the range you provided at Investor Day. And then second, you have mentioned that you've done some creative things in terms of capital deployment, in terms of pension plan, UPIL, et cetera. Are there any other big sort of ticket items that you might consider for 2014 that might compete with share buybacks?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. The -- In terms of the RBC coming down, I wouldn't pay too much attention to that. We've kind of been stable in our outlook of 375 to 400 over the last several years and that's our outlook for 2014. We actually outperformed a little bit. I think, this year with some better statutory results than we had going into the year. So we we're kind of still in that range, not much to read into that. I think at 375 to 400, we feel very good about the overall RBC position. But with regards to new items coming out there, it's a dynamic world. And I would have told you going into last year some of the things that we did, were not necessarily on the docket and similar to this year, and we're going to react to that, including the amount of share repurchase, we've got a range out there of $300 million to $600 million, and it means that we'll be nimble with whatever the market is giving to us. So we're going to be flexible on that front. The good news is, we do expect a significant amount of capital generation, and we will have opportunities to react to whatever environment, we see.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You reminded us in your end of year presentation that, that the Closed Block remains an important user of capital, and it's really depressing the ROE of the entire Unum group. Could you give us an update on the following: and we'll talk about the -- whether there's going to be a long-term -- or several analysts, myself included, have talked about whether there's going to be a long-term care reserve increase. What about looking at this from another perspective? Is there a possibility at this point of either releasing capital in any way from this business or enjoying somehow, notwithstanding it being in the Closed Block, a sharp increase in earnings from there?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, you want to start that one? And we'll get Jack involved as well in that response.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, sure. I think, when you look at the -- Eric, when you look at the Closed Block, I think, those points you mentioned around how it will evolve over time, I think are very good ones in terms of how we build the block, how Jack and team are managing it without stealing much of his thunder in terms of -- as those opportunities provide themselves to relive capital, similar to the way we did with our disability block going back several years. And we want to make sure that we are positioned, structured and ready to take advantage of those opportunities, where we can extract capital from this block. I will tell you that we don't see that right now. And as you look out over maybe the next couple of years, probably don't see it. But Jack is definitely positioning the team to be ready for that.","Thomas R. Watjen","Jack?","John F. McGarry","And so, UPIL being redomesticated was a good example of taking our first step and positioning that. We -- the block is still very immature. It's a young block, particularly on the group side. Results are -- can go up and down, I would say. And I think, we would be cautious, given the long-term nature of the block before we would take steps to recognize, I think, fluctuations in earnings or release capital in the block. But also the industry is maturing. So interest rates are getting steadier, more predictable. People are getting more comfortable with the reserve. So it's not happening today, but we're hopeful over the next 3 to 5 years as interest in the variable annuity block intensifies, that makes it over into the long-term care block as well. So we're going to position ourselves that if the capital markets ever do open up for long-term care, we'll be in a position to take advantage of it.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just as a follow-up on the long-term care, and speaking in terms of a timetable for whether an action would be taken if any is taken, back -- as I recall, back at the end of 2011, when you add to this, I guess, it was the individual business following your exit from the group insurance business, you were making the points as I recall that, while you had a large block, the number of policyholders on claim was relatively small. The number of policyholders in later duration of claims was even smaller still. And therefore, concerns about the credibility of your data, you turned to I guess, it was a newly released study of the Society of Actuaries to help you set reserves. Now, 3 years later, have things changed materially? Do you have many more people on claims that the data is credible? Or to put it differently, as you assess the adequacy of your reserves, do you still need to look to the outside to understand the opening outlook?","Thomas R. Watjen","Jack, want to give -- pick up on that because I think, you touched on just very, very earlier. but a little more detail on just so the status of our in-force block.","John F. McGarry","The number of people on claims with us has been pretty steady actually. It's increased modestly. It's not expected to increase rapidly, over time, high-single-digit kind of increases annually. And a part of that is because old people go on claims. They have high mortality. There is younger people on claim who recover. So we will see steady growth in the claim block. We don't expect to see dramatic growth. We act different than most carriers because we have a big group business. Most of our lives are on the group side. They tend to be much younger. The average age is still under 50 on the group side. And so, we would expect to have a much smaller claim block relative to number of lives insured in the amount of premium we collect than people have written in the older age. And that gets back to that this is going to be a long run, that it's going to be around for a long time. It's going to grow gradually. We don't expect dramatic things to happen at that ages, and we're preparing for that.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Finkelstein of Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two quick ones. Incidence trends in group disability, how do they compare to kind of normalized levels? How do they compare to precrisis levels?","Thomas R. Watjen","Let me take that and Mike can add on to that. I think that's a good topic, I think from the incidence levels, so we have a little bit of claims of that actually come in and then claims that ultimately get paid and I think that, that paid side has actually been fairly steady over the -- even throughout the crisis. That's one of the things that we saw is that -- where they actually went through to a paid status was actually fairly steady, probably elevated, slightly through that period of time has probably coming down slightly through this period of time. And I think that's a trend line we like the looks of.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, just to build on, quickly, I'd say the fundamentals of the business are strong. So whether it's paid incidents, which is steady then modestly improved recoveries offsets, those are in very good shape. In the quarter, we had volatility and miscellaneous income but as we sort of think about the business on a go-forward basis on the pricing trajectory, I think, we're in good shape.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Rick, the New York company, any changes in asset adequacy provisions?","Richard P. McKenney","No. In the fourth quarter, we went through and actually did not raise any cash flow testing reserves that we have done in the last several quarters. So we think that, that's achieved. Though which was driven primarily in previous years from interest rates, and that's achieved stability around that, so we didn't put anything up in the fourth quarter.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, last quick one. Is if you look at statutory earnings for the quarter, you add back the social security database matching, you actually add back a little bit of an adjustment you made that is kind of is offset at UPIL. Stat earnings are actually pretty strong in the quarter. And I guess, I'm curious if there's anything that was phenomenalistic in that number, or whether, we should be thinking about that as a trend-able number? I know, you talked about kind of the year being kind of in a normalized level at $680 million. But the fourth quarter, if you make those adjustments, were pretty good.","Thomas R. Watjen","I think -- Mark, I think, you're exactly right. The fourth quarter was very good and when you adjust for those 2 things. And it reflects many of our comments, which are the risk results across the board are actually looking pretty good and that would generate stronger statutory earnings at the same time. So we're happy with the fourth quarter levels. I think, if you pull out those 2 items, we're -- we actually get up over 700 million for the year, which is moving up faster than we probably expected at the beginning of the year and certainly helps our capital generation model.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","But there's nothing in that number that's going the other direction that we should be thinking through other than maybe just some seasonality?","Thomas R. Watjen","No, nothing that I would highlight.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to see if you guys can talk about what products you're currently offering on the exchanges in the large national brokers? And then of those products, which are the ones that seem to be selling the most? And recognizing, we are still in the early stages here, which is trying to get a sense of the product offerings.","Michael Q. Simonds","Tom, I would reiterate, we're talking about small volumes that have come through to date. What we've seen most prominently is actually simple employee-funded things like group short-term disability offer on a voluntary basis, group term life insurance on a voluntary basis. To be honest with you, participation has been quite different depending on the employer and the situation. And just another reason to stay close to it as it evolves and I think, volumes pick up here over the course of 2014.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, you guys, to be certain, you guys don't have a dental or vision product offering on the large national exchanges?","Michael Q. Simonds","We do not on the large national exchanges. But we rolled out over the course of 2013, dental as part of a bundled package using a partner. So we're taking that into our core market. And to the extent that an exchange partner's looking for that, we have gotten it on a private label basis.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then as your sense at the I mean, the dental and vision of those kind of the products that at least in the early stages seem to be leading the exchanges at least in conversations you guys are having with some of those brokers?","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, those are always of interest. But no, I wouldn't sort of signal that there is a dramatic difference from a basic term life insurance or short-term disability that those sort of all kind of all fit into a similar package.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then Tom, maybe as follow-up to Suneet question on voluntary as well. Curious if you think, we could see kind of some of the big maybe managed-care players that may or may not already have voluntary capabilities, look to make acquisitions. Or do you think, it will kind of look to build out platforms on their own?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, Chris, it's hard to say. I think, to start with what [indiscernible], lets face it, there's a lot of focus on voluntary for good reason. This is the direction of the marketplace, as I said earlier. This is a place, where we stake the claim out 5 or 6 years ago to make a much more significant commitment to this business. And it's certainly been, and we've been rewarded for doing so. It's also -- it is -- it's a little early to figure out what strategically is going to happen as the results for this, you sense that even with our exchange discussions. It's not real clear, how powerful or important its distribution channel exchanges are going to be. So all kind of struggling with a bit of a new world in trying to figure out, whether what's changed and what's not changed, because it may very well be that some things simply haven't changed. And just on the M&A front, I'd say Rick, it's safe to say, there's not a lot of voluntary businesses that are out there actually. And so, I think more likely than not, when people get in this business, they tend to actually have to build from within, develop relationships with some of the enrollment firms or some of the technology firms that have connections into those exchanges, because there just simply isn't a lot of M&A activity in this marketplace at all. We'll continue to be very active looking at things, but most of these things just don't fit that particular bill. But I don't...","Richard P. McKenney","Those that are in the voluntary space today are looking to get bigger. And so, I think that's a dynamic that we see across the board. And so, even if there was a desire to acquire in that front, they'd find scarce opportunities.","Thomas R. Watjen","And Chris, it might not seem as sexy, but I think, Mike mentioned it, we are actually looking at partnerships. Actually UnitedHealthcare is obviously one. But I do think in addition to people starting businesses, people looking to buy business, of which there aren't many, we're also going to see maybe more partnership link ups that happen as a result of some of these things that are happening in the marketplace. And I think, we crossed that cultural barrier frankly, because that often is not what companies like us in our industry do. But we're in a different spot right now. We developed, as Mike said, relationships on the dental front. We developed relationships with one of the largest health care companies in the country. And I think the partnership angle is also going to be the place you are going to see us continue to play, I think, as we kind of find people who have looked at this marketplace, concluded the cost of entry is too high, need to have it somewhere in their mix of products that they offer their customers, and we can be a very viable partner in a venture like that.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one for Rick. you mentioned the pension plan, the funded status there, the freezing of it. Have you explored any other strategies, risk transfer or any other risk management on the block?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. So when we look at our pension plan, Chris, I think that those options are out there and available to us. So we set out there with a, as I mentioned, a slightly overfunded position. And we'll have to look at other ways that we want to de-risk that over time, but nothing on the docket today.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","We'll go to Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wanted to come back to Rick. The -- just following up on Finkelstein's question about the strong sort of core stat earnings. And if you run rate that, just considering, you're not -- top line's flattish overall, it would appear that, that would pave the way for a pretty strong capital return here, all things equal. And so, if we take the $50 million buyback in 4Q, I assume that was low just because you were dealing with the redom, et cetera. Can we assume a significant pickup in the pace of buybacks here just considering the stat earnings visibility?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, Tom. This is Rick. I don't know if I'd put that one for one in terms of that. But I think, I'd reiterate what both you and Mark have said is that stat run rate is higher to the tune of almost $100 million faster than we thought it would be going into that. So that gives us a lot of flexibility to do different things. Once we have that, we have choices to make around how we redeploy that capital. Share repurchase has been one of the bigger ones that we've used over the last several years. I think, you're right in saying the $50 million in the fourth quarter had a couple of factors that weighed into it. One, we are going through a lot of restructuring with UPIL, et cetera. And so, the second piece, I put into that is we're also dealing with the share price that was a lot higher. As you look at this quarter and where we are, our share price has come down as the market has. Our capital generation has been good. And I think that we feel well situated for a share repurchase as part of our overall capital deployment this year, which puts us back in the $300 million to $600 million range. But it's still early in the year, and we'll see how that plays out. But share repurchase will be part of our plans.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so no leaning toward low end, high end just in terms of what you know today?","Richard P. McKenney","I wouldn't give that to you yet, Tom. But it's only because we're just starting the year and we've been blocked out. And so, we'll start buying back stock when our windows open back up.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a related follow-up. Is another potential use -- and I think, you've already commented on long-term care and that kind of is what it is. But the other thing I've been looking into is just IDI and whether or not that might be another use, just considering I think that's just more of an interest rate issue as opposed to any claims issue. But is that particularly, I think, it's Northwind, which is the larger Closed Block of IDI. Is that a potential use or need for capital if you look out over the next year or 2?","Thomas R. Watjen","Yes, Tom. On the IDI block, the Closed Block, I would say to take you back, we haven't really talked as much about it lately because as we structured that block and as we've seen how that's return over the last 7 years since we went into the Northwind structure, it's actually done quite well through a pretty rough period of time. It still continues to look that way, so I don't foresee anything that will cause us to put capital into that. One of the things you might be looking at is in the fourth quarter, we had some miscellaneous income that came in that area. As opposed to letting that flow through, we actually increased reserves for a similar amount, but that's a onetime thing. When you look at interest rates specifically, what we've got in that block is, primarily the cash flows that are coming off of our portfolio are paying claims. So there really isn't any interest rate risk. It's a very well-managed book. You might get the stray item that happens around miscellaneous income. But by no means does that denote that we wouldn't have a capital -- capital call as a result of that.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, you guys don't disclose it anymore on legal entity basis, you give a consolidated statutory numbers. But previously, you had showed Northwind legal entity results in that last quarter, I believe, had lost money. Can you comment on what that did this quarter, whether it's breakeven, lost money, quantum of either?","Richard P. McKenney","I can -- actually can't comment on that. I'd tell you it has been volatile. But there is nothing in the results, and I don't have it in front of me. But I think, there's nothing in our results this quarter, which has been or anything that I see challenging within the IDI Closed Block.","Thomas R. Watjen","If you step back actually look at Northwind over longer time horizon. I mean, we are what, we paid off roughly half of the outstanding debt associated with Northwind. The cash flows from that block have actually, when you look at it over that period of time, have come in remarkably close to what those expectations were. So again, I just ask us to step back from time to time and look that over that period of time. Its actually, that transactions performed pretty much in line with what we expected.","Richard P. McKenney","And we can see volatility quarter-to-quarter. But I think, the bigger things is that over the long term, it's performing as expected.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And again, just to reiterate, that's not a business or not a legal entity that you would expect to be a call on capital over the next few years?","Richard P. McKenney","That's correct. And actually, Tom pulled it up. It actually made $10 million this quarter. So you're going to see a little bit of volatility around that, but I think it's fine.","Operator","We'll go to Ryan Krueger of Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I just have a quick one. When we look at the Closed Block segment, the $2.7 billion of GAAP allocated equity, how much of that is long-term care versus IDI at this point?","Thomas R. Watjen","Tom?","Thomas White","Ryan, this is Tom White. Roughly, of the $2.7 billion, round numbers, is about $1.3 billion for the closed disability block, $1.3 billion for long-term care, and the rest is a collection of other smaller runoff businesses.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay, great. And on the long-term care piece specifically, as the block ages and reserves increase over time as a result, should we expect the allocated equity to grow? Or how should we look at that?","Thomas R. Watjen","Jack?","John F. McGarry","Yes. I mean, I would expect as reserves grow, the allocated equities are going to grow. So it will mature. It should be funded out of the premiums that the reserve piece. So there is a little bit of a bubble yet to come.","Thomas R. Watjen","I think going on the overall block I think, is as that's happening, the disability block as it continues to shrink down, the shrinking and there's capital being released as a result of that. I think you should said, Jack, when you take the 2 together at least for a couple years, it's probably more of an increase as a block. But we're getting to that point, where actually it starts to then flatten out at that point.","Operator","We'll go next to John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So just wanted to come back to this idea of statutory earnings being in the slightly elevated pace, and maybe get at it a little bit more differently. Fourth quarter, I think, we've seen from just about every group insurance type company so far that results on the underwriting side have been pretty favorable. On an overall basis, especially if you just sort of strip out the Closed Block and look at your ongoing businesses, on an overall basis, was fourth quarter for Unum better than a seasonal typical seasonal good result?","Richard P. McKenney","John, this is Rick. If you think about this quarter, we actually had a good fourth quarter last year. And we can have good fourth quarters, so I don't know if I'd take that. I look at it more from a full year basis was actually quite strong. And we saw a little bit of the seasonality improvement in fourth quarter. We did last year as well, but I'm focused more on the full year type numbers.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. So on a full year basis again, just to clarify, so maybe a little bit to the good on the underwriting side on a full year basis","Richard P. McKenney","I think that's right. I think, we have been saying consistently all year long, we are seeing good underwriting results across all of our businesses.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just wanted to think about this. Obviously, you pointed out lower miscellaneous investment income in the disability line in the U.S. On an overall company sort of consolidated investment income basis, was miscellaneous income or maybe net investment income overall, was it low, in line, maybe slightly above? Can you characterize that?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, I think, it was actually right in line, John. I think that it actually reported a little bit higher, but we mentioned the Closed Block and how some of that went straight to reserve. So if you net that out, we're kind of tracking right in line with what we usually get on average.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Perfect and then, last one for you is just. Obviously, so much to learn over the next whatever, the next intermediate term around health care exchanges, how the market shifts a little bit. I'm interested, you guys obviously have a great brand in the sort of broker space. Is there -- are you seeing any reason to invest in branding more from a retail perspective as you look at the opportunity and getting closer to the individual employee?","Thomas R. Watjen","Actually, John, let me ask both Mike and Randy to speak to that. But I think as you heard us talk even on call this morning, one of the things that we've began in a quite some time ago was really much, much better understanding of the consumer -- what drives consumer behaviors and things like that. And from which, then we can make informed decisions but I think about what you just said. And maybe Mike, just talk a little bit how that's relating to Unum US? And as I said Randy, just talk a little bit how that's relating to our Colonial Life operation?","Michael Q. Simonds","Sure, I like to say that a lots of play out, where we sit today, we look at it and say we see the employer very much involved and their advisers. So I think, you rightly call out the Unum an Colonial Life brand is strong with the distribution. Also strong with employers and professional benefits decision-makers, so that remains a strategic advantage for us. And then if we stack up investments that we can make, certainly brand at a consumer level as an investment that we can make, but actually, we're prioritizing investments in product and capability over that. So as we sort of think about was the next dollar and where is it going to go and where is the best return, we feel quite strongly that having better technology, better education and better product, which is where we are making the majority of investments is still the best ROI for us.","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, would you like to add anything to that, Randy?","Randall C. Horn","Yes, Tom. I just I'd emphasize what Mike said about the employers still being in the driver's seat. So our promotional and advertising efforts are going to stay focused at that employer decision-maker. But that being said, there is going to be more branding type emphasis at the consumer level as time goes forward. We're in the process of kind of refreshing our brand here at Colonial life at the present time. And we'll be emphasizing that more strongly in the marketplace going forward.","Thomas R. Watjen","I think, with this point, we have time I think, Tom, for one more question.","Operator","We'll go to Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Question on the holdco liquidity. I think that last year going into 2013, the target was 1x to 2x interest and dividends. And it seems like the $500 million target for this year comes in or below the top end of that range. So curious as to what drove that lower.","Thomas R. Watjen","When we look at the holdco liquidity of $514 million, where we ended the year, we actually were in the $500 million to $800 million range. So we're actually within the range as we look at it going into last year. A couple of things to think about with holdco liquidity. One is, we talked in the past about 1x to 2x coverage, and that includes all cash uses, dividends as well as interest payments. And as we look at it now, one of the things that we did last year, which was we put on a credit facility as well for $400 million. so we have significant amounts of liquidity, that which sits in cash and that which is untapped in our credit facilities as well. So I think that probably is fine to drift down below that 2x, although, we can of look at that as part of our overall sources in terms of when we think about capital deployment. So you'll see that fluctuate. And I think the plan we put out there for next year would actually be in a similar range of that $500 million to $800 million.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then is there some sort of rule of thumb you could offer as to how to think of possible margin impact of decreasing retention rates and maybe higher sales?","Thomas R. Watjen","Not quickly.","Richard P. McKenney","Not quickly, yes.","Thomas R. Watjen","It's a broad question.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. I mean, we obviously, throughout all our businesses, participation rates and voluntary plans, Mike, I think around here is incredibly important. So we look at it very carefully, but I'm sure sure if there is a good rule of thumb actually on that.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, I think in general, we look at, if the question is persistency versus new sales trade-up, what we'd say is that -- on persistency, where we've seen a point or two deterioration of the margins of that are significantly below the block, so it actually has, not a dampening, but an actually increase in the profitability of that block of business. And in terms of the new business coming on, we're pretty disciplined about the levels that we bring it on. So I wouldn't anticipate material changes in margin based on the mix between those 2 factors at least in group insurance for our business.","Thomas R. Watjen","And I would just add to, I think, we spend an awful lot of time on persistency. Because obviously part of the challenge is to obtain a new customer. But actually frankly, most importantly is keeping the right customers. And so, when Mike talked and Randy talked about the investments we've made in sales and services and infrastructures and people and training and things like that -- which by the way, we've been through some significant amounts with both of those organizations already this year. A big reason to do so is because is not just getting the sale, but actually the more we can keep business, that's incredibly important part of our ability to generate margins and consistency of our financial performance going forward. So that's very prominent, but there's just no rule of thumb unfortunately, I am afraid, that we can share.","Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. And we look forward to seeing many of you at our various upcoming investor conferences and events over the next several weeks. And this will complete our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas White","Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the first quarter 2014 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the SEC and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.

And now I'll turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?","Thomas R. Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter, and I think they were off to a strong start to the year. Operating earnings per share, which excludes realized investment gains and losses, as well as certain pension costs, increased 8.8% to $0.87 per share, which is consistent with our 2014 outlook for operating earnings per share growth of 5% to 10%. Our growth rate this quarter was more balanced than it's been in a while, with our after-tax operating earnings increasing 4.7%, the highest rate of growth since 2011.","Once again, we have been able to augment our operating performance through capital management actions, which I'll touch on in a moment. Importantly, too, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, which I continue to believe is a strong measure of enterprise value, increased 9.2% year-over-year to $33.01.","Now let me touch on a few specific highlights before turning things over to Rick. First, we continue to generate strong consistent operating results within our ongoing businesses with all 3, Unum US, Colonial Life and Unum UK generating higher year-over-year operating earnings. Unum US results continue to be driven by favorable risk results, reflecting our focus on disciplined underwriting, pricing and risk selection. Colonial Life delivered a very strong quarter with favorable risk result and strong premium growth. And finally, Unum UK continued to show solid year-over-year margin improvement, driven in large part by our actions to improve profitability in our group life line of business. Overall, our core ongoing business segments are generating consistent, solid margins with an operating return on equity of 14.8% for the quarter, which is towards the upper end of the outlook we provided for 2014.","Secondly, the results of our Closed Block were again within our expectations this quarter. The loss ratio in the long-term care line improved relative to recent trends, continuing in -- at the lower end of the range of our expectations. This still remains a challenging business, but I am very encouraged by the actions that our team is taking to manage these blocks of business.","Third, we continue to speak stronger sales growth in both of our U.S. operations this quarter and good growth in the Unum UK in our flagship group disability product line. In Unum US, total sales increased by 7.2%, with particularly strong results in our small and midsized employer markets, which are employers with under 2,000 lives, where group benefit sales grew by 16.5% over last year and our voluntary sales grew by 9%. We also, again, saw strong sales results in our Colonial Life operation. We're driven by strength in our commercial market business. Total sales increased 6.5% in the first quarter.","Lastly, while our Unum UK sales were generally flat in local currency this quarter, group disability sales increased 6% in the quarter. Group life sales comparisons will remain challenging, as we continue to take aggressive pricing actions in a very competitive market.","Moving next to investments. While the credit quality of the investment portfolio remains in very good shape, we continue to be challenged by today's low interest rates and tight corporate bond spreads. Frankly, these pressures increase in the first quarter and pose challenges for us and our industry. We are, however, maintaining our investment quality standards and are continuing to adjust prices in those products that are most interest rate sensitive. We are hesitant to invest fully in this environment; and as a result, we hold higher-than-normal cash balances, which is having a negative impact on our net investment income. You saw that in our Unum US and Closed Block segments this quarter.","And finally, our capital position remains quite strong and continues to provide us with significant financial flexibility. Our risk-based capital position was approximately 400% in the first quarter, and our holding company liquidity position stood at $822 million, which includes the proceeds from our recently completed debt offering. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the quarter, and that's now 15 of the last 16 quarters that we have repurchased shares, totaling approximately $1.9 billion over this period.","As you know, dividend actions are also an important part of our capital management strategy and has been the practice in the past. Our Board of Directors will review our dividend policy at the upcoming May meeting. I expect you'll see another increase at that time. Over the past 5 years, we have increased our dividend by 93% or about 14% per year.","So in summary, the first quarter was a good solid start to the year. I'm encouraged by our stronger level of operating earnings growth, which, combined with our share repurchase activities, resulted in strong per-share growth in operating earnings and book value. Additionally, the combination of strong persistency and good sales growth has allowed us to generate modest but profitable top line growth.","Lastly, our capital position remains very healthy, giving us the ability to invest in our business and markets while also returning capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividend increases.","Now I'll turn things over to Rick for a review of our operating results. Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Thank you, Tom. Our first quarter results were solid, as we reported operating earnings per share of $0.87, up almost 9% from last year. We saw good underlying growth in our after-tax operating earnings, which accounted for roughly half of that growth with the balance coming through our ongoing capital management. We will continue to focus on driving growth in operating earnings, and our first quarter performance was the best quarter we've seen in the past 2 years.","Looking first at Unum US, operating earnings increased 1.3% year-over-year, driven by favorable experience in the group life and AD&D line and the supplemental and voluntary lines. Group life and AD&D produced another strong quarter with $59.8 million in operating income, up 3.3% on stable risk experience and premium growth of just over 2%.","Our supplemental and voluntary line reported operating income of $82.5 million for the first quarter, up 14% from a year-ago quarter, as our voluntary benefits experience stabilized from the higher lapses we saw in the year-ago quarter.","Operating income in our group disability business declined to $68.5 million from $77.9 million a year ago, driven primarily by lower levels of miscellaneous net investment income and some pressure on net investment income from holding higher-than-normal cash balances in the quarter. I'd also remind you that we recorded a $4 million gain on debt ex [ph] last year's first quarter.","Importantly, risk results in group disability remained quite strong, with a benefit ratio declining to 83% this quarter from 84.3% a year ago, as the underlying experience showed stable to lower overall claim incidence and continued favorable claim recovery performance, familiar themes for this line for the past several quarters.","Looking forward, we expect a slightly higher level of earnings from group disability, with some incremental improvements in the benefit ratio, offset by some ongoing pressure from net investment income, given the lower-rate environment. We expect our margins in this line to remain strong, consistent with what we've delivered over the past several quarters. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the Unum US segment as return on equity was 13.4%.","Moving to Unum UK. Operating earnings were GBP 22 million for the first quarter, 9% higher than the first quarter of 2013 and generally consistent with our fourth quarter earnings. We continue to make good progress in improving the profitability of our U.K. business, particularly with the repricing and repositioning of the group life business.","The operating ROE for the U.K. has improved to about 18% for the quarter. In the first quarter, the Unum UK benefit ratio was 70.1%, which is slightly higher than a year ago but down from the fourth quarter. We continue to see improved performance in our group life line of business, while risk experience was a little bit weaker in our group disability line, reflecting higher claim incidence. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress Peter and his team have made in the U.K.","Colonial Life generated a very strong quarter at $79.4 million compared to $75.4 million a year ago, one of the strongest quarters in its history. We saw favorable risk experience across all of its business lines, producing a benefit ratio of 50.5% compared to 52.5% a year ago. The underlying profitability of this business continues to be excellent with an operating ROE of 18% for the quarter.","Rounding out the enterprise, the Closed Block also had a strong first quarter, with operating income of $29.1 million at the high end of our range of expectations for this segment. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the LTC line improved relative to our recent experience at 84.7%, primarily reflecting an improvement in claim incidence. We generally expect the LTC interest-adjusted benefit ratio to be in the range of 85% to 90%, so this quarter's experience was slightly under that. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio for the Closed Disability Block was consistent with a year ago at 81.5%.","Looking at our sales and growth trends across the company, the positive sales momentum that emerged in the second half of 2013, following the slower half of last year, continued to build in the first quarter. And we're quite pleased with the sales results in our operations.","In Unum US, total sales increased by 7.2% in the quarter, with solid contributions across our various product lines and market segments. Within our group benefits lines, LTD, STD and group life, total sales increased by 12.1%, with a 16.5% growth in the core market and 5% in the large-case market. Additionally, our voluntary benefit sales increased by about 5%, with particularly good results in the core market segment where we were up 9%.","We continue to be encouraged as we look to the second quarter. And in addition to good sales, persistency for our Unum US employee benefits line ticked up to 89% for the quarter compared to just under 88% for the full year 2013. So bringing it all together, overall premium growth for Unum US was up 1.1% for the quarter, well within our outlook range of 0 to 2% for the full year.","In the U.K., sales were down slightly at GBP 10.4 million for the quarter. We produced growth in the disability line of 5.7%, but the overall decline was driven by our group life line of business where we continue to be careful on pricing.","Persistency in the U.K. improved over last year. However, persistency in the group life line continues to reflect the pricing actions we are continuing to implement. Premium income was also lower than last year's first quarter due to lapses resulting from our repricing of the life block.","Finally, at Colonial Life, we saw a very good sales for the quarter, an increase of 6.5% with positive contributions from both new accounts and existing accounts. We also saw a very strong trends with re-enrollments in some of our larger account cases. Persistency was slightly lower relative to the first quarter of 2013, but premium income increased by 3%, which is consistent with our expectation of 2% to 4% for Colonial Life. Overall, we're quite pleased with the growth trend lines that we see in the company.","Now moving to the investment portfolio. The credit quality of our portfolio remains in excellent shape, and the launch list of potential problems continues to be quite low. The decline in interest rates and the spread compression made for a challenging investment environment again in the first quarter. We saw A 10-year bond dropped by 36 basis points. At times like this, we will sometimes hold cash balances for our product portfolios at higher-than-normal levels, as we look for better opportunities to put the money to work. The net effect is some near-term pressure on investment income relative to our expectations, and we felt that across a number of our business lines. This would be similar to what we have seen a year ago, and our team will continue to remain disciplined in good asset selection.","Moving to an update on capital management. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance companies was approximately 400%, and our holding company cash and marketable securities was $822 million at quarter end. Our statutory operating earnings of $130 million continues to be within our range of expectations, though it was on the lower side of what we have been experiencing. Statutory results can tend to be a little bit more volatile.","During the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate, tight corporate bond spread environment and did issue $350 million of 10-year notes at a 4% coupon. We are in the process of redeeming roughly half of the debt we have maturing in 2015. Total amount maturing next year is 279 -- $297 million at a 6.85% coupon. As a result, for the second quarter, we will be reporting debt extinguishment costs and a currency hedge gain related to the debt, and those numbers will net close to 0.","We continue to buy back our shares with some of the capital we're generating, and the first quarter was a more active quarter for share purchases relative to the end of last year. Share buybacks totaled $100 million and keeps us on track for our $300 million to $600 million range for the full year. I would also affirm that our 2014 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share remains in the range of 5% to 10%. In fact, most of the first quarter trends we experienced were in line with our 2014 outlook for sales, premium growth and our ROE expectations; and I would say it was a good start to the year.","Now I'll turn it back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas R. Watjen","Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by Rick reiterating how pleased we are with our start to 2014. Our focus remains on continuing to profitably grow our business through disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, along with a clear need to maintain sound risk management in managing our investments and capital. We expect to continue to generate capital; and as we have done in the past, balance the deployment of that capital with the needs of the business, opportunities we see in the marketplace and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend actions. This will complete our prepared remarks. And operator, let's move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just for Rick first, just to start off with long-term care, can you just give us an update in terms of how you're thinking about the guidance you've given us in the past around a potential reserve build? Obviously, there have been a number of moving pieces, UPILs come onshore, underwriting score was a little bit better, but interest rates are a little bit lower. So if we kind of put it all in the mix, how are you thinking about that original guidance that you gave us?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. Suneet, let me take you back actually a couple of years, and I don't think it's changed dramatically. As we look at our long-term care assumptions, these are long-term assumptions, we will see those change over as we look through time. If I were to highlight a couple of things that we continue to look at is one of the underlying experience that we see, you would've seen we actually had a good first quarter. That is one data point, but it -- it's certainly good to see that as we've seen volatility in the line. As you mentioned, the -- on the interest rate side, we are in a difficult investing environment. But as we come up of the year end, I would say that it's not dramatically different than what we've seen here over the last several years. And as we look out to the range, it's something that we have to evaluate as part of the overall mix in terms of our ability to invest those cash flows that we'll receive as part of the long-term care and the management of that. I think the big thing that we continue to work hard on, and Jack continues to work with his team, is on the pricing front. And maybe I'll turn it over to Jack to talk about the progress we're making on that front. Jack?","John F. McGarry","Thanks, Rick. We're really pleased with where -- the progress we're making on rate increases. We've exceeded what was built into the initial gross premium valuation reserve for rate increases. So far, we're continuing to file for additional rate increases. We're continuing to seek good success in getting additional approvals. And actually, I think the environment for rate increases has continued to improve somewhat within the state regulatory environment.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Any sense in terms of order of magnitude of how much better you're doing on the price increases versus what you thought?","John F. McGarry","I mean, it's in the 5% to 10% range.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then I guess for Rick, just to follow up on this, as we think about still that potential reserve build hanging out there at some point, is it fair to say that, given the capital contribution you made when you brought UPIL onshore on a statutory basis, that you've kind of handled what we might have otherwise seen as a statutory reserve build at the time that you take potential GAAP charge? Is that the right way to think about it?","Richard P. McKenney","Certainly, when you look to last year and the work that we did about bringing our UPIL business back onshore, as part of that restructuring, actually, statutory reserves were increased. So we've talked in the past about stat to GAAP differentials and how those were close to each other as we went back a couple of years, and our stat reserves have increased as part of that process. So there is some room there between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves, as we look out to the future.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And just a final question on this topic, so if there's a GAAP event that happens at some point, '15, '16, whenever it is, we should -- should we think about that as sort of a noncash sort of event since, perhaps, it might not be a statutory impact and thus potentially no impact on your capital management targets?","Richard P. McKenney","Well, I think I'd just repeat what I just told you that there is a differential between those 2 to project out that far in how things would play out. I don't think it's something that we want to do today. But I think the actions that we took at last year end to bring that back onshore were good proactive strong actions, and we'll continue to manage the block that way. And it's hard to isolate any one thing.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple more general, sales were very strong, and surprising -- I was wondering if you could put that in the context of maybe new accounts, new clients versus payroll.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. Mike, do you want to get started with the Unum US business? And then maybe, Randy, ask you to speak as well actually on that.","Michael Q. Simonds","Sure, thanks. Yes, we've seen a good rebound, and I think Rick alluded to it earlier, but we saw health care reform and ACA implementations slow things down a year ago. So the first half, it was slow as employers and their advisors were sorting through the changes. We saw proposal activity down really across our market segment and sales declines in the third quarter. That started to abate a bit. We saw a little bit of growth in the fourth quarter. And so I'd see first quarter result as the next step on that continuum being up about 7%. Encouraging for us, we continue to see strong growth out of existing clients. So over 60% of our new sales, from a Unum perspective, came from those existing relationships. That's very important to us because we know those sales actually drive greater stickiness. It's a contributing factor to why I think persistency continues to tick up a bit. It also comes in favorably priced and with a slightly lower acquisition cost. So existing clients remain a really key growth opportunity for us. I would say, and maybe I'll turn it over to Randy with this, while in the mid and larger ends of the markets, we're seeing that increase in proposal activity continue at then a very small end of the market, say, under 50 life employers. There's still a fair degree of sorting out going on the health insurance side, so it's still a little bit sticky there.","Thomas R. Watjen","And Randy, before you chime in, I just -- maybe Mike, I think it's worth saying, too, that the growth you saw in the first quarter really did not come from natural growth. We weren't seeing an emergence of that as a contributor to growth per se yet.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes. We think about -- when we think about the earned premium lines, Tom, that's right. We're seeing basically a flat level of natural growth. So the growth we see in premium from new employees being added or rate increases driving premium increases, it's really -- our growth is coming from new lines of coverage sold, new clients coming in and plan design changes and the like.","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, do you want to add to that?","Randall C. Horn","Yes. You bet, Tom. Yes, we saw good sales growth for both new accounts and existing accounts. As Mike said, there's still some ongoing pressure in that real small end of the market, under 50 employees. But -- so -- our number of new accounts was down a little bit in that segment. So on average, we were just writing larger cases. We are seeing good momentum, though, building. Things were kind of loosening up in that smaller end of the market, so we're optimistic with the trend lines we're seeing at the current time. But again, good solid numbers for both new accounts and existing accounts.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Randy, same for you, not really employment growth, but just offering more products to existing accounts?","Randall C. Horn","Yes, it's offering more products but just knocking on more doors, Steven, just getting them in. Our new rep count was up nicely in the first quarter. They're the ones writing a lot of the smaller new accounts, and we're seeing very good productivity from new reps so far here in 2014.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. One more, Randy, for you, if I may. There was a -- there was an -- I think it was the Wall Street Journal, things are beginning to blur, but I think it was Wall Street Journal. There was an article with regards to changing definitions of cancer and maybe changing treatment. I don't know if you saw that or not. But if the definition of cancer was changed, would that affect your business?","Randall C. Horn","I did not see that specific article, Steven. But no, I don't think that would have a direct impact on us in terms of changing the definitions. I mean, I'd have to see specifically what you're talking about. But again, we sell purely indemnity products that lay out very specifically what we'll pay for certain types of treatments and diagnoses. I guess, if there was some broad-based change in the definition of what cancer is, it could have some impact on us. But I don't think it would be all that immediate. And of course, we'd have the opportunity to go in and change our product designs and our definitions, if that did take place.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the Colonial Life segment, the benefit ratio is under 52% for the first time in a while. Just wanted to get a sense of whether you feel that level of improvement, which is sort of at the low end of your range, is sustainable.","Thomas R. Watjen","Randy, do you want to pick up on that?","Randall C. Horn","You bet. Yes, it was definitely in the lower end of our range. We had great results in all of our major product segments, very good mortality in the quarters, so everything just lined up very nicely for us. So that is lower than what we would anticipate for the balance of the year. Now our outlook is for stable benefit ratios. We feel really good about kind of that 51% to 53% range, so again, look for good stability there. But everything just lined up well for us in the first quarter, so a little bit on the low side there.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Randy, as growth improves in Colonial Life, that will probably be a positive factor in the benefit ratio going forward, right?","Randall C. Horn","Absolutely, because you have better benefit ratios in that -- in those early durations of almost every product.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears to private exchanges, any update you can provide there in terms of the growth opportunity or product expansion potential, that would be helpful.","Thomas R. Watjen","Sure. Why don't you, Mike, sort of pick that one up? And I think, Randy, you can add a little to it as well. But Mike?","Michael Q. Simonds","Sure. Thanks, Tom. Certainly, activity and interest in exchanges continue to increase out there, but actual volumes of premium coming through on private exchanges is, it's pretty minimal to date. And really, we think about it regardless of the pace with the absolute level of adoption amongst employers. We're pretty well positioned, both Unum and the Colonial Life businesses. Being category leaders in each of these products is important, as intermediaries and technology firms create exchanges. They're coming to us. Our leadership in voluntary benefits has positioned us well and that we got over 40 connects into this technology companies, previously focused on benefit administration, now focused on private exchanges. So while it's early days, and I suspect it's going to play out, not over months or quarters, but over the next few years. We feel like we're well positioned. And I think the last comment I'd make before turning to Randy, in all of the exchanges in which we're participating, and in fact, in all that we've encountered in the market, for our lines of business, the carrier is selected by the employer. So I think, at times, there's a little bit of confusion out there as to whether individual employees are going to be choosing amongst different carriers for life insurance. But in fact, to get good spread of risk in the most efficient delivery, each of these exchanges is looking for the employer to select the carrier first. So our strong brand reputation with employers and with their advisors has played in the market traditionally and will play in these exchanges going forward. How about, Randy, if you have anything to add there.","Randall C. Horn","Yes. I guess, maybe Mike, the only thing I would add is in addition to the employer continuing to be involved in making account-specific decisions, the exchanges we're involved with today for a VB line of business, we would be the only carrier involved on that specific employer account for that selected VB line of coverage. So we're not -- it is -- it's not an open marketplace kind of situation where an employee would be selecting amongst several different VB carriers. We're also very focused on continuing to have our agency system involved, our benefit counselors involved on those accounts. So again, we are involved in a number of exchanges today. We're evaluating several others. Not seeing a lot of sales generally in the industry coming through private exchanges today, but we feel like we are very well positioned going forward, if that, in fact, does happen.","Operator","We'll go next to Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So we've been focusing on the sales in the U.S. for the first half of the Q&A. I want to switch gears maybe to the U.K. And I noticed that the large case market saw some improvement in sales after some pressure last year. I think that's also the market where the unit came into a little bit of a pressure in terms of underwriting results a couple of years ago. So maybe you could give us a little more color as to what's driving the sales growth there and what's different this time as opposed to kind of the 2010 there?","Thomas R. Watjen","Peter, do you want to respond to that question?","Peter G. O'donnell","Yes. Great. Thanks very much for that. It's very different, I think. So as you know, we've seen sort of undertaking a renewal program across our book. What we are seeing is, in the group life area, where I think we were very competitive a few years ago in the group life market, that's where the life large cases where written around 2010. If you look at what we've written in group life, we're being very selective. We still see that market as very competitive. We wrote very little large schemes in the group life market. And it's a challenging market, we think, to make money in. Some of our competitors are writing cases there. But I'm taking some of our business, actually, on our persistency is a bit lower as well in that large case. So we're being selective in where we write that business and maintaining our discipline. Where we have seen success, though, is in our LTD market. We can compete very effectively with other carriers in that space. Our claims proposition is, in our view and in the brokers' view, more value for money in terms of what we do for the customers. And we can charge a bit of a premium for that claim service over and above the competition. And actually, our premium tends to be around 10% of the large end where the claim service works. And we've been successful in writing a number of large schemes in the first quarter versus the competition. And we've also been successful in bringing some new schemes to market in that space, where, particularly, the banks are looking at what the benefits are and offer. And now the economy recovers a little bit in the U.K., they're willing to invest a bit more in their employee base.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. So it's mostly our financial institution banks granted?","Peter G. O'donnell","That's right. Yes.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one more question, if I may. On the Closed Block, I saw that the individual disability premiums declined by quite a bit. And I was hoping maybe to get a little more color as to what was driving that decline.","Thomas R. Watjen","Jack, do you want to take that one?","John F. McGarry","Yes. I mean, the decline is just a natural runoff of the book. That block has been closed for a long time, since the mid '90s. Those people are aging. Most people do not extend their coverage beyond age 65. So it's kind of like the baby boom retiring, if you will. So it's just naturally running off the books.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that move, kind of maybe mid single-digit decline to low-teens, should be -- we should think of that maybe as the new run rate?","John F. McGarry","I mean, I think as the block ages, it's going to -- the decline is going to accelerate. So, yes, I would think that would be the -- I don't know whether this quarter is specifically the new run rate, but you should think about the run rate accelerating as the block ages.","Richard P. McKenney","But more in the mid single digits than the double digits.","Operator","We'll go next to Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question on expenses. Expenses have picked up across a number of segments the past few quarters. So I was just hoping you could talk about what's driving this and whether we should view it, your recent expenses, as a reasonable run rate going forward or if there's some one-off investments in there.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, sure, Erik. This is Rick. When you look at our expense base overall, as you would have seen over many years, we manage it very tightly. We think about it from an expense ratio, so relative to premiums, and manage that as well. Relative to last year, you would have seen a tick-up. But I would tell you it's basically we're right on our plans for this year. Included in those plans, include some investments that we continue to make in the company around technology, around brand and different things like that, but it's very much in line with our expectations overall. So I think what you saw this quarter is about a run rate that you should expect for the remainder of the year.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then on long-term care, just curious, we saw the first noticeable reinsurance transaction this quarter with CNOs, Closed Block deal, but they didn't. I realize there are a number of significant differences between your block and theirs, but I'm curious whether you view this as a one-off transaction or does it suggest that a third-party market for long-term care risk might be beginning to emerge?","Richard P. McKenney","Good. Good question. This is Rick again, Erik. When you think about that, and we've talked about that previously in terms of what will happen, we think, in this market over time, as more data evolves in long-term care space, I think there will be more opportunities for other people to take on that risk at certain prices. This transaction you saw there might be one of those that actually bodes, that's out there in the horizon. I think you also look at a very robust reinsurance market for other blocks of business that you've seen out there. So those are all good things. What I wouldn't do is read across to our business that there'll be something of a large nature that's coming across our block anytime soon. But those are all good indicators that the market is getting better. But as part of the transition we would expect to see in this market, as data grows, as more information grows, as capital becomes available to it, it will be something we look at. And that points you back a number of years to what we did with our Northwind transaction, that it went through the same cycle around the individual disability space. And we hope to see that in the long-term care space as well. So good things but don't read across that there's something imminent on the horizon for us.","Operator","We'll go next to Christopher Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question on the U.K. So it seems results are sort of tracking back in line with your expectations, with earnings clearly stabilizing, the sales and the life piece falling as you work through kind of that repricing process. And I think you're going to be through kind of the repricing of that book by the end of the year. So just wondering how you're thinking about the reinsurance agreement that you have in place when that's up for renewal and if you have an estimate for how much earnings you're kind of giving up with that -- with the reinsurance contract.","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, why don't you start on that one, and then Peter can pick up a little color on it.","Richard P. McKenney","I think the way you characterized it, Chris, is right, that as we went through that reinsurance transaction, we're going through a major restructuring of the block, including the reinsurance, including pricing and what we're doing in the market. And actually, this year-end, we recaptured some of that business. So I shouldn't say recapture. We renewed reinsurance, but we didn't have the same amount that we reinsured out. We have retention levels higher of around 70%, 75% of the block. At the same time, on the reinsurance front, we did keep in place a volatility cover. So we actually, per life, we retain less. We think that's good volatility management for that block of business. And in both cases, we've been very happy with the pricing. And once again, this is a structure which goes out 1 year. So we have a lot of flexibility as we get towards the end of this year to figure out what type of retention we want to continue to hold on that block. But I put all that in the context of we're very happy with how the returns have changed and improved for our U.K. life business, and we think of reinsurance there as a tool to help us manage the return to good profitability that we've experienced in the past.","Thomas R. Watjen","Peter, do you want to add a little bit, too, just in terms of where we are in the repricing actions and just maybe some of the market dynamics?","Peter G. O'donnell","Yes. Thanks, Tom. So in terms of what are the repricing actions, yes, in terms of the -- we're about 75%, 80% through. So I guess in U.S. terms, we're in the seventh innings. We've probably got eighth or ninth innings. So I expect to be done by sort of the end of the third quarter on the repricing. As Rick said, what we've seen is we're very happy with the business we're retaining. We're seeing those results come through. You can see that in this quarter's results, very evidently in the sort of group life product stream and the return on equity. And as we've reached the sort of third quarter, we'll take another look at the reinsurance. I suspect the per life looks like a good thing to do, and then we'll look at the retention level, depending on how it's performing. But it's certainly working for us today.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then a follow-up on LTC for Jack. So the repricing comments were helpful. Wondering if you could talk about conversations you're having in the marketplace. It seems like there's sort of increased focus from the NAIC around the repricing process and if minimum loss ratios should maybe be met before submitting price increases. So, really, just wondering how you're thinking and handling these dialogues. And if the type of loss ratios that have been proposed are adopted, any estimate for what portion of your book are already above those minimums and would be eligible for repricing?","John F. McGarry","Yes, we've been actually very active in dialogues with the NAIC and regulators. I've gone out personally, visited Scott Kipper, who runs the Senior Issues Task Force of the NAIC. I've been out to see him twice. The loss ratio that's being vented about are logically, prospectively on new business written. They don't necessarily apply to enforce blocks and particularly close blocks. But even with that said, the loss ratios are at a level that they wouldn't impact our ability to pursue rate increases.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one quick one for Mike or Tom. You've talked about kind of expanding partnerships as sort of the benefit marketplace evolves, and you've done a number of things with health care. Just wondering if there's anything else in the pipeline that we should have on our radar.","Thomas R. Watjen","Chris, it's a great call. And Mike maybe talked about that because there is a lot going on that we probably can't get too specific. But we're in some interesting general dialogue.","Michael Q. Simonds","Thanks. Great question, Chris. And I'd say the macro trend, as you are seeing health plans, continued to get less bridge and gaps get created, and that creates real opportunities for us, broad-based. And then finding new and interesting ways to get after those opportunities continue to surface. You mentioned the UHC partnership. That's been a very good partnership. We're about 3 years in. It's been a differentiator for us in that large part of the marketplace to have the world's biggest managed care company and the world's leading disability company working together. And we actually have a pretty healthy pipeline of other partnerships coming that attack actually different segments as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Thomas Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wanted to come back to long-term care. So first on the rate increases you're getting. Can you comment on whether or not you see a big enough benefit to offset the previous comments you've made and the previous disclosures you've had about potential charges, I think, mainly related to discount rates. So can you -- is there any way to quantify that? Is that a positive enough new development that there's a chance that, that could fully offset the potential need to strengthen GAAP reserves? That's my first question.","Richard P. McKenney","Yes. Rick. Yes, let me take that again. And, Tom, maybe I'll recharacterize some of the things I'd say, which is just to say there are -- kind of if you think about it, 3 big moving parts, and they're constantly changing. One of them is going to be the experience in the block. And if you think about what we saw this quarter, that's good, but these are, once again, long-term views of how we see the experience in the block emerging. We've got the interest rate pressures. We've got to put these cash flows to work at certain levels, and we'll deal with that over a period of time. This quarter, a little bit tougher, but once again, these are our long-term views around how cash will get put to work over a very long period of time. And the third piece, as you say, is the price increases. And so that's a little bit better than we thought. And these pieces of how we see them, how we feel about them are constantly moving, are constantly reevaluating them. And as we look to establish the correct level of reserves to the block, we're going to continually reevaluate them. And it's hard to look at any one moment in time and say explicitly where they are. But like I said, we can only give you the best transparency, we give you the indicators that we see out there and how those are evolving over time. And that's what we'll continue to do with you quarter in and quarter out. And that's our best read that we have as we sit here in the first quarter.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, Rick, can you comment on the -- I believe the last time you all took a charge in 2011, there was a difference between stat and GAAP, and you equalized those 2. What is that difference today in the reserve levels?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure, Tom. Actually, it changed over time as they do, but I will give you a number, probably safely say it's north of $500 million and why it sits out there today. So that will be the differential today. It's a little bit north of that, and that will change over time. But there is some differential between our stat and our GAAP books today.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And what's the latest update on if there is a strengthening, what kind of timing? Is it still a few years away potentially? Or is there any way to get timing clarity around that?","Richard P. McKenney","I think I'd take you back, Tom, to what I just told you, which is there's a lot of pieces and they're moving constantly. It's hard to give you clarity around the timing. It's because those dynamics are constantly changing. So I probably would just leave it at that, that we'll continue to reevaluate it and continue to give you some views on that. But particular to the interest rate piece, I think that we go through ups and downs in the interest rate cycle. And the original guidance we gave you back in 2011 still is pretty reasonable in terms of how we look at it.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a comment about not fully investing right now. How should we think about that? I guess interest rates remain a bit low. Should we consider or should we expect you all to have that same strategy for the next few quarters if rates remain low? Is there going to be a point at which if it goes on long enough, that you'll start more fully investing?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure, Tom. When we think about investing, this is actually something we did exactly how it played out last year as well, where there wasn't a good selection of assets. And sometimes it's rates, sometimes it's actually supply. So there's a lot of reasons why we wouldn't put our money fully to work. The dynamics look similarly today. If you look at last year as an example, we've got it all to work by the end of the second quarter. So how's that going to play out in the course of this year? I can't really tell you today. But our team looks at it very carefully, and we are in constant conversation about when to put money to work and when to sit on it and wait for what we think will be a better environment. A lot of dynamics going to that conversation, as they are right now, but I can't give you much more than that as we look out to the second and third quarter.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Just my last question. Would you -- I know you had mentioned statutory earnings were a little bit lower this quarter. Is the full year expectation still roughly the same as it's been in terms of statutory? And was there anything in particular weighing on results in 1Q?","Richard P. McKenney","Tom, the statutory results in 1Q were a little bit lighter, but I'd put you within a range. Last year, if you went to first quarter, they were actually a lot better than we thought. So in stat, we will see more volatility, but that doesn't change our outlook in terms of where we think our stat results can come in. And importantly, it doesn't change our views around what our capital management programs look like. So although we see the volatility, we'll continue to watch it, but we don't read across anything to the full year yet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick ones. Most has been answered already. In the U.K., I was just -- I was interested in whether you could give us some sense for the order of magnitude, as you think about the pricing today on the group life side, cases that you're actually willing to write, relative to the pricing, say, perhaps 3 or 4 years ago when you sort of cited that you are maybe a little bit -- a bit overly competitive.","Thomas R. Watjen","Peter, do want to pick up on that one? Again, I think it's just -- it's a matter of just looking back, as John said, about just the pricing environment a couple years ago versus how you're sort of viewing it today and what -- where we're playing and where we're not playing.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm trying to get a sense. Is that 20% higher pricing or 100% higher pricing?","Peter G. O'donnell","It's in the 10% to 15% higher pricing, I would say. So -- whereas -- where you're writing pricing around about your cost of capital are slightly below even when you got pushed on competitive. We're now pushing for more of where we feel comfortable a good return on that business is. And so it's low-teen, double-digit increase, that kind of thing. I think the challenge -- what you've seen on the life book is -- so as you shrink the book, clearly, that gives you some -- a little bit of expense pressure. But we're more than happy that we're balancing that with a margin increase.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful.","Thomas R. Watjen","And, John, as you know, the group life business tends to be pretty price sensitive from a customer point of view, and you have far less ability to start differentiating your offering with service and claims processes and things like that. So those may seem like relatively small percentages, but they can swing business quite a bit.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I know. I understand, Tom. That's helpful, though. On the U.S. group disability side, we actually saw a couple of players in that market increase their discount rates this past quarter. I guess it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, given what we've seen on the rate side, on the interest rate side or yield side, but did you guys make any adjustments to discount rates? Or do you expect to make any?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure, John. Yes, when you look at our discount rates, it's something that we manage over a period of time. We did not make any adjustments this quarter. And we look at how we're investing money relative to the portfolio, and you've seen us over the last several years manage that carefully. To give you a sense, our margin between our asset yields and our liabilities is still 90 basis points, very consistent with where it's been. So we manage that all together and do it. And I would tell you, it is -- we did see it on the net investment income side. It is a challenging environment, and that line feels it. But we also have the ability to price for it, to manage it and work through it. So it's not a new story for us. It's how we continue to manage it.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I know. I certainly appreciate your commentary on the new money investment side. I think we're starting to see some companies maybe stretch for yield, and it certainly seems like you guys are being more conservative on that front. The last question for you, maybe for Rick, you had sort of mentioned that you've got this 2015 debt maturity, I think it's just shy of $300 million, that you've maybe already repurchased some of that. Can you just give us maybe a bit more detail on what's going on there?","Richard P. McKenney","Sure. We actually had about $300 million that was issued out of the U.K. It's part of -- they're not directly linked, but it's part of our issuance we did. We chose to actually tender for half of that. So that's actually in the process of being done. So that will happen probably in the mid-May time frame, a little bit later in the month. So you'll see that come through. We're actually paying to make a hole [ph] as part of that, so there will be debt extinguishment costs. But because this was U.K. debt, we also had currency hedges on. And so as we removed that, there was a gain associated with that. So they will be in a couple of different line items in our income statement, but those 2 roughly equate -- kind of thinking the $10 million to $15 million range on both sides of the equation netting close to 0.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. So you'll get a head start on sort of interest expense coming down as a result of this?","Richard P. McKenney","That's correct.","Operator","We'll go next to Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Just to head back to Closed Block LTC, was there an element of the improvement in the interest adjusted benefit ratio that was attributable to group LTC?","John F. McGarry","We actually saw improvement in both individual and group, so yes.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. It's my understanding, when a state approves a rate increase and the carrier goes to the policyholder, that they get 3 options. They can either pay the increased rate, they can keep their old rate with reduced benefit or lapse. And with individual policyholders, I think carriers have found that, overwhelmingly, the policyholders will pay the higher rate. Is that the same dynamic that you've seen in the group market?","John F. McGarry","It's a little different in the group market in that the premiums, first of all, are a lot lower. Our average premium in the group market is $400 versus like $2,000 in the individual. We are probably seeing more buydowns in nonforfeiture options in the group market than we see in the individual, and that tends to be positive from a reserve development perspective.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Right. And so I guess is that something that's sustainable? Or is that kind of a onetime benefit that you'll get maybe at the January 1 and July 1 renewal periods?","John F. McGarry","Yes, it will tend to spike in January and July when it happens. It only happens when you're going through rate increases. And so it will happen as long as we're continuing to implement group long-term care rate increases. And we'll be doing that for a while because you implement them in the order that states approved on at the next anniversary. And so there's -- we implemented the first batch of state approvals this year, but there are other batches that will be emerging next year as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A question about Colonial. You've had a lot better sales results over the last couple of quarters than one of your main competitors, despite probably facing similar headwinds in regards to health care reform uncertainties. So it begs the question, are you seeing any change in buyer behavior? And what I mean by that is, is there a shift -- has there been a shift in preference towards using brokers, which is your main distribution avenue, versus, say, using career agents [indiscernible] for these products?","Thomas R. Watjen","All right. Ryan, just to clarify, as you know, we really have 2 pathways into the voluntary benefit business. Certainly, the Unum US pathway, sales primarily through brokers and consultants. As you know, the offering we bring to market there is a more comprehensive full offering of group voluntary and executive benefit. The other avenue certainly is the Colonial offering, where we actually market a more limited set of voluntary benefit products, but those go through agents. And the agent may choose to actually use the broker. And so I just want to clarify, we've got sort of 2 avenues into the voluntary marketplace. We consciously chose to keep those 2 avenues because they actually complement one another as we come to market and, in our mind, actually give us a much broader array of choice in the marketplace, everything from the very small employer to the very large employer and in the public sector as well. So sort of with that backdrop, maybe, Randy -- maybe -- is it worth talking a little bit about what you're seeing actually from the broker side of things?","Randall C. Horn","Absolutely. Well, let me emphasize, first of all, that we are continuing to stay focused on our agency distribution system. We do not have different distribution channels here at Colonial Life. Again, our focus is on our career agency system. As they move up market, there typically will be a broker involved. And so we work with brokers through our agency system in a partnership manner. Really not seeing any big shifts in that. I mean, there certainly are growing opportunities as employees are given more and more responsibility for their benefits. And we're seeing more and more brokers interested in getting into the voluntary space, Ryan. So we're very optimistic and feel like the way to go is to keep focused on our agency system and have them work effectively with brokers.","Thomas R. Watjen","Mike, would you like to add a little bit of that from your market perspective?","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, just to echo Randy's point, we definitely see the increased interest amongst brokers. I don't know about the switch amongst employers going more towards accessing the benefits through the broker, but the brokers' interest. As they've seen some of their revenues capped from a health care perspective, they are looking for ways to build out their client relationships and diversify revenue. That drives interest in voluntary. To give you a little bit of a sense, Ryan, over 1\/3 of our new sales in the first quarter came on an integrated group in DB basis. So we're seeing that same advisor bring multiple product solutions. That's also driving good interest in our executive benefits or IDI product line as well.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. You talked about M&A a little bit in the past. I know, generally, there hasn't been a lot going on or a lot available in your markets. But wondering, are there any additional lines of business that you guys would be interested in longer term, say, something like medical stop loss that may benefit from more demand from health care reform?","Thomas R. Watjen","Rick, do you want to just touch the overall M&A strategy?","Richard P. McKenney","Yes, Ryan. Let me just give you a view. It's probably not going to be different -- significantly different than what we've seen, although the market is active. I think the M&A markets, in general, across the insurance space are active out there. When you get more specific to our lines of business, people still tend to like their benefits business and are not avid sellers. When you get to product line, we have a good product set. So we're pretty well filled out across the board, but we'll continue to entertain things that fit within our strategic sweet spot at the -- working at the employer to provide protection benefits. And then I'd also remind you that we look around the world as well. So it's not just different lines we have in the U.S., there's different geographies, which we'll be seeing similar dynamics of what we have today. So we're quite active out there in looking in terms of different opportunities. But the M&A markets, I think, within our lines, particular business probably have not changed that much as you look over the last several years.","Thomas R. Watjen","Good. Thanks, Ryan. Well, it looks like we've actually exhausted our questions. So thank you, all, for taking the time to join us this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you at various investor conferences and events this spring.

The positive business trends and favorable momentum we have been experiencing over the past several quarters continue through this one as well.","Our after-tax operating income per share was $1.05, another in a series of record highs for our company and a very healthy increase of 7% relative to last year's second quarter. For the first half of 2017 our after-tax operating income per share increased just over 8%.","This performance exceeds our expectations coming into the year of growth of 3% to 6% and as a result, we are increasing our outlook for the growth in the operating income per share to a range of 5% to 8% for the full year 2017. Jack will discuss the drivers of this performance in a moment.","Our financial performance remains very well balanced across our business segments. Unum U.S. and Colonial Life continue to produce very strong results with good sales momentum fueling the company's 6% premium growth adjusted for the individual disability reinsurance arrangement and FX.","In addition, we continue to see favorable benefits experience and well-managed expenses. Our Unum U.K. results continue to run slightly below our expectations, driven by the challenging U.K. economy, but I would highlight that Unum U.K. continues to produce strong margins and an operating return on equity in the 15% to 16% range.","And finally, the Closed Block operations were stable again this quarter. When you bring it altogether, our capital generation was excellent, allowing us to raise dividend by 15% buy back $100 million of stock while still building on our excess capital position.","Our first half results are a continuation of the solid momentum we have built coming into the year and our focus on the disciplined execution of our business plan. Our strategy has kept us in step with the changes occurring in the employee benefits market and the investments we're making in our business as part of that strategy are clearly paying off.","Our recent acquisitions of dental businesses in the U.K. and in the U.S., have given us a foothold in the dental market, which is a natural extension of our business. Colonial Life's territory expansion work is also showing positive trends towards accelerating the rate of sales and premium growth for that business.","And our emphasis on improving the customer experience across the enterprise has made us easier to do business with, while leading to better and more efficient ways of operating. More broadly, our singular focus and continued reinvestment in the employee benefits market continues to be an advantage for us and is unique among our peers.","As an example, as the market has shifted more and more towards employee engagement and shared funding, our business model has kept pace. The scale of our business is also increasingly an advantage. It gives us depth of data in the pricing of new business, scaled operations in the administration of our in-force business and industry-leading management of clients.","And finally, the strength of our combined Unum U.S. U.K. and Colonial Life distribution systems provide unique reach into the broker and business-to-business benefits marketplace, allowing us to effectively serve employers of all sizes and industries.","Equally important driving results in the execution of our strategy are the quality of our people and the strength of our culture. Because of our ability to deliver on the promises we make to customers and shareholders, rest with our employees, we continue to ensure they have the tools, technology and training to exceed expectations.","We also understand the benefits of building a more diverse workforce and while we're proud of where we are, we still have opportunity as we build out our culture of inclusion. It's a business imperative as we look to mirror our customer base and serve an increasingly diverse workforce.","At the same time, social responsibility is important to us, in particular our commitment to making our communities better is a cornerstone of our business. Last year alone, we contributed nearly $13 million and our employees volunteered more than 87,000 hours to charitable organizations throughout the U.S. U.K. and Ireland.","And finally, we continue to elevate our stature as a voice for our industry, building partnerships with industry groups and policymakers that can move us closer to our goal of protecting the financial security of more working people and their families.","Now I'll turn it over Jack take on some of the details of the quarter, Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high-level overview of our second quarter results and I will provide a more in-depth view of the themes we're seeing in our business.","Overall, the second quarter was an outstanding one for Unum. Our after-tax operating income per share of $1.05 is an increase of 7.1% over the year ago quarter. We continue to experience strong balance between the operational performance drivers of our earnings per share growth and the capital management drivers.","Our after-tax operating income increased 3.2% to $240.4 million for the second quarter while our share repurchase activity contributed 3.9% to our after-tax operating income per share growth relative to last year.","Our before-tax operating income increased 5.6%, while our tax rate was higher this year at 32% compared to 30.4% in the year ago quarter. Our Unum U.S. business segment continues to be the biggest driver of this performance. Before-tax operating income for this segment increased by 9.1% over last year to $247.8 million.","Within Unum U.S., group disability had another outstanding quarter with before-tax operating income of $92.4 million an increase of approximately 24% relative to last year. This growth in operating income was primarily driven by a strong improvement in the benefit ratio from 80% in the second quarter of 2016 to 76.5% this quarter.","The benefit ratio includes a 50-basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals that we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and remains within the 76% to 79% range that we communicated to you at the December Investor Meeting.","The favorable performance this quarter was primarily driven by lower incidence trends in the group LTD product line and lower prevalence rates in the group STD product line. Group disability premium income increased by 1.2% over the year-ago quarter as the benefit from recent quarter sales offset slightly lower persistency.","The group Life and AD&D line produced a strong quarter with operating income of $60.9 million in the second quarter and increase of 7% over the year-ago quarter. Premium income increased 4.4% over the year-ago quarter and the benefit ratio improved to 70.6% in the quarter compared to 71.5% last year, primarily driven by lower average claim size.","The supplemental and voluntary lines contributed $94.5 million to the earnings this quarter, a decline of 1.5% relative to last year. Premium income continues to grow at a healthy pace increasing 10.5% in the second quarter compared to last year.","I'll note that we executed a reinsurance transaction in the individual disability line in the fourth quarter of 2016 and this transaction lowered revenues by about $25 million, which was offset by a reduction in the sum of benefits, commissions and expenses of about $25 million.","This results in a slight elevation of the benefit ratio, but no material impact on the operating income of the line. Underlying performance in the individual disability line was favorable relative to last year as new claims in this line were lower.","Our voluntary benefits business continues to show good growth trends with premium income increasing 5.6% for the second quarter. The benefit ratio was slightly higher at 43.4% compared to 42.4% in the year-ago second quarter as benefits experienced in the light product line was less favorable.","Also, the acquisition of Starmount contributed $41.2 million in dental and vision premium income to the supplemental and voluntary lines.","Sales in the Unum U.S. segment for the second quarter increased by 10.7% over last year with notable strength in the voluntary benefits large case segment and the group core market segment. Voluntary benefit sales in total increased by 10.7% for the second quarter as large case sales improved by 15%.","For our group product lines, overall sales increased 4.6% over last year with our core market segment increasing by 5.7%, a nice improvement over recent quarters. The addition of the dental and vision product lines increased sales this quarter by $10.4 million and we're very pleased with the productivity being generated in this product line.","Persistency for our group product lines and Unum U.S. remained lower than the year ago levels, but improved relative to the first quarter levels and remain well within our expectations.","Unum U.K. continues to operate in a challenging economic environment brought on by last year's Brexit vote. Second quarter before tax operating earnings reflected this challenge declining by 12.1% to \u00a322.6 million compared to \u00a325.7 million in the year ago quarter.","Our premium income grew by 1% in the second quarter in local currency as favorable sales and renewal trends were largely offset by pressure on the in-force block. This trend is likely to continue as the U.K. works through the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.","The Unum U.K. benefit ratio was 75.6% for the second quarter compared to 70.1% in the year ago quarter driven by higher inflation in the U.K. this quarter relative to last year. Higher inflation impacts the inflation linked benefits in certain of our products, but this is likely offset by higher net investment income generated from inflation index-linked bonds, we hold back these benefits.","The benefit ratio was also impacted by the 80-basis point reduction to our discount rate for new claims, which we implemented in the first quarter and I expect this to continue to pressure year-over-year earnings growth for the second half of 2017.","The underlying risk experience was unfavorable for the Group's long-term disability product line due to lower claim resolutions, while group life performance was favorable driven by a lower volume of new claims.","The pressure on earnings we're experiencing in Unum U.K. is likely to continue for the second half of the year and repeating though that even with these growth challenges, the Unum U.K. segment continues to generate very good profit margins and an operating return on equity in the 15% to 16% range.","Despite the economic headwinds, Unum U.K. sales for the second quarter were very strong increasing 24% relative to last year in local currency. This increase was primarily driven by its success in the dental and group critical illness product lines.","Our group LTD sales were down for the second quarter, following a very strong first quarter. Overall persistency for our U.K. segment is in line with the year ago and improved from the first quarter of 2017 and is also in line with expectations.","Moving to Colonial Life, we again had an excellent quarter with strong consistent and stable results. Operating income increased 5% to $81.8 million in the second quarter. Premium income growth continues to build momentum, increasing 7.1% for the quarter, driven by the strong sales trends we've seen over the past several years.","Colonial Life's benefits experience remained generally in line with our recent trends as well as our expectations with a benefit ratio of 51.3% for the second quarter compared to 51.1% in the year ago quarter. In the second quarter, we also completed our deck reviews for our Unum U.S. and Colonial Life businesses with minimal impact on year-over-year results.","Sales momentum for Colonial Life continues to be very strong, increasing 7.5% in the second quarter. Sales growth in the core commercial market segments was a big driver of this performance, increasing 13% in the second quarter, following growth of 13.2% in the first quarter.","We also continue to see good balance with new account sales increasing 16.7% in the quarter, while sales to existing accounts increased by 3%. Persistency for Colonial Life remained stable at 78.7%.","Finally, for the Closed Block, operating income was $32.6 million in the second quarter of 2017, in line with the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 82.3% in the second quarter, compared to 84.3% in the year ago quarter.","The improvement was primarily due to the reduction in the claim reserve discount rate in the year ago quarter to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher levels of phone call and tenders realized.","For the long-term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 89.4% for the second quarter, compared to the year ago ratio of 92.6%. This improvement was driven primarily by lower claims incidents relative to last year's second quarter.","Looking at interest rates and new money yields for the long-term care portfolio, we continue to exceed our new money yield objective of 5% in the second quarter. With these strong operating results across the company, we again generated very strong statutory income with after-tax statutory operating income for the second quarter totaling $225.2 million.","Over the past four quarters, we generated $877 million of after-tax statutory operating income, which is driving excellent capital strength for the company. The weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance companies is in excess of 395% and our holding company's cash position excluding amounts committed for subsidiary contributions has increased to $757 million at quarter end compared to a year-end 2016 total of $594 million.","Our capital position and cash generation capability are a source of great strength for the company. It provides us tremendous financial flexibility to grow and invest in our business, while we continue to generate shareholder value by returning excess capital to our shareholders.","Again, in the second quarter, we repurchased 100 million of our shares consistent with the trend of past several quarters and in line with our outlook for the year. I'll also remind you that at our Annual Board Meeting in May, we raised our common stock dividend by 15%.","Moving now to investment results. interest rates and corporate bond spreads were both somewhat tied during the second quarter. Despite this time the challenge this presents we continue to maintain healthy interest reserve margins in our U.S. LTD product line and meet the new money yield assumptions for long-term care.","In addition, our investment quality remains in very good shape. Our exposure to retail investments and asset class increasingly under scrutiny lately is very manageable and well below industry average exposures.","Wrapping up, I'm very pleased with the second quarter and our first half performance for the company. Given our strong first half operating results, we're increasing our outlook for after-tax operating income per share growth for the full year 2017 from our original range of 3% to 6% to a new range of 5% to 8%.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Jack. As you can tell, we are very pleased with second quarter and our first half results. At the same time, we\u2019re also very encouraged by the financial position of the company and our strategic position in the Employee Benefits marketplace and we are looking forward to the second half of 2017.","We will now move on to your questions. I\u2019ll ask Jenny to begin the question-and-answer session. Jenny?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Seth Weiss of Bank of America.","Rick McKenney","We can\u2019t hear you very well.","Seth Weiss","I am sorry. Do you hear me or no.","Rick McKenney","That is better enough.","Seth Weiss","Thank you. Expanding on the U.K. and the pressure that you classified there. Would you classify this primarily as a function of lower interest rates and the lower discount rate or are you seeing adverse claims pressures there given maybe by employment trends similar to what we may see in the U.S.?","Jack McGarry","Yes. It\u2019s a little bit of both. We do have pressure from the discount rate. We also saw actually in the first quarter and the second quarter, some volatility and underlying risk results. The first quarter was driven by higher average claim sizes and good disability, that the second quarter was driven by claim resolutions.","We continue to think that most of that volatility and would expect things to level out over the year. But again, I think most of it is growth issue relative to the economy as well as lower interest rates.","Seth Weiss","Okay, great. Just a follow-up question on the timing of the cash position in cash means. So, with the cash position up over $150 million from the year end level. Is there perhaps an opportunity to accelerate share repurchase or you holding a little bit of maybe added buffer at the hold code for cash contributions or any other timing needs?","Jack McGarry","As we mentioned at our December outlook. We expected that we would generate additional cash in 2017. WE thought it was prudent given the kind of the uncertainty around tax legislation and other things to hold that buffer. We don't expect that\u2019s a permanent thing that we need to do and we anticipate giving a lot clearer guidance about future capital on plans at our coming December investor meeting.","Seth Weiss","Okay. Thank you for the answers.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thanks, Seth.","Operator","And we will go next to Suneet Kamath of Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to start with Unum U.S. just looking at the persistency there. It looks like you are down maybe 160 basis points first half of \u201817 versus first half of \u201916. Just wondering what the outlook there is, maybe when do you think persistency could stabilize or are you okay at these levels?","Rick McKenney","Mike?","Mike Simonds","Sure. Good morning, Suneet, it\u2019s Mike. Yes, persistency is down. If you recall we talked a little bit about the abnormally high persistency that we had last couple of years actually, and so, where we find yourself today is actually well within what we would we see as historical norms.","That being said, we were encouraged to see a little bit of an improvement in 2Q over the first quarter of this year and probably most importantly we feel really good about the underwriting approach through the renewal process. So, to give you a sense of the business that we lost ran about nine points worse profitability perspective than the business that renewed through the cycle.","So, continue to feel good in a competitive market that customer see real value in the Unum proposition. I'd certainly say, we\u2019re in a range that we\u2019re comfortable with and probably if there's any trajectory it\u2019s slightly positive.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just maybe shifting to the U.K. given the potential for Brexit to impact various sectors. Can you give us a sense of maybe what your distribution is in terms of exposure to different corporate sectors particularly financial services?","Rick McKenney","We\u2019re going to Peter O\u2019Donnell for that. Peter?","Peter O\u2019Donnell","Thanks very much Suneet. We have a sort of reasonable portion of the business around 20% that\u2019s with financial services, but that covers quite a broad set of financial services. So, it cover local banks as well as those with international exposure.","I think our view on Brexit is, what we\u2019re seeing as Jack referred to, on the economic pressure is that, the banks aren't adding jobs and where they are -- where they can they are subtracting jobs and that\u2019s what given us the pressure in the enforce.","A number of the made announcements around transferring work, but it\u2019s quite small number of jobs to places like Frankfurt and Dublin. So, we\u2019re not seeing any significant shift of jobs as yet and no one's talking about that. What they are talking about is, perhaps cutting back on desks and things they were set up on and you know setting up small branch outlets are legal entity outlets allows them to trade overseas, those contingency plans.","We need to watch that because obviously Brexit is still pretty uncertain exactly how it\u2019s going to work. So, it\u2019s import we get a deal. At the moment that's the kind of scale of the change we\u2019re seeing.","Suneet Kamath","Great. Thanks.","Rick McKenney","Thanks, Suneet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks, good morning. I guess I had a follow-up. To the persistency\u2019s, it does seem like it\u2019s starting to get a bit better again sequentially, also had better sales in Unum U.S. this quarter. I guess just curious an update on competitive conditions and are things starting to improve a bit?","Mike Simonds","Ryan, I can take it. It\u2019s Mike. Good morning. I think read the good one. It remains a competitive market for sure, I sort of comment at the last question about some of the persistency losses that we've seen at very low margins to actual losses. So, competitive but we are encouraged. Sales were up 11% in the quarter.","Importantly if you unpacked that a bit, core market sales were up 6%. We saw coverage count increase nicely in the quarter which is very encouraging as we turn toward the second half of the year.","Voluntary benefit continues the to roll along up double digits at 11%. And importantly, while not a big contributor yet, the dental and vision lines are exceeding our expectations, which were pretty aggressive here for the first half, and usually when we are writing dental and vision that's coming package with other lines as well. So, that's been a nice contributor.","Rick McKenney","Let me talk a little bit formulation there. The market for voluntary benefits continues to grow broadly. So, there's a capacity for more competitors come into the space. We really like our value proposition across all of the market segments and we particularly like our ability which we believe is somewhat unique to serve all market segments with our field distribution system being an agency distribution system.","We have a great reach across the U.S. across every segment and we can efficiently and effectively serve each segment. Jack, pointed out that our core market sales were up 13% again in the second quarter after 13.2 in the first quarter. We really like that segment and we think that our distribution system gives us a unique opportunity to reach it. So, we feel pretty good about the competitive environment.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then follow-up for quite a number of years you\u2019ve been pushing through rate increases in Unum U.S. Are you still a little targeting in terms of mid-single-digit rate increases given kind of the strength and profitability in that business at that point?","Rick McKenney","I don\u2019t think, you can think about the pricing two ways. One is just good care and maintenance of the book of business. So, we will always have a good robust renewal plan in place where we\u2019re sort of calibrating to the risk experience at a client level and I wouldn't see that changing for the balance of this year or for the years to come.","If you think about the aggregate pricing of the book, I think we\u2019re really well tethered to that, our point of view of what we've experienced in looking forward on the fundamentals of interest rate and new incidents and risk trends. So, say in aggregate we\u2019re in reasonable shape but with you ongoing care and feeding.","Ryan Krueger","Understood. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Now, we will go to our next question from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan","Jimmy Bhullar","Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, just if you can talk about your view on your long-term care, there is, I think you've been earning yield relatively close to what you'd assume but you are assuming a ramp up in the next few years in interest rates. So, what your confidence in reserve adequacy.","Secondly, just if you can comment a little bit about the initial reception you\u2019ve seeng in the market to your getting into the medical stop loss product line and how -- what sort of the long-term potential do you see in that market?","Rick McKenney","I\u2019ll start out Jimmy. Jack, you want to talk about\u2026","Jack McGarry","So, from long-term care perspective we've actually exceeded our new money rate bogey in every quarter since we took a reserve charge at year-end 2014. You know that help build some margin relative to the initial reserve assumptions we do have interest rates increasing beginning soon and increasing over time where we\u2019re still hopeful. We will see that happen but time will tell in any case, we feel very comfortable with where we are right now.","We would also note as we said many times that we have a good buffer between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves and so even if interest rates don't rise according to that projection. We feel comfortable that any of that would be a GAAP event as opposed to a capital event.","Rick McKenney","Mike, you want to take on stock op.","Mike Simonds","So, we officially entered the medical stop was market as of 71, taking proposals for 11-18 affective. WE are taking a slow entry into that market. But we do like it overall it","So about $14 billion industry. It\u2019s growing at a low double-digit clip and importantly for us a lot of the same underlying fundamentals of understanding the data that goes into actuarial pricing translating that into good discipline case level underwriting having a field force that understands the importance of balanced growth and profitability.","We feel like, we've got some capabilities to bring to bear in that market. Also, importantly it gets us insight into what employers planning to do with their overall employee benefits program earlier in the cycle. So, we get a good look at what the employee base looks like from health perspective as well as what we are planning to do with health plan design\/ ","Many if we not most of our products wrap around that health decisions. So, it\u2019s a good strategic insight at a case level. So, I don't expect we\u2019ll be talking about large impact to our P&L here in the next 12 to 24 months. In the long term, I think it's got the potential to be a nice business for us.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then lastly just on your higher EPS guidance. Can you give us a little bit more generally on what really caused -- decidedly beat this quarter how are you thinking about the next the second half of the year and is it more margin driven or premium driven the upside versus what you initially guided?","Jack McGarry","Yeah. I would say that beat this quarter is, both you know we have strong, strong premium growth, we saw BTOE grow both within Unum U.S. as well as colonial consistent with that premium growth that's what we've been shooting for a while now kind of fighting the headwinds of interest rates and other things we feel great about this quarter was just a really sound fundamental third quarter where contributed as the way we would owe in any gives us no optimism as we go into the second half of the year.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will go to our next question from Thomas Gallagher of Evercore ISI morning.","Thomas Gallagher","So, Jack, in terms of thinking about capital management, you\u2019ve been generating more, more than you been spending on buybacks and dividends, building whole co-cash and I know you mentioned short of taking a wait-and-see approach based on tax reform et cetera.","But if we sort of fast-forward to next year's plan and assume you keep building at a similar rate issued in the first half would that be enough of an offer where you could then at least commit to 2018 higher cash flow being committed to the higher buybacks and dividends.","Is that sort of the way to think about that you\u2019re -- the reason for accelerating the buyback now is more building a bluffer in case there is tax reform. And from that point of forward, you would be able to use something or is it more multi varied than that?","Rick McKenney","So we have a buffer now, but we\u2019re extremely pleased with statutory earning that we\u2019ve been generating 225 million this quarter. That's been consistent \u201816 and \u201817 that builds free cash flow generation. We\u2019re not in a position where we think we\u2019re going to build a cash buffer forever.","So, we need to decide you know and understand. We need decide what to do with that capital. We expect to make that decision at the end of this year. And so, we have excess capital and we will we will put that to work. We\u2019re not going to save it forever.","Thomas Gallagher","And with buybacks\u2026","Rick McKenney","I think timeframe 2018 as Jack said, over the course this year. But just to reiterate what Jack said. We have good capital buffers. But we will make sure that we are using that capital effectively and also to the advantage of shareholders.","Thomas Gallagher","And so, would buyback be the most logical source of you know if you do end up moving to a higher level?","Rick McKenney","Let me remind you of our capital management philosophy, the first thing we want to do is grow our organic businesses and make sure we're investing in those. The second thing we would look at from a party perspective is mergers and acquisitions and being able to increase our shareholder value through those.","Third, we look at dividend. We increased our dividend 15% this year which is continuation of the of a trend of increasing dividend. And the final thing, we will look at a share repurchase but in the absence of you know an acquisition opportunity or some other event I think share repurchase would be a reasonable place to the use our excess capital.","Thomas Gallagher","Just curious, if you guys have spent any time on NAIC developments regarding the long-term care transfer solutions and some potential there and what your thoughts are?","Rick McKenney","Steve Zabel, will answer that.","Steve Zabel","Thanks, Tom. We have been tracking activity there. I would say it\u2019s very early days. I know there was a meeting recently with the LTC task force. Those types of discussions have gone on before the NAIC. Never really got any traction as you can imagine that be a pretty complicated structure to try to put in place.","But we will continue to track it. Definitely would not be a priority item for us as we\u2019re thinking about our action plan. So, we continue to work the initiative that we have and we\u2019ll continue to monitor it. But I think it\u2019s pretty early days.","Thomas Gallagher","And then just one final question. Should we still think of the U.K. as being a source of cash flow for the next few years. When I heard you describe what's happening in the environment, to me it sounds like an earnings issue, not capital issue, not a balance sheet issue. Even if things got a lot worse on the claim side. I still wouldn\u2019t view that really as a balance sheet issue. But just wanted to confirm that?","Rick McKenney","Tom, this is Rick. I think that\u2019s certainly the case. So, what we\u2019ve talk about the U.K. the pressures, we\u2019re having are about growth pressures. The capital flow has been very consistent. We\u2019ve been taking dividends from the U.K. for a long period of time. That\u2019s been stable. The team here did a great of working to solvency too.","So, we gone through the regulatory changes. Still able to grow capital to the company. So, this is not a capital discussion. It\u2019s one of growth and it\u2019s one of the great business that we would like to continue to grow. We\u2019re just feeling the headwinds of Brexit in the U.K. economy.","Operator","And then moving on we will hear next from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at U.S. group visibility on the writing, continues to be very good. When I think about -- when I think about the performance. Do you think is a reflection of your price and risk discipline and claims management.","So, without asking for kind of any update you guidance, do you think you are enjoying the full benefits of all the things that you've put in place and all the pricing that you are ready to put through or do you feel like there is some more room to levers to extract more margin?","Mike Simonds","It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. Very consistent with the guidance we gave you guys heading into the year. We just got to the lower end of that range quicker and that's how I would describe what's driving that on the underlying.","I\u2019d say, we would have seen ourselves sort of probably more gradually moving down through that range to the course of this year that\u2019s as a reflection of the underwriting approach being sure that we\u2019re price for interest rates and incidents in the like.","I would say getting to the range quicker is the volatility which has been favorable for us particularly around new long-term disability incidents.","Humphrey Lee","And then just looking at your overall businesses, everything seems to be humming along pretty nicely. Just kind of thinking ahead, do you see anything that is on the horizon that could peak your interest, peak your cautious kind of, looking a little bit longer term?","Rick McKenney","There is lot of things that peak our interest. As we look longer term, first of all, reaffirm what you said, the business is run extremely well, it\u2019s broad-based, the team is doing a great job. We\u2019re going to continue to be focused on that. Our plans are still good and aggressive as we look out over the next 18 months and beyond.","We\u2019re going to pursue those plans, certainly thinking about where the future opportunities. But we don\u2019t rest and I think that\u2019s the important thing. We are always looking beyond what changing, what's emerging in our world in the employee benefits world, in the world of technology that we need to take advantage of.","So, at the same time we\u2019re executing well today, we\u2019re investing for the future. So that\u2019s what you'd expect of us and that's what we\u2019re doing. But we are happy with how the businesses performing today. But to be performing in the next year and the year after that, we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re constantly looking to the future.","Mike Simonds","Humphrey, I think good examples of that would be our investment in dental business, dental and vision businesses in both the U.K. and the U.S. and our entry into the stop loss market, on both we view as tremendous growth opportunities for the company.","Humphrey Lee","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Eric Bass of Autonomous Research.","Eric Bass","Just wanted to talk a little bit about voluntary benefits. I was hoping you could talk about the penetration rates for voluntary both in terms of the adoption by employers as well as the number of employees who are electing voluntary benefits?","Rick McKenney","We see both the adoption rates at the employer level and at the consumer level improving. The dynamics in the industry that create need, haven\u2019t changed, in fact, we\u2019re accelerating. So, more employers are moving to high deductible healthcare plans. We\u2019ve shared statistics with you in the past. Roughly 40% of America's workers have adequate life insurance and disability insurance. So, there is huge opportunity there.","As employers are looking to continue to pass on cost to employees for benefits, they are increasingly looking at voluntary solutions. Our broker partners are increasingly looking to voluntary solutions as an opportunity to supplement their income as they\u2019ve seen their income from health insurance backup. So, we're excited about the opportunities. We think that the penetration rates both employer and consumer level continue to increase.","Mike Simonds","Talk about Unum U.S.","Rick McKenney","What I would add to Tim\u2019s comment which is within voluntary benefits, maybe two categories of products with more traditional employee benefit lines, life insurance, dental, vision insurance, so, we see penetration of those benefits pretty high once you get over 100 employees. So, you'd be up in the 75% to 85% range.","What\u2019s happening there though is more-more of the premium is going to employee base is becoming a more voluntary benefit. So, things like the Starmount acquisition, that's exciting to us because we bring those employee paid abilities into a well-established, highly penetrated business.","And then the other half is what Tim is speaking to the supplemental health products that wrap around health insurance as those deductibles go up. So, really strong growth but a lot of runway left in terms of penetration in lines like critical illness, accident, hospital indemnity. ","Eric Bass","Thank you. And can you also just quantify what the natural growth trends for premiums are both in the U.S. and U.K. businesses?","Mike Simonds","Yeah, maybe I'll start and this is Mike on the U.S., in the U.S. it's the continuation of what we've seen over the last several quarters. So, a little bit of job growth, a little bit of wage increase probably not as aggressive as we would like to see in that 1% to 1\/2% tailwind to us in our traditional group insurance businesses.","Rick McKenney ","And Peter, do you want to touch on the natural growth trends in the U.K.?","Peter O'Donnell","Yeah. So, as I said referred to earlier, it's split actually between our larger clients which would be 1,000 plus employees 2,000 plus where what we've seen is we would normally see around 2% 2% to 3% natural growth we're seeing slight negative minus 1%.","It hasn\u2019t gone through to the smaller markets, the SME as such we call it, which is under 1,000 and it's a little bit sectoral as well because if you're exporters, you're doing better than if you're exposed to the local market.","Eric Bass","Great. Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Eric.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Nadel of Credit Suisse","John Nadel","All right. Good morning, everybody. Mike, I found one of your comments I think it was in response to an earlier question, pretty interesting. I think you were talking about the portion of the block that had not renewed had them I guess it's the margin -- I'm assuming it's a margin of about nine points lower than the portion that had renewed.","Could you just dive into that a little bit more? Do I have that right that it's nine points on the margin or is it -- how do we think about that?","Mike Simonds","So, if we look at what's the terminated premium and where did that business run relative to the active, that comes through the renewal cycle and process. There is a ninth point spread between the two and let me just add a little color.","Where we feel that most acutely is in, I would describe the midmarket, I would say 100 employees up to 2,000 employees that's where we see the most competition. You have carriers that focus at the small end that are trying to move up into that midmarket, carriers that have traditionally been in a very large employer space investing to try to move down and gets pretty choppy there in the middle.","It was nine point spread in total, but the business that we lost in that midmarket was actually at a loss and a notable loss. So those are typically being taken at enforced rates. We're looking to move them up and someone's willing to take them on where they're sitting currently.","John Nadel","And just as a -- is that 100 different cases? Is it a 1,000 different? How big is that piece? Would we be able to actually see it, if it showed up at one competitor, I'm assuming it doesn't show up at just one, but if it did, would we be able to actually see it?","Mike Simonds","I think you'd see it come through. We've got a pretty decent market share in that mid but still it's going to be in the 12% to 15% market share range. So, there's business moving that's certainly not coming just from Unum.","So, it will be hard to draw it linearly, but John we've talked about it in the past. Anytime in the group insurance space, you see a carrier that outgrows the market out of multiple for an extended period of time. It is usually a lag effect to a pretty significant loss ratio hit.","John Nadel","You know, I am in agreement on that. Thank you, Mike. The only other question I have is Jack, this is about 10 quarters now since the long-term care charge at the end of '14 and an update on the next several years pass of targeted new money yields and then the increase thereafter.","Can you just -- I know you've said you've exceeded the 5%, but what's the actual number that you guys have achieved over the last 10 quarters or so? How much upside have you actually achieved relative to that five and can you just remind us at what point does do we start to need to see that gradually increasing from that 5 to I think it's sort 6 or 6.5?","Mike Simonds","I would say we haven\u2019t shared the actual number. We're not going to get in the business of sharing our actual quarterly new money rates against our portfolios, but it's been a reasonable beat and so we feel good about where we are.","If you look at our history over the last 10 quarters. The good news is our actual results are a little bit further up that curve than the 5% and so we have a buffer, but in the next one, two, three years, we're certainly going to need to see an upward movement in interest rates or we're going to have to look at the reserves.","John Nadel","Okay. And then maybe one more follow-up on the LTC just and I know you guys have been having a decent amount of success on the Landing Spot program. Can you just give us an update on how things are going as it relates to rate increases and I guess we could characterize the Landing Spot as essentially a buydown of benefits?","Steve Zabel","John, this is Steve. I'll take that one. So, we continue to be very pleased with the take-up rate. I think we've mentioned in the past adoption its north of 50% on those increases. It clearly varies by the level of increase that was actually approved where the higher increases, the adoption rate is going to be a bit higher.","We continue to feel good about the regulatory environment. There's been a lot of education, a lot of awareness over the last several years. I think regulators are much more open to the conversation.","There's also a lot of alternatives that are put out there about how these rate increases are approved and implemented and we've seen a lot of flexibility by the regulators and we work with them at construct. So, we're pleased. We're still on pace with our original assumptions related to rate increases and we'll just continue to work that with the regulators.","John Nadel","Appreciate that. Thanks for the responses.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, John.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Thank you. Good morning. Rick, in your comments, you had alluded to improvement I think at Colonial that you suggest it should support acceleration in sales. Any specifics you can share on that, when, how much?","Rick McKenney","Yeah, I think the sales growth that we've seen in Colonial Life is a result of a lot getting more feet on the street and how we're working that. I was referring to we're continuing to focus on that.","We really like our Colonial Life business, but I'll Tim talk about the things we're doing to continue to accelerate the growth of that company?","Tim Arnold","Yeah, thank you Rick. Thanks for the question Mark. We have a plan to accelerate growth through territory expansion primarily, but also through some initiatives around persistency improvement.","We did open three new territory offices in the first six months of this year, bringing us to 45 total offices and we expect that to continue to grow and over the next few years we'll be in the upper 50s.","Each of these new offices is already exceeding expectations that we had for the very early part of the tenure. We're excited about the talent available in the marketplace. Currently we're excited about the people we're bringing into the organization and we're excited about the opportunities we see in some places where I wouldn't call it exactly wide space, but we see some underpenetrated parts of the country where we have opportunities to go and make a difference.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","And with no further questions at this time, Mr. White, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Rick McKenney","Yeah, this is Rick actually. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you at investor meetings here over the next several weeks.","For our investor friends, we know you have a busy day today. So, we will end the call promptly, but we thank you for joining us and we'll leave it at that, thanks.","Operator","And again, that does conclude our conference for today.

Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter was another excellent quarter for Unum, capping off a very good year. On the quarter, after-tax operating income per share increased over 5% to $1 per share and bringing our full year 2016 operating income per share to $3.92, which is a record for our company. This represents an increase of just under 8% over full year 2015, which was also above the upper end of our original outlook range of growth of 3% to 6%. This performance was broad based and driven primarily by solid premium growth, especially in Unum US and Colonial Life. There was also a very strong operational performance across all of our business lines. I remain very encouraged by our ability to deliver these results in an environment of still relatively low interest rates and more recently, a weaker British pound. ","I am equally encouraged by our company's potential to generate even stronger results, as the economy improves and potentially as interest rates move higher. As we discussed with you at our outlook meeting in December, I believe the primary reason we are delivering these strong results and doing so on a consistent basis is that we are well positioned strategically in the Employee Benefits market. We excel at the fundamentals of our business in three primary areas; distribution and relationship management, pricing and risk selection and claims processing and management. You will see this expertise come through in the premium growth we are generating in our core businesses, while also maintaining very attractive profit margins. The reason is that as we pursue this growth, we do so in a disciplined way. Jack will cover this in each of our business lines in his comments in a moment, but let me first provide a few highlights on the quarter. ","First, our premium growth remains very healthy. For Unum US, our fourth quarter growth was up 6% relative to last year. Colonial Life\u2019s growth continued to build momentum as premium growth for the fourth quarter was just under 7%, the strongest rate of growth since 2008. Sales were also very encouraging in the fourth quarter, as Unum US sales rebounded to increase by 8.5%; Unum UK increased by 6.7% in local currency and Colonial Life sales also grew 6.5%. In addition, we are very pleased with the persistency rates we are experiencing across all of our segments, which helped generate this premium growth.","Second, our profit margins remain quite strong in our core business segments with ROEs running in the mid to high teens. The discipline we follow in the fundamentals of our business from the pricing and underwriting of new business relationships to the management of our current customers. This provides a good balance between producing top line growth and doing so in a profitable way. As you would expect, given these growth trends and strong profit margins, we\u2019re also generating excellent statutory earnings. In fact, for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, we generated record levels of statutory income, that is 885 million in after-tax statutory operating income for the full year 2016, an increase of 28% over 2015. ","As a result, our risk-based capital levels and holding company cash position finished the year above our expectation. This provides good choices for our capital deployment strategy. We start with backing the growth we're seeing in our business as well as investing to enhance our position in the market. This is true on both a core basis as well as acquisitions such as Starmount and NDP. This healthy cash generation has also enabled us to increase our dividends and consistently repurchase our shares with the excess over our growth needs. Another indicator of performance is the steady growth in our book value per share, which for the fourth quarter, increased year-over-year by 8.5% to $39.02. Book value, excluding AOCI, increased 9.3% year-over-year to $39.24 at quarter end.","So in summary, it was an excellent year for Unum in 2016. It was a year that saw a lot of volatility in the markets. Through it, we remain steady with our intense focus on the disciplined execution of our business plan and serving the needs of employers and their employees. We are optimistic as we enter 2017 with a great market position, a recipe for top and bottom line growth and a great team. ","So with those highlights on an excellent quarter and full year, I\u2019ll ask Jack to cover our fourth quarter results in greater detail. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning, everyone. Rick provided a high level overview of our fourth quarter results. And now, I want to provide a more in-depth view of the themes we\u2019re seeing in our business. ","First, it was an outstanding quarter for Unum overall. Our tax operating income per share of $1 is an increase of 5.3% over last year. We achieved these results, despite the 33% tax rate in the fourth quarter, which was driven in part by the sharp rise in interest rates in the UK. Our before-tax operating income increased 7.6% to 346.9 million, the strongest rate of growth we've experienced in many years. As in prior quarters, we continue to be pleased with the strong balance between the operational performance drivers of our EPS growth and the capital management drivers. Leading the growth in before-tax operating income was our flagship Unum US segment, which produced record operating income for the fourth quarter of 240.1 million, an increase of 12.1% over last year. While each of our Unum US business lines performed well, group disability had an outstanding quarter with before-tax operating income of 89.5 million, an increase of over 35%. ","The earnings growth was driven by a sharp improvement in the benefit ratio from 81.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 77.7% in the current quarter. The current benefit ratio includes a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claim incurrals and is consistent with the 76% to 79% range that we communicated at the December investor meeting. The improvements in the group disability benefit ratio that we've seen throughout the year continue to be driven by favorable incidence trends in the cumulative benefit of rate increases on renewals over the past several quarters. Group disability premium income growth was 3.7% over the year ago quarter, driven by continued strong persistency levels. ","The group life and AD&D line continued a steady performance with operating income of 56.1 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3.3%. Premium income grew 4.9% over the year ago quarter and the benefit ratio improved slightly to 71.5% for the fourth quarter compared to 72% in the year ago quarter. Lower incidence, lower average claim size and favorable waiver premium benefits experienced throughout the improvement in group life. The supplemental and voluntary lines continued to perform well, producing after-tax operating income of 94.5 million, an increase of about 1% over the year ago quarter. Premium and growth trends remained very favorable, increasing 11.1% in the quarter compared to last year. ","It's worth noting that we executed a reinsurance transaction in the individual disability line in the fourth quarter. This transaction lowered premiums by about 25 million, which was offset by a reduction in the sum of benefits and expenses of about 25 million. It caused a slight elevation of the benefit ratio, but had no material impact on the operating income of the line. The transaction improves the capital efficiency of the product line, thereby improving the future ROE of the line by about one half percent. Also in the supplemental and voluntary lines, this was the first full quarter with the acquisition of Starmount and results were in line with expectations. We're excited to now actively offer Unum branded dental and vision products in the market. ","We're very pleased to see the rebound in sales growth for Unum US in the fourth quarter. Our sales increased 8.5% over the fourth quarter of 2015, after showing year-over-year declines in the previous three quarters. Total group sales increased by 8.2% with very strong growth in short term disability and group life, driven by sales to existing customers in the larger cases segment. Overall, we continue to see strong persistency across all of our Unum US lines of business. Obviously, this is a key driver of positive premium growth. ","For Unum UK, operating tax -- before-tax operating income was slightly lower at GBP24.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to GBP24.4 million in the year ago quarter. Benefits experience was generally favorable, with the benefit ratio improving to 67.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 69.9% a year ago, due primarily to better group life results. We experienced about a 1% decline in premium income, which was mostly attributable to slower growth we're seeing in the imports block of business, likely a result of the economic disruption created by the BREXIT vote in June. Clearly the exchange rate is a negative for our reported translated results. With an exchange rate of 1.24 for the fourth quarter compared to 1.52 in the year ago quarter and 1.31 in the third quarter of 2016. We expect this to continue to impact reported results in 2017.","Sales in Unum UK remained favorable, increasing 6.7% on a local currency basis in the fourth quarter. The increase was well balanced by product line and by segment. We were also pleased with the improvement we saw in persistency, which was 87.3% for 2016 compared to 86.3% in 2015. ","Colonial Life again produced very strong and consistent results with before-tax operating income of 79.9 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 3% over last year. Premium income growth continues to accelerate, increasing 6.8% for the quarter. Our benefits experience remained generally in line with expectations and recent trends. In addition, our sales trends for Colonial Life remain positive with an increase of 6.5% for the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by success in the larger end of the commercial market and the public sector. We also saw a very good balance with account sales increase -- with new account sales increasing 6.9% in the quarter, while existing account sales grew by 6.3%. For the full year 2016, Colonial Life sales increased by 10.3%, which is the fourth consecutive year we've seen year-over-year growth, a very strong result through a difficult economic environment. Persistency also improved in 2016, increasing to 79.3% from 78.5% in 2015.","Finally, for the closed block, operating income was 34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 28.1 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 84.7% in the quarter compared to 87.2 in the year ago quarter. The underlying benefits experience was in line with our expectations, but the reported benefit ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was impacted by a reserve discount rate adjustment we made as a result of unusually high bond call activity and related miscellaneous investment income. ","For the long term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 89.1% for the quarter, improved from the year ago ratio of 89.7% in the third quarter 2016 ratio of 93.8%. The year-over-year improvement was driven primarily by favorable mortality experience and the impact of persistency on active life reserves. I'll point out that since the fourth quarter of 2014 reserve adjustment, the interest adjusted loss ratio has been 89.4% within the long term ratio of 85% to 90% that we expect. Adjusting for the impact of a large group case termination which impacted the loss ratio in the third quarter of 2016, this two year cumulative loss ratio would be 88.1%.","I continue to be pleased with the progress we're making in the closed block, particularly in the long-term care line. The yields achieved on new money for the long-term care business have consistently exceeded the assumptions we've built into our reserves. Also, we continue to make good progress in achieving rate increase in our in force long term care business. We received some notable approvals recently and continue to make good progress against the assumptions we use in our reserves. The landing spot whereby a policy holder can avoid a rate increase by electing to slowdown the policy benefit inflation rate has been viewed favorably by consumers and regulators alike. These actions combined with the underlying performance of the block improved the statutory results for the Fairwind captive. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to maintain the strong capital position of Fairwind, while reducing the level of cast contributions for 2016 relative to 2015.","So to summarize, our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter was outstanding, highlighted by good premium growth, favorable persistency trends, very good benefits experience overall and favorable expense trends. These trends in turn generated excellent statutory income. After-tax statutory operating income for the fourth quarter was 260.6 million, a 43% increase over the year ago quarter. For the full year, our after tax operating statutory income totaled 884.6 million for 2016, an increase of 28% over the 2015 total of 689.2 million. These results reflect our strong benefits experience across the majority of our business lines. ","As you know, statutory results drive capital strength and free cash flow generation. We finished 2016 with a risk-based capital ratio for our traditional US insurance companies in excess of 400%. This strong 2016 statutory earnings will result in increased dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and will allow us to continue to build holding company cash next year. Our holding company\u2019s cash position totaled 594 million at year end 2016, which was slightly ahead of our Investor Day outlook. We repurchased $103 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter and our full year repurchases totaled 403 million.","Looking now in investment results, new money yields have improved since the election in early November. While the ten year and thirty year US Treasuries rallied by 85 basis points and 75 basis points respectively during the fourth quarter, we've seen some giveback as corporate bond spreads are somewhat tighter. All considered, we're feeling better about the environment for new money yields. ","So in summing up 2016, we reported after tax operating income per share of $3.92, an increase of 7.7% over 2015. This exceeded our outlook for the year for growth of 3% to 6%, primarily due to strong operating performance across many of our businesses, which more than offset the negative impact from the decline in interest rates in the British pound. All three of our core business segments showed year-over-year growth in before-tax operating income for the full year 2016 with Unum US increasing 7.6%, Unum UK increasing 3% in local currency and Colonial Life increasing 1.6%.","As we outlined for you at our outlook meeting back in December, our outlook for growth in 2017 also calls for growth in after-tax operating income per share of 3% to 6%. I\u2019d say that our view on earnings potential for 2017 has not changed, but with our outperformance in the fourth quarter and the higher starting point for earnings going into 2017, we would be looking for growth rate to be a little lower in that range as we begin the year. To wrap up my comments, I'm very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. It was an outstanding year. We are executing very well on our strategies with focus on maintaining pricing discipline, generating strong persistence in growth in our core business segments, delivering on renewals to maintain our profit margins and meeting new money yield targets for the long-term care. This success gives us a great foundation to continue to build and grow upon as we move into 2017.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Jack. We'll now move to your questions and as I conclude our prepared remarks, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with our overall results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. I'm encouraged by the positive momentum we have going into 2017 which will serve us well as we manage through the year.","So let me now ask the operator to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","I have two questions. First on the US business, if you could just discuss the operating environment and whether you are starting to see a benefit from wage inflation and hiring in your numbers. And also just how pricing trends were as you went through renewal season for the past year? And then secondly on UK, how susceptible do you think your business is to Brexit and the like potential workforce reduction at some of the large financial services companies, whether you\u2019ve seen it already or are you expecting that and how much is it - of that is baked into your guidance for \u201917?","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Jimmy. Let Mike start with the view on the US market.","Mike Simonds","Thanks and good morning Jimmy. So, two parts to your question I'd say, we continue to see a nice gradual increase to the tailwind of natural growth that shows up just straight directly into premium on the employer funded business and it shows up in our voluntary plans as well where we had really strong re-enrollment results for the fall and headed into 2017. I think in terms of the market, to the second part of your question, first and foremost for us is the ability to renew our existing client base and we saw persistency just north of 90% in the group lines again. And we\u2019re able to hit our pricing targets through the renewal cycle, so we feel very good about that. Encouraged to see little over 8% sales growth as well, now a good chunk of that came from existing client sales both cross-selling and enrollment. But the very smallest end of the market, small case group insurance we actually saw an increase year-over-year on new client sales those are the shortest sales cycle clients and so that's probably the most current view. And as we mentioned at the outlook meeting, this is the first year in a few where we're not going in with new business price increases on the group side. So reasonably optimistic that we've got a rational marketplace out there probably tempered just a bit by the mid market which remains quite competitive.","Rick McKenney","Probably maybe we'll go over to Tim Arnold at Colonial Life to hear his view on the market as well.","Tim Arnold","Thanks Rick, we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in the small case market especially, the employment growth and the wage inflation also helps us when we go back out to reenroll an existing client. We have employees who are earning more and maintain more income protection and more protection through some of our other products as well. So we're optimistic about the environment.","Rick McKenney","And you\u2019re second question was on UK Brexit, Peter O'Donnell, do you want to hit on both what we're seeing today and then how we're thinking about that going into \u201917.","Peter O'Donnell","Yeah, thanks for the question, so in terms of what we've seen in 2016 is basically a slight slowdown. So you've seen in our premium numbers that we had very strong sales, we also saw very strong persistency, but wage growth was relatively weak as was employment growth and we think that business investment is sort of damp at the moment and people are being cautious about the future. What we haven't seen is a significant exodus and what I'd say is that's quite unlikely moving large parts of complicated financial services to the EU is incredibly complex and high risk you know. So if you move from our derivatives trading, it's hugely complicated to manage and regulate. And the city of London remains a good place to do business. What we are hearing from some of our clients is they may set up some offshore sites where they will move some jobs but relatively low at the moment to enable them to sort of continue trading in Europe, but we're not seeing any indication of any mass exodus at the moment. So I think in our outlook what we factored in was really a continuation of what we saw in 2016. We think wage growth will remain slow even with inflation going up and we also think that people will be cautious about business investment until we\u2019re clear on the exact Brexit implications.","Jimmy Bhullar","And financial services as a percentage of your premium base in the market, is it, I think it's about 20%, 25%.","Peter O'Donnell","Yeah, it\u2019s around 20%, but it's spread across a lot of non-investment banks, so we would have a lot of the retail banks that will be very UK oriented. So it\u2019s not quite as significant as that when you sort of look at what's truly affected. And you think about industries exporters, they were also exposed you\u2019re going to do well because of weak sterling. The tech sector stay well over here, so we got a pretty balanced portfolio really.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Could you talk about the Starmount acquisition just thinking about how the sales would be distributed over the four quarters, it's obviously making a nice contribution, dental and vision there. I think you did a 10 million in new sales in the quarter. How should we think about that number for next year in terms of overall sales and how would it be distributed through the year.","Rick McKenney","Yeah Mark, we appreciate the question, we're very excited to have Starmount as part of the fold and how that fit strategically with us. And I'm sure they\u2019re listening in, many of our new employees there, so we certainly welcome them. Mike you want to talk about our outlook and how we see the business overall?","Mike Simonds","Yeah, good morning Mark, delighted to talk about Starmount. So the way I think about it is what you see in the fourth quarter is the Starmount branded and Starmount distributed results. We are now in the market as of the first of January with Unum branded dental and vision products and so I would expect that the sales would ramp up through the course of the year as we bring it out to initially about half of the 50 states and begin to bring Unum sales people and client managers to bear on the portfolio. The seasonality of the business will track with our group insurance more broadly, so you'll see in general fourth quarter being our strongest sales quarter which is another reason why it will ramp up as we go through the year.","Mark Hughes","And then the - when we think about the sales outlook for Colonial, double digit growth for the full year kind of high-single digits in the fourth quarter when you look at the kind of your recruiting, your pipeline let's say, how do you think we should look at 2017.","Rick McKenney","Tim?","Tim Arnold","Yeah, thanks Mark. We are optimistic about 2017, the leading indicator is that we evaluate for ourselves progress are all turning favorably, the recruiting that we experienced in 2016 was strong and above our internal plans. The growth in our sales offices was also very strong. Growth and sales measures are very strong and we continue to see great opportunity in the marketplace. ","Rick McKenney","I would add that we\u2019re actually making investments in the expansion of our footprint in the Colonial Life salesforce and are very encouraged by recent success there and we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2017 and beyond.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Seth Weiss from Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","Just wanted to follow up on the reinsurance transaction and supplemental involuntary. And sorry if I missed this in the prepared commentary that $25 million impact on premium offset on the expense line, should we expect that to be ongoing or is that just something unique to this quarter.","Jack McGarry","I would expect it to be ongoing that's the seated premium. The benefit in expense piece that offset is ceding commissions as well as some risk sharing. So I would look at that as affecting those lines at that level but having no material impact on really the operating income of the line and just improving the capital efficiency.","Seth Weiss","And if we think about your topline guidance that was given for 2017, should we just adjust that down accordingly or was that contemplated the reinsurance transaction when you gave that guidance.","Jack McGarry","That would have been in there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo Securities.","Sean Dargan","At the December Investor Day, Jack mentioned the possibility of basically paying another party to come up with a LTC solution and you did build the cash balance at the holding company. I'm just wondering if you've gotten any closer, have you have any more insight about what type of appetite there might be from traditional or nontraditional counterparties?","Rick McKenney","Jack you want to hit on that?","Jack McGarry","It is a complex thing with long-term care. I would say we're not imminent in terms of having a solution. The rise in interest rates certainly helps the bid ask spread and that you know so we continue to be active in the market we continue to talk to people we continue to work with our regulators. It\u2019s clearly something we've focused a lot of attention on, but I wouldn't say that anything imminent.","Rick McKenney","And to add to that Sean, you also talked about the increasing cash position and capital build up that we have and I wouldn't equate those two, but Jack maybe you want to talk about our capital generation where it is today and how we're thinking about it?","Jack McGarry","So we feel really good about our year-end capital position based on extremely strong statutory earnings that we had in 2016 which will drive 2017 dividends. We expect that position to continue to build. As we look at our capital position I\u2019d say our uses for it have remained very consistent that\u2019s continuing to invest in our core businesses. We\u2019ll continue to look at the M&A market for our opportunities. We continue look at our dividends and support our dividends and continue to maintain our payout ratios. And then finally we look at share repurchase. Our stock price is run up, but we will tend to be very consistent and predictable in our share repurchase and capital plans. We're not going to overreact to current stock prices. Actually we still feel that at $46 a share that our stock is a good investment and that we will put money into. And we will be building cash this year and would expect to build cash into the future as well. We will be looking very closely at what to do about it. There's a lot of unanswered questions out there on interest rates, tax reform, the economic environment, but as we get more clarity about where those things are going to land and take stock of where we are, expect we will be communicating more in the future about our capital plans.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Billingsley from Compass Point.","Ken Billingsley","I had questions, one on the investment portfolio looking at the balance sheet. Total investments from third quarter and fourth quarter were down about 2 billion, looks like reserves were off, were down 1.5 billion and then the AICO adjustment was 500 million. Was this related to the reserve, I\u2019m sorry the reinsurance transaction or could you just explain to me what the moving parts were?","Jack McGarry","That had more to do mark to market basis in the balance sheet with the rising interest rates we saw in the third quarter. Reserves were down but the market value of assets were down a commensurate amount.","Ken Billingsley","But not a connection between something that happened from a reserve?","Jack McGarry","No, it\u2019s nothing in the underlying performance of the business or the reserve level.","Rick McKenney","Or the reinsurance [indiscernible].","Jack McGarry","From a book value perspective things were pretty consistent.","Ken Billingsley","And my next question, having - I\u2019d just you guys to look back to 2013, I'm just trying to get an idea of what you think ACA reform may have on the impact of sales and persistency and looking back at 2013, I guess that was the year before the mandate went into place. There was a decline at Unum US and Colonial Life and nearly every segment for sales and persistency. Now it bounced back in 2014. Was this a distraction for customers as they were focused on what was going on with ACA and could we see that in the future as reform is in place and they have to focus on how it's going to back their business maybe less focused on employee benefits.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Ken. We'll start with Mike and then we\u2019ll go over going to Colonial Life.","Mike Simonds","Ken, you have an excellent memory, 2013, we absolutely did see markets freeze up a bit as employers and their advisors tried to sort through the implications of ACA, a small tweak to the commentary though, it was a slowdown in sales, persistency was actually strong through the period because business didn't tend to move. As we look into 2017, you are right, there is uncertainty around the administration and the future of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s something that we're watching really closely. I'd say though on balance, we're quite optimistic that we won't see a slowdown like we did back in 2013. It seems more unlikely given the fact that we will be unwinding requirements versus putting new complex requirements in place. So in that regard it's likely to be less disruptive. And I say in general as you\u2019re unwinding, employers are slow to make broad-based benefits changes unless they're compelled to by new regulations. So I can see a more conducive environment than we saw back in 2013. Now Tim, I don't know if you got a view on Colonial Life.","Tim Arnold","I agree with that Mike, the slowdown on Colonial Life sales in the third quarter of 2013 was also amplified by the fact that we were making a number of changes in our distribution system and leadership which have helped us become more effective but created a little bit of a slowdown in that same period when ACA was being implemented. So like Mike, we are pretty optimistic that any changes at this point would be less impactful. The need for America's workers to have the kinds of benefits that we offer has never been greater. We've talked to you guys before about the 30% of American households have no life insurance and significant under-insurance and disability increasing medical deductibles which all play in our favor as we think about the marketplace.","Operator","And at this time that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Rick McKenney","Thank you. We appreciate the questions this morning. I think that it\u2019s a little bit reflective that we had a very straightforward and very positive quarter which was a great wrap to the year. So we thank you for all for taking the time to join us this morning. We also look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. We're going to be quite active out in the market at various investor events over the next several weeks and look forward to telling you our story in greater detail as we do that. So I appreciate the time and we'll talk to you soon. Operator, that now completes the fourth quarter 2016 earnings call.","Operator","Thank you.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement and our website also in the Investors section.","Yesterday afternoon, Unum reported fourth quarter 2019 net income of $296.2 or $1.44 per diluted common share compared to $249.1 million or $1.15 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 included a net after-tax realized investment gain of $7.2 million and after-tax costs related to the early retirement of debt of $1.7 million. Net income in the year ago fourth quarter included a net realized after-tax investment loss of $32.6 million excluding these items after-tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $290.7 million or $1.41 per diluted common share compare to $281.7 million or $1.30 per diluted common share in year ago quarter.","Participating in this morning's conference call are Unum's President and CEO, Rick McKenney; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Zabel and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Simonds as well as Peter O'Donnell who heads our International; and Tim Arnold who heads our Colonial Life business.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Rick McKenney for his opening comments.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. We close out 2019 with a good fourth quarter. Our after-tax operating earnings per share increased 8.5% over the year ago quarter to $1.41. This puts us our operating earnings per share of $5.44 and a growth rate of just under 5%. In the fourth quarter, we had a good mix of growth with after-tax operating earnings growth of 3% complimented by the additional benefits from share buybacks producing the 8.5% overall increase.","The business environment, we operate in, remains mixed with headwinds from lower interest rates and the economic impacts of Brexit on our UK business offset somewhat by the favorable employment trends and a strong consumer in the U.S. All-in-all, we are pleased with our performance in 2019 and optimistic as we move into 2020.","Looking at our business trends, I'm pleased with the premium growth we saw in our core business lines, which are approximately 5% overall for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Sales trends however were more volatile in this quarter and sales for Unum U.S. were lower on the quarter, impacted by the competitive conditions and the employee benefits market and our desire to maintain discipline with our pricing and risk selection.","I feel it's important to remember that because of our focus on discipline, Unum U.S. sales can vary from year-to-year, but I'll put that in a context that our compound average growth rate has been 5.6% since 2016, and sales in total have exceeded $1.1 billion for each of the past three years. We saw favorable growth trends in our international lines and an improved rate of growth in Colonial Life the fourth quarter, which helped us to generate a slight increase in sales for the full year for Colonial Life.","Total sales for the Company for the full year were $1.8 billion. And persistency levels in our U.S. group lines and international business lines remained steady at very favorable levels, reflecting the strong value proposition we bring to our in-force customers and our distribution partners. Next, we continued very favorable overall margin trends across our core business lines. Benefit ratios remained within our expectations, particularly in our U.S. based businesses. This reflected disciplined approach we bring to product pricing and underwriting as well as in-force block management through renewals.","While adding new customers in our core business segments is a driving force of our strategy, we know that sustainable growth requires us to maintain our focus on protecting the strong profitability of these businesses. Expense management trends also continued to be favorable in our core business segments. We're maintaining our focus on effectively managing our expense base while freeing up the capacity to invest in new capabilities.","I'll come back to this in a moment, but we see significant opportunities for growth and efficiency as it is important element of success and will be continuing this focus on productivity, expense ratios and the profitability of our business. Taking in aggregate, these favorable operating trends in our core business segments continue to drive strong margins and capital generation. As a result our adjusted operating return on equity was 17.2% for the fourth quarter.","Our core businesses also generated healthy statutory after-tax operating earnings of over $1 billion in 2019, with a resulting cash flow funding our growth and supporting our capital deployment initiatives. Wrapping up on our financial results, Closed Block had an excellent fourth quarter, with historically low loss ratio in the Closed Disability Block. We also saw favorable overall results in the long-term care business, which has remained within our expectations since we updated assumption 18 months ago. Steve will cover all these results in more detail in his comments.","So to conclude my remarks, we are quite pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. We enter 2020 with a strong sense of optimism. You also saw a few weeks ago, we named Mike Simonds as our Chief Operating Officer, recognition of his past success and a well-deserved expansion of responsibilities should drive growth.","We know that delivering consistent long-term success is a constantly evolving market for benefits, and through all of this new product introductions and business acquisitions we have made requires us to continually challenge our approach to how we do business, and Mike's new role will be instrumental in this process. Our team is excited about the opportunities we had ahead of us and for continued growth and success.","Now, I'll ask Steve to cover the details of the fourth quarter results. Steve?","Steven Zabel","Great. Thank you, Rick, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased with the fourth quarter results. It was a good quarter overall with solid results in our Unum U.S. and Colonial Life businesses, both of which came in consistent with our expectations. The Closed Block had excellent results while the international business had a separate quarter, reflecting the challenges we face in the UK business environment. Our fourth quarter tax rate was slightly higher than expected in the quarter but was in line with our expectations for the full year, A result of normal volatility we expect to see over the course of the year.","Miscellaneous investment income rebounded in the fourth quarter from an unusually low amount in the third quarter, but remained below our expectations and historical trends for the full year. All in all, we ended the year in good shape with after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share of $5.44, within our growth expectation of 4% to 7% that we established a year ago. Now I'd like to dig more deeply into the results.","Starting with Unum U.S., we continue to see solid underlying results in the fourth quarter as adjusted operating income increased 5.8% to $263.1 million, with each of our three reporting lines showing positive year over year results. Premium growth remained healthy at 5.1% year-over-year driven primarily by continued strong group persistency. Net investment income increased slightly less than 1%, helped in part by an increase in miscellaneous investment income over the year ago quarter.","Benefits we experienced in the segment were generally favorable with the benefit ratio declining slightly to 67.3% in the quarter. The adjusted operating return on equity for Unum U.S. remained quite strong at over 18% in the quarter. Then within Unum U.S., adjusted operating income for group disability increased 2.9% to $83 million in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good premium growth and strong benefits experience as well as slightly higher net investment income. Premium income increased by 5.7% as the in-force block increase from prior period sales growth and continued strong persistency in our group insurance lines.","The benefit ratio improved to 74% in the fourth quarter and 76.2% a year ago, driven primarily by favorable claim recovery experience in our group long-term disability product lines, which was partially offset by higher claims incidents. Net investment income in the quarter was slightly higher as higher miscellaneous investment income offset the effects of reduced assets back in the line and lower portfolio yields on those assets.","The increase in the other expense ratio compared to the year ago quarter was primarily driven by the rapid growth of our lead services. Keep in mind that the fee income related to those services is included in the other income line. Excluding the service business, we saw a slight improvement in the operating expense ratio on the fourth quarter relative to a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the Group Life and A&D line increased by 6.1% in the fourth quarter to $68.2 million, premium fee income increased 4.8% primarily from prior period's sales growth.","The benefit ratio of 71.7% was generally consistent with the year ago quarter of 71.6%. The expense ratio declined slightly due to the ongoing focus on expense management and operating efficiencies. To the more volatile quarter for sales in our Unum U.S. group lines of business declining 9.4% from the year ago quarter. Full year sales, however, were declined by less than 1%. Persistency in our group lines in aggregate continue to be a bright spot for us, at 90.5% for full year 2019, compared to 90.3% in 2018.","Finally, the supplemental and voluntary line, adjusted operating income was $111.9 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 7.9% relative to the year ago quarter. Premium income grew by 4.5%, primarily driven by prior period sales and the growth in our dental and vision product lines, partially offset by unfavorable persistency across all businesses. Looking at benefits experienced for each product line, the benefit ratio for individual disability was slightly lower relative to last year due to a lower average claim size and favorable claim recoveries. The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits line was higher, primarily due to unfavorable claims experienced across all products finally.","Finally, in the dental and vision line, the benefit ratio was higher relative to the year ago quarter, due to higher utilization. Expense ratio for the supplemental and voluntary line improved relative to the year ago quarter from our focus on expense management and operating efficiencies. Sales for the supplemental voluntary line were lower by 5% for the fourth quarter with declines in both the individual disability and voluntary benefits product line, offsetting the growth in the dental and vision product line. For full year 2019, sales in our supplemental and voluntary line were flat.","Our Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of $23.9 million for the fourth quarter, a decline 21.4% from a year ago quarter. The decline was driven primarily by lower operating income from the UK line of business in local currency. In local currency, the Unum UK line of business reported adjusted operating income of \u00a317.4 million in the fourth quarter, a decline of 21.6%. These results reflect growth in premium income of 8.6% relative to the year ago quarter from higher persistency, sales growth and the benefit of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line.","Net investment income for the Unum UK declined 8.7% to \u00a320.9 million in the fourth quarter, due in part to lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds that we hold to support the claim reserves associated with our group policies that provides for inflation-linked increases and benefits and also lower yield on fixed rate bonds. The benefit ratio for the UK business increased to 77.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 74.6% a year ago, primarily due to unfavorable claims experience in both the group long-term disability and group life product line, partially offset by lower inflation-linked increases in benefits.","Unum International sales in U.S. dollars increased 13.8% in the fourth quarter with sales in the UK and local currency increasing 13.9% and sales in Unum Poland increasing 8.8% on a dollar basis. Persistency for the UK business continued to be favorable in the face of successfully implementing renewal rate increases over the past two years, as we look to offset the interest rate pressures.","While our Unum UK results are facing continued headwinds from Brexit, we are pleased with the execution of our strategies, which are centered on implementing rate increases, maintaining strong persistency and discipline on new sales pricing and actively rerating underperforming cases. In addition, we are very pleased with performance of the Unum Poland business, which produced strong premium growth of 8.6% this quarter on a dollar basis. We continue to expect our 2020 operating income to be relatively consistent with our results for full year 2019.","Moving on, the Colonial Life segment produced adjusted operating income of $87.7 million for the fourth quarter an increase to 2.7% for the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 3.6% for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by prior period sales growth, including the expansion of the dental and vision products offset in part by a lower level of persistency. The benefit ratio of 51.5% was generally consistent with the year ago quarter of 51.6%. So, the Colonial Life continued to rebuild momentum with a year over year increase of 2.6% in the fourth quarter, which brings the full year sales to an increase of almost 1%.","In the quarter, we saw positive trends in the public sector markets where new sales increase over 41%. Persistency for full year 2019 declined to 77% and 78.1% in 2018, but we believe that persistency will level out in 2014 and current levels. We are confident in the actions we've been taken to rebuild our sales momentum and expect improved sales growth levels in 2020.","Now moving onto the Closed Block, adjusted EBITDA operating income was very strong at $46.1 million, compared to 34.8 million in the year ago quarter. As expected, premium income for this segment continues to decline, down by 4.5% in the fourth quarter, which is primarily due to the ongoing policies terminations and maturities for the individual disability lines, which is partially offset by premium rate increases within the LTC products.","Net investment income increased 3.1% in the quarter, driven by an increase in the level of invested assets, backing the LTC line, which is partially offset by a lower yield. In the individual disability product line, the interest for adjusted loss ratio was 74.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 81.2% last year, which is primarily driven by favorable claims experience. This quarter\u2019s loss ratio was the lowest that we've experienced in over 10 years, but going forward, we expect the loss ratio to be in the low 80s.","In the long-term care business line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 86.7% for the fourth quarter and remains within our expectations and the loss ratio in 85% to 90% range. Over the past four quarters which we feel is a more appropriate time to measure of alpha line like LTC, the interest adjusted loss ratio for LTC is 88.1%, again in line with our expected range.","I'll then round out the Closed Block discussion with three other important topics related to LTC. First, we made incremental progress with premium rate approvals in the fourth quarter with several new approvals on our group LTC rate filing. We are pleased with the rate of progress we are making to our $1.4 billion assumption and believe we can achieve this goal in the coming years.","Second, we have exceeded the new money yield target of 5.5% since the third quarter of 2018. And we've often cautioned the assumptions back in this business line need to be analyzed over a long term time horizon given the potential for quarterly volatility, but remain satisfied with how the trends have evolved since reserve update in 2018. And third LTC related cash contributions to subsidiaries for the full year 2019 for our first Unum subsidiary totaled $100 million and for the Fairwind captive totaled 268.","Looking at over the next couple of years, our capital plans anticipate these tax contributions suddenly back to a previous historical average of around 200 million, combined as we work through the impacts of low interest rates and tax reform. Wrapping up with a corporate segment, the adjusted operating loss which excludes $2.1 million of before tax costs, related to the early retirement of debt, with higher in the fourth quarter $50.5 million, compared to a loss of $48.2 million in the year ago quarter. This was driven by lower net investment income and higher interest expense, which was offset by lower offering incentives.","Statuary earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies were quite strong in the fourth quarter with statutory after-tax operating earnings totaling $266 million, compared to $215 million in the year ago quarter, and totaled $1.03 billion for the full year. Our capital metrics remain in good shape with a weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. traditional life insurance companies at approximately 365% consistent with our plans for the year.","Also consistent with our expectations, cash at our holding companies totaled $863 million a year end in 2019. Early in the fourth quarter, we completed the tender and redemption transactions that we began late in the third quarter, which generated the small debt extinguishment costs reported in the fourth quarter. In addition, share buy backs in the fourth quarter were $100 million and totaled $400 million for the full year of 2019. It also highlights a book value per common share excluding AOCI, as of December 31, 2019 was $48.92, which was an increase of 11.2% over 2018.","So for full year 2019, after-tax adjusted operating income per share was $5.44, an increase of 4.6% over full year 2018. Looking at 2020, we continue to expect growth in after-tax adjusted operating income per share in the 4% to 7%, which is consistent with the outlook we provided at our outlook meeting in the December.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments and look forward to your questions.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Steve. And again, we're very pleased with the fourth quarter, and we're in full swing for the New Year in 2020. Team is here to respond to your question. So, I'll ask Kevin to begin the question-and-answer session. Kevin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","On disability, can you give a little bit more color on the benefit ratio? I guess it improved despite absorbing the lower discount rate. So just hoping you give some incremental color on what you sought to offset that and drive further improvements?","Rick McKenney","Yes. Sure. So, as you've noted good solid loss ratio and the group disability line at 74%, I'd say to your question specifically, strong recoveries and offsets in the quarter, more than help offset a moderate increase in new claim incidents. And as you noted and as we had talked about at Investor Day, we did go ahead and lower the new claim discount rate on new incremental curve by 25 basis points in the quarter.","Ryan Krueger","And then on competition, you've made a number of comments in December about seeing more voluntary competition. You also had softer traditional group sales. Are you seeing more competition in traditional group as well? Or do you view the quarter as more volatility as more combined to voluntary?","Rick McKenney","Ryan, it's Rick. Let me just step back and talk a little bit about, how the competitive landscape has changed over the last several years. You would note a number of players that have sold businesses to others that are incumbent in our space. And so, that's been a dynamic that we have seen out there and that has covered across the group stays. On the voluntary space, you would have heard us talk about new entrants, people getting into the voluntary space that would not have necessarily historically been in that space. And so, we're seeing how that's playing out over time.","I actually talked a little bit more about fourth quarter. I feel very good about the sales we saw in our UK operations, Colonial Life from a better trend that we saw in the first half of the year. And then we did see Unum U.S. down a little bit on the quarter, but when you look at a fourth quarter, I'd go back to the greater than 1.1 billion in sales and are maintaining our pricing discipline, which you see year in and year out, we will continue to pursue that.","I think the recognition of the competitive landscape changing, are a number players that really like this space. I think that bodes well for us that we're in front of the pack, and as we go through and come to the space and go through integration, we're focused on growth in the future. So, I'm very satisfied with where we are, but also looking forward to where it is. Competition will come and go. We've been talking that for many, many years. We don't necessarily see the irrational competitor, which is one thing you can't do much about. But we expect competition and we think it's actually god for us business in a longer-term. Maybe, Mike, do want to add anything on, what you're seeing particular to our lines in fourth quarter?","Mike Simonds","I think it summed it up in the fourth quarter, maybe just a little bit color. We did see a decrease of about 8% overall. But if you unpack it a little bit, sales to our existing clients were actually up about 7% and that's really important to us. Those tend to build stickier, longer-term relationships, and they come in more favorably priced. And what you have to do is go out and win in new client relationship. I think that's where we felt, Ryan, the most competition is in the new client market and that's not terribly different than what we had seen emerged over the full second half of the year and pretty consistent with prior cycles in the past.","I guess I'll just close by saying. As we look out in 2020, there is a lot of reasons for optimism, we're certainly going to maintain that pricing discipline that you have known and seeing from us pretty consistently, but new capabilities going up particularly in that core market where we have struggled to get some growth within our targeted underwriting margins with, the rollout of our new digital platform will not be taking core clients from on-boarding all the way through the administration of their benefits completely, digitally.","And we think that's going to help set us apart. As well as a new investment in sales reps in the core, where we have now built out a dedicated team to target the small under core market where we will see a lot of opportunity to grow. And maybe, Tim, I think you might have a couple of comments about the market on the voluntary side.","Tim Arnold","Yes, sure. Thanks Mike. I think about the results that Colonial Life has in 2019. Certainly, the competitive environment was one factor. But just as a reminder, some of these as we talk about in December, we make changes in our recruiting model that had an impact on our sales, that has nothing to do with competitive environment. We also made changes in a number of key distribution relationships. We've made some changes in migrating towards the higher persistency industries and perhaps away from some lower persistency industries. So, we feel great about the quality of the sales we had in 2019.","The public sector growth as Steve talked about earlier, with that being the highest persistency industry in our book, we feel very good about that. And we feel great about the continued contribution of dental in our book, and we had a strong year against selling to our existing customers. So, that's also helpful, and as we look forward, maybe at the risk of slightly over answering, but as we look forward, I agree with Rick, the market opportunities are tremendous. There are still 6 million businesses out there that have more than one employee and less than 100.","Those businesses to be tend to be underserved. Their employees are certainly underserved with less than half of America's workers having adequate life or disability insurance. We've had a strong value profit in all markets and all segments. With our current footprint, we can reach over 80% of America's workers within a 1-hour drive with one of our primary offices. We have 6,000 people who do benefits education and counseling, which is desperately needed in this environment.","And on the recruiting front after a challenging second and third quarter, we've rebounded nicely in the fourth quarter and are back to the levels that we saw before we made this strategic shift in our recruiting approach. So, we remain pretty optimistic and we still feel comfortable with the guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just first question on pricing, particularly in UK and U.S., when the interest rates are down, a decent amount so far this year. So how do you feel about the level of pricing that you're putting out in the market? And do you have to maybe some more price through to contend with where rates are today?","Mike Simonds","It's Mike. Actually, it's pretty consistent with where we're in December. I think we talked about in the past. Certainly, yields are one factor that we're going to put into new business and renewal policy claim trends and expense levels are also getting factors. In fact, there's some puts and takes. And like we talked about in December, I think we had a really good spot given current returns, to probably, nudge rates up a couple of points, certainly low single digits across most products and segments. But I think one of the things we work really hard to do is, deliver consistency to clients in terms of predictability, so acquire clients at a sustainable range and then where we need to make adjustments are going to be pretty, pretty modest.","Suneet Kamath","And then, Rick, in your opening comments, you've talked a little bit more about expense efficiencies and some of the actions you guys might be taking. Can you just provide a little bit more color on, what some of those actions would be and sort of how materially they could be in terms of driving growth?","Rick McKenney","Thanks Suneet. It is a big part of our commentary, but it's a part of the actions that we're focused on right now. It comes in two fronts, maintaining the efficiency that you've heard year in year out, maintaining a very good expense ratio. It's not outsized, we do it. On every year, we look at how we can maintain efficiency. I think we're leaning into a little bit harder these days, and the goal is to actually be able to channel our investments into these growth opportunities we see.","You hear the optimism that we have, but we got to make sure that we're putting the money behind these opportunities to go after. So, the expense efficiency that you see will really be applied, most of it, back into our capabilities as we go forward. So, that's why you hear about a little bit more about it, because we're a little bit more focused on, but it really will be going back more towards the opportunities and the capabilities that we see in the next several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Just the follow-up on the competition in group. Would you say and I heard your comment about the 7% increase in sales to existing clients, so most of the competition is coming from new declining sales. Would you say that you're close on a lot of these cases that you're not winning? And the reason I asked is, if you\u2019re really losing on price by a larger, wider margin. Just curious if you would have optimism that sales would recover in 2020? Or is it not that far forward on pricing to the point where you can kind of recover from a sales standpoint?","Mike Simonds","Tom, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. I would actually say, not that far off in general. There's going to be some volatility process to prospect, so one does not apply to all. But I think Rick said it earlier in the call, where we really don't see an irrational competitor to which we have seen at times in the past where you might be significantly out. I'd say we've got pretty healthy market out there.","I'd say in general we're in the hunt and that bodes well as we -- we already put some new tools into our sales people's hands here in 2020 and I think that does bode well. And few of the optimism around the guidance we put out there for continued steady top line growth. I'd say the other piece is, there's just -- there's less churn in the market and that's my observation certainly reflected in our persistency. And as we've looked at our 1.1 renewal cycle, there's just less of business moving in the traditional group side.","Thomas Gallagher","And then, just the question on IDI Closed Block performance is very favorable. Was that mainly just increased mortality in the quarter? And I guess just relatedly, just given that you've had several years of good performance there, does that -- would you say that improves the possibility or optionality of you doing something with backlog to free up capital or where do you stand on thoughts regarding that?","Steven Zabel","Yes, good morning, Tom. This is Steve. I'll take that one. So just related to the quarter around our Closed Block individual disability income business, I'd say over the combination, probably the main driver was just lower incident. It was a bit of an anomaly for us. We had lower incidents on that block. We did also see strong mortality but probably not that was outsize what we would normally see in the fourth quarter.","So I would say, it was mostly driven by incidents, definitely would not see that sustainable into the future. And my comments, I guided back down to the low eighties and that's still where we are. But I do have to say we feel good about how that blocks, perform if you go back that block, the majority of that block is in a special purpose vehicle. It was securitized with nonrecourse debt and debt has performed very, very well.","So I think that's really speaks to the consistency of the profits coming off of that block. That's actually going to be paid off going into the middle part of next year. So, we feel good about it, but again if you're thinking about kind of forward looking, the low 80% loss ratio is probably a more normal rectal level. When it comes to just the block itself and how we're thinking about opportunities, we continually test the market and continually explore the market in a variety of ways.","One, we definitely look at reinsurance. Obviously, we'll look at potentially re-levering that block, once that debt's paid off. But it also is generating some nice distributable cash flows and so we also have the option just let that come through and have it be available for holding companies. So, we'll continue to explore all three of those options as we see. But whenever we do, it's going to be for the benefit of shareholders. And so, we'll make sure that economically it makes sense for the Company and the shareholders.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, thanks. And if I could just sneak one more in. Just the 365 RBC, do you have a pro forma estimate of what that RBC would be? If you recaptured the long term per captive, what adjustment we should make to RBC?","Steven Zabel","Yes, I would just go back to how we think about our targets for risk-based capital. We try to keep it in aggregate of 350 and that's what we guide towards as far as our traditional insurance companies. We don't really publicly disclose what that would look like, but I think we'd still be around that 350 range, if we were to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Looking at Unum UK, you've pointed out there is the impact of Brexit and interest rates and also you have some unfavorable underwriting in the quarter, but I think the profit margin is one of the lowest as I can recall. But given some of the ongoing impact, how should we think about the profit margin for that line of business going forward?","Rick McKenney","Maybe I'll just turn it over to Peter. I mean, one of the things I would remind you, Humphrey, that when you look at our line of business, it's still a mid teens ROE business. So, it has a little bit lower we talked about that in our comments, in the quarter and in the world of Brexit, having a still a mid teens ROE business is very good. Now, let me turn it over to Peter to give some more details in terms of margins stand.","Peter O'Donnell","Yes. Thanks Humphrey. Maybe be I'll just a step back and sort of give my view where the business is. So, yes, we have experienced a challenging environment recently with the significant uncertainty around Brexit. And as you guys mentioned it, interest rate and the exchange rate, I would say, are sort of most visible indicator of that with interest rate down below 10-year, down below 1%, and the exchange rate being under $1.30 for most of the year. Good news, it's not a $1.30 since it's pretty stable around that.","Very positive about the election results in December, it's really good. I think for business in the UK, we spoke to most business leaders they want to see a stable government for at least 5 years. However in 2020, we expect the external environment to be very similar to 2019, as the UK debates its future relationship with EU.","As Steve mentioned in his remarks, I feel good about the focus we're making in many areas. We've seen good growth in products that are sensitive to interest rates, good expense, good core growth, and persistency is being good given the renewal program. However, it's on our long-term visibility product, we have seen the most pressure, both from interest rate and higher claims incidents and severity, moving away from a long-term averages. But we've been responding to again over the last two years with our rate program, which will restore margin and we are being very disciplined on pricing of business.","We do see volatility by quarter, and in 2018 we've averaged around 20 million, higher in the first half and lower in second half. I wouldn't worry too much about that trend in the second half. It does tend us to move around a lot. But basically, we landed about 80 million for the year; and as Rick mentioned, an ROE of just under 14%.","In 2020, we will continue to rerate the book and work on clients to improve claims and grow those non-interest rate sensitive products. And we expect BTOE to be broadly in line with 2019, but it can move around that $20 million NIM by quarter. It's difficult to call it by quarter. So overall, very positive about the positioning and prospect of the business over the medium term, given the actions we have and are taking, and particularly as we see returns to more normal political environment as we clear Brexit.","Humphrey Lee","That's helpful. And then shifting gears back to U.S., so you've talked about the efficiency and I think I appreciate the color that you provided. But just looking at group visibility, the expenses kind of came up, I think part of it is because of the lead management that you have in there and you are spending more to grow that business. So just how should we think about the general expenses for good visibility going forward, as we think about your efficiency gain for your underwriting business, but at the same time while growing your lead management?","Mike Simonds","Good morning, it's Mike. So, in that group visibility segment is where we have our fee-based services business primarily lead management, which increasingly becoming not just FMLA at the Federal level, but state level and municipal level as well as corporate fees. So that in combination with the sizable disability fee-based services that we provide is growing. We see that as a very attractive business for us over time and one of our biggest areas of the investment.","So, the overall profile of the Company that Rick was talking about, we're going to continue drive efficiencies at the macro level and that is one primary place that we're reinvesting funds back into this business. We see that as a real problem that we can solve for clients in a differentiated way. And so as we do that in the segment, as you're computing kind of an OE ratio with premium as your denominator and fee-based business are going to continue to see that OE ratio continue to drift off.","But I would tell you that, if you pull the fee-based businesses out of the segment, we actually saw about 50 basis points decline in the traditional operating expense ratio there. So, in some ways, you kind of look out for that segment, I would continue to expect some modest growth in that expense ratio because of the growth in fee, but you should know that underneath that, we're continuing to sort of drive efficiency on the insurance side.","Humphrey Lee","So, should we expect that kind of expenses for group visibility to maybe at least in the near-term much growing faster than your top line?","Mike Simonds","I think it's going to grow slightly faster, but probably reasonable. We'll see that in that ratio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","I just wanted to know a little bit on some your earlier questions. So, if Unum U.S. in the group disability area, this year you had a full year benefit ratio of 74.4%. Last year, I mean in 2018, it was 76.1%. So, as I think about an earlier comment you made about being able to get low single digit rate increases. Maybe you could give some color on where that benefit ratio could stabilize? It sounds like some 75% is doable. I know you had favorable claim recoveries this quarter, but it seems like 75% or lower is doable going forward. And maybe you talk a little bit about that?","Mike Simonds","Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. It's Mike. So, I think it's reasonable to have that sort of 74% to 75% range in mind. I would think just in general, that is pretty tight when you think about business like this, but that can overtime particularly at a quarter-to-quarter level have some volatility. But as we look out and look at the returns on the major drivers of that benefit ratio. That seems like a reasonable range.","Andrew Kligerman","I'm still trying to reconcile your ability to grow sales and the balance in markets. I mean, if you look at given the essence volume kind of business is down to 12% year over year. And it looks like in Colonial overall is 3% profit versus 5% to 7% guidance. Maybe you could, I mean, maybe focused specifically on the pricing there, is pricing coming down?","Rick McKenney","Yes, Andrew. Thanks for the question. Pricing on a voluntary side really isn't an issue. Almost all of the products that are sold in the voluntary side are separated and prices not negotiating points. So, the negotiating points tend to be around what type of participation you\u2019re thinking might be based on the enrollment conditions, what compensation looks like whether there are technology companies that would need to share some of the compensation et cetera. So those are the negotiating points and we don't see those being any particularly real threat to us.","Andrew Kligerman","Mike on U.S.?","Mike Simonds","Yes. I'd say, we talked about it a little bit, but I'd say in the market, it is much less priced point and its around underwriting the product features and we talked a little bit about that we have rolled out some new products there I think really wanted to creating additional consumer level value. There is less expense both to cover administration because the OE expenses that we have had but also through the challenge and the commission level out. We see there actually pretty nice growth on that subset of new product and about 25% of all of our new sales in the quarter came on those two products categories and just looking at new products is about 50%. So, I think it will take some time, but as we look at the pipeline for voluntary under Unum branded side of the business, I think that's really optimism.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Bass of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bass","Do you expect New York Life's acquisition of Cigna's Group business have much impact on the market? And historically, have you seen mutual companies approached the market much differently from a pricing or target margin perspective?","Rick McKenney","Thanks for the question, Eric. I mean, I think I would step back and I made some comments about how the market changes well. Prior to that acquisition, you have had consolidation in the benefits space. For a different reason and different players, you've also seeing some acquisitions done from foreign players that have come into the space as well. So, there is a lot of dynamics adding a new competitor in there that is in the mutual space. This business still needs to be well managed and work through the business. So, I don't -- we haven't seen the dynamics yet, but I think that, it should be similar to other competition that we have seen in government space. Mike do you want to add?","Mike Simonds","I think also specific to the question. We've had a couple of long-term mutual competitors in the space and have not seen a materially different sort of orientation to other competitors.","Eric Bass","And you have had some good success with the lead management services products. Are there other opportunities to add ancillary to fee-based services or products to drive growth in the future?","Rick McKenney","Sure. We also think that, that is the case. I think the lease service gives us a point of interception in a pretty meaningful way down to a level about worksite, and we can see a lot of potential services branching off from that as well. So, that is one of things as we kind of look forward as a company, we've got a very strong insurance and benefits footprint across the U.S. and UK and we see increasingly that there's opportunities to introduce new primarily digital backed by people services alongside insurance products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","First, there is a question on loss trends in the disability business. Obviously, it's been very favorable and I guess the labor market is helping as well. Do you see anything that would suggest that margins are not going to hold up at the recent levels? I know, you're guidance is a little bit more conservative than what you've been reporting. And are you pricing based on what you've seen in terms of lost trends over the past year or so or more based on longer term averages?","Mike Simonds","Sure. Yes. So, on group disability I'll take it back to the commentary earlier. I think 74 to 75 on the loss ration and it is very reasonable and what our expectations are looking out, as I was saying earlier, you look sort of the major factors that would sort of impact loss trends that we don't see, things that would materially impact that. But as I say every time, it's an insurance business, it involves taking some risk. And they're certainly can be, particularly, when you look at it on a quarterly basis, some volatility there.","But our approach is about being really smart and disciplined upfront about the risks that we take on and then just investing heavily in remarkably talented group of professionals. That handles the claims process from the clinicians to the book, rehabs to the disability benefit specialists. It is a really impressive machine and quite effective that helping support people, return to work in a very consistent way.","Jimmy Bhullar","And just on, like the changes, upcoming changes in long duration contracts in terms of accounting. Do you have any better insight you'll be effective? I guess the LTC and IDI business are there you have the most exposure, but when do you think you'll be able to give some idea on what the impact on your book value would be?","Steven Zabel","This is Steve. I'll take that one. So, I'll step back just a little bit just on the new accounting guidance. This is a GAAP only accounting guidance. How we view it will have to change our reporting and our disclosures for GAAP basis financial reports. From a statutory cash flow, from a capital deployment perspective, we see this as a bit of a non-event. It was delayed a year out. So, the effective date is in 2020.","And so, the team's working through it and the recent change was adding the scope claim reserve liabilities, so we're working through that. The majority of the impact will be around discount rates, things that we talked about before. So, as we look out, we're planning for the 2022 implementations. The team's working hard at it and, as we get more information, we will disclose it as it makes sense, but really nothing new to talk about right now.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Kevin. And I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. Kevin that now completes our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Tom White. Please go ahead, sir.","Tom White","","Great. Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2014 earnings conference call for Unum. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact. As a result, actual results might differ materially from results suggested by these forward-looking statements.","Information concerning factors that could cause results to differ appears in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are also located in the sections titled Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and our subsequently filed Form 10-Qs.

A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's presentation can be found in our statistical supplement on our Web-site, also in the Investor section.","Participating in this morning's conference call are Tom Watjen, President and CEO; and Rick McKenney, Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as the CEOs of our business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum US, Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK, Randy Horn for Colonial Life, and Jack McGarry for the Closed Block. And now, I will turn the call over to Tom Watjen. Tom?","Tom Watjen","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everybody. For the third quarter, we reported $0.87 per share in operating earnings, a 2.4% increase over last year and a result generally consistent with our expectoration. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of many of the positive operating trends we have seen over the past few quarters, including continued strong sales growth, accelerating premium growth and stable risk experience, all of which are helping us to produce solid margins and profitability on our core business lines.","For the first nine months of the year, our operating earnings per share increased 6.9%, which is consistent with the 5% to 10% outlook we provided you at last December's Investor Meeting. Book value per share excluding AOCI continues to grow nicely, increasing 9.1% from last year's third quarter level.","Now let me highlight a few things before turning the call over to Rick for his more detailed remarks. First, we continue to see good sales momentum in our key business lines, a trend that emerged a year or so ago. Unum US sales increased by 13% this quarter with particularly strong results in our sales to existing customers. Colonial Life also continues to generate strong sales growth with third quarter sales also increasing 13%, reflecting solid results across all of our market segments and growth from both new account sales and sales to existing accounts.","And finally, as expected, Unum UK sales rebounded this quarter increasing 15% year-over-year in local currency. I'm confident that these results did not come at the expense of future profitability but instead reflects the strength of our competitive position and today's generally more favorable benefit market conditions.","Second, we are also seeing accelerating premium growth, with a 4.1% increase in premium in our core operating businesses. Premium growth has certainly been favorably impacted by the positive sales trends but also reflects the strong persistency in most of our lines and the targeted pricing actions we have taken in selected product areas.","And finally, driven by our strong risk results, we continue to generate excellent operating margins and returns in our core business segments. As a result, we again reported solid statutory earnings in the quarter, which continues to give us the financial flexibility to support the expected capital needs in the business while also returning capital to our shareholders.","Now looking ahead, while today's interest rates are certainly a challenge and are likely to remain a challenge, over the past few years we have successfully managed through a pretty low interest-rate environment and I am confident that we will continue to do so. More importantly, I do expect the positive operating trends, specifically our sales and premium growth along with our strong risk results, to continue into next year, and we'll have more on that at our Investor Day meeting in December.","Now let me turn things over to Rick for a more detailed review of our operating results. Rick?","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Tom. Following on Tom's comments, I'd like to provide additional details on the drivers of our operating performance this quarter as well as a deeper look into top line growth and a view of our trends in our investment portfolio, and I'll close with an update to our capital management position and our capital management plans.","Looking first at Unum US, we saw the continued favorable trends of improved premium growth, up 3.4% year-over-year and an improved benefit ratio which declined to 70.4% for the segment from 72% in last year's third quarter. This good product performance was not enough to offset the headwinds of the low interest rate environment and as a result operating earnings declined 2.5%.","This general trend was consistent across the three business lines within the Unum US segment. Group life and AD&D results were favorable with operating earnings increasing 7%, driven by premium growth of 3.8% and lower claim incidents as the benefit ratio declined to 70% from 71.6% in the year ago quarter.","In the supplemental and voluntary lines, operating earnings were relatively flat at $82.5 million. Premium income increased by 1%, while risk trends in both lines were improved relative to last year. Net investment income was $3 million lower than last year due to a decrease in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous income, partially offset by growth in the asset base.","Operating income in our group disability business declined to $69.2 million from $78.6 million a year ago. Premium income increased by 2.2% and the benefit ratio improved further down to 82.1% in the third quarter from 82.9% a year ago due to continued strong claim recovery performance, both of which are very encouraging trends.","The headwind in the quarter in this line was net investment income which declined by almost $12 million on a year-over-year comparison. About one third of the decline was attributable to lower miscellaneous income, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter. The other two-thirds of the decline resulted from the slow decline in the portfolio yield in assets over many quarters.","While this interest rate environment creates ongoing pressure, we continue to gradually re-price this business to reflect the current rate environment. So overall, despite the pressure from lower investment income, we could bring it back to a solid quarter for the Unum US segment as operating ROE was in the 13% to 14% range.","Moving to Unum UK, operating earnings were \u00a320.1 million for the third quarter, flat with the year ago quarter and consistent with our expectations for this business. We have tended to experience a negative seasonality in our Group Income Protection line in the third quarter in our Unum UK results, which caused some pressure on earnings relative to the second quarter. Our risk results remain well within our expectations with the third quarter benefit ratio at 70.8% compared to 70.6% in the year ago quarter. Return on equity for our UK business continues in the high teens.","Colonial Life generated another strong quarter at $71.2 million of operating earnings compared to $69 million a year ago. We saw favorable experience across our lines resulting in a benefit ratio of 52.7%, slightly improved from the 53.1% benefit ratio from last year. The underlying profitability of this business remains excellent, producing an operating ROE of 16% for the quarter.","And rounding out the enterprise, the third quarter operating earnings of $26.2 million for the Closed Block was in line with our expectations of a range of $25 million to $30 million per quarter for this segment. Risk results were also generally in line. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for the long-term care line was at 88.5% and was higher than the very favorable experience of the first half of the year which was 82.8%, but within our expected range of 85% to 90%.","And the interest adjusted loss ratio for the Closed Disability Block was 82.3%, improved from the second quarter level of 89.4% but slightly higher than the year ago quarter of 80.6%. As we have said before, these blocks will show volatility from quarter to quarter but this quarter's results were within our expectations.","Net investment income was an important driver of results in this segment, especially relative to the very strong second quarter results, as miscellaneous investment income was $9 million less in third quarter of 2014 than the second quarter. Again, this component of net investment income will be volatile quarter to quarter for the Closed Block segment in showing a negative quarter to quarter sway.","Moving on to our sales and growth trends across the Company, as Tom highlighted in his remarks, we are very pleased with the results we are seeing. In Unum US, total sales increased by 13% for the quarter, and for the first nine months of the year increased by 18% relative to the same period in 2013, which in our view gets us firmly back to a more normalized level of sales after last year's slowdown in the market.","Within our group benefit lines, total sales increased by 21%, with 13% growth in the core market and 57% growth in the large case market during the third quarter. Importantly, 70% of the large case sales are sales to existing customers, giving us a high level of confidence in the pricing of this business.","Voluntary benefit sales were relatively flat this quarter but are up 6% on a year-to-date basis. Along with the strong sales momentum, persistency for our Unum US employee benefit lines is encouraging and has been mostly improving throughout the year. In fact the persistency in the group long-term disability line has improved to 90.2% in the third quarter of 2014 from 87.4% in the year ago quarter. The net result is that Unum US premium income increased 3.4% in the third quarter, our strongest rate of growth in two years.","At Colonial Life we again had a very good sales in the quarter, increasing 13% for the third quarter and 9% for the year to date compared to the same periods in 2013. Results remain encouraging across all of our sales metrics. Core market corporate sales are up 11%, large case corporate sales are up 35%, and public sector sales are up 11% for the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same time period in 2013.","In addition, recruiting results have been strong, up 16% over the prior year, with strong production results out of those new recruits new to the Colonial Life agency system. Persistency remained slightly below year ago levels but premium increased 3.3% for the quarter consistent with our outlook.","And finally in the UK, sales increased for the first time in several quarters growing 15% in local currency as we moved past the re-pricing and repositioning of our group life block. Disability sales contributed to the increase growing at about 8% to \u00a37.1 million and persistency in the UK continues to improve particularly in the disability block which is at 88.4% so far in 2014 compared to 81.9% last year.","So overall we're encouraged with our growth trends and we are also pleased to see the pricing on the business we're selling today. We are continuing to see some evidence of improved top line growth from better employment trends, but is not yet close to what we saw at pre-recession levels.","Now looking at the investment portfolio, the credit quality remains in excellent shape and the challenge of the low interest rate environment remains front and center. As I have indicated throughout my review of our segment results, the primary headwind in the quarter was the low level of miscellaneous investment income, primarily income from [indiscernible]. This amount tends to be very volatile from quarter to quarter and this quarter we had a total of $7 million of miscellaneous net investment income which was $12 million less than the second quarter and $9 million less than the year ago quarter. But beyond this volatility, the low new money yields continue to create incremental pressure on the portfolio yields that back our product lines.","Now looking at capital management, the weighted average risk-based capital ratio for our traditional US life insurance companies remained consistent at approximately 400%, and our holding company cash and marketable securities was $720 million at quarter end. This is all fueled by statutory operating earnings which generated $168 million and are within our range of expectations.","Also we continue to steadily buy back our shares with the capital we are generating. We bought back another $100 million for the quarter which now brings us to $300 million for the year and into the range of our $300 million to $600 million range for the full year.","So wrapping up, I also affirm that our 2014 outlook for growth and operating earnings per share remains in the range of 5% to 10%. I look forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Outlook Meeting which we'll be holding in New York on December 16 and we'll begin discussing our outlook for 2015.","Now let me turn the call back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?","Tom Watjen","Thanks, Rick. Before we move to your questions, I'll close by reiterating that I'm very pleased actually with our overall results for this quarter, including our continued strong sales growth and premium growth, and once again this quarter excellent risk results. These all bode well for our future.","While the current level of interest rates and bond spreads are challenging, we have managed through periods like this before and I am confident we will continue to do so. Our focus hasn't changed. We are continuing to profitably grow our business, to maintain strong margins through our disciplined pricing, underwriting and expense management, and to generate capital which we'll continue to use to support the needs of our business including investing in growth opportunities we see in the market but also continuing to return capital to our shareholders.","Now this completes our prepared remarks, and Dana, let's move to the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Seth Weiss with Bank of American Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","Can you give an update on the difference between your GAAP and stat reserves within the long-term care business?","Tom Watjen","Jack, would you like to take that one?","Jack McGarry","We said previously that the difference between GAAP and stat is over 500 million. It continues to be over 500 million. It gets wider as statutory reserves grow but it's in the normal course of things and it hasn't changed dramatically.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","Okay, great, thanks. And apologies if I missed any updated sales goals guidance but can you comment on your goals for the full year in light of what's been strong growth across the businesses for the first three quarters?","Tom Watjen","Rick, you want to take that?","Rick McKenney","[Indiscernible] update our outlooks. We went back to the last year. I think what I'd tell you is, if you went back to our sales expectations going into the year, Unum US was 7% to 10%, we're handily outpacing that today and we feel very good. I think you would have heard that through the tone of all of our comments, so we can touch more on that. The UK is actually pretty flat year to date, so it's a little bit behind the goals but that's been one of the volatility from our life business, we've sold that, but third quarter results were pretty good and I think bode reasonably well for the fourth quarter.","And lastly, Colonial Life has had great sales this year, up 9% on a year-to-date basis. We went into the year looking at 4% to 7%. So I think that Randy and team there are doing a great job in terms of sales front. So we're not going to update it for the fourth quarter, I think we gave you an indicator for the year, but needless to say I think we go on to the fourth quarter feeling pretty good about what we have accomplished thus far and how we see the year wrapping out.","Tom Watjen","Seth, if I could add something, once we adopted the format a few years ago of having a fairly open transparent sort of set of guidance tools and metrics that we put out there in December, we really haven't updated, I don't think Rick, any of these as we go through the course of the year. We stand by I think that guidance we provide for sales, for premium, for operating earnings and for return on equity, and I think that's kind of been our approach to this.","So I think we don't do the updates as Rick said, not just by sales but by any of the elements of that and we stand by that outlook we provided earlier which we think was pretty comprehensive, it's pretty detailed, and as Rick said, I think if you go through all the measures we put out actually last December, you'll see for many of them we're certainly well within the range if not above the range. But again, I think we have always had a policy of just sticking with that guidance.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","That's fair enough, I appreciate the commentary. It's just fair to say that the initial guidance, it didn't contemplate some sort of slowdown in the fourth quarter, is that right, is that fair enough to say?","Tom Watjen","Look, actually you're talking about sales, actually sales \u2013 I don't think we had any [procedure] (ph) slowdown, I think look at all the business has I think \u2013 again, we're staying with the outlook we presented but as you can see even at this point in the year for the year to date results across many of these, we are certainly leaning very much to the high-end of that guidance if not above that guidance and we see nothing as I said in my comments that gives us any indication that some of the things we have seen with sales growth, premium growth and risk are anomaly. These are things that we have seen to have great momentum in and we think are going to carry into 2015 as well.","Seth Weiss - Bank of American Merrill Lynch","Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","So you're going through your annual review of assumptions in the fourth quarter. Can you help us just think about the potential impact of low interest rates and tighter credit spreads on your long-term care reserves?","Tom Watjen","Maybe we do. Rick, if you don't mind, just give an overall view of interest rate management, because obviously as Rick said in his comments and I did in mine, this interest rate environment, both interest rate and spreads, is not particularly positive for our industry, and so maybe start there and then we can sort of talk about some of the other branches of that?","Rick McKenney","[Indiscernible] into the process, I would tell you that across the Company we go through \u2013 as you started into the question, we do go through our assumptions in a more detailed way in the fourth quarter and that process will happen as normal. You mentioned specifically interest rates across the board and I'll flip it to Jack in a second, but when you think about interest rates in the Company and how we manage them, the majority of our product lines we actually are able to price for them. So that comes into how we look at the overall interest rate management.","One of the lines that also is impacted by interest rates would be our long-term disability line and we think about the reserves around that, and our discount rates we have talked in the past about a margin or at least a differential that we have between what we are getting from our earned yield and our discount rates, last quarter it was 90 basis points and this quarter I think it ticked up a basis point or two to 91 basis points.","So it gives you an indication of how we manage interest rates through those different lines, and I'll flip it over to Jack to talk more specifically about long-term care, but interest rates I think broader management [indiscernible].","Jack McGarry","And so clearly long-term care is very sensitive to the interest rate environment, but I'd remind people that there are other important assumptions within the long-term care business as well. Morbidity and mortality are important, the ability to get rate increases in the future to respond to interest rate pressures are important. And so we are in the midst of a comprehensive review of all the assumptions related to long-term care. We are making good progress on that review. It will be part of our annual normal reserve adequacy studies. And so we expect to have more clarity on that in the fourth quarter as those studies are completed.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Got it. And I guess, and you didn't mention the IDI-Closed Block, is there anything we should be thinking about as it relates to that from an interest rate component?","Tom Watjen","Sure. Let me bring up the IDI piece which is important because when you look at our IDI block it is a significant block from an asset level perspective. The important thing to remember there though is that we are now getting effectively new cash flows. So the cash flows we get in both from premiums, coupons and bond maturities basically goes to pay claims. So when you think of the interest rate environment, we are somewhat indifferent to the interest rate environment around that because there is now new cash flow there to invest.","And then when you talk about the Closed Disability Block, it's also going through a similar process around our reserving processes at year-end, so I don't want to leave that piece of it out, but as Jack said, these are normal processes and we continue to watch interest rates but I think there's a couple of areas where we watch it probably a little bit more closely.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Thanks. And just one last follow-up, because you mentioned the discount rate, I guess how should we be thinking about the decline in interest rate on your new claims discount rate, and to the extent you were to make an adjustment, how much of an impact would that have on your pricing and potential competitiveness within the industry?","Rick McKenney","Sure. When you think about the discount rates of that line and we have adjusted discount rates in the past, and so I'd tell you that on an annual basis 25 basis point move is a $12 million to $13 million impact. And so that's something we always look at, but once again it's highly managed that our assets relative to that discount rate, that's something we do over longer period of time, we have a healthy margin today but we have to be reflective of where we are today as well and manage that through a period of time. So discount rates are something that we always look at in that line. Maybe I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about how we impact that from a pricing perspective.","Michael Q. Simonds","Thanks, Rick. So we would be looking at discount rate, we'd be looking at turns and incidents and severity when we're building new business pricing into a plan. So to give you a sense in 2014, because I think it's indicative of where we sort of look going forward, we are able to put about a quarter of our core group insurance business through the renewal program, about a third of our large case business through thinking as we always do pricing forward for things like aging and interest rate. We placed prices in the high single digits, and as Rick hit in his comments, overall block persistency is just about 90%.","So we feel pretty good about the track record and the current environment to take necessary actions. As we look forward, certainly low interest rates is something that we'll factor into our pricing plans and we'll probably mean a modestly expanded renewal program in '15, but again I think the environment is one where we feel pretty confident going into that.","Tom Watjen","Let me add to that a little bit too. We started a pricing discussion like this on the back of still some strong returns and margins. And so maybe like, kind of like some others in our industry, our margins and our profitability are pretty strong in that line. And so therefore, pricing actions can be more temporary because they are actually only dealing with the interest rate comportment.","The other thing I guess I'd say, Erik, too is when we go through our outlook in December that Rick referred to, we'll have this all contemplated in that outlook actually. And so I think we're obviously thinking as all you are about the fact that it looks like 2015 is going to be a difficult interest rate environment and a difficult spread environment, I think you are going to assume we start to build that in a way we think about the business, and as we share our outlook it's going to be embedded in that.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Kind of asked and answered, I am kind of interested though on expense levels in general and what you're doing there, they did strike me as somewhat high this quarter. Did they strike you as high at all?","Tom Watjen","Rick, you want to touch on that at high level, and maybe we'll go to business units after that actually?","Rick McKenney","I don't think it struck me as high this quarter. I think it's something that as we continue invest in the business, the team here works very hard about balancing those investments with good productivity and what we saw. So you can see a little bit of volatility on a quarter to quarter but it doesn't strike me from an overall \u2013 one of the things I'd factor into that is, as we grow the business and we pay more commissions and compensation, you're going to see more expenses actually flowing through as a result of that. That's a good thing and so we can break some of that out in the future, but we feel fine about our expense there.","Tom Watjen","Michael, anything to that?","Michael Q. Simonds","For you if you ask me that I think, Tom, Rick just hit on one of the key points, it's just as we've seen sales growth accelerate, the acquisition costs associated with bringing that business on is a [indiscernible] pressure there and that's pressure that we are happy to have and deal with. The second is certainly we continue to make some capability investments in the business. So we think particularly about employee pay, those will pay really good dividends as we continue to build scale on that business. And the last one is not new in the quarter, it's a little bit more long term, but as we shift our mix of business and grow our core insurance and voluntary benefits business a bit faster, those tend to be higher OE but lower loss ratio type businesses. So we would see just a little bit of gradual movement there just natural mix.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. Rick, can you touch on the tax rate? It looked like it might have been a little bit low in the quarter.","Rick McKenney","Maybe a few checks. I think we have been right around 30%, Steven. I think if you go year to date, I think it's somewhere around 29.7%, 29.8%. So that's tracking within range of our expectations we would have gone for the year, so not much else to say there.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","Okay. And then one more. I realize it's volatile but the miscellaneous investment income obviously a big deal this quarter, you gave us numbers for 2Q and 3Q last year. Do you know off the top of your head what 1Q might have looked like and maybe 4Q, and that way we will at least see a run rate for the year?","Rick McKenney","Sure. I have that, I can give it to you. 1Q would have been around $13 million, we had $13 million, $14 million, something like that. And then year ago fourth quarter I think was closer to $20 million. So like we said, it's volatile. With $7 million this quarter you will see that volatility coming through. And although it causes a little bit of volatility on the margin, I think when you look in the aggregate, you really have to look to the underlying ROEs of our business lines which continue to be very strong.","Steven Schwartz - Raymond James","No, the risk results were very good. Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Just want to start with the long term care review again in the fourth quarter. If I think back to the 2011 action that you took, part of the assumption change related to a Society of Actuaries study, I think it was lapse rates and persistency, my understanding is the next study from the SOA is not going to come out until 2015, but I believe you're getting some of that information currently. So I guess the question is, do you think that in your review this year you're going to have the updated information to take a good look at the lapse and persistency assumptions?","Tom Watjen","Let me object to this introduction. I think as you know, you have invested heavily in the infrastructure of your business actually. I would say today as we go through an analytical process like this, we're in a very different thought actually, and so obviously maybe we couldn't address any specific question, but let me just remind everybody what we've done to build a lot better sort of database and capability to do the work that we're doing right now actually.","Rick McKenney","","Yes, and we've made a big investment over the past year and a half and the infrastructure supporting these studies, we built a state of the art modeling capability, we have invested in our data structures and our ability to access them to look at our actual experience. And so we are continuing to move forward. We are in a much different place today than we were even two or three years ago. We tend to be more reliant on our own experience, particularly related to things like lapses and persistency where we have a good exposure, we have credible data of our own. And so we will use it.","There has been a recent publishing of preliminary SOA results on continuing some recovery trends. We have looked at that as part of our comprehensive process. We are taking that into account as we finalize our assumptions. But I would tell you it hasn't had a material impact on where we were and where we think we will come out.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Got it, okay. And then I guess for Rick, with interest rates falling again, seems like we're getting into this conversation around discount rates for group disability and comparisons to other companies that have a more formula like approach to establishing the discount rate versus I think what your approach is. So I guess the question is, can you talk about the approach that you take, why you take it? And I think the other issue that comes up a lot is the fact that you use a duration weighted yield in that 90 basis point margin that you gave us. So can you talk about why you use that and what it would be if you didn't use duration weighted yield, what that margin would be?","Rick McKenney","Just to give you a view of just a couple of things taken into account, one is how we think about running the business too and we think about it on a basis where we are actually out in the markets, we believe in stability with our customer base and that would bring price to market and how we talk about that. I think we look at the interest rate management on a similar way where we think about it over the longer term, and you would have seen going back a couple of years ago we've adjusted discount rate a number of times to try and make sure that we keep a good spread between what our assets are yielding and what our discount rates need to be. We'll continue to do that. We're not going to do that quarter by quarter, we do it on a longer-term trajectory and you can continue to see us do that. It all comes back to just our philosophy, how we take that back to the market and introduce it through our pricing models and everything else.","I'd also refer you back to a point in time where we were investing assets at much higher returns than our discount rates, much higher, and that's in the credit crisis when we were actually investing at high yields, we didn't let that flow through earnings, where theoretically we could have, we actually let that build up in our reserve margin. And so it's true on both sides of the equation, when things are harder as they are today and when things are better we maintain a similar philosophy around that.","Second part of your question on the average weighted \u2013 duration weighted yields, that's a non-event for this line. This line matches up actually duration very well. So I can't give you specifically what the duration weighted and non-duration weighted is for this line but when you think about our assets and liabilities, they are actually pretty well matched in this line. We actually as part of our supplement put out a duration weighted yield. The reason is because we have so many different lines, we're trying to balance that to give you a good indicator in our supplement around what that runs like, but in a specific line such as LTD, that's really not a helpful or a differentiable metric around that. So I won't spend too much time on that, Suneet.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay. So bottom line though, that around roughly 90 basis points or 91, I think what you're saying is if we looked at that without the duration factors, it wouldn't be dramatically different?","Rick McKenney","No, it would be the same. And when we actually go out and look at our 90 basis points, we actually look out over time and so we don't want to actually get to a point where we get \u2013 where that comes down too quickly and that's what you've seen us do over the last several years, is actually move on discount rate before we needed to in a sense, not getting down to a margin where we're uncomfortable. We'll continue to do that in the future.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Three quick questions on sales, specifically the non-core sales. So I think you mentioned that 70% of these sales are coming from existing customers. So the questions are; one, is that kind of true across the board, in the UK, Colonial and the US; two, what is driving the sales growth in existing customers; and three, what's driving the growth in the remaining 30% sales growth?","Tom Watjen","Why don't we go around each of the CEOs actually to speak that? Mike, you want to pick that one to start?","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, sure. So we would have seen north of 60% of our sales for Unum US coming through and that's across lines of business and segments that we market under I'd point out, and Rick did as well, in the large end of the market it was actually a higher number than that, it was north of 70% that came from existing clients. So it's a big part of our strategy. To your question of what's driving it, it's investments in new lines of business, so building out our voluntary benefit in particular, it's individual disability line of business and it's capabilities around enrolment and re-enrollment.","So we've got a good level of service delivery to those clients, they know us, know us well, and so our objective is to be there, be consultative and be able to grow over time. That growth we delayed for a couple of reasons. One is, it does tend to come in favorably priced to the new client acquisitions; two, it drives persistency for us. So we're quite confident that as we build out those relationships over time, it drives up our persistency. And I think that's reflected in the results that we're seeing here where any particular line we may need to take great action but we still see the overall relationship holding.","Tom Watjen","Randy, you want to give a little color on the Colonial rebuild?","Randy Horn","You bet, tom. We typically average about 65% or so of our sales in any given quarter being to existing customers. So that has not really changed much over time, and that's just a big part of our business model where we have our agency system going back to service, enforce clients, talk to new hires, introduce new product lines, that type of thing. So that's kind of just normal course of business for us.","That being said, we are seeing very strong growth this year in new accounts sales. We were up over 20% in the third quarter, and I think that's a matter of the market conditions improving. Again we have implemented some new products here and continue to grow our agency system. So very good sales results across the board, but again a big part of our model is to keep going back and seeing existing customers and generating increasing sales growth on that side of it. So it's about a 65-35 split for us.","Tom Watjen","Peter, you want to touch on the UK briefly?","Peter O\u2019Donnell","Thanks, Tom. So sales in the third quarter were good but there was some timing switches between quarter two and quarter three. So when I look at year-to-date, as Rick said, we're sort of pretty much in line with last year. If you look at our GIP sales though, they were up about 3% which is a nice bit of growth there, and obviously our persistency is pretty good there. About one third of our sales comes through existing customers and that's pretty much a standard metric for us if you look on quarter on quarter or year to date, it's around about one-third of our sales to existing customers.","Tom Watjen","Did we touch the things, the issue?","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","Just had a question on the UK business, maybe if you could talk about market conditions there and your success in re-pricing the group life block? And then also related to that, on the reinsurance contract, do you increase your redemption this year and given that the margins there have been stabilizing should we expect you to recapture more or increase retention further in 2015?","Tom Watjen","Peter, you want to pick up on the market condition?","Peter O\u2019Donnell","So the market conditions in the UK, so we have been very successful at re-rating the block and feel very good about the business that's in force now. We still have what I would call sort of small rate increases to put through in some schemes, but I would put that into the business as usual. We are also able to be opportunistic at times where we see schemes that come to market where the competition isn't chasing volume where we can write those at reasonable margin. So you will see group life I think be volatile quarter on quarter as we pick and choose the schemes that we want to play on. So that would be the sort of overall perspective. What was the second question, sorry Jimmy?","Jimmy Bhullar - J.P. Morgan","Just on the reinsurance contract, you increased your redemption this year, do you expect to do or increase it further next year given that margins have been stabilizing?","Peter O\u2019Donnell","So we're very happy with the reinsurance contracts the way it's performed. So it's exactly what we would have wanted it to do over the past two years. Really the question comes as an economic decision for us and we are right to market at the moment, we are looking at the prices, and I will discuss that with group and the Board and say, look what's the deal on the table, and depending on how those economics look, that will drive that decision. So we will be able to update you on that I think in December when we come with our overall view of 2015.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Colin Devine of Jefferies.","Colin Devine - Jefferies","I've got three ones. Just first to clarify on the core large case, there hasn't been really any fundamental change in the strategy that Unum in any of its regions is going to become more aggressive in the large case market?","Tom Watjen","Mike, you want to take that one?","Michael Q. Simonds","Sure. So actually I think Peter [indiscernible] up well. Where we see opportunities to write new clients in the [indiscernible] market here in the US, we will take advantage of it. If you looked back over six quarters, you'd see a fair amount of volatility up and down. We've put together a couple of good sales quarters here, but I would expect some volatility looking forward. I think to the heart of your question though, if you look at group sales in total for Unum US, you'd see that over three quarters of all our sales were in the core market. So while the variance was a little bit different here in the pure third quarter, we still are looking to grow the core at a faster rate.","Rick McKenney","Maybe I think I'd add to that actually, I think Mike, to the efforts of you and your team, we've actually got a very strong margin on our large case block now actually. So there's been quite a bit of work leading up to the last several years in terms of pruning the block. The other thing is again I think you used the statistic about 80% of our large case business was NBOC which we'll maybe speak a little bit to those two.","Michael Q. Simonds","Yes, so most of the growth we are getting is through expansion of the client relationship, and that's helped us along with our disciplined underwriting actually to get to strong and consistent risk returns out of that large case business. And so we're confident that we can really [grow with our] (ph) market rate, but again it's going to be opportunistic on the new sales front.","Colin Devine - Jefferies","With respect to IDI on the Closed Block, persistency seems to finally be trending down a little over last couple of years. What sort of [indiscernible] first, is that [indiscernible] just really been an aberration that we're seeing get a little weaker, we are finally seeing that block start to run off? And then I've got a final one on capital.","Jack McGarry","Persistency is an interesting term. Actually what's happening is as the block ages, people are retiring and [indiscernible] so they are no longer working, and we think that's going to continue to happen, that's been increasing pretty steadily over time, it will continue to increase as the block ages. So we think it's just part of the consistent maturation and runoff of the block.","Colin Devine - Jefferies","Okay. And then the final one with respect to capital management, clearly the Company is not growing exceedingly fast here, the core business lines are producing ROE, so if they don't lead the industry or is as good as it gets, Tom, can you talk about the dividend policy? I know the buybacks are fine but I think the other part of the payout ratio, it would seem to me you could support a payout ratio probably double the level that you are currently distributing?","Tom Watjen","Let me introduce it, Colin, then maybe I'll ask Rick to pick it up. I think as you know, our strategy on capital management has always been to have a sort of a two-pronged approach to it. Part of it is actually buybacks, part of it is actually dividend increases. I guess I've [indiscernible] by the point but I think that's always going to be our view as both of those are going to continue to contribute to our return of capital strategy to shareholders. I do think, Rick, it's safe to say that dividend has been an important piece to the puzzle, we have been continuing to grow it, but maybe you want to embellish a little bit.","Rick McKenney","Colin, I think the way you're looking at it is right and we look at it the same day which is our dividend policy what you would've seen the last several years, we have increased that payout ratio because we can support a higher payout ratio. And so we've seen that grow at double digits over the last five years. And so we'll continue to have that be an important part of the strategy.","And the balancing item with that is as we look at the growth and the investment we want to have, I hear you on the growth front but actually as we look at the core operations, premiums are up 4%, we're feeling better about that, I'd like to put more capital there overall, and then as we don't see use for that capital on those two fronts or a throw in the M&A market as well, then we'll buy back shares and you saw us do that this quarter and that's been our ammo for the last several years and I think that will continue.","But I don't want to minimize the fact that we do see an increasing payout ratio on our dividends to be important as it has been over last five years and going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","First question, and I realize you are in the process, so there's not a lot you could say on it, but for the year-end review, I believe what I've heard you say over time is that expect this to be GAAP only, should not have a statutory impact. Is that still the right way to think about it?","Tom Watjen","Jack?","Jack McGarry","I don't think we've necessarily said GAAP only. We certainly would expect to the extent something happened it would be more of a GAAP event than a statutory event. We talked about earlier in the call, the difference between our statutory reserve and GAAP reserves and statutory reserves are considerably more conservative. Probably the note to that would be First Unum and some of their owners statutory requirements would be the only adjunct I would add to that statement.","Tom Watjen","And Tom, [indiscernible] First Unum is our New York subsidiary.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Yes, that's right. Okay, and then next question is, in some prior periods when rates have gotten pretty low, I know you all have harvested more liquidity in certain quarters and that's created some short-term NII pressure. I'm just wondering is that partly what we're seeing here as well right now?","Rick McKenney","So I think when you think about the overall interest rate environment, I'm not sure harvesting liquidity, but when you think about where we've been able to invest and things like that, they've been in tougher spots. So we've gone into some higher rated assets over that period of time, we've sat on some cash through some periods of time until we see the right investments out there. So that is part of what you're seeing from a net investment income perspective. And I think it just comes back to the choices that we have to invest in and where we've been able to in previous years find asset categories we like that maybe were out of flavor and we were able to get some good yields, that's been a much harder trend this year because most assets are in an overbid situation and that's just the reality of this year. So I'm not sure if it's as much liquidity, it's probably a little bit of that, I think it's just more that it's harder to find places to put money to work.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Rick, specific follow-up to that, so in the last few quarters here have you been investing in more short-term securities at present or has that not been the case, I just want to be clear?","Rick McKenney","Not materially, I'd say that's not the case, Tom. I would talk about higher-rated securities which can have a net investment income impact but we're looking at the relative value, and so that's all been part of this pressure that we're seeing from an overall perspective.","Tom Watjen","And [indiscernible] buying a lot of short assets.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Got you. And then last question just as a follow-up to Suneet's just on the duration adjusted yield, a little more just to understand how you think about this philosophically, so in the quarter duration adjusted yield went to 6.19%. If I look at cash yield or nominal bond portfolio yield, it's actually all the way down to 4.71%. So that's almost 150 basis point spread. Which one matters to you really? I know you have in the supplement this duration adjusted yield, but the 4.71% is the one that's actually flowing through the P&L. So anyway, can you talk through like why one matters or the other one doesn't to you?","Rick McKenney","I think that the duration weighted yield across the portfolio is an indicator in aggregate and the best way to represent what's going on across the Company. The calculation you're doing in terms of the shorter-term perspective of that, that's not really meaningful to me because we actually run it on a line by line basis, right. So whether I'm getting a higher yield than that for long-term care or lower yields from that backing some of our shorter lines, that's how we manage it. It's really a product by product perspective and it's hard to give you that in one metric. So those two metrics you have out there are right and the trend lines on those if you follow them would be similar, but we do manage this on a line by line, product line by product line basis.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","So I have a question about US traditional sort of group insurance sales, and I guess the question is sort of this way, you're not the first to report earnings results this quarter, there's been some that have preceded you, I recognize they don't represent the entire group insurance industry. However, it's just about everybody is demonstrating pretty strong sales growth, [indiscernible] talking about strong sales growth, smaller end of the quarter StanCorp, and just about everywhere in between with maybe one or two small exceptions. But the overall market certainly can't be growing at this kind of pace given what we're seeing economically, lack of employment growth or at least slow employment growth. I guess my question for you is this, who's losing the share? I'm not asking you to name names, just in general like how is this \u2013 it's so significant that it seems very stark?","Tom Watjen","Mike, just give a little more color again what you're seeing in the market and how we're competing actually in the market?","Michael Q. Simonds","I'd say generally, John, we see a mix really across the board but certainly there are some players in the market that are re-pricing their business. We know that the industry return on equity, I think it came up to one of the questions earlier, is somewhere in the single digits, and so there's work to be done in terms of pricing. So there are actually a few carriers out there where their earned premium is down and they are shutting some business. That business shows up as new sales in other places. So there's a little bit of churn within. I think it's the combination of the economy improving and some market expansion paired with some carriers that need to do some re-pricing which is generating some churn, that spits out the total industry sales numbers.","So the way we sort of look at it is we're comfortable with the returns we're generating in the business, we're sticking with our underwriting standards, and we feel good about having that 90% persistency. So we are not feeding a lot of the churn back into the market, but I think it's the sum, the total of the two that gets you to the sales number.","Rick McKenney","And I think, John, we are also benefiting from our investment in our service infrastructure. So I think the quality of our relationships, I'd say Mike, are pretty much at all time high in terms of customer satisfaction and that obviously plays well into being able to expand lines of coverage and do more business with existing clients.","The other thing I think we benefit from is our sense of stability. I think as we talk about our results this quarter and talk about the outlook as we get to the December meeting for 2015, there's not a huge change in focus actually, and this has been the case for the last five or six years. So that consistency, that stability, those are the things that I think play very well I think, Mike, in terms of how we come to market now too whereas not everybody has that same set of circumstances.","Tom Watjen","I was just going to interject. That seems like a pretty good point because there are some who are going through some pretty significant change.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Just one more question following up on idea of miscellaneous investment income and bond call prepayments, I guess the question I'd ask is this way, to the extent that we see rising rates it seems to me in miscellaneous investment income would stay down or start trending down, obviously on the other side of the equation though you get the opportunity to invest at highly yields which is terrific, but I guess I'm thinking more about just overall portfolio size, I mean how long do you think bond call prepayments can persist? It seems to me there will be a limit to it given once a bond is called it can't be called again.","Rick McKenney","Sure, maybe I'll give you some comments on that, John. I have watched this cycle for the last decade and so they do ebb and flow in terms of cycles that they go through. One of the things that I would say is true of our prepayments is while some of them are structural in nature, so it's not just somebody taking advantage of a low interest rate environment, so we have private placements that have structures within them fees, structures within them that happen as a result of M&A as an example and people retire debt.","So interest rate is not the only reason that there is restructuring in these portfolio, but as we said you would see volatility, we've seen a lot of consistency as you look over the last three plus years but that's not to say that that will continue on that pace forever and it's something we'll call out to you as we see it. But as I've seen the cycles come and go, it's I think that's something you will see across the industry and the portfolio but I don't want to remove the fact that some of it is structural in how we invest and those will not go away.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. And then last one maybe just big picture, Tom. M&A opportunities out there, we have heard now for a very long time everybody wants to own it, everybody wants a group insurance business, nobody wants to give it up. Is that still the same thing that you are continuing to see or do you think there will be an opportunity for Unum to maybe bolt-on something over the course of the next 12 or 24 months?","Tom Watjen","It seems like it is a continuation of the theme of what you just said. There's a lot of people who want to be in the business and increase their scale and there doesn't seem to be many who want to part with their business. But as we said earlier, there's an awful lot of challenges for some carriers as they go through sort of trying to sort out how do you actually effectively do this business. It's one thing to say you want to be in it, but can you actually manage the business both operationally and financially.","And so, I don't think, Rick, we're assuming any M&A activity but we're certainly staying very close to the marketplace. It feels like it's going to be more that there's not as more buyers than sellers, but we're going to continue hanging around the rim to use the basketball term. But I think the other side of that is we don't need to do M&A to fulfil some of the objectives that we have laid out.","So if it happens, it's great, we do have the financial and operational resources to do things, we are also very, very careful to stay within the framework of the things we know well, and again we don't have to do it for us to achieve some of the objectives that we've laid out, but there's always hope.","John Nadel - Sterne Agee","Okay. And I guess fair to say too that maybe some of the higher level of sales is effectively a small version of M&A as some of these companies are maybe struggling and losing business?","Tom Watjen","Absolutely. And again, I think certainly again, if there is an M&A opportunity, we want to take a look at it, but there's another way also that sees on some of these opportunities which is just in the marketplace, and I think [indiscernible] several of our businesses.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR","I want to just dig into sales a little bit more and kind of I guess compare and contrast with some competitors who have had weaker sales this quarter. So kind of thinking of AFLAC and also CNO and Torchmark, a little bit different products, different distributions, but the sense I'm getting from them is a lot of challenges, and so this is really geared towards Colonial, a lot of challenges from distraction from ACA, kind of a better economy means it's harder for them to recruit, and I'm not sure if your independent contractor model shields you from that, hearing there's a lot of competition even for people who are selling life and supplemental health among new entrants into those markets. So I guess I was just kind of curious for more kind of understanding your texture on how you're getting better sales numbers as all these other folks are kind of struggling given all the items I mentioned?","Tom Watjen","Yes, Randy, we're always \u2013 as you are alluding to, we're cautious, not to speak to specific competitors, but maybe Randy, you could talk about lots of things we've been doing too because it's really more about I think the things that we've been doing that have been behind the results that you have seen from Colonial and maybe to touch on some of those things in response to Randy's question.","Randy Horn","Happy to. I think it really boils down for us to just consistency and focus, and primarily having a focus on our agency distribution system, and this is the channel that we go to market with. We work through that channel on both the direct sales side and the smaller end of the market and then work with them in terms of partnering with brokers as they go upmarket, and we think very importantly, Randy, this helps us avoid any channel conflict.","So we've not had to deal with any ups and downs and stresses and strains about distribution. It's just been a very singular approach for us and I think that's worked well. From there it's just really a sound execution of the fundamentals in that agency system. Our recruiting continues to be very strong, we're up about 16% with new agent recruits here in 2014, and I think more importantly we're seeing the production from those new recruits very strong, up over 40%.","So we're very encouraged there, we continue to improve the effectiveness of our training programs and our overall sales support, and again that's led to a strong growth in the number of producing agents and the number of producing sales units that we have out in the field. So, all of that has just led to increasing activity levels, more appointments and a strong increase in the number of closed cases.","As far as the market environment, Randy, we are seeing a gradual improvement in the economy. Still some pressure in terms of new hires in that small end of the market, but other than that we are seeing more and more employers opening up to changes in their benefit programs, introducing voluntary benefits. Most of them are moving beyond the Affordable Care Act implementation and in fact we're seeing strong growth in a number of our products that very much complement those changes to major medical programs, strong sales of critical illness for example in our accident products.","So all of this has really led to very broad-based growth in sales force here in 2014, both on new and existing accounts. In all of our market segments we're seeing a very strong double-digit growth. So we're very optimistic about the fundamentals of our business and we have a very optimistic sales outlook. So hopefully that answers it for you, Randy.","Randy Binner - FBR","Yes, it's certainly helpful. I guess the one follow-up would be, I mean so 16% on new agent recruits, that's also kind of a best in class number, at least among these publicly traded guys, have you changed the way you recruit at all including I mean like covering their expenses or sign-on bonuses or do you have a new IT systems or anything that's kind of changed, or is it all just status quo as far as the recruiting process goes?","Randy Horn","I'd put it in the fine-tuning category, Randy. We're always tweaking a little bit around the edges in terms of new approaches and how we connect digitally as well as face-to-face, that type of thing, but in terms of financing or different commission rates or something like that really no significant changes, it's just staying focused on it. We of course have established goals for all of our sales managers to hit when it comes to recruiting, and then I think most importantly then providing a great opportunity with good training and the opportunity to make a great living, and I think the word spreads rapidly out in the marketplace.","Rick McKenney","If I could just add too, I think a little bit of what, as I answered to John's earlier question too, just the stability and consistency of the things we do actually is incredibly important in the marketplace and it's also important to Colonial's business. People know what we stand for, they know how we value the distribution system and obviously we continue to innovate and add new things as we go through time, and obviously for those who haven't seen it the sponsorship at Colonial with Shark Tank for example is a good example of those kind of things where we are stepping out. But still I think that stability and consistency is one of those things where I think our organization is certainly domestically is being rewarded for.","Tom Watjen","I think we're bumping up against the hour here. I know people have some other things to move to. So let me just say, thank you for taking the time to join us this morning and we look forward to seeing many of you hopefully in our mid-December Outlook Meeting in New York, and operators will conclude our third quarter operating earnings call.","Operator","Thank you.

The third quarter of 2018 was both a strong and pivotal quarter for the company. Earlier in the quarter we released the results of our long-term care review, which have now been incorporated in our financial results. ","More importantly, our core businesses continue to deliver strong premium growth and strong margins. In our market of employee benefits, the operating environment remains very good for us as the economy continues to perform well. A tighter labor market means full employment and wage inflation, both of which continue to provide more potential customers and increase the need for the financial protections that we provide. A stronger economy may also see higher interest rates, which is a real plus for our business. Overall, it was a good quarter and we are building momentum moving forward.","As I mentioned in the third quarter results we reported yesterday afternoon, included the impact of the reserve addition to our long-term care business that we pre-announced back in mid-September. There were no material changes from that review. Adjusting for that, as well as for net realized investment gain in the quarter, our adjusted after tax operating earnings were just over $300 million, an increase of 22% over the year ago quarter. Adjusted operating earnings per share were a $1.37 in the third quarter, an increase of just under 26%, compared to the third quarter of last year\u2019s $1.09.","Well, we will continue to address the long-term care block and update you on its trends as they evolve over time. We are very focused on the positive, underlying trends we are seeing in our core business operations and the consistent financial results they're generating. Here are a few points I'd like to highlight on the performance this quarter. First, premium growth for our core business segments remains favorable, increasing 6% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. This growth is being generated by a number of encouraging trends, including strong persistency, in our Unum US business, excellent sales momentum in Colonial Life, and disciplined management of rate increases on in-force business in Unum UK.","Next, we continue to see generally consistent benefits experience across the core business segments, particularly in our Unum US and Colonial Life business lines. Benefits experienced at our UK business has been more volatile recently, but our disciplined approach to underwriting and pricing in our key U.S. and UK business segments continue to generate consistent results.","We also continue to see stable to improving expense ratios for the business segments through the active management of expenses and the benefits of investments that we have made. And continue to make \u2013 to improve the customer experience.","With these strong operating trends, we continue to see excellent profit margins and returns for our core segments, which in turn drive significant financial flexibility for the company. This financial flexibility allows us to invest in the growth of our business, both organically and through the expansion of our footprint, such as with Pramerica \u017bycie, acquisition that we closed in early October. This financial flexibility also enables us to effectively manage the legacy long-term care block with reserve in capital updates as appropriate, as well as investing in the internal resources and talent to effectively manage this complex block.","Finally, our financial flexibility allows us to return capital to shareholders approximately $5.8 billion since 2007 through shareholder dividends and share repurchases. And while we were not in the market in third quarter repurchasing shares as we completed the long-term care reserve analysis, we will resume that activity with the completion of our third quarter reporting","It has been an active and eventful quarter for our company in many ways. And a quarter that I believe illustrates the strength of our franchise. Our management team is striving to ensure that LTC does not overshadow our core business segments and a franchise that it serves a growing need in our society and delivers real value to our shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll ask Jack to cover the details of the third quarter results. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. As you saw in our earnings release yesterday afternoon, we reported a loss for the third quarter of 2018 of $284.7 million or a $1.30 per diluted common share. This loss included the reserve charge for long-term care, which totaled $593.1 million or $2.71 per diluted common share and was consistent with the estimate of $590 million we pre-announced back on September 18.","In addition, we reported a net after-tax realized investment gain on our investment portfolio of $7.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share in the third quarter. Adjusting for these items, after tax adjusted operating income was $300.6 million or $1.37 per diluted common share. While third quarter results were consistent with our strong recent trends, there were some unusual items that affected net investment income, the tax rate and corporate expenses, which I'll explain further in my remarks.","Jumping into our operating results for the third quarter, I'll begin with Unum US, where it was another very good quarter with positive trends in premium income, very good persistency and stable benefit ratios across our major business lines. Within Unum US, adjusted operating income for group disability increased by 3.3% to $93.0 million in the third quarter.","We saw a good top line growth, and improved benefits experience and also higher miscellaneous investment income. Miscellaneous investment income can be volatile from quarter-to-quarter, and in the absence of this favorable volatility, group disability income would have been in the mid-$80 million range this quarter. Benefits experience for group disability, continues to perform well with the benefit ratio improving slightly to 76.3% in the third quarter, compared to 76.7% in the year ago quarter, due primarily to lower claims incidence and favorable claim recovery experience in the group long-term disability line, which was offset by higher claims incidence in the group short-term disability line.","The group life and AD&D line had a strong third quarter, with adjusted operating income of $64 million, an increase of 6.5% from the year ago quarter. Premium income increased 7.8%, driven primarily by prior period sales growth and improved persistency, which increased in the group product line to 91.2% for 2018 year-to-date, compared to 87.7% last year. The benefit ratio was slightly higher at 71.8% in the third quarter, compared to 71.4% in the year ago quarter, due primarily to higher claims incidence.","The supplemental and voluntary lines generated excellent results, with adjusted operating income increasing by 5.2% to $113.9 million in the third quarter. Premium income increased 7.1% for the third quarter due primarily to higher sales, including growth generated by the expansion of our dental and vision product line. Benefits experience was very favorable in the third quarter for the voluntary benefits in dental and vision lines, while the individual disability line experienced higher claims incidence and higher average size of new claims. All in all, the supplemental and voluntary lines continue to produce strong levels of income for the company.","Sales for Unum US in the third quarter declined by 5.6% primarily driven by lower sales in the group disability and life lines. We continue to see positive momentum in the voluntary benefits and dental and vision product lines, but market conditions seem competitive to us in the core market segments, where we intend to remain disciplined with our pricing. Persistency remains very favorable within Unum US, with persistency for the group lines combined increasing to 90.6% for the first three quarters of 2018, compared to 88.2% last year.","Moving to Unum UK, we continue to see a difficult business and economic environment, creating uncertainty in the marketplace. As a result, adjusted operating income remained relatively flat at \u00a320 million for the third quarter of 2018, compared to \u00a320.2 million in the year ago quarter. Premium income was stronger this quarter, increasing 5.6% on a local currency basis generated largely by improved persistency, rate increases on the group long-term disability block and growth in the in-force business. The Unum UK benefit ratio was 74.2% for the third quarter of 2018, compared to 74.9% last year, driven primarily by favorable claims resolutions in the group long-term disability line, possibly offset by unfavorable claims activity in the group and supplemental lines of business.","Unum UK sales for the third quarter increased by 2.4% year-over-year, driven by higher sales in the group long-term disability and supplemental lines, which offset lower sales and group life. The improvement in persistency from 86.4% in the first three quarters of 2017 to 87.7% in the first three quarters of 2018 is particularly encouraging given the level of rate increases we put through the block.","Colonial Life again, produced strong results with adjusted operating income in the third quarter of $84.2 million, an increase of 3.1% from the year ago quarter. Premium growth remains steady, increasing by 5.6% in the quarter. Benefits experience improved slightly to 51.5% in the third quarter, compared to 51.8% in the year ago quarter, primarily due to favorable experience in the life product line. Sales at Colonial Life continued to accelerate increasing to 13% in the third quarter, compared to the year ago quarter. The introduction of the dental product earlier this year is contributing to this growth with sales at $7.5 million in the third quarter. In addition to the strong dental rollout, sales from other product lines also showed strong year-over-year growth.","Moving to the Closed Block, we reported a loss before income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses of $718.6 million for the third quarter, which includes the increase to long-term care reserves of $750.8 million on a before tax basis. Excluding this reserve increase, adjusted operating income totaled $32.2 million in the third quarter of 2018, compared to $26.6 million in the year ago quarter. In the individual disability line, the interest adjusted loss ratio improved to 80.5% in the third quarter, compared to 82.4% in the year ago quarter, due primarily to improved mortality experience. The results of the long-term care business lines of the third quarter reflect the new reserve assumptions we discussed in our presentation on September 18.","On this new reserve basis the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 87.5% in the third quarter, which is in line with the range we outlined for yield [ph] of 85% to 90%. The interest adjusted benefit ratio in the year ago quarter was 93.3%, but it's not \u2013 but it's not comparable given the reserve basis change.","The statutory impact of the long-term care reserve increase that we recorded in the third quarter was also in line with the expectations we've previously disclosed. Of the approximately $200 million impact we estimated, our total statutory results for the third quarter included $142 million of increased disabled life reserves for our long-term care blocks including fair wind. The $200 million projection includes asset adequacy testing reserves related to the long-term care block, which will be finalized in the fourth quarter. But the total is anticipated to be in line with the $200 million we communicated to you in September.","Looking at the Corporate segment, the adjusted operating loss was higher in the third quarter at $47.1 million compared to a loss of $36.2 million in the year ago quarter. The higher loss ratio in the quarter was primarily driven by expenses related to Poland acquisition and restructuring costs that totaled approximately $8 million before tax.","As a final comment on our operating results in the quarter, the tax rate this quarter was 17.9%, adjusted for the long-term care reserve charge and net realized investment gains. This is lower than the tax rates of the first and second quarters of this year, which were 19.9% and 19.5% respectively. The lower tax rate this quarter was primarily the result of updates to our 2017 tax filing, which added a net benefit of $6.1 million to the GAAP after tax income for the third quarter. We anticipate the fourth quarter tax rate will be in our expected range of 19% to 20%.","Statutory earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies remain at very good levels and adequately support our capital plans. For the third quarter, statutory after tax operating earnings totaled $253 million, compared to $187 million in the year ago quarter. For the first three quarters of 2018 statutory after tax operating earnings totaled $745 million.","We are encouraged by the rise in interest rates in the corresponding higher new money yields we realized in the third quarter. In the third quarter we easily exceeded the 5.5% new money yield assumption for our long-term care business. As a reminder, our new reserve assumptions set includes a 5.5% new money yield assumption through 2021.","For our other US businesses new money yields are higher, but remain below our portfolio yields so we can expect to continue to see pressure on the portfolio yield in overall net investment income. Importantly, the relationship between our new money yields and new claimed discount rates continue to provide a healthy margin. Higher interest rates are very beneficial to our business, especially as we have very little disintermediation risk in our liabilities.","The capital position of the company remained strong. At the end of the third quarter, the risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. traditional life insurance companies remained at approximately 385%. With the implementation of RBC formula changes from tax reform at year end 2018, we anticipate ending the year with RBC in the range of 360% to 370% under the new formula.","Cash in our holding companies totaled $973 million at the end of the third quarter. As we move towards the year end that cash balance will decline with the funding of Pramerica \u017bycie acquisition, expected cash contributions for Fairwind in First Unum in the resumption of share repurchases. We will resume our $100 million of quarterly rate in the fourth quarter and I anticipate making progress on the $100 million we did not buy back in the third quarter. We'll have an update on these metrics at our outlook meeting in December and feel very comfortable with where they're trending.","I'll conclude my comments this morning by reiterating our expectation of growth and adjusted operating income per share in the 17% to 23% range for the year. Though given our performance for the first three quarters of 2018, we expect to be towards the upper end of this range. As a reminder, the base of adjusted operating earnings from 2017 is $4.24 per share and the projection for 2018 excludes the reserve increase for long-term care.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Jack. All in all, it was an eventful quarter for the company. We're encouraged by the operating trends we\u2019re producing in our core businesses. And we're also pleased to have completed the LTC reserve analysis. We look forward to the growth of our core operations for the remainder of the year and as we move into 2019.","We'll now move to your questions. I'll ask the operator to begin the Q&A Session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead sir. Your line is open. ","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the US group dynamics in terms of competition, persistency, and then also kind of any early look you can provide us on January 1 renewal trends.","Rick McKenney","Great, thanks Brian. I'll turn over to Mike for his comments. Go ahead Mike.","Mike Simonds","Good morning Ryan.","Ryan Krueger","Good morning.","Mike Simonds","I\u2019d say \u2013 excuse me, I'd say we've got a competitive but rational market we've gone through stretches of time where you\u2019d have one or two carriers that would be aggressively trying to take share. I would say that's not necessarily the case right now. But I'd say in general the industry feels pretty good about where margins are and so there's less \u2013 but there\u2019s less business moving and you\u2019d see that in our group sales numbers. 3Q is not typically a big sales quarter for us any way, but we did see some declines in group disability and group life insurance.","Yeah that was I\u2019d highlight offset to a degree by continued strong growth in the sub-fall segment VB, our voluntary benefits sales were up about 6%. And encouraging to see continued strong adoption of our dental and vision product of about 27%. So we'll continue to keep an eye on it, most importantly for us is despite it being a difficult new client acquisition market, it's proving to be a market where we're holding onto customers. I think persistency is up a couple of points over the prior year. That's really helping fuel a good, strong, earned premium growth that both Rick and Jack a highlighted.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And any insight you can provide on January 1 renewal? ","Mike Simonds","Yes I mean, I think, if you look up market larger cases, decisions have largely been made and we feel real good that the persistency trends that we've seen shown up in the numbers are likely to continue as we head into next year. Some decisions are still to be made in the core market. So that's part of the font of fourth quarter. But in general I wouldn't see anything other than pretty solid and sustained levels of persistency.","Ryan it also might be worth noting, I mean it's tough, when we look at the new sale, it\u2019s a tough comp to the prior year. So in 3Q, I think, our group sales were up about 29% and a similar almost 30% increase in 4Q of last year. So the environment we had last year was one that was conducive for us winning some new client business and doing it at our targeted pricing levels. I'd say we\u2019re looking at a more difficult comparison this year.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then I just had one on Unum US expenses. The expense ratio was 19.9% it had been running more in the 20.5% to 21% range. Can you give us some more color there and if there were any material timing considerations that impacted the quarter?","Mike Simonds","Yeah, I did say it was a kind of equal weighting between a little bit of timing of expenses that we would expect to kind of normalize as we go into the 4Q. And then what I'd say is it\u2019s kind of been a longer term trend over the last really three years or so where we've seen pretty gradual improvement in that expense ratio as we've modernized some of our \u2013 some of our processes and put some new technology. We're starting to see some of the benefits of that come through a bit. That's a slower burn.","Rick McKenney","Ryan Id remind you that the 6% premium growth helps as well.","Ryan Krueger","Great, thanks. ","Mike Simonds","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead sir your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. So I had a question first on just the free cash flow. I think you were adding about $200 million to stat reserves this year. But it seems like from your comments that it shouldn't really affect your ability or your free cash flow that's available for buybacks and dividends. So is that the case? And why is it that it's not \u2013 it's not being reduced next year because of the stat reserve addition?","Rick McKenney","Ryan\u2026","Jack McGarry","It\u2019s Jimmy.","Rick McKenney","Jimmy, I'm sorry. So it's not that it doesn't affect \u2013 it doesn't affect free cash flow, it\u2019s that we built it into our plans and we expect to given the strength of our balance sheet going into this, that we\u2019ll be able to cover those uses and continue to repurchase shares.","Jack McGarry","And then if you think about the \u2013 yes Jimmy I\u2019d just add to that, the free cash flow, I mean, what\u2019s generated from the companies is still a very, very strong from a statutory perspective. And we look at the reserve charge we went through, we see that more as a funding need, onetime in nature, similar to other things that we're doing. But free cash flow, the underlying free cash flow of the enterprise still remains very strong.","Jimmy Bhullar","And as you go beyond 2019, like into 2020, would you assume that you would have more flexibility than you've had in the past, assuming that there's no such charge or no stat reserve addition or is some of like sort of the 2019 free cash flow is something that is being compensated by 2018 and 2020 to some extent?","Jack McGarry","We're going to have a strong free cash flow in 2019. You've seen the statutory earnings in 2018, which is the driver of 19 dividends from our subsidiaries. I'd remind you that there's a lot changing in the capital world as well. We have the implementation of the RBC factors that due to tax reform that will happen in 2018, we have the C1 factors getting updated in 2019. And so they continue to see things to work through, but we feel very comfortable with where we are, we feel very comfortable in our ability to meet those obligations. I would say I'd be looking probably more than 2020 and 2021 for when we really see the benefit, when we get through kind of those changes in capital formulas and we\u2019ll really see the benefits of tax reform kicking in.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just lastly, on the benefits ratio in the U.S. disability business, it's improved each of the last several years. How do you think \u2013 and it seems like it'll be better this year than it was last year. How do you think about that improvement continuing given sort of the competitive environment and the economic backdrop?","Mike Simonds","Thanks. I\u2019ll take that one. It\u2019s Mike. Excuse me. Yes so I'd say we were right about in line with where our expectations are. And so that's going to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. I would say probably the one thing as we sort of look forward, we saw a bit of benefits ratio pressure in a pretty defined segment on the short-term disability side. And that's something that we're addressing through that renewal program. It's not hugely consequential, but that is something that we\u2019ll provide a little bit of improvement to the segment overall.","Tom White","Thanks, Jimmy.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Please go ahead sir.","Mark Hughes","Yes good morning. Thank you. You talked about the wage inflation and full employment helping your core business. So you talked about natural growth in the past. Are you seeing that actually flow through your underlying growth?","Rick McKenney","Yes, we actually, when you think about the natural growth that you talked about in the past comes from two different things that they're coming through, one is just as employment improves over time which we have seen we you look too pretty full employment economy. We haven't always felt the benefits of the swings around that just given who we insure at the employee base whether it's part time workers, other areas of the economy we don't insure. But we certainly have felt that over a period of time.","The thing that we're looking at now is wage inflation. You're starting to see that in our lines that we cover as well and so we'll look to have that be a lift. But the way you can think about it Mark is we've seen probably benefit if you look over the last four, five years, but probably 1% addition to our premium growth that we've seen. So out of 6%, 1% is probably coming from an economic lift. If wage inflation really starts to kick in, in our sectors, then we could see more. But that's something we'll look forward to.","Mark Hughes","And then on the persistency side, you touched on this. But it seems strange that your sales are a little slower, granted you have a tough comp. But at the same time your persistency is quite good. Do you think that's based on your internal initiatives or is it just more broadly business isn\u2019t moving quite as much?","Mike Simonds","Yes, it\u2019s Mike. I can take that. I think it is a bit more of the latter. I mean, I think, there's less movement in the markets. The number of proposals that we're seeing coming through on the brokerage side is down year-over-year. So that's a piece of it. But for us taking care of existing clients is job one. So almost all of the investments we make in capabilities we do it with an eye towards improving the experience that we're delivering there. A lot of our growth has come by expanding the number of union benefits that are offered by each of our clients and with each line that we extend we see an incremental improvement and stickiness in that relationship.","So those are some of the long-term sort of helpful dynamics. But the market itself, I think, is also a bit of a tailwind for us. ","Rick McKenney","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning, first question is on a Colonial, yet good sales there, but weaker Persistency seems to be kind of the opposite trend you're seeing in your group business and you also had a decline in public sector sales. Can you talk a bit about what's driving that result? Is competition escalating there or any comments on that dynamic?","Tim Arnold","Yes. Thank you, Tom for the question. On the Persistency side, we had a little bit of volatility in the first quarter of this year and the Persistency metric gets reported on a 12 month trailing basis, so that will stay with us through the fourth quarter of this year, but still a little bit of volatility there, but still inside of our expected range for Persistency.","On the public sector side, we are seeing a little bit of pressure on our Educator market this year. We don't believe its enhanced competition at this point. We had a really strong public sector sales growth here last year, so the comps are a little bit challenging, but we believe that it's just this one segment of our Educator business that is creating the pressure.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Rick McKenney","And I think we have to make sure that we added that you've referenced it, but Tim sales have been great, so we'll start with that to a 13% growth in Tim's business Colonial Life has been seeing very good sales growth.","Tom Gallagher","And Jack, just a question, expecting contributions to Fairwind in First Unum this year are they going to be consistent with levels of prior years or can you quantify what you would expect there?","Jack McGarry","They're going to be higher this year for a couple of reasons. One is the statutory reserve charge, it's going to impact capital levels in Fairwind, the new reserve base has an impact on cash flow testing within First Unum, so that kind of $200 million number is probably a decent number to think about the addition on top of kind of normal funding, and there's a little bit related to the new RBC factors as a result of tax reform, but that's one of the reasons why we're holding a pretty sizable cash balance going into the fourth quarter.","We expect that cash balance to come down with that funding, but we would expect that land comfortably above our one-time fixed charges.","Tom Gallagher","Got it, and just to understand, so this $200 million statutory reserve charge split between reserves plus AAP and thenon top of it, about another $200 million or\u2026?","Rick McKenney","No, the $200 million is the funding of that reserve charge and so if you look at kind of our normal funding that we've had year-after-year where we haven't had reserved charges, there's going to be an increase on top of that as a result of the reserve charge. That's what's driving the higher level of funding this year versus some previous years.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Randy Binner from B. Riley. Please go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Excuse me. Good morning, I had a question just on investing in the Long Term Care bucket, with interest rates higher, you know the first question is can you kind of characterize how much higher you're getting above the yield or the hurdle there rather than that, what are you seeing in the market, our spreads wider, is paper more attractive, or private investments more attractive in the last couple of weeks just trying to get an idea of what this investing environment is affording you in matching those liabilities in the LTC book.","Rick McKenney","Yes. So this is Rick just to talk about overall market environment across all of our books and I'll touch on Long Term Care in particular, but the higher interest rates has been good across our portfolio from what we've seen and that actually helped a lot of our product lines, credit spreads are still pretty tight so those haven't moved out at all. So, that's something that we still deal with, but the all-in investor rate that we're seeing across our lines are very good, particular to Long Term Care we saw rates higher than our 5.5% that Jack talked about comfortably above that in the quarter, given the mix of what we've invested in.","So, the higher rates overall from the 10 year and 30 year have been a real plus to us but it's one we fight every day and getting good investments but it's a much better environment that we've seen this half of the year than we've seen in previous times.","Jack McGarry","I'd add to that Rick, that even with the pullback in rates we've seen recently, the 30 year has held in significantly better than shorter rates.","Randy Binner","And are you seeing the better opportunities in bonds or is it in private structures? I guess I'm just trying to understand with an update on kind of how I can think about tracking what you might be investing in that book going forward?","Rick McKenney","You know the good part of our treasury rates as they float in all the books, so it's kind of across the board that we've seen a more favorable investment opportunities. So one of the advantages that we have is we can choose our asset classes, we're not committed to the certain percentages and so our investment approach is to really look at relative values across the board and to pick the best one.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Thanks. Good morning everybody. Jack a question on LTC reserves and the underlying assumptions. I'm wondering, is there any data that you can disclose to investors that demonstrates what you're looking at that indicates that morbidity improvement is a reasonable assumption? And I ask this because, you know very clearly what we're hearing from some of the other larger LTC players is that they're really seeing no evidence of morbidity improvement. So, I'm sure you can understand why investors are somewhat skeptical over that underlying assumption given what we're seeing and hearing from the rest of the industry.","Rick McKenney","I'd start John bringing you back to our September 18 presentation. We laid out a graph there that showed our actual to expected incidence rates over the past decade. They had improved on average 3% a year relative to our underlying reserve assumptions, we think with that as the historical result assuming 1% going forward is actually a pretty conservative assumption. ","The other thing I'd point out and I've said this as a lot, is that morbidity improvement can only really be understood relative to your underlying reserve assumptions and so when we showed that graph of 3% improvement, that was how morbidity improved using our underlying reserve assumptions as the expected base, if your underlying reserve assumptions are a more aggressive than ours, they have a different slope going forward than ours based on the same claim trends you may not see morbidity improvement relative to those assumptions.","So again, it's only meaningful on a company-by-company basis, taking into account what the underlying assumptions in reserves are. We feel very comfortable with where it is. We disagree that nobody else has seen it, I mean we've talked to other companies, maybe you know it\u2019s kind of like saving on GEICO, you know if the companies who aren\u2019t using it tend to be the most vocal about they are not using it, but there are plenty of companies out there that continue to use it and continue to see it within the blocks.","John Nadel","Okay. Alright, that's helpful, I appreciate that. And then a follow up question is just, maybe it's following up on a couple of earlier questions and thinking about RBC and targeted risk based capital levels. It sounds like roughly $1 billion of cash balance that you had at the end of September, some of that's going to be used as a funding of capital injection down into the subsidiaries. So your 385% RBC ratio that was flat quarter-over-quarter, how should we think about, where you are targeting for that ratio to be considering some of the capital injections, it sounds like you're going to make in 4Q as well as taking into account some of the formula changes that are coming through including the effect of tax reform?","Jack McGarry","So as we mentioned in our remarks, John, we expect to end the year at 360% to 370% that's largely reflecting the change in the RBC factors from tax reform, which will be implemented at year-end 2018, I think that's a little higher than we need to be, but we also anticipate another change in RBC factors with the C1 changes, which will be a smaller impact but will impact 2019. So that level of capital is a level we feel comfortable with going forward. I think we'd see RBC ratios decrease because the denominator increases in 2018, and then a little bit again in 2019 with the C1 factor changes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bass, Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping you could comment on the earnings outlook for the Closed Block segment following the LTC charge, does the resetting of the benefit ratio back to the 85% to 90% range or any changes in allocated capital have any impact on the go forward earnings expectations?","Steve Zabel","You know, we think it's going to have minimal impact. We would expect earnings to continue for the Closed Block kind of in the range that they have been in. You do get, I mean certainly a lift from the improvement in the loss ratio, but there's also additional required interest that comes into play with the increase in the reserves and those two things kind of offset each other.","Erik Bass","Okay, thank you. And then on Colonial can you just update us on where we sit in terms of the business investments that you've talked about and should we expect the expense ratio to start coming down as we move into 2019?","Jack McGarry","Tim, you want to take that?","Tim Arnold","Sure. Yes, so we do continue to make investments in the business both in distribution and customer experience, and talent and technology. We do also believe that the OE ratio will begin to come down as the premium income continues to accelerate and the rate of investment slows just a bit, but we'll continue to make investments. We do see that the expense ratio coming down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee, Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So in Unum US, we are definitely seen the dental and vision business continue to grow at a very good pace. I think you've talked about growing that book of business to $500 million of annual premiums in four years at your investor day, do you think you are kind of on track towards that target and maybe can you talk a little, how should we think about the trajectory of that growth.","Mike Simonds","Yes it\u2019s Mike, Humphrey, thanks for the question. We are excited about the potential that came with the Starmount acquisition and that we're seeing really nice growth in the group dental line in particular, I think we are right in the range of where we would want to be towards that $500 million target, but it \u2013 you know we're early in that five years, so we've got a not just to deliver over the next 12 months, but we've got to continue to invest in the provider network, in the technology that underpins that business. So the trajectory goes beyond just as reported period sales results, it's also kind of investing in the scalability of that business and that's also on track for us.","Rick McKenney","And I\u2019d add to Humphrey too. We've also launched through the Colonial Life business and we've seen a great start Tim, maybe you want to comment about that?","Tim Arnold","Yes. So we launched that in very late March and at the time we had about 35 states approved, we are up to over 44 now, so getting much better national coverage and the attraction of this product in our distribution system has been better than expected, that product is on its own performing very well, but we're also noticing that when we sell the dental product, we have good traction with many of our other products and those same employers as well. So, very pleased it is very early, but pleased with the progress we're making and excited about 2019.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. I think in your prepared you talked about kind of right now the dental adoption rates is kind of 27% in Unum US, but to get to that 500% like what kind of adoption rates you need to get to in order to achieve that target?","Mike Simonds","Yes, Humphrey, it's Mike. So the sales growth rate I think is what you're referencing of about 27%, and we need to be in that range on a sustained basis over the next several years, so you should be looking for high-teens, low-20% type growth and as with any kind of startup growth story, it's not going to be linear, right? So there'll be some quarters where we are exceeding that and there'll be some where we're below it, but that needs to be when you take a longer term view where we are.","Tim Arnold","Thanks Humphrey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Good morning. First question I had was just on some of the accounting changes from FASBI. Could you comment at all just on, I guess for Long Term Care specifically what kind of discount rate you're using and if there's any way to help us think about quantification of how much reserve levels could change from the new accounting regime and if there's any offsets that I should be thinking about across the businesses, aside from just sort of the interest rate impact?","Jack McGarry","Okay. So thanks Alex. So the first thing I'd note about the accounting changes is that they are GAAP only impacts, they won't affect statutory reserves or capital, they're scheduled for implementation in 2021, we would think that would be the earliest that implementation, will happen. There've been some favorable developments in the economy changes versus the excluded disabled life reserves with 60% of our reserves as company are disabled life reserves, so they won't be impacted by the accounting changes.","The big impact will be on active life reserves when you change the discount rate from \u2013 discount rate based on your portfolio results to a single discount rate that transition change will happen through AOCI. We actually already have a mark on our liabilities under FAS 115 and AOCI, so that mark isn't as big as going to a single A rate but it's already in there.","The good news about that going through AOCI is it won't impact book value, excluding AOCI which is the way most people look at returns on equities and book value of the company, it won't impact, reported GAAP earnings in a dramatic way because that's going through AOCI and we will continue to report earnings based on kind of our current portfolio rate in Long Term Care on going forward in terms of what comes through retained earnings.","So, I think there'll be an impact from an AOCI perspective it's a bigger market than we currently have, there's a lot of work to do to figure out what that is and to get our reserving systems to align with the way things need to be calculated under the new rules.","The other good part about the rules is, at least on our initial past, we don't see any of our products having market risks benefits associated with them. So we're not going to face some of the volatility that will arise out of that and so we're looking at it overall, it's going to be a kind of work we think the result will be manageable and we\u2019re encouraged by the fact that the impacts will be through AOCI and not through retained earnings, and kind of our historical measures will continue to apply post implementation.","Alex Scott","May be just a follow-up on the AOCI point specifically, I mean one of the things I've been thinking about is just part of the reason we excluded AOCI today is associated with assets being marked through AFS and liabilities sort of not being marked through the same degree. So I guess, through your conversations with the rating agencies and so forth are you finding that they will continue to look at it excluding the AOCI or will they actually look at just regular book value as well going forward? Or is it sort of too early to tell?","Jack McGarry","I think it's early to tell and in fact if you look across the rating agencies, there's not a single way to look at it, different rating agencies exclude different things in their leverage calculations and again from a rating agency perspective it's wisely above leverage as opposed to kind of the earnings in return pieces, so time will tell there's a good amount of time to get accustomed to where it is, but again there's no single view across rating agencies today and I'm sure they will work to develop their views over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Thank you for taking my question, most has been answered. I want to understand the expense that you guys incurred during the quarter incorporate for processing all your work on the LTC charge like the operational expenses and related, looking at the very good results in Unum US, to what extent do you think that the expense management and whatnot that delivered that result is sustainable in the going forward quarters?","Rick McKenney","Sure Josh, this is Rick. Let me just talk about our expense management overall and specifically in the corporate what you're highlighting there, it's not with the result of the investment in actual process, what we saw there was we had some restructuring costs as we've realigned some of our resources, particularly to the technology side and so you're seeing that come through. But expense management as a broader theme is something we're always investing in better ways to do things more efficiency.","I think Mike covered pretty well the expense management on the US side so I won't hit on that, but that's a general theme across the company as we want to be very efficient in terms of what we're delivering for our customers and seeing that come through the expense ratio. To do that sometimes you have to invest, sometimes you have to realign, and so you'll see some one time things that happen through the corporate line, but overall our expense management remains very much on track.","Josh Shanker","So let me just go back to the U.S. for a second. I mean [indiscernible] going forward are we at levels \u2013 should we think about there's a seasonality or is the 3Q 2018, I guess a sort of a leaving off point where you guys have made material improvements that are going to be going forward in the future I guess?","Mike Simonds","Hey Josh, it's Mike. So there is some degree of seasonality. So if you look back, it's not a bad idea as you're performing estimates to look back over the last couple of years, quarter-to-quarter volumes come through it kind of a lumpy way in the employee benefits business, but I'd say it's probably more constructive to look at what the annual numbers have done, and I'd say we've seen pretty good gradual improvement over the last several years and I would expect this to Rick's point that would continue going forward. ","Specific to the fourth quarter in your question, I'd say to reiterate that it's probably equal parts, some timing of expense that will come through in the fourth quarter and as well as that underlying improvement and then net of those two is what we've been seeing.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, just one clean up question on the LTC assumptions, just wanted to confirm going back to the morbidity improvement in the 1% that you talked about Jack, is that your assumption for a GAAP and stat or are you just making that assumption on a stat basis? I mean, on a GAAP basis?","Jack McGarry","Yes, that's a good question. If you look at Long Term Care, there's really three kind of sets of assumptions that company uses, there's their statutory assumptions underlying the statutory reserves. We do not have morbidity improvement and our statutory reserve assumptions.","The second basis is your GAAP assumptions we do include morbidity improvement and the GAAP assumptions. And then the third basis, which is a very important one as well as the basis we're using for cash flow testing. So it is quite possible for a company to not have morbidity improvement in their statutory reserves and not have morbidity improvement in their GAAP reserves, looks like use morbidity improvement in their cash flow testing assumptions to test the adequacy of both their stat story and their GAAP reserves. ","So we do not have morbidity improvement in our statutory reserves we do include in our updated reserve basis on a GAAP basis the morbidity improvement, and we do use that same morbidity improvement assumption in our reserve adequacy testing. The exception to that would be in the state of New York where morbidity improvement is not allowed.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. I mean I sort of always under the impression that we should focus on the difference between stat and GAAP and that should give us a sense to the extent stat is higher of all the cushion or a buffer, but now it seems like if you're using different assumptions for the two approaches maybe comparing them is less relevant?","Jack McGarry","Well, it is very relevant, it's less important what the different assumptions are than the fact that our GAAP reserves are based on the best estimate under the loss recognition, that's why we use the same basis for GAAP reserves that we do for cash flow testing, to the extent you are holding more money on a statutory basis, you have more provision for future benefits and expenses and protection of policyholders.","So I would focus less in the difference in our underlying assumptions for stat and GAAP and focus more on just the gross difference and the fact that you have a higher provision for future experience under stat immediate GAAP.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dargan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead sir.","Rob Dargan","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of moving pieces around the capital side, especially as we look towards the year-end and through 2019, I was wondering if we could just dial it in and think about it in the context of your existing ratings, is your intent through all of your capital management actions over the next year or two to maintain your existing ratings? Or would you be willing to let your rating slipped from one of the agencies? Just trying to wrap my arms around how you're thinking about that looking ahead.","Rick McKenney","Yes, you know basically you can never guarantee these things, but based on everything we know and we've had good discussions with the rating agencies, we would expect to maintain our ratings.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Rick McKenney for any additional remarks.","Rick McKenney","Yes. Thank you, Shelly.

Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, which are statements that are not of current or historical fact.

Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the results, I would like to welcome Steve Zabel in his new role as the company's Chief Financial Officer. I couldn't be happier with how the smooth transition has taken place, not only with Steve but more broadly within our financial organization. And I also would recognize Jack and his help in the transition until he retires later this year.","So on to the quarter. We continued to be very pleased with the financial results of the company and the overall business trends we're seeing. Our after-tax adjusted operating income per share for the second quarter increased 4.6% to $1.36, and for the first half of 2019 has increased just over 5%. This lines up well with our outlook range for the full year of 4% to 7% growth.","Looking at second quarter results. One of the biggest highlights was the growth in premium income that we saw in our core business segments, which totaled just under 7%. Unum US premium income increased by 6.2%, benefiting from disciplined sales trends, very strong persistency in our group lines and growth from new product lines, like dental and vision.","Colonial Life has been a consistent source of growth for us over the last several years and the premium growth rate this quarter was 6.4%. This is despite sales being down for the first time in many quarters.","Finally, our Unum International segment produced premium income growth of 14.2% on a U.S. dollar basis, certainly benefiting from the Unum Poland acquisition, but also higher growth within Unum UK. This has been the result of our persistency improving over the past several quarters, while the team has done an excellent job driving renewal premium increases.","Across the company and given our disciplined approach to growth, I believe the value proposition we bring to our markets and our strong focus on customer service are possibly reflected in these growth trends.","Next I'm also pleased with the expense management we are seeing in our core business segments. We're delivering improved expense ratios, while investing in new capabilities and investing in many of the faster growth areas of our business, such as leave services.","Turning to the Closed Block this quarter, this marks the fourth quarter since the long-term care assumption update in the third quarter of last year. Steve will cover this in his comments as well, but I'd highlight that rolling 4 quarter interest adjusted loss ratio was within our long-term target of 85% to 90%. This will play out over a longer-time period, but it's good to see these results in line with our assumptions.","And finally, the disciplined management philosophy we bring to the business continued to generate strong margins in the core businesses this quarter. With those margins, we have continued to deliver strong statutory earnings and cash generation. This has enabled us to maintain strong and stable capital metrics, while consistently returning capital to our shareholders. This quarter that means that along with the $100 million of share repurchases, we also raised our dividend by just under 10%.","To wrap up, we're pleased with our results for the second quarter and the first half of 2019. We are tracking in line with the expectations we set out for the year. Our teams are excited with the growth we're seeing in our business and the opportunity to provide our financial protection products and services to more employees and their families.","Now I'll ask Steve to cover the details of the second quarter results. Steve?","Steven Zabel","Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be in my new role and look forward to further building my relationships with our shareholders and the broader financial community. To echo Rick, I'm pleased with the quarter and the overall trends we're seeing in our businesses. In my comments this morning, I'll provide additional detail on the performance of our business segments and provide an update on our capital position and outlook for the year.","Beginning with Unum US. We continue to see very good results from these operations. In the second quarter, adjusted operating income increased 1.3% to $254.3 million. As Rick mentioned, we are pleased with the premium growth we generated in Unum US growing 6.2% over the year ago quarter driven primarily by the excellent persistency levels we're seeing in our group businesses, our recent sales trends and the emergence of our dental and vision business. We continue to see pressure on net investment income for the Unum US segment, down 6.3%, driven by lower miscellaneous investment income as well as the ongoing pressure on portfolio yields.","Miscellaneous investment income for the second quarter for the company in total was in line with our historical trends and consistent with the total in the year ago quarter. However, the impact to adjusted operating income was different for each of our business segments, which I'll point out in my commentary.","Within Unum US, adjusted operating income for group disability increased 2.5% to $83.6 million in the quarter. We continue to experience good premium growth and excellent benefits experience, though net investment income remains under pressure. Premium income showed strong growth, increasing by 6% as the in-force block increased from strong persistency levels, particularly in short-term disability over the past year and our sales of both LTD and STD products in recent quarters. The benefit ratio improved to 74.7% in the second quarter from 76.2% a year ago driven by favorable claim recovery experience in the group long-term disability line partially offset by higher pay claim volumes in the group short-term disability product line.","Consistent with recent trends, net investment income in the quarter declined 9.2% driven by the ongoing trends that reduced assets back in the line and lower portfolio yields on those assets as well as the lower amount in miscellaneous investment income relative to the year ago quarter.","Adjusted operating income for Group Life and AD&D line declined by 6.7% in the second quarter to $62.7 million. Premium growth was favorable in the quarter, increasing 7.4%, primarily from period sales growth and strong persistency trends. However, higher average size of claims elevated the benefit ratio to 72.9% in the second quarter and 70.3% in the year ago quarter. Sales for these group lines of business in Unum US were very strong in the second quarter increasing 16.8% over the year ago quarter. The group disability lines primarily drove this growth, increasing 32%, with strong large key sales growth, while we experienced a slight decline of 1.3% in Group Life.","Persistency in the Unum US group lines remains very strong at 90.7% for the first half of 2019 and remains an important driver of our premium growth. Finally, for Unum US, the supplemental and voluntary lines showed very good results for the second quarter with adjusted operating income of $108 million, an increase of 5.6%. The primary drivers for the quarter were good premium growth and favorable expense management, which did offset lower net investment income and our higher overall benefit ratio. Premium income grew by 5.2%, primarily driven by higher sales in the voluntary benefits and dental and vision product lines.","Looking at benefit experience for each product line. The benefit ratio for individual disability was unfavorable due to unfavorable claims activity and less favorable mortality experience. In the dental and vision line, the benefit ratio was also higher relative to the year ago quarter primarily due to a higher average claim size, but consistent with our expectations for this product line. I'll add that with the continued shift towards the group dental products and discontinued sales for the individual coverages, the benefit ratio for this line will naturally grow higher. Finally, the benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits line improved primarily due to favorable claims experience in our disability and group hospital indemnity products.","Sales for the supplemental and voluntary lines increased by 5.1% for the second quarter with strong growth in dental and vision and voluntary benefits offsetting lower sales in the individual disability product line. ","As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, persistency in the voluntary benefits in line will continue to be impacted throughout the year by the high level of terminations experienced in the first quarter. Terminations in the second quarter were consistent with our expectations. Our Unum International segment reported adjusted operating income of $30.7 million for the second quarter, an increase of 11.2%. The increase was driven by higher operating income from the U.K. line of business in local currency as well as the inclusion of the financial results of Unum Poland.","In local currency, the Unum UK line of business produced adjusted operating income of \u00a322.7 million in the second quarter, an increase of 11.3%. Results for the U.K. business included favorable growth in premium income of 7.3% relative to the year ago quarter from higher overall persistency, sales growth and the benefit of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line. The benefit ratio for the U.K. business increased to 85.6% in the second quarter from 76.7% in the year ago quarter. The increase was driven by unfavorable mortality experience and a reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the unusually high level of bond calls we experienced in the quarter, the benefit ratio was also impacted by inflation-linked movement in benefits related to our group products as inflation was higher in the U.K. in the quarter.","Net investment income in the U.K. was significantly higher in the quarter increasing almost 43%. This was driven by the unusually high level of miscellaneous investment income due to the bond calls I mentioned before and a higher level of invested assets, which was partially offset by a lower yield on fixed rate securities in the investment portfolio. With the rise in inflation in the U.K. this quarter, investment income from inflation-linked securities in the portfolio was also higher as we hold these securities to support the claim reserves associated with our policies that provide increases in benefits linked to inflation.","Unum International sales in U.S. dollars increased 5% in the second quarter with generally flat sales in the U.K. and local currency plus inclusion of the Unum Poland for this period. Persistency for the U.K. business continues to be quite strong even as we have successfully implemented renewal rate increases over the past several quarters.","The Colonial Life segment produced adjusted operating income of $84.4 million for the second quarter, down slightly from the year ago results of $84.6 million. Growth in premium income remained strong at 6.4% for the second quarter, reflecting growth in the in-force block form prior period sales growth, particularly expansion of our dental and vision products. The benefit ratio was unfavorable at 51.4% compared to 51% in the year ago quarter due to higher claims incidence in the cancer and critical illness line of business, partially offset by lower claims incidence in the life line of business. Net investment income declined by 7.5% in the second quarter primarily due to lower miscellaneous investment income, which produced a $4 million negative swing relative to the year ago quarter as well as a lower yield on invested assets.","Also in the quarter, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased due to the growth in the level of deferred asset and the impact of the perspective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions for interest-sensitive voluntary life products. This is the FAS 97 unlocking, which we perform each year in the second quarter. This produced a negative swing of about $3 million relative to the year ago quarter. Overall, we feel good about the underlying trends for Colonial Life and the 17.4% adjusted operating return on equity this business generates. Sales at Colonial Life declined 4.2% in the second quarter compared to the year ago quarter with declines in the large case and core commercial markets in the public sector. The comparison was a challenging one given the strong growth rate we had in the year ago quarter. We are working to build our recruiting pipeline for new agents and are encouraged that we'll return to positive sales growth in the second half of the year.","Moving to the Closed Block. Adjusted operating income was $33.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 13.9% over the year ago quarter. As expected, premium income for the segment continues to decline, down by 4.2% in the second quarter, primarily due to the ongoing policy terminations and maturities for the individual disability line. Net investment income increased by 2.6% in the quarter driven by an increase in the level of invested assets, which was partially offset by lower level of miscellaneous investment income.","In the individual disability product line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 81.3% for the second quarter compared to 82.9% last year. The second quarter of 2018 results included a reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from an increased level of bond calls in the year ago quarter. Partially offsetting the impact was elevated new claims incidence during the second quarter of 2019. The results of the long-term care business line for the second quarter reflect the updated reserve assumptions, which we adopted in the third quarter of 2018. On this updated reserve basis, the interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care was 87.4% in the quarter, in line with our expected range of 85% to 90%. The interest adjusted loss ratio in the year ago quarter is not comparable given the reserve basis change.","We are now four quarters past the update to our long-term care reserve assumptions we recorded in the third quarter of 2018. Over those 4 quarters, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 86.7%, well within the 85% to 90% long-term range we outlined. In addition, we're making good progress against the assumption for future rate increases, and we've received approvals for just under half of the $1.4 billion assumption. We remain encouraged about our ability to achieve this goal over the coming years.","Also we have exceeded the new money yield target of 5.5% over the past 4 quarters, including the second quarter of 2019. As we have cautioned, we need to take a long-term view of this business given its potential volatility, but we are pleased with how the trends have evolved over the past four quarters. Wrapping up the Corporate segment. The adjusted operating loss was higher in the second quarter at $43.8 million compared to a loss of $35.5 million in the year ago quarter due in large part to lower net investment income from a lower level of invested assets as well as higher expenses, including higher pension cost and a higher level of debt outstanding. This quarter's results are consistent with our expectation of quarterly losses in the mid-$40 million range.","Statutory earnings for our traditional U.S. insurance companies have remained at healthy levels providing support to our plans to maintain a strong steady level of capital to back the growth in our core business lines while also supporting our capital management plans. For the second quarter, statutory after-tax operating earnings totaled $278 million compared to $249 million in the year ago quarter.","Our capital metrics remain in good shape with the risk-based capital ratio for our U.S. traditional life insurance companies at approximately 365% consistent with our plans for the year.","Cash at our holding companies totaled $977 million at the end of the second quarter. The increase from the first quarter largely mirrors the debt issuance we completed in June, which was a $400 million 10-year senior debt issue with a 4% coupon. The first of these have been earmarked for the $400 million maturity we have in 2020. Share buybacks in the second quarter were $100 million consistent with our outlook for the year. ","I'll wrap up by reiterating our expectation of growth and adjusted operating income per share in the 4% to 7% range for full year 2019. This is consistent with the view we shared at our outlook meeting back in December.","Now I'll turn the call back to Rick for his closing comments and look forward to your questions.","Richard McKenney","Great. Thank you, Steve. It was a good overall quarter for the company and one that, I believe, shows the benefits of our strong position with employee benefits and voluntary benefits markets. The team is here and ready to respond to your questions. So I'll ask the operator, Cody, to begin the question-and-answer session. Cody?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","I had a question on Unum US core market sales. You had -- they've been trending a bit weaker for several quarters. I think you had expressed some caution about the competitive environment. There was some improvement in the quarter. So I was hoping to get an update there. And are you seeing a bit better competitive conditions now?","Richard McKenney","It was a good quarter, Ryan. Thanks. And Mike, do you want to take that?","Michael Simonds","Yes. Thanks. Ryan, good quarter overall. Just taking a step back from the quarter looking at 12% growth, which is great. 2Q is not our largest quarter. It's particularly encouraging because it signals some momentum across the majority of the segments, and I would definitely highlight the core. As we look at 1Q, we closed the gap to the prior year. Here in 2Q, we're starting to show a little bit of growth. And I am encouraged as we look forward to the pipeline, as we get towards very significant fourth quarter, when we'll be looking to close January 1 effective date, which as you, is a big part of the sales year for us. So really a combination of continued success cross-selling into existing clients based on the strength of those relationships. Growth in dental has been helpful and doing right, but it also comes packaged quite a bit with other core lines in the small end of the market, employers love the package. So it remains a competitive market for sure, but I am encouraged when I look at the trends in that part of the business.","Ryan Krueger","And then in regards to, I guess, some new claims discount rate in the U.S. and the reduction in interest rates, can you just give us a sense of how that looks at this point? And if there's a risk that you may need to lower the discount rate as we get closer to the end of the year?","Richard McKenney","Steve, do you want to take that?","Steven Zabel","Great, yes. Ryan, I'll just kind of take the interest rates from a higher level and then Mike is going to talk just a bit about how it effects our pricing. I guess, we look at interest rates differently across the various product lines. When you look at our U.S. long-term disability, we think about that as having a good level of margin in those discount rates versus what our current portfolio yield is. So we think we have some margin in there that we can work with. We also have the ability to rate that block over time, guaranteed renewal business, so that gives us quite a bit of flexibility there. We look our CDB block, our Closed Block individual disability, very little new money coming into that, so very little cash flow risk. And then for LTC, we look at that over the longer-term horizon. We feel good about the new money rates that we're getting today. We've exceeded our 5.5% and look to be able to do that over the near term. So overall, we think interest rates are manageable in the short term, but I'll let Mike talk a little bit more just about some of the pricing competition and how we think about go-forward pricing.","Michael Simonds","Yes. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it. Ryan, you've been following us for a while and know that we've certainly seen lower interest rate environments and fluctuations. And one of the things that we stay very focused on from the actuarial to the underwriting distribution function is being able to take a long-term view, place renewals when we need to, adjust the business pricing when we need to, and we've been pretty successful at maintaining profitability through various interest rate environments. That being said, when we think about pricing, just building on Steve's comments, interest rates and yields are one factor that we work in. When we look at things like claims incidence, recovery offset momentum that we have, things like our expense level, those all go into formulating new business pricing. And from where we sit right now, we don't really see the need to make adjustments from where we're putting business into the market and the renewals that we're going through, but we'll continue to watch it closely, in particular as we go through reserve adequacy and look at things towards the end of the year as we sort of think about 2020 and 2021, but I think we're in a good spot currently.","Operator","And then we'll move on to our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Looking at Colonial Life sales, it's definitely weaker this quarter. I think you pointed out that the weaker agent, recruiting was a factor and then also for different -- due to difficult column. But I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your current recruiting outlook as well as any other additional factors that may effect the sales growth in the quarter? And then, I guess, lastly is, how -- are you still comfortable in terms of achieving your 2019 sales growth outlook for Colonial Life?","Richard McKenney","Humphrey, we've got Tim Arnold here. Tim, do you want to take that?","Timothy Arnold","Sure. Yes. Thank you, Humphrey, for the question. There were a few factors that contribute to the sales challenges that we had in the quarter. But before I get those, I know we have 1 or 2 people who are maybe new on this call, and just as a quick reminder, over the last 22 quarters, Colonial Life's average growth rate in sales has been a little bit north of 8% in an industry that's growing 3% to 4%. So a long track record of very, very strong growth. In the quarter, we did experience pressure from some recruiting shortfalls we've seen over the last few quarters beginning in the second half of 2018. We attribute that to a couple of things. First, the very strong growth that we had in 2018 caused our sales team to be very busy, producing sales, helping implement new customers and rolling significant amount of new business. I think that took a little bit of focus away from recruiting when such very strong sales activity was occurring. ","And then the second is, in this economy with incredibly low unemployment rates, recruiting can be a challenge. We do expect that recruiting to swing back in the second half of the year. We've made some changes in the way we recruit people and the way we on-board them, and so we do expect that to swing back up. Our a rep -- new rep production is actually not down as much as the recruiting would suggest. So while recruiting is lower, we are seeing somewhat improved productivity on the people that we are bringing on. The environment is still very competitive, especially in large case, and so we see that showing up as pressure a bit. You and Steve both mentioned the challenging comparable from last year. We launched our new dental product on March 25 of last year, that fueled extremely strong growth in the second, third quarters of last year at 13.5% in the second quarter and 13% in the third quarter. And then finally, I would say, in the quarter, we made the decision to restructure and terminate a very small number of high-volume brokerage relationships where the kind of business that we're getting from certain brokers had very low quality, low persistency, and where brokers perhaps valued compensation more than they valued a good strong customer experience and value to the customer. And so that created some headwinds for us as well. ","In terms of the outlook, it's going to be a challenge, but our team is highly motivated to do everything we possibly can to try to get to the bottom end of the range, but it will be an uphill battle. The good news is that we feel good about the pipeline we have, including in large case right now. And as a reminder, 40% of our annual sales occur in the fourth quarter. So while it's going to be a pretty steep hill to climb, there are some opportunities for us to close the gap.","Humphrey Lee","Thanks for the color on that. And then shifting gear. I think in Rick's prepared remarks, you talked about kind of this leave service management opportunities. And I think that kind of showed up in Unum US supplemental voluntary this quarter with the other income and expenses a little higher. I guess, maybe at a high level, can you talk about what kind of opportunities you're looking at and in terms of kind of on a P&L impact because I thought that the leave management was more of a service as opposed to an earnings generator, but maybe I was wrong? So any color in terms of how you think about that business going forward.","Richard McKenney","Sure. I think it's a good question, Humphrey, because leave services is very important to our business, and we've been a leader in that space and been doing it for several years. And I think you're right, it's not in and of itself an earnings generator, but it's an important part of the package as we go and talk to customers that they value those services very much. We do an excellent job at that and had for a long time, and I think we're well known to provide that service very well. So it'll be part of the package. It's part of the reason why you see good core growth across our broad package that we have out there today. You mentioned it can skew the expense ratio a little bit given the fact that those are kind of just expenses that get added on and really get reflected in the margins that we see otherwise. So it's a very good business for us. We're continuing to invest in it. We think it's a real help to the overall value proposition that we bring to our customers. It's widely talked about in the market today, and we think we do a great job of serving our customers, and we look that to help us as part of our overall growth trajectory. Mike, do you want to add anything?","Michael Simonds","Yes. Just a couple of quick things, Rick. Humphrey, we find that in the group disability segment, the fees that we charge for that business it's not a risk-bearing product, so the expenses plus a small margin gets you to your fees charged. Rick, I think, nailed it really well. And you know just the one thing I would point to is every time that you read about another state or another municipality passing some sort of paid or protected leave law, that means complexity for employers. And so I'd say we're seeing with increasing frequency employers looking to outsource the compliance and the employee experience around those paid and protected leave. It's a complex business, but it's a really good opportunity for us to embed value. And when you look at the growth and the accelerating momentum in our short-term and long-term disability lines, a good amount of that you can attribute back to the strength of the leave offering.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","First question is just on, can you comment on, in group disability, how do you see the margins trending just given the mix shift that we're seeing here? You had better top line growth this quarter, but it was mainly large case and it looks like there was a big surge in short-term disability sales. Any thoughts on how you see that changing the margin at all or do you think it's roughly being priced where the book is being priced in aggregate?","Michael Simonds","Sure. Thanks, Tom. As we just mentioned, the leave business has helped drive short-term disability growth and that does tend to pull long-term disability along as well. We do price to very consistent return target and we've gotten to a place where there's compatibility large case to small case and across products from a return on invested capital point of view. We're pretty bullish about the growth and the accelerating momentum that we're seeing. And when we think about the earnings coming out like for disability segment, a lot of consistency in the loss ratio. When we look at incidence patterns, when we look at the recoveries, when we look at the offset patterns, and I think when we look at opportunities that continue to chip away the expenses, I think there's a lot of reasons to feel like there's sustainability in that segment from an earnings perspective.","Thomas Gallagher","And I guess, just to follow-up on that, would there be any major difference in the loss ratio in long-term disability versus short-term disability? Because -- I ask that because I think you've had a very favorable claim recovery trend, which I presume is mainly on the LTD side. So I was just curious if there's like a meaningful difference between those two products and how it would show up?","Michael Simonds","Yes. So the loss ratio is higher on the long -- on the short-term, sorry. And what I would say is there's less capital behind that short-term disability line, so you don't need as much premium margin to generate the same returns on the capital behind it. The other thing is, I'd say, as we do see some building momentum in the core market, that tends to bring more fully insured long-term disability premium along with it. So I see some encouraging patterns on that front as well.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. And then Steve, I think your comment on new money being better than 5.5%, and near term you felt like there was still pretty good visibility there. Just thinking about that's almost 300 basis points above the 30-year treasury. What are you guys buying to get that kind of yield and to continue to have good visibility on that? And is there a corresponding capital charge based on the type of assets you're buying? Or is it still -- you're still able to get higher-rated paper, higher-rated bonds as you're buying those?","Steven Zabel","I'll answer the specific question and Rick might just cover kind of how we think more broadly about risk management across our investment portfolio. So I'll start just by saying, we've been very successful over the last 4 quarters in the environment that we're in being able to exceed the 5.5%. When we look at 30-year yield, they've come down, but they haven't come down as much as maybe what we've seen in the 10-year part of the curve. So we still feel pretty good about that and they're not impressive, and then we've navigated through those types of yields before. Just as far as what we're investing in, we do not look to change our investment allocation against this line. We are in a combination of investment grade, fixed maturity, securities as well as high yield. We also sprinkle in some alternative invested -- investment assets and those tend to give us a little bit higher yield. And so the combination of those, we've been able to exceed the 5.5%. With our current allocation, we believe we can continue to do that in the current environment.","Richard McKenney","As Steve mentioned, I think when you look at the overall enterprise, Tom, our investment strategy and where we are really hasn't changed going back several years. So our credit quality overall pretty stable. We have added the asset class of alternative investments, but it's very small relative to the overall portfolio. We think it's a good asset class. And so when you think of Unum as the overall franchise, our investment portfolio has been very consistent. And we're very happy. And when we see that today in terms of our watchlist and other metrics, I'd say the credit is still very good. So I'll wrap that all around, the work that's being done particularly at the long-term care, and we still feel pretty good about that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","You mentioned the pressure on net investment income in Unum US. Given where new money rates are today, how would you expect this to trend going forward given the underlying growth in the business that you're also seeing?","Richard McKenney","So miscellaneous income, I think, was the driver of kind of the pure 2Q result and seeing a more significant drop-off in net investment income than we have in prior periods. And so there is volatility too, but it's largely bond call activity back in that line, and we would expect that to revert to the mean over time. And I think right now in today's environment you still see those rates come down, so it still provide a little bit of pressure on the investment income line. But, as Mike said, we've been pricing for that for a while and we have the margin there. So you may see that investment income continue to come down a little bit, but that's factored into our forecast.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then you also mentioned the strong premium growth in Unum US this quarter really across the business. How much are employment growth and wage inflation adding to your premiums at this point?","Richard McKenney","Yes. So I think that overall the natural growth, as we talked about before, has actually been pretty good. The economy in terms of employment levels, you see that in the unemployment rate is good and stable, and we do start to see some wage inflation. So it's probably not as high as we might have historically seen it, but we think it is additive and it's just probably reasonably good in today's environment. So despite many of the headlines you see about the economy, people are hiring people, people are seeing competition in the employment ranks. And as a result, they're having to increase benefits and raise wages. We think that all plays very well for us.","Erik Bass","Got it. I think you had historically said that added 1, 2 points annually. Are we sort of at the lower end of that range now? Is that a fair kind of assessment?","Richard McKenney","I think it's still a good range. I think that the -- it probably pushes toward the upper end of that range right now closer to two.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","First question is just on Unum UK. I know there's little bit of noise in the quarter with bond call, but I was wondering if you could just help us think through with the kind of experience you're seeing and the environment, any update on the impact that you would expect as kind of Brexit closes in?","Richard McKenney","Yes. Peter, do you want to take that one?","Peter O'Donnell","Yes, great, I'm happy to do that. As you pointed out, this quarter's benefit ratio is really an anomaly. There's been a number of things go on. We've had the bond called sort of higher inflation as Steve mentioned and also underlying [indiscernible] we saw just a little bit of lower debt, it does move around a bit. If we look at the year-to-date benefit ratio, it's not that far away from our assumptions. We had a good first quarter. And nothing in the economy is saying there's anything unusual happening there. We rerate all our schemes on an experience basis. We've been doing that over the last 2 years. And we think we're there thereabout in terms of where the schemes are rated now. I think from a Brexit perspective, obviously, most noticeable thing you can see in the quarter results is where the dollar is trading. We obviously went below $1.30 on average for the second quarter, and now we're at $1.21, $1.22 and that is effecting some of the comparatives. And if that continues into the third quarter, that's just a headwind against the numbers we're reporting for the U.K. business, but underlying the business is performing well. We got good premium growth. Sales, as the guys mentioned, were flat year-on-year, but actually we had a pretty difficult comparative. We wrote one very large case last quarter. So when we look again year-to-date, sales were up quarter-on-quarter. We're happy with persistency. So we feel we're in a very resilient position to trade through whatever Brexit throws at us.","Alex Scott","Okay. And then my follow-up is just on the FASB accounting rules. I know they got pushed back a year, but just would be interested to hear any kind of update in terms of the way you're thinking about the impact, the timing and when you might be able to shed more light on that, if you're not able to today? And maybe just broadly, how you're thinking about leverage? I know that ticked up a little bit this quarter, and I think it was just a pre-fund maturity, but would be interested, particularly if Steve, you have any views on how to manage leverage around this business?","Steven Zabel","Yes. So I'll take the LDTI update first. So just to reground on that accounting change for how we handle reserving on our policies for mostly our long-duration contracts. Right now, the interpretation, as we would read, it would say they're probably the active life reserves, which is about 40% of our overall reserve level. And really for us the biggest change is going to be around the discount rate where we're going -- we'll need to go to more of a single A type rate, which doesn't really match up with a lot of our portfolios. We view it as noneconomic. It's not going to impact our statutory cash flows. So overall, feel good about that. So what has happened is there was a preliminary vote to delay and it has been recommended to delay the implementation for a year to 1\/1\/2022. That is pending a 30-day comment period and then there will be a final vote on that. ","So we shouldn't have a kind of final recommendation or, I guess, final vote in the coming month. I'll tell you, we can't really speak yet to the timing of when our evaluation is going to be done because what we believe there's still some important interpretations that need to be made before we really truly understand the scope of the new guidance and are able to evaluate that. So we're really not trying to give any kind of update on when we might be able to give the results of our evaluation. What I'll say is we feel good about the process. There's a lot of process changes that need to be put into play with our evaluation systems. We're making great progress against that. So we feel good about the process, and clearly we're happy that they're going to delay it a year, it will give us that much longer to really work through it and work through the analytics on that. On the leverage side, yes, you're correct. Our leverage went up a couple of percentage points and that was due to the issuance we had in June of the $400 million 10-year note. That is earmarked for the prefunding of our maturity next September. And so we would do that leverage staying at the current rate really until we get through that prefunding. I think we'd want to manage that down over time though.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Andrew Kligerman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","I'd like to go back to actually both -- to pricing on both the group markets and voluntary. A few years ago, there were some companies that just weren't performing well and they seem to have cleaned it up and repriced. And performance, in general, in that state space in group seems to be pretty solid. But when we had the new tax legislation at the beginning of 2018, I think, across-the-board companies were saying they're going to have to give back some of that pricing to the consumers. And so on that front, I'm just wondering when that comes back because the benefit ratios look really good at Unum, particularly in your group disability line and at your competitors. So when does that come back? And in the same vein in the voluntary area across the board and your competitors, there is a real push into that product line. So I'm wondering, do you think that pricing across those two broad areas will start to come down as we get into 2020? And if so, how much?","Richard McKenney","Yes. So maybe I'll start off just on the overall pricing environment and talk a little bit about tax reform and how that has worked its way back into pricing. And I think our view on that and at the time when it was going in, we looked at that and said, it may, but it will take some time, and we'll see how it does. The more we looked at it, I think it's less of a factor. When you think about the tax rate impacts of the margins, what we see, our margins that we're getting today, which are above our competition, it's really not going to work its way back into pricing. Just the sheer level of 10% difference in a federal tax rate relative to our pricing is an immaterial input to that process. So we don't see it because of that. I would also say pricing in our markets today are pretty rational, pretty stable. And I'm talking particularly to the group markets. ","There's always a point in time and you reference several years ago where somebody is being more aggressive pushing into the market, disrupting a little bit. We don't see that in a major way today. There's always somebody on the margin or in certain case that we don't -- we scratch our head on a little bit. But I think, overall the pricing environment is pretty good for group across the board. And then on the voluntary side, I think there is much more competition, more people are getting into this market. It's a great market. We've known that for a long time. And as they weighed into it, it's not necessarily price. Prices are pretty standard to the end consumer in terms of what they see there but there are ways they can package it, ways they work with, carriers will work with customers, meaning the employer to entice them into that type of thing. Tim talked a little bit about that in his comments in Colonial Life, but I think that's true in the voluntary market. So there's more competition there. We're holding our own -- holding pricing, getting good margins, and we see that continuing, but it's certainly something we are vigilant for every day.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. And then just shifting over in relation to the discount rate, one area that's allowing you to not reduce, it might be the use of alternative assets. And you mentioned that, that asset class was very small. Could you give us a sense of how small it is? And where you'd like to get it? Because I think I've heard a dialogue that you'd like to grow that business. And then also what alternative assets? What specifically are you looking at?","Richard McKenney","Yes. So talk about the asset class overall, and I think we talked about -- there was a discussion we were having particularly related to long-term care and the alternatives. I think, our current number out there today is somewhere around $400 million on a $40 billion, $50 billion portfolio. So it is a very small percentage, less than 1% of the overall portfolio. We do like the asset class, we'll grow it some. I don't say we'll grow it -- we've been growing it in a very rational way over several years, and I think that's important when you're looking at these type of deals to not load up in any one vintage. And lastly I'd say, these are more credit deals when you look at them out there, more akin to what we're used to investing in that are out in the market. So without getting into specifics, I think it leans more towards the credit side than other alternatives.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. And you wouldn't want to double or triple it or something like that, the amount?","Richard McKenney","If we did so, it will be over a very long period of time. We worked our way into that $400 million position over 4 or 5 years, maybe even a little bit longer than that. So we'll continue to invest in that asset class. I think it's good, but I won't see it doubling over the next year or two.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","Just had a question first on the long-term care business. I think the loss ratio has been within your expected range since you took the charge last year. Seems like you're achieving your yield as well. How are the other factors? And have they been -- that go into your reserves, have they been better or worse than assumptions, so things like price hikes, [indiscernible], just trying to assess the likelihood of another reserve charge in the near term.","Steven Zabel","Jimmy, I'll take that question. So I think just a few grounding topics here. First of all, we go back to last year and the company went through a pretty comprehensive review of all of our assumptions in September and we looked at everything, from interest rates to rate increase strategies to claims incidence, different types of claim terminations, policyholder terminations and reset that based upon our experience that we've been observing over the last several years. So we went through that process. It was rigorous. We had a lot of third-party review of that, and so we feel good about that where we ended up through that process. You did mention that we've had a pretty good loss ratio experience since we reset those assumptions. For the full year kind of roll -- or for the fourth quarter rolling average, we're at 86.7%. ","I'd say if you break those components down, you mentioned we feel good about the new money rate that we've been able to get on our portfolio, we've talked about that some. We also feel good about our rate increase strategy. I did mention that we're getting close to 50% of the $1.4 billion that we had in our reserve assumption. I think we had mentioned back in our year-end call that we were around $500 million against that assumption, most of that coming from California, California approval as well as some exempt estates on our group product. Since then, we've continued to see good success. And I am encouraged because we're seeing it both on those pending increases that have already been filed and have been on file for some time when we did our reserve assumption adjustments. We're continuing to see routine incremental approvals on those. But then we have a good mix with some of those that we just filed more recently towards the end of last year into the first part of this year. As I mentioned back then, a lot of those new approvals were going to be on the group side of the business. And again, I am encouraged that we're seeing good approval on those. So all in, we feel good about where we are on the rate strategy. But again, it will play out over multiple years. We have a lot of these approvals that get approved on an incremental basis on an annual basis.","When it comes then to the underlying liability assumptions, again I think a good guide is to look at our overall loss ratio. We've seen fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter on that. If you remember, fourth quarter last year, we had pretty good incidence on that, and we were actually below our expected range of 83.2%. But I just want to reiterate that we don't change our view of long-term assumptions based on just 1 quarter, whether they're very favorable or unfavorable. And I think it's important that the people understand when we think about the range, we're looking at the range of 85% to 90% and anything within that range, we view as satisfactory, and we view as being within our expectations. So we're going to see fluctuations within that range. We may even see a few fluctuations outside of that range, like we saw in the fourth quarter, but we continue to feel pretty good about where our assumption set is and it's played through in our loss ratio.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. On the group disability business, your margins have sort of gradually continued to improve off of already strong levels. What's driving this? Is it incidence or recoveries? And to what extent do you think barring any change in the economic climate to what extent should the margin sustain at these levels?","Michael Simonds","Thanks, Rick. I'd say all the above. So incidence has been pretty good, but not outstanding. I'd say recoveries continue to be just rock solid and predictable. We have a great team that helps get claimants back to work in a really high quality way. And when we look at where the loss ratio has been, it's been favorable. And when we sort of look forward at the underlying components of that, there's no reason to think that, that is at a sustainable level going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","So I'm interested in the discussion too around sort of exceptional margins, really strong return, and it's not just Unum US, but I'll focus there because that's where, I guess, there's more competitive pressure generally speaking. And I agree with Andrew's comment earlier, a couple of years into it now, it's not just you guys with strong margins and strong returns, pretty much the entire industry is benefiting from this. And so I guess, I'll take a different approach to the question though. Mike or Rick, why not step up on the gas a little bit more, grow a little bit faster? I mean, I recognize this is cyclical business, but if economic conditions remain this good, if the fed is on our side, if all these factors are in place and you're generating high-teens return, that's so far ahead of cost of capital. I don't understand why you wouldn't actually be more aggressive here to grow a little bit more quickly, particularly when you've got the opportunity to re-rate over time?","Richard McKenney","John, we really appreciate that question, and it's a dialogue we have internally as well because we have seen very good margins. We've also been at this for a while, and so it's important that we talk about discipline because those good margins can go away very quickly in an undisciplined environment. You don't have to go back couple of decades when we were part of that as well. We've seen many carriers do that over the last several years. So we're hesitant to do that, but it doesn't mean that we're not pushing the growth side. And when we're growing premiums, 7% across the board and generating these margins, we think that's a pretty healthy mix. And so although the temptation will be there, I think I give credit to our team who has been doing this for a long time. Discipline is still part of what we do and part of the core of this franchise. And I think we're proud of that. Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to that?","Michael Simonds","I think you've got it. The one I would have, Rick, is where we are leaning in, John, is on capabilities. And so we continue to increase the investments that we're making. And we talked on this call and prior calls about the investments that we're making in the leave management business. We are continuing to invest in that and we'll do so over the coming quarters. Another big asset for us is proven to be the technology we've invested to integrate our processes into the cloud-based HR platforms that our clients are increasingly adopting. And we got great success with our integration with Workday and expect to have some more news on that front over the coming quarters, which we think could help, provide a tailwind for us.","John Nadel","Okay. I appreciate the commentary. And then if I could switch gears just to sort of long-term care and the premium rate increases. So in the first half of this year, in the Closed Block, LTC premium growth was about 1% year-over-year maybe slightly less. Can you help us maybe understand what's happening with the actual policy count? Obviously, that's got to be declining. I just don't know how fast. And then how much of these recently approved rate increases were very meaningful amount. Do you think it's already -- earnings grew the premiums that we're seeing in the Closed Block or is that still on the comp largely?","Steven Zabel","Yes, John, this is Steve. So just from timing, I'll give you a little bit of perspective just on the process of approvals and then the implementation of rate increases. You can usually look at a communication period and implementation period that can stretch anywhere between 4 to 6 to even sometimes 8 months on the individual side. We have certain technology releases and then we make sure that we have good communications upfront to the brokers of record as well as the policyholders so that they can think about choices that they have to make. So as an example, the California increase that was approved at the beginning of the year, that is just in the process of being implemented, and so you would not see any premium in the current financial statements related to California. That will start to come through later this year. And then on the group side, it's even a little bit more extended just because you have the factors that I described as well as the anniversary dates that you're working with, and those are implemented on the anniversary dates of the group. So it takes time, it takes time, and so we've seen kind of steady increases from those that have been approved in past years. A lot of what we've seen so far on the newer program, you wouldn't have seen come through the financials yet.","John Nadel","So then is it fair then if we thought about this from a modeling perspective, Steve, that the Closed Block LTC premium, we should probably see that growing over at least the next 12, if not longer, months given the success you've had on the Premium rate increase side?","Steven Zabel","Yes. The one thing that I would say there is with certain of these increases, specifically California, we do continue to offer the option on the old individual side, yes, the buydowns. And so we've had a pretty good take-up on that historically with other states. And so I'd caution you to build too much in. We need to see just how that behavior, the policyholder behavior plays through, and that's something, obviously, we're very interested in and we'll track. But I'll just end by saying, we're very encouraged by the approvals that we have received and feel like we're well on our way to the reserve assumption.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","I'll just do two quick ones in the interest of time. So on the Unum UK discount rate change, should we expect any ongoing earnings drag as we think about the next couple of quarters?","Steven Zabel","This is Steve, I can take this one, and I'll just give a little bit more color around the discount rate change. So we had a pretty significant bond call overall in the quarter, it was about \u00a310 million that came through on that. We took about half of that and took the opportunity to adjust our discount rate and we adjusted that by about 8 basis points. And so we had about $5 million increase in the reserve, so that pretty much resets our claim discount rate at that point. And then how we would view that is just going forward that would pretty much match off with the accretion that we'd have then on that claim reserve versus what we think we're going to yield on our portfolio. So there might be a little bit on the margins, but I wouldn't see it being very material.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Got it. And then just the second one in terms of capital return. I think we still have maybe $50 million left in terms of carryover buyback from that quarter last year when you didn't buy back stock. Is the plan to execute that in the second half of this year?","Steven Zabel","Yes. We will continue to evaluate that. And if you recall, we did catch up $50 million of the $100 million that we kind of forgo -- that we forewent in the third quarter of last year. We'll continue to evaluate that. But I think kind of how we're looking at the future, the kind of $100 million a quarter is probably a pretty good expectation.","Operator","And we'll now take our final question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","One last LTC question before we end. Can you talk about the time lag between applying for a rate increase and receiving it? And if we look at the rate increases that you've been approved for since taking your last charge, how many of them have been sort of processed with a 2% 10-year environment in mind?","Steven Zabel","I'm not sure I followed the last part of that question.","Joshua Shanker","If you saw the rate increase, you saw the rate increase with whatever the prevailing interest rates were in the market in your interest rate assumptions. I assume your interest rate assumptions may -- we don't know, but may have changed. But if in January you sort of did the math and came to this is the price we need to increase in X state, and now we're 6, 7 months into the year and interest rates have changed. I'm just wondering to what extent have prices that you've asked for been filed for in a very different interest rate environment?","Steven Zabel","Yes. I guess, I'll look at that just to go back to the process we take to file rate increases. It's a very long-term view of both our liability assumptions as well as interest rates. So if you go back to how we were looking at it when we did our reserve assumption adjustment back in September, that would've been the basis for our rate increase request. So -- and we take a consistent approach nationwide to that. So we would have reset the assumptions set. We would have factored that into rate increase requests, and then we filed those new ones through the last part of last year into the first part of this year. And again, we still feel good about our long-term view of interest rates and they'll feel like we need to reset those at this time. And so we wouldn't adjust those for the rate increase request as well. And just the timing, that varies quite a bit. Some states -- we've have some states that have approved the increases that we filed the latter part of last year and the first part of this year. They are approved, and we'll be implementing those and then there's other states that it takes longer and it may take even several years. They also may face those in over time. So the timing can vary quite a bit. But we factor that all in to how we think about the value that we can get from those.","Joshua Shanker","And with long-term care, are there any filed in new states that you can start charging and the state will get to your approval at some point?","Steven Zabel","Yes. We mentioned back in the first part of the year, there are, I'll say, a couple states that there is an exemption from filing group, long-term care rates. So if you have a nationwide program, you can just begin charging those nationwide rates. But it's pretty limited and there is very few just file a new states, most of them will go through pretty comprehensive process.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","I just had a quick follow-up on the California rate increase. I think it's the way profits before losses accounting works, sometimes the premiums, they come in from a premium rate increase are necessarily used to build reserves the way your typical premiums would. So I was just interested in, like, do I have that right, will those premiums kind of -- they come in from that increase fall to the bottom line more so than premiums ex rate increases?","Steven Zabel","Yes. I would say you'd get different answers depending on the accounting basis. So when you look at GAAP accounting, we factored those increases into our reserve assumptions. So there is a point where those reserves assume that you're getting the increased premium. Now the timing of that may not always match up perfectly because there is an assumption of the timing of implementation. But by and large, over time, those premiums are anticipated by the reserve itself. So there's less of that, that will fall through. On a statutory basis, your statutory reserves kind of work independent of the actual premium collected. It's -- those are kind of more locked in assumptions, and so more of that may fall through to the bottom line.","Richard McKenney","Thanks, Alex. So I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us this morning. Cody, I think, that now completes our call for the second quarter of 2019.

The second quarter was another solid one for Unum with opertaing eararnings per share of $0.89. slightly trailing the year ago results of $0.90 per share. While our risk results showed somewhat higher volatility in some of our U.S group line this quarter, we also saw the continuation of many of the positive operating trentds we've seen in the past, most notably strong premium growth in our core businesses. In addition our statutory earnings remain healthy and capital position is strong providing us with excellent financial flexibility.","I want to cover a few of what I believe are the key highlights of the quarter and then I\u2019ll turn to Jack to provide announcements of our results in greater detail. I will start first with sales, where as expected we experienced some moderation from the strong growth we\u2019ve enjoyed over recent quarters to a more normal long-term level of growth.","Unum U.S. sales increased by 1% for the second quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. By market segment, we saw continued momentum in the core segment, which we define as less than 2000 employees with year-over-year growth of 4%. We did see sales decline in the large case segment which is a market we approach on opportunities phases and where sales can be more volatile.","At Colonial Life, sales continued at very continued growth at very good levels increasing almost 6% with solid performance in the core commercial segment and public sector and finally Unum UK sales continue to gain momentum increasing 6% for the quarter in local currency, second with continued good sales momentum along with healthy levels of persistency across all of our business lines we continue to experience very good growth in our premium income.","Our core business segment on a combined basis generated premium income growth of 5% over last year with Unum U.S. premium growth of 7%, Colonial Life at 6% and Unum UK up 1% in local currency. Next our benefits experience overall remains within our range of expectations though we did experience pressure this quarter particularly in our U.S. Group life. On a quarter-to-date, on a year-to-date basis, our disability lines were in line with prior year with the challenging second quarter mostly offsetting a very good first quarter. And in Group life and AD&D we saw pressure as well.","Other lines of business benefited from favourable results especially the close block in Colonia Life. Importantly, our margins remain very healthy across our core business segments. And Jack will detail these trends by business segments as commentary. With these ongoing solid results and good statutory results, we continue to maintain a very strong level of financial flexibility.","This enables us to support our growth needs while also returning capital to our shareholders. This quarter we repurchased over $100 million of our shares and will implement a 12% increase in our dividend effective with the payments we\u2019ve made in the coming weeks and finally as we have discussed with you for some time, the primary challenge we continue to face in the ongoing low interest rate environment.","Interest rates and investment spreads were somewhat higher in the second quarter however they remain well below historic levels. I\u2019m pleased however with how we\u2019ve been able to manage through this low rate environment over the past two years and with the actions we have been able to implement to maintain healthy profit margins in our business segments.","So with those highlights on our second quarter performance, I will now ask Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack?","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Rick gave the high level view of what we believe is the solid second quarter and I would like to review more detail the operating and growth trends, we saw in the quarter. I\u2019ll start with Unum U.S. where second quarter operating earnings were $202.8 million, a decline of 6% from the year ago quarter of $215.8 million.","Premium income growth was strong increasing 6.8% over the year ago quarter. The pent up ratio for the U.S. segment increased slightly to 71.2% in the second quarter compared to 70.4% in the year ago quarter as we experienced negative volatility in our U.S. Group Life business. In addition, net investment income declined by 1.1% primarily reflecting the ongoing decline in yields on our invested assets. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our Group disability business was $61.2 million, a decline of 15.8% from the year ago quarter at $72.7 million, while premium income continues to build momentum increasing by 71.1% over the year ago quarter, we saw continued pressure on net investment income which declined by 1.8% in the quarter.","In the higher benefit ratio which increased 83.4% in the second quarter compared to 81.9% in the year ago quarter. The benefit ratio was impacted by higher new claimants and higher average size claim in our LTD product line driven in part by the 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate for new claimant implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe this quarter\u2019s results reflect negative volatility that will occur in this line from quarter-to-quarter including the very favourable first quarter experience, the benefit ratio for the first half of 2015 is 81.8% compared to 82.5% for the first half of 2014.","Group Life and AD&D operating income was $52.5 million for the second quarter, a decline of 13.4% from the year ago quarter, premium income continues to grow at very healthy levels increasing 7.3% for the second quarter. Earnings were negatively impacted by the increase in the benefit ratio to 73.1% for the quarter up from 70.1% a year ago, primarily driven by an increase in the average paid claim size for the group life line.","Again this appears to be normal volatility and did not change our outlook going forward. Trends in the supplemental and voluntary lines were favorable with operating income at $89.1 million for the second quarter and increase of 8% compared to the $82.5 million a year ago.","Premium income growth trends also remain favorable for this segment increasing 5.8% in the quarter compared to last year. With perspective the individual disability line had a favorable quarter has overall risk results remain stable, the voluntary benefit ratios declined to 43.1% in the second quarter compared to 48.2% a year ago as mortality experience was favorable in the life product line and higher policy terminations in the critical illness product line generated release of related active life reserves.","Moving to Unum U.K, operating income was \u00a325 million for the second quarter and increase is 5.9% over the year ago quarter of $23.6 million. The benefit ratio improved 70.7% for the second quarter compared to 74% in the year ago quarter as risk experience in the group life line business was favourable benefiting from lower new claim incidents and average claim size.","Unfortunately mortality negatively impacted results in the group disability line although the risk results remain within our long term expectations. Margins remain in very good shape for Unum U.K for the quarter and first half of the year and the operating ROE was 19.1% for the quarter.","Colonial Life also continues to generate strong results. With operating income of $77.6 million a 3.6% increase over the year ago quarter at $74.9 million, risk experience was favorable over the year ago quarter primarily driven by favorable mortality experience in the life line as a benefit ratio decline to 50.4% from 52% in the year ago quarter.","Margins remain strong Colonial Life within operating ROE of 16.6% for the quarter. Finally the growth loss operating income was $36.6 million in the second quarter flat with the very strong results from the year ago quarter. This year\u2019s results were strong related to our long term expectations for both the long term care line in the closed disability block with good underlying risk experience in both business lines.","In the long term care block, the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 83.4% for the second quarter favorable related to long term expectation of 85% to 90% benefit ratio but long term care has less favorable claims raise in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the very favorable experience in the prior year second quarter.","In the closed disability block we have a strong improvement relative to results of the second quarter of 2014. The interest adjusted benefit ratio improved 83.6% this quarter compared to 89.4% a year ago primarily driven by more favorable claim incelntives and mortality experience.","I\u2019ll now move to the growth trends we experience across the company as Rick pointed are we saw a moderation in our rate of sales growth this quarter. This still was to be expected particularly in Unum U.S where we continue to implement rate increases in the market to offset the effects of growth the low interest rate environment. It\u2019s important to note that our sales growth levels have moderated we continue to see a very strong absolute level of sales.","I would remind you that it\u2019s the relationship between the size of our imposed renewals business in the volume of sales that drives growth in our premium income. So starting with Unum U.S. total sales increased by 1% in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Well this moderated from recent quarterly sales trends we continued to see good trends in the group visibility lines where LTD sales increased by a 11% and STE sales increased by 39%.","We saw a decline in the group life Canadian D sales by 22% against a very strong second quarter 2014. By comparison the second quarter of 2014 sales increased by 71% over the second quarter of 2013, a very active large case sales activity. Overall to the claims of business core market sales continued to show positive momentum is advancing by about 4% for the second quarter. Large case sales declined by 7% overall which is typical of the volatile pattern we experience in this market segment.","Growth in voluntary benefit sales have also been volatile, the sales declining a little over 1% for the second quarter compared to the year-over-year increase at 20% plus for the previous two quarters. In addition, sales and individual visibility line increased a 11% for the second quarter. Persistency for Unum U.S. remained a very healthy levels for the group lines combined persistency was 89.3% for the first half of 2015.","With these sales trends and persistency levels along with underlying management of imposed renewals we generated premium income growth for Unum U.S. this quarter at 6.8%. A Colonial Life in this sales continue to grow at a strong pace in the second quarter increasing 6% relative to last year. the composition is this growth was encouraging is the core commercial market produced an increase of over 4% in the public sector increased 15% offsetting a slight decline in our large case sector business.","New account sales declined slightly this quarter so the growth over Colonial Life was overall primarily driven by sales through existing accounts. In addition, new rep contracts increased by about 7% as we focus on building the pipeline of producers.","Persistency for Colonial Life as high year-over-year at 79.2% helping to generate overall premium growth of 6% in the second quarter, a highest rate of growth in several years. Finally sales in Unum UK increased by 6% again in the second quarter in local currency. Persistency remained stable in the group visibility line at 87.5% and continues on an improving trend in the group life line up to 79.9% for the first half of 2015.","So overall we\u2019ve made very pleased with the growth trends we\u2019ve seen at core business segments. Quickly looking at investment results interest rates in investments spreads were higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and as a result and new money yields were slightly higher as well. However, our medium new money yields remain well below our existing portfolio yields so they are down with pressure on our portfolio yields and net investment income continues to impact our profitability.","We are actively raising prices in the market as a primarily means of managing this impact. Moving to capital management, the weighted average risk based capital ratio for our traditional U.S. life insurance company continues to be stable from quarter to quarter remains approximately 400%.","Holding company cash and market hold securities was $481 million at quarter end which reflects our $103 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Statutory operating earnings were $116 million for the second quarter and for the past four quarters statutory operating income totaled $633 million, a healthy level of earnings which has also remain stable over time.","Wrapping up, I want to affirm our 2015 outlook for growth in operating earnings per share in a range of 2% to 5% after 351 in operating earnings for 2014 has adjusted by the accounting update. Given our first half results we expect it to be towards the lower end of that range but we will need to continue to see how business trends and interest rates play out for the reminder of the year.","So overall it was another solid second quarter for the company and now turn it back to Rick.","Rick McKenney","Thanks, Jack. And I\u2019ll reiterate. We are pleased with the second quarter results. Our premium growth remained strong and our margins are healthy. These solid results continue drive good capital generation and strong financial flexibility for the company. This allows us to continue to invest in the growth for our business while we return capital to our shareholders. So we\u2019re happy with the results and now we\u2019ll move to your question.","So I\u2019ll ask the operator to being the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thanks you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks and good morning. I want to start with the right actions that you are taking in the US, are you now sort of pricing your business to reflect the current interest rate environment to all that\u2019s going to baked in the cake at this point or is there another round of right action that you need to take on a go forward basis.","Jack McGarry","Mike, you want to take.","Mike Simonds","Yes, sure. Good morning, Suneet. So I think already two fronts so first is new business pricing and where we would say absolutely new business pricing reflects our best view on interest rates underlying risk, aging of the population et cetera. The renewal is as you know, it takes a little bit of time to work through that. So to just give you a sense, in the larger end of the market, we see about a third all of our large employers come through each year and then in the core market exposure to 20% to 22% that we put through in renewal program, each batch that comes through reflects the current view of interest rates.","So we\u2019re making good progress but even as we saw rates fall a bit last year that would get reflected in the renewal program this year and in the next two years to come.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Got it, and then I guess for Jack on your comments about I think what you\u2019re getting here was the nominal level of sales relative to the in-force, I mean I guess is the takeaway from that, that even if sales growth rate of sales starts to moderate because just of the large numbers that we should still expect premium growth because essentially you\u2019re out selling your lapses is that kind of where you are going with that?","Jack McGarry","Yes that is pretty much and so if we get to that point, normal growth in sales will be reflected in normal growth in premium but we are - we\u2019ve gotten over the tipping point with the size of our sales is big enough to overcome the lapses and generate some really good top line growth.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And my last question on top line is, is it still fair to say that you\u2019re not really getting much of a benefit from either employment growth or wage inflation?","Jack McGarry","Yes I mean it turned from - it has been negative in the past, it is positive, it is in the 1% to 1.5% range and so we haven\u2019t seen, we haven\u2019t seen the lives in wage growth that perhaps the general economy is seeing as yet.","Suneet Kamath","In a normal period that 1% to 1.5% is typically what again could you remind us?","Jack McGarry","I mean 2% to 4% depending.","Rick McKenney","I think one thing to add that is we are seeing the Life\u2019s grow, we really haven\u2019t seen the wage inflation and so that is something that I think is true pretty much across the economy, it\u2019s very true in our books. So we\u2019re getting better employment but not seeing what we would expect from overall wage inflation, so that is something we look forward to.","Suneet Kamath","All right, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.","John Nadel","Hey good morning everybody. Maybe two quick questions for you, there is some who are reading the DOL proposal to potentially have an impact on group insurance, sales, do you read it that way, if so do you guys have a view on this obviously there is a lot of focus amongst the annuity writers and others selling business into qualified plans but I\u2019m curious whether Unum has a similar view that this could potentially stream into the group insurance business?","Rick McKenney","Hey John this is Rick. Thanks for the question. I think the - when you think about the overall, what is going with the fiduciary role and from the Department of Labor, one it is early day, so I think like anything that we look at in Washington, we stay very involved with the discussion that is going on out there and making sure that we have our views around that - around what is going on and where those different roles might go. So I think we have to say it is still early days, I think it is very clear though from the discussion, the questions and the guidance coming out of Department of Labour but this is very much about investment advice that goes on out there which doesn\u2019t include us. So it is one of those things that we stay on top of.","We don\u2019t think it is going to and we don\u2019t think it should apply to anything we do in the business but it is one of those as you deal with the ways of Washington, we stand on top of it.","John Nadel","I totally agree with your view. The second question I guess is there has been M&A activity, there is at least one group insurance business [indiscernible] is very publicly out there potentially other transactions that we don\u2019t necessarily hear about the bankers might be bringing to you, should we read into the fact that your buybacks continue that, that M&A is something you\u2019re not really looking hard out at this point or are they mutually exclusive?","Rick McKenney","John I appreciate the question, I think we\u2019ve been very clear on M&A is a core part of our strategy, when you think about that and so you wouldn\u2019t have seen us do any deals but there wasn\u2019t a lot going on in the market, that is how we would have voice that. So as you mentioned the market is seeing greater momentum, we are definitely going to part in the view of what we have out there, we will be close to whatever actions going on out there, I think we are well known, in the market at least that were interesting in growing our business through M&A that\u2019s the core part of our strategy. So, that M&A can look like adding capabilities, it could look like expansion of our all portfolio, but to be very clear M&A is a key part.","Your second piece of the question is around the capital to do so, and I think that as we look at that we have been able to return capital to shareholders, to share repurchase and through dividends, but at the same time we have kept our balance sheet in the space. So we can react to environment to an M&A become as better and that\u2019s been consistent. So we think we have the prior part to participate in these markets and we will be very active on the firm, and they are neutrally exclusive and we think","John Nadel","Okay, as a quick follow up along those lines I mean obviously you are carrying a risk based capital ratio that at least, for your business mix is significantly above I think some tiers and significantly above, your historical levels, shall we think about that Rick is you know exact part of the capacity, if they were to be used for M&A as suppose to you know retiring equity. The risk based capital ratio could, be a source if you will funds.","Rick McKenney","I think we have been on over time that we have running of 400%, we have been top of our ranges that we have communicated externally so there is room there, we carry holding company cash as Jack mentioned that just under $500 million there is room there and then when we look to our leverage ratio, we are very clean that leveraged structure that provides this capacity as well. So, we think we have a lot of capacity and I take you back to the capital generation model. Every quarter we keep generating capital as well that can buyback stock or go towards certain type of transactions.","John Nadel","Yeah no question, statutory earnings have been traffic. The last one, I have real quick is just that question I guess for Mike. There is been some, other companies talking about some model shifts in competitive environment in U.S. group insurance that utmost notably this morning was more of the commentary from that around the [indiscernible] business which I know is not necessarily something here focused on by can you give us an update on your views on the competitive dynamics.","Rick McKenney","Yes, sure John thanks for the question. I\u2019d would say is in comparison we certainly saw more favorable market conditions in 2014 and we had seen in a little while we had few carriers that needed to address profitability issues on that created some opportunity we saw the market shake off some of the distraction from ACA that where we adopted in the end of 2012 and then 2013. I\u2019d say as I look at 2015 we probably see a little bit more of an aggressive stands around pricing in the market. Then we have saw 14 but still reasonably go to and I would say pretty typical conditions.","John Nadel","Okay, thanks very much. That\u2019s all I have.","Rick McKenney","Thanks John.","Operator","And will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a few questions on first on if you could go into a little bit more detail on the two businesses where you say week margins a group disability and then Group Life just talking about what you saw in terms of incidence and severity trends and how do you expect the loss ratios do or margins still emerging those businesses in the second half of the year. And then also on long-term carrier you had pretty good results in this quarter, but given in the level of rates that were at right now, if we stay at this level through the end of the year would you expect to add to your New York\u2019s stat reserves again this year or could you been doing that in the past for the last few years?","Rick McKenney","Okay.","Jack McGarry","I got Peter. Yes, good morning Jimmy. First from the group disability and Group Life it really, we take a look at there, it really look like just normal volatility on the group disabilities side the new claim incidence rates was up slightly average size was up and so was a combination of those two things that drove the results would again pointing to the first half of the year way to very, very good first quarter and a less good on second quarter, but year-to-date we are pretty much were we could expected the and we would you know in our outlook is not changed going forward. A Group Life it was absolutely an average claim size, so you know just higher paid people happened to be the peoples at that submitted claims or the claim size was up 6% for the quarter, and again that\u2019s something that we wouldn\u2019t view as being the trend and one of you is changing our outlook going forward.","From the long term care side, where rates are and in the guidance that we\u2019ve given in the past we\u2019ve talked about New York being kind of a steady thing and so we would expect to have contributions to New York at a similar that we\u2019ve had in the past. And actually rates are a little better than they were at year end and so that there has been little modest improvement in that but again, we\u2019d expected the similar levels and it\u2019s clearly something that has been baked into our capital plans.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks, Jimmy","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James and Associates.","Steven Schwartz","Yes. Hey, everybody. Now I\u2019m not going to take up much time most were asked and answered. So thank you.","Rick McKenney","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And we will now go to Colin Devine from Jefferies.","Colin Devine","Okay. Thanks very much. So couple of things. Just to clarify on the deal situation because I don\u2019t believe Unam submitted a comment letter on it. But I presume then you just sort of participating with the ACI and using the welfare benefit plan and be carved out is number one.","Number two, with respect to group life, in terms of if you look over the last six to seven years and I appreciate using I would just a severity issue, how many standard deviations were we sort of off your average. And then lastly on the capital management because gettingthis ROE up seems to me an ongoing challenge. Mind your standing is rolling over the closed lock securitization doesn\u2019t make a lot of economic sense. Can you just sort of walk us through why that is as things getting paid down fairly rapidly. Thanks.","Rick McKenney","Good. Thanks, Colin. Let me just follow-up on your first question. We are actually participating when I talked about our activities in Washington. One, there is direct conversation that we have. Second is through our trade associations, ACI would be one of those. So we did not submit our own comment letter but we are very much part in that process. Let me turn over, Jack, talk a little bit about the group life.","Jack McGarry","At the group life standard deviation, we did you an analysis of that. It was close to within one standard deviation. So we were clearly within our 75% confidence into on the group life. It was high but not out of the realm. On the securitization of the closed lock, where that\u2019s being paid down we\u2019ll - we will continue to look at capital options for both the close visibility block and we\u2019re actively looking for capital options the long term care block as well. So it\u2019s clearly something that we consider, and we will look for opportunities going forward.","Colin Devine","Can we get still little deeper into the close block securitization because if I recall and it was done in time, its come right there and goes back to it as well. You freed up I think it was about $800 million of capital. And my understanding now is if you rolled it the number might be a 100 or something. Life has changed, is it the way you can use reinsurance and how the [indiscernible] regulators you are looking at it, what\u2019s the difference today versus when you did it. If you could be more specific that would be helpful.","Rick McKenney","I think Collin its Rick . just couple of things, one is the size of the relative block so I think the cash flow is coming that block that reduce significantly as that block has run down particularly as you look back seven years. So the cash that comes off that we generally is part of the securitizations what you are really securitizing is roughly half of what it was back then. So that\u2019s a biggest thing. So there is no change in the rules, no change in the views around that.","The second piece is the opportunity around is a much lower interest rate environment, so you think you have much better debt ability to much lower financing cost. It was done on a floating rate basis and so that was matched up early with floating rate assets. So you don\u2019t have that juice if you will as well. So there is benefit and I think there would be some benefits to relooking at that but it\u2019s more what is the magnitude of the those sides that we have out there.","Colin Devine","Okay. Well, then if that\u2019s not the option for you practically speaking are you explain selling off if you can part of the long-term care block, since that to me seems to be the only way the ROE is really going to start to move up.","Rick McKenney","I mean we would certainly entertain selling the long-term care block or reinsuring it, we\u2019re listening to the market, there are not a lot of buyers currently for particularly for big long-term care blocks. There have been a couple of very small transactions, they tended to be much older, more mature blocks. So we are actively there particularly if interest rates continue to rise, it makes that a more possible option in the market but there from what we\u2019ve seen there, they are just not the buyers yet on it.","Colin Devine","Okay. Thanks very much.","Rick McKenney","Thanks Colin.","Operator","And we will go now to Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Thanks good morning, just a quick follow-up on your buybacks. So year-to-date you are running at little bit north of $200 million and kind of towards the lower end of your $400 million to $600 million targets, how should we think about the pace of the buybacks for the remaining of the year and what would make you kind of maintaining a similar pace of the first two quarters or what will kind of push you more towards the upper end of the guidance?","Rick McKenney","Thanks Humphrey, Jack do you want to take that?","Jack McGarry","Yes we are very comfortable with our pace of buybacks currently, it is towards the lower end of the range, I think given our current stock price, given the current interest rate environment and given the activity that is going on within the insurance space, we think our current level of share repurchases strikes a good balance between financial flexibility of a company and good management of our capital levels.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on the long-term care cost, you mentioned you have been actively looking and but there assume not too many buyers, kind of in your estimate still talking about the price differences to ways apart and how is that trend kind of over the years, do you see that at least getting closer?","Jack McGarry","I think from my perspective, it is certainly interest rate rise the price difference gets closer in addition we have had two reductions in our discount rates on long-term care, so the spread between current rates and our discount rate gets closer that makes that option more viable. I frankly think that it has less to do with interest rates right now and more to do with comfort with the liability side and I think it is going to take some time in maturing of those blocks for people to get comfortable enough with it, that they will consider a purchase.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. And then just on the interest rate part for long-term care, I remember a couple of years ago you guys were thinking about potentially keeping in some interest rate for your long-term care block but at the rate - come through, do you see rates improved again, what matter would you consider that we should be putting in some interest rate hedges to shield some of the interest rates to your long-term care block?","Jack McGarry","I think interest rates need to rise, rise more, I think we are probably close at the end of 2014, we remember that tenure was just north of 3%, so it is within the realm and again as we lowered the discount rates, the hurdle rate for putting hedges on gets lower as well.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just a question on the relationship and if there is anyone on the 2014 very strong sales growth you had in U.S. Group and whether or not that is contributing at all to the elevated benefit ratios this quarter, do you see that as a pricing issue at all or do you still have even if will remain around this level, is that still a good enough of turn you would necessarily need to see rate actions?","Jack McGarry","We actually look at claims by year of issue, and there was no evidence that any of the problems"," that we saw in the group lines where the result of recent sales, was pretty random with that stuff showed up by year of issue.","Tom Gallagher","[indiscernible].","Rick McKenney","Yeah, no Jack said looking, you look at by issued here look at by industry geography and no concentration that was suggest that you had - underwriting quality or pricing issue in terms of what the trajectory of rate I mean if you look at particularly I think the disability market and you look at say look there is still work to be done pretty consistently on the interest rate front through the renewal program, persistence is done - is held up really nicely.","We would certainly planned to see that continue but, will be audit from our rate increase perspective to the existing clients for next two or three years. And then our new business we moved rates up at the end of 2014 and - up again here at the mid year and that\u2019s just to get its currently as possible on interest rates and also just to reflect that you got a slightly aging population and that\u2019s going to drive into down the road for us.","Tom Gallagher","And can you give some perspective on magnitude of a rate further renewals as they come through?","Rick McKenney","Yeah, so its mid to high single digits its pretty difficult and then for any particular pocket or client, you\u2019re going to see variance around that, but on average as we are.","Tom Gallagher","Is that change from were to been to say last year the year before to meet the high single digits?","Rick McKenney","Similarly it\u2019s edged update will be [indiscernible] as actually we would be done at extend of the programs, and so we are touching more clients than we had a year or two ago, but the average size increase pretty much in a range.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, and then I would also just to add a question on supplementary in voluntary business. Margins here have been quite good, and my first question is that you think that\u2019s a reasonable run rate from a margins stand point whether you are look at the loss ration or just the pre-tax earnings margin that you have been experiencing there and I guess the second question is just trying to rap my head around you know looking at how good these loss ratios are individual disability 30% interest adjust loss ratio and granted it\u2019s a much different business and you are close block which is running in the 80s, but I just - trying to think about is that a number that is going to go up a lot over time or is that kind of aware the business form a pricing standpoint.","Mike Simonds","Yes, it\u2019s Mike To, across - in that supplemental segment in across both the voluntary individual is actually quite different businesses, but with the [indiscernible] trend around here question which I say wouldn\u2019t expect any dramatic movement I would say in general over time we would see loss ratios about at that level just slightly increasing over time and that would be offset by efficiencies gained and so would see operating expense is come down a bit in those lines and as a net impact is to your question is those are good healthy margins and we would seek to maintain those bottom [ph] mix wills shift over time.","Tom Gallagher","And, are there just looking it\u2019s a 43% voluntary benefits loss ratio, I mean are there a minimum loss ratio considerations at all or is that non applicable to these lines of business.","Rick McKenney","Yes, I think we are generally, we are good shape there I would say in the quarter particularly elevated lapses in voluntary benefits until there is a release of active like reserves that pushed up more favorable benefit ration there that\u2019s our play in the quarter in particular, but now I think in general we are in pretty good shape in that voluntary benefits portfolio there is product release that are going in a pretty regular stream and there is going through all 50 state filings and looking at experience in [indiscernible] there.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Rick McKenney","Thanks.","Operator","And now we will go to Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","Good mornings everybody. I wanted to go back the elevated disability claims with this quarter and just wanted to got a sense are there any pockets of the market where you are seeking the claim size or incidence rate picking up.","Rick McKenney","It really as we look at by industry by size there wasn\u2019t really a pattern to it. So it appeared to us to be pretty much pure volatility. And the underlying piece too is the 50 basis points increase in the discount rate is going to drive your average size up itself now there is a little bit elevated about that. But that had a role to play in it as well.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. And then can you also maybe explain why the asset supporting group disability declined. I would have thought that\u2019d be up just given the sales growth and high persistency.","Rick McKenney","Yes. I mean that decline because the assets are more related to the reserves part in the business than it is the premium and so claim run offs with good recoveries as a reserves buying the business have been declining slightly and so the assets have been declining as well.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And finally, persistence is clearly still strong but still in the US was starting to see some declines in 2015 in short term visibility group life voluntary benefits. Do you see this is part of a broader trend or just normal volatility?","Jack McGarry","Yes. I think its normal volatility. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to watch very closely just linking it to back into the reprising for interest rates as we work through the block it\u2019s the balance between placing the rate increases and retaining clients through that process at 89.3% feel very good about where it sits at the moment. But we will continue to watch it really closely.","Yaron Kinar","Great. Thank you very much.","Rick McKenney","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Billingsley from Compass Point.","Ken Billingsley","Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up in your comments about the benefits or not giving the benefit from employment growth and a way to inflation, as employers and insurance brokers are not as focused on ACI are you seeing a shift and maybe their interest in pushing the benefit products or has that not actually translated yet.","Mike Simonds","Sure. It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. Actually demand for our products because we\u2019re think them as financial protection benefits is growing and so generally what we see is ACI is just been part of a long term trend towards the consumer or the employee driving benefits decisions. And what we see is when you put a employee in front of a healthcare decision, they are going to buy down on the healthcare and usually that means higher deductable, higher co-pay type insurances lower monthly premium, they use some of that savings to buy products that help fill some of those gaps.","So in general we see consumers with more interest in living benefits in particular supplemental health products, short term disability and like. Employers I think just as the economy is improving there is some of that slack is coming out of the labor market and so the need to attract, retained talent is hightened until doing so with employee choice option as an economic way to do it, so demand in the employer front is good.","And then, I think to your point in the question, what we seemed in the distribution channel with brokers is a pretty strong interest to diversify away their revenue from such dependent on healthcare commission. And I would say even as consolidation continues in that health market, that\u2019s going to put further downward pressure on healthcare commissions and creates a demand for other source as a revenue and that\u2019s where Colonial Life Unum products fit very nicely.","Ken Billingsley","With the penetration in some of these employers for ACI because they had to, are you seeing that this is transition in opening more doors for your products or maybe they weren\u2019t considered before or it has demand not necessarily increased.","Mike Simonds","Yes. I think it\u2019s not an overnight sensation but I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a building sense of demand. One interesting kind of coral area is ACI has brought a pretty step up compliance and regulatory requirements particular around keeping track of time. And so what more and more employers are looking to technology benefit administration, cloud based, HR, IR solutions and the like. Those are platform that we\u2019ve worked hard to build a relationship overtime with until that\u2019s opening up some interesting channels for us. So technology driven distribution of benefits and so again, I don \u2018t think that\u2019s an overnight explosive growth, but at the slow burn which I think is getting parts of the market, we had been too before.","Ken Billingsley","Okay, thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Erik Bass from Citi.","Erik Bass","Good morning, thank you. Given where interest rates are currently, do you anticipate there would be any need to make further adjustments to the new claims discount rates in the second half of this year?","Jack McGarry","We\u2019ll look at it, we will come to the end of the year, we do our annual claim review, reserve review in the fourth quarter, we have healthy margins currently in our interest margin, it is north of 95 basis points, so there is some room in there and we are optimistic that if perhaps the Fed begins to move in the second half of the year there is a little lift in the interest rates would help that a lot. So it is something that we are going to wait and see but we are comfortable with where we are, we are comfortable with our margin being at the higher end of we would like to see it and so I think we have some flexibility coming into the end of the year.","Erik Bass","Got it, thank you. And I guess just one question from Mike going back to the competitive dynamic, are you seeing or do you anticipate any impact from the recent or expected M&A in the group market?","Mike Simonds","Time will tell, I guess would be the quick answer is generally though when you see M&A it is going to be a pretty considerable distraction both acquiree and acquirer so that usually create some uncertainty and opportunity for players to stay focused through the period but again time will tell.","Erik Bass","Got it, thank you.","Mike Simonds","Thanks Erik.","Operator","We will take a question now from Mark Hughes from SunTrust.","Mark Hughes","Thank you, good morning. The commentary benefits sales down a little bit was that consistent with the broader competitive pressure or was it just less take rates from individuals, what was the dynamic going on there?","Mike Simonds","Yes, great thanks. I think it is a little bit of just quarter to quarter movement in sales trends, we had a really strong first quarter, I think year-to-date we are up 20% in voluntary benefit sales. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, second quarter tends to be a light quarter in terms of seasonality for that particular line, generally we feel good and you look at the pipeline, it looks good I think demand for products is high and we continue to invest in capabilities around product of distribution and probably it has done a little bit of more investing than we have in years past around consumer centric capabilities and driving up take rates, participation rates for new and for existing plans and we are starting to see some pretty encouraging things there. So little bit of also in the second quarter but I think the long-term trends are healthy.","Mark Hughes","Thank you.","Operator","And we will now take a question from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hey thanks good morning. Just want to follow up on the M&A commentary, I think you mentioned that you might have some debt capacity, your debt-to-cap ratio is around 25%, can you help us think about to how high you could bring that up if you done the deal that was attractive that required additional capital to finance?","Mike Simonds","Sure. When you think about the 25% we have today, it is kind of pure senior debt relative to our overall capital position, so there are different forms if you could take on and I think that the key about us being able to take it up from there is something we can do but it is also both at the longer term plan. So we say we feel good about 25% longer term if we take it up for a period of time for M&A and it comes back down in a pretty rapid basis we think that is just fine. So I want to approach top end range out there it is much more about the trajectory how we want to run it.","Ryan Krueger","Understood and then it has been a while since you have done an M&A, can you just, can you talk about your philosophy when it comes to evaluating M&A and accretion versus buyback and [indiscernible] that?","Mike Simonds","Well I think the first thing Ryan is when we look at M&A it is going to be above what is the strategic fit that we have with the overall company, so always at the start there and then very quickly go to the economics of the deal that you see out there. So I think about IRR, think about those things then you come relative to the use of capital, so we do compared to share repurchase which has been very good for us overtime so we\u2019re going to, we doing that as well and then we look at accretion, dilution I think those are important metrics for shareholders, those will be part of the mix as well but I take you back to number one is where is the fitness strategy and number two to the economics of the deal look like.","Ryan Krueger","And is else fair to assume that if you ware evaluating the M&A deal relative to buyback but you could probably deployed more capital into an M&A transaction and bring down your balance sheet metrics a little bit lower in an M&A deal then with buyback, from a rate giving our rating agencies and look at this.","Rick McKenney","I think it goes back to - the comment about is the long term to, so science about metrics on day one, what there expectations of those trends look like as well so I think - flexibility in there, it\u2019s a on exact science relative to share repurchase things like that but I think those are key [indiscernible] with you to help us think about different M&A transaction.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks. Appreciated.","Operator","Great. I will now take a follow up question from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Thanks. Just a quick follow up on M&A so you talked about you kind of look at different things and I just talk curious is there any particular business type that you will be more insisted in over analysis so may be, prevent more voluntary over for the share group or anything in terms of the business that will be more interested","Rick McKenney","Well, Humphrey as I said we\u2019re looking at how does it fitting with the overall strategy so all of the things that you mentioned our all part of our strategy, we are figuring out how we can reach more customers through the employer so when you take that as a broad scope that\u2019s we\u2019re going to look at. So I want to get more specific in that but we\u2019re going to stay true to working through the employer but there are lot of needs that can provided through the employer which will explore all of those.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thanks and then another thing upon your critical - I know one of your peers talked about, saying unfavorable, claims experience related to critical illness especially in the cancer coverage do you see anything kind of unusual or anything adverse or kind of resulting trend respect to kind of coverage for cancer treatments.","Rick McKenney","May be that\u2019s - Tim Arnolds talk about our Colonial IPO around our cancer product..","Rick McKenney","Yeah, right the cancer products continues to form very well we certainly stay [indiscernible] of developments in the medical field around cancer treatment and the impact that might have on our benefits cost but at this moment we\u2019re pleased with the direction of the product and increasingly it\u2019s a differentiator for us because there are on as many company at their offering as specific product line.","Humphrey Lee","Okay so but overall did the claims experience a largely in line with your expectation unless you don\u2019t see that kind of elevated cost related to treatments.","Rick McKenney","Correct, no","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Alright, thank you.","End of Q&A","Rick McKenney","Thanks Humphrey.

Please go ahead, sir.","Tom White","Great. Thank you, Don. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the first quarter 2016 earnings conference call for Unum.

As well as the CEOs of our core business segments, Mike Simonds for Unum U.S.; Peter O'Donnell for Unum UK; and Tim Arnold for Colonial Life.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Rick for his opening comments.","Rick McKenney","Great, thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. We're happy to be taking you through our first quarter results which were a strong start to the year. Overall, we saw first quarter operating income per share at $0.95 which was an increase of just under 7% over last year. There are continued positive operating trends underlying this. This starts with solid levels of premium growth across all three of our core business segments and also included stable benefits experience. This performance continues to drive strong profit margins and excellent capital generation for the Company, giving us lots of flexibility.","We've consistently said that our financial flexibility is an important asset. I believe our first quarter actions demonstrated that point, as we not only maintained capital deployment through share repurchases at a time when our shares were trading lower, but we also invested in our future growth with an announcement of our agreement to acquire Starmount Life Insurance Company. We believe this transaction will help us capitalize on the growth opportunity in the dental market which is very consistent with our employee benefits focus.","Now let's get to a few key highlights of the first quarter and then Jack will provide an analysis of our results in greater detail. To begin, I'd like to highlight the premium growth we continue to see in our core business segments. For the first quarter, premiums in Unum U.S., Unum UK and Colonial Life all showed very good momentum, with roughly 6% growth rates.","For Unum U.S., we generated premium growth of 5.8% for the first quarter, with good persistency trends, strong contributions from our renewal programs and pricing actions and our 2015 sales levels. New sales did decline in the first quarter due to some increased competition we're seeing in the market and also some difficult sales comparisons. It's an area where we will continue to be disciplined and we will continue to take price where we see it is needed. Unum UK premium growth in local currency improved 6.1% in the first quarter, with the benefit of the National Dental Plan acquisition we did in the middle of last year. And, finally, at Colonial Life, premium growth for the first quarter was 5.7%, driven by the very positive sales trends we have seen over the past two-and-a-half years which continued again this quarter, with a new-sales growth of 16%, our strongest rate of sales growth in many years.","Next, with this improvement in premium growth over the past several quarters, I'm especially pleased that we've maintained the profitability of our core business. I believe this demonstrates our disciplined approach to our markets and how we price, underwrite and go through our renewal process once we have placed business on our books. It can be challenging in today's low interest rate environment to continually move price increases into the market, but our teams are doing a commendable job of managing the balance required between generating top-line growth and maintaining profit margins. With these strong operating results, we continue to produce a very strong level of statutory earnings and capital which provides us substantial financial flexibility.","As I mentioned, this flexibility was especially evident this quarter with the repurchase of $100 million of our shares at very attractive levels. Along with the announcement of our planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company which we expect to close in the third quarter. The Starmount acquisition is consistent with our desire to invest in the growth of our core businesses and we believe will provide an attractive national platform for us and its scalable infrastructure to profitably grow in the dental market.","Starmount also brings a team that has a strong cultural fit with Unum and how we serve our customers. We're excited about the strategic transaction which will help us expand our customer relationships, both within Unum U.S. and Colonial Life operations. In addition to all this, our book value per share, excluding AOCI, continues to grow at a steady pace, ending the quarter at $36.68, an increase of 8.6% from a year ago. Overall, it was a very good quarter with our core operations driving steady, stable growth and our capital management actions continuing to deliver value for our shareholders.","So, with those highlights on a very good first quarter, let me turn the call over to Jack to cover our results in greater detail. Jack.","Jack McGarry","Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Rick provided a high-level overview of our first quarter results and now I want to provide a more in-depth view of the operating trends we saw in the quarter. I'll begin with Unum U.S., where first quarter operating income was $215.9 million, an increase of 0.7% from the year-ago quarter of $214.3 million. Premium income growth remained very healthy, increasing 5.8% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio for Unum U.S. segment was favorable, at 69.3% in the first quarter, although it was slightly higher than the very favorable 68.3% in the year-ago quarter. In addition, our focus on disciplined expense management also contributed to the operating results.","The profitability of Unum U.S. remains very strong, with an operating ROE of 14.4% for the first quarter, compared to 13.5% in the year-ago quarter. Within the Unum U.S. segment, operating income in our Group disability business was $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter of $74.3 million. Premium income increased 6.3% over the year-ago quarter, but we continue to see pressure on net investment income which declined by 3.4%, compared to the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by lower portfolio yields. The benefit ratio of 80.6% in the first quarter was at the favorable end of our expectations, although it was higher than the very favorable 80.1% benefit ratio we experienced in the first quarter of last year.","Group Life and AD&D operating income was $55.4 million for the first quarter, a decline of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. Premium income continues to grow, increasing 5% over the year-ago quarter. The benefit ratio was 71.5% for the first quarter, compared to 70.9% in the year-ago quarter, due to increased incidence and a higher average claim size. Operating income in the supplemental and voluntary lines was very strong at $90.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of 9.7%, compared to the $82.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Premium income growth trends were also strong in this line of business, increasing 5.7% in the quarter, compared to last year. From a benefits perspective, our overall results remain in line with our expectations.","The first quarter benefit ratio for the individual disability line was 50.9%, compared to 48.9% in the year-ago quarter, as new claim incidence rates were slightly higher. For the voluntary benefits line, the first quarter 2016 benefit ratio was 43.8%, compared to 40.9% in the year-ago quarter. Underlying claims experience for the voluntary line was stable in the quarter, with the increase in the benefit ratio being driven by the change in active life reserves, resulting from fewer policy terminations in the current quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter. Looking at Unum UK, operating income was \u00a323.5 million for the first quarter, an increase of 9.3% over the year-ago quarter of \u00a321.5 million. Premium income increased 6.1% over the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of NDP and growth in the group disability line.","The benefit ratio was 67.9% for the first quarter, compared to 65.3% in the year-ago quarter. Higher claims incidence trends in the group life line of business and the impact of inflation linked benefit changes were partially offset by more favorable experience in group disability. Overall, profitability of the Unum UK segment remains quite favorable with an operating ROE of 17.7% for the first quarter, compared to 16.1% in the year-ago quarter. Colonial Life again generated strong consistent results with operating income of $77.4 million, compared to $77.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The slight decline in operating income was driven by lower net investment income reflecting lower miscellaneous investment income. The benefit ratio improved to 50.9% in the first quarter, compared to 51.3% for the year-ago quarter, driven by favorable benefits experience in the Accident and Sickness and Critical Illness product lines.","Margins remain strong for Colonial Life with an operating ROE of 17.7%, compared to 16.9% in the year-ago quarter. Finally, for the Closed Block operating income was $33.7 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $26.7 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher miscellaneous investment income, compared to a very low level of miscellaneous investment income in the year-ago quarter. The underlying benefits experience for the individual disability line was in line with our expectations. The increase in the interest adjusted loss ratio to 84% in the first quarter, compared to 80% in the year-ago quarter, was largely driven by a reduction in the reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher level of bond calls and bond tenders we experienced during the first quarter of 2016.","For the long term care line, the interest adjusted loss ratio was 88.9% for the first quarter, compared to 87.3% for the year-ago quarter, resulting from a higher average submitted claim size. The underlying risk experience for long term care remains within our long term expected range of 85% to 90%. I'll move now to the growth trends we experienced across the Company in the quarter. Starting with Unum U.S., total sales declined by 4.5% for the first quarter compared to a year ago. This was not unexpected, as we had a very strong core market sales results a year ago first quarter and we continue to see the increased rates offset interest rate pressure. However, we also you saw increased competition in the quarter, particularly in the mid-market. ","Looking at the sales results by product line, LTD sales were flat in the first quarter, while STD sales declined 32.5% compared to the year-ago quarter. LTD sales improved in the large-scale segment, due to strong sales to existing customers, offsetting lower sales in the core market segment. Group life and AD&D sales declined 4.9% for the quarter, as we continue to take disciplined pricing approach to this market. Our individual disability sales increased 35.8%, compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by strong growth to existing customers. Finally, in the voluntary benefits product line, total sales declined 4.5% against a very strong first quarter last year which included a $25 million single large-case sale. Core market sales for voluntary benefits performed very well in the quarter, increasing 16%.","Our sales outlook for 2016 for Unum U.S. calls for growth in the 2% to 4% range again and it's likely we'll see quarterly volatility as we did in 2015, particularly given the volatility on the timing of large-case sales. Persistency for Unum U.S. continues at very healthy levels. For the group lines combined, persistency was stable at 88.8%. Voluntary persistency of 76.7% was favorable to prior-year results and individual disability persistency of 91.3% improved over the first quarter of last year. Given recent sales trends and strong persistency levels, along with the underlying management of our in-force renewals, we generated premium income growth of 5.8% for Unum U.S. this quarter. Sales in the UK were strong as well, increasing 16.4% in local currency, with favorable trends in core markets for both group long term disability and group life, along with the benefit of the NDP acquisition and an increase in other supplemental product sales. Persistency was favorable at 85.6%, due to improvements across the product lines. Given these trends, premium income growth for the UK this quarter was 6.1% in local currency.","Finally, Colonial Life sales remain on an accelerating trend, increasing 16% for the first quarter. Growth this quarter was [indiscernible] and well-balanced between the commercial sector, both core market sales and large-case sales and the public sector. In addition, each product line shows positive year-over-year growth trends. Persistency for Colonial Life was slightly lower across all product lines in the quarter, but it remains in line with our expectations. Premium growth continues to show good momentum, increasing 5.7% in the first quarter, compared to the year-ago quarter. ","Overall, we remain very pleased with the growth trends we see across our business segments, as well as the profit margins we're maintaining. Looking now at investment results, new money yields were pressured in the first quarter by declining yields for both 10-year and 30-year treasury, despite this, we're again able to slightly exceed the new-money yield assumptions we have for our long term care portfolio just as we did throughout 2015. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, I'd like to give you an update on our energy holdings. As we told you last quarter, we believe our energy exposure is very manageable within our existing capital plans. The sharp increase in oil prices since we last talked has further strengthened our outlook for the portfolio. The portfolio ended the quarter in a net unrealized gain position of $18.9 million, compared to a net unrealized loss position of $51.4 million at year-end 2015. The size of the portfolio also shrunk modestly.","During the first quarter, the rating agencies undertook a comprehensive review of energy credits. As a result of that review, along with other portfolio management actions, our below investment grade energy exposure increased by $66 million. The impact of all the rating changes to our RBC ratios for the traditional U.S. insurance companies was only 2 RBC points. It's worth noting that the impact of rating changes to RBC ratio is heavily impacted by a Company's ratio of C2 risk to C1 and C3 risk. Since we're more heavily weighted to C2 risk, the impact of these downgrades to our RBC ratio tends to be lower. Net-realized losses in the energy holdings from both gains and losses on sales, as well as other-than-temporary impairments, were $24 million pre-tax for the first quarter. These losses were partially offset by realized gains in the rest of the portfolio.","We continue to review our energy holdings and examine those holdings through a number of stress scenarios. Current oil prices are higher than our baseline scenario and our experience in the first quarter was consistent and in some cases better than we expected. In summary, we continue to believe that the capital impacts of our energy holdings are very manageable and do not alter our financial or capital plans. Moving to capital management. It was an active and very productive quarter for us. Our share repurchases totaled $100 million, with most of that activity occurring while the stock was trading up in February, thereby enabling us to buy the shares at an average price of just over $27 per share.","As a result, we retired 1.5% of our shares making a very productive use of our excess capital. In addition, as Rick highlighted, we announced the planned acquisition of Starmount Life Insurance Company which we believe will provide us with a platform to begin to develop a substantial national dental and vision business over time, benefiting the growth prospects for both Unum U.S. and Colonial Life. This transaction won't close until the third quarter and is being financed in such a way that we expect to remain well within our capital ranges while maintaining our share repurchase plans. Also on capital management, we typically see a reduction in our holding Company cash in the first quarter. This year we decided to maintain the dividends we take from our insurance companies in 2016 at approximately the same level as 2015, but we decided to adjust the quarterly pattern. Therefore, we took $179 million of dividends in the first quarter, about $35 million higher than the year-ago quarter.","As a result, our holding Company liquidity position remained stable at $478 million, compared to $475 million at year-end 2015. In addition, we've extended our $400 million credit facility by a new five-year period to provide added flexibility. The higher statutory dividend, along with the growth in previously discussed downgrades, caused our risk-based capital ratio to slightly lower, at approximately 390%, compared to approximately 400% at year-end 2015. We continue to target our risk-based capital ratio in a range of 375% to 400% for the year and holding Company liquidity is at least one times our holding Company cash-coverage needs of just under $300 million this year. Statutory after-tax operating earnings were quite strong for the first quarter at $184 million, compared to $158 million in the year-ago quarter, a nice 16% increase. Wrapping up, our expectations for the growth in after-tax operating income per share for 2016 is unchanged from what we discussed when we reported the fourth quarter which is a growth rate within a range of 3% to 6%.","Overall, it was a very good start to the year. We're pleased with the operating results and feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Rick.","Rick McKenney","Thank you, Jack. Before we go to your questions, I would just reiterate how pleased we're with the first quarter performance, good premium growth, stable benefits experience, strong capital generation and in addition, we're finding good ways to put that capital to work, both through returning it to shareholders, as well as investing in future growth.","So with that, we'll move now to your questions. I'll ask Don to begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John Nadel","I guess the only real area of focus I've got in the numbers is that the last few quarters now, in the closed block, the long term care benefit ratio has been hovering in that 88% to 89% range. So, it's toward the upper end of your 85% to 90% expectation. Is there anything of worry there when you look, underlying that benefit ratio, in terms of some of the underlying trends there?","Jack McGarry","Yes, John, I'll take that. We're not really seeing anything in underlying trends. There's some volatility in the results we see, but if you look at over the average, it's pretty close to being right in the middle of that range which is where we're comfortable. And we have seen it bounce around quarter to quarter.","Rick McKenney","I think, John, you highlighted the last three quarters. But if you went to the beginning of last year, we actually saw very favorable results. So it's like this block with [indiscernible], you've got to take a longer term view to it.","John Nadel","Just wanted to check that box. Then the only other question I've got is maybe, Mike, some commentary on what you're seeing in sort of the competitive environment. I mean, I know there are some impact on your sales, probably just from comparisons being tough from the year ago, but can you give us some color around sales and sales outlook.","Mike Simonds","I guess I would start by just saying we feel really good about the strengths of the product portfolio and expanding product portfolio. The distribution relationship's rock solid in the service proposition, so, I think that's just important context. As you highlighted, we do have a tough comparison in the first quarter. A year ago, sales were up in the high teens. But even given the tough comparison, if you sort of unpack the aggregate sales number here in first quarter of 2016, there's some pretty encouraging trends within our [indiscernible] and voluntary segment, we saw VB, as Jack highlighted, grow by 16% in the core and actually large case VB had really good momentum as well.","We had a $25-million sale last year to an existing client. To give you a sense, this year our biggest VB sale was just a little under $4 million. So, broad-based, I think, traction and success with voluntary. And also in the segment, recently issued IDI sales were up 36% and that's been a really good story for us and fits with our strategy of selling multiple lines into existing clients. As you highlighted, the soft spot for us was new group insurance sales and we felt that most acutely in what we would call the midmarket which is sort of employers 250 to 2,000 lives. To give you a sense, proposal activity in that segment was actually up in the low double digits. So, good traction in terms of taking good looks at opportunities, but our ability to close that business was definitely constrained by an increasingly aggressive underwriting environment out there.","We saw that materialize a bit in the second half of last year and it's definitely persisted here into the first quarter of 2016. We have seen this cycle many times. So, we're going to maintain our discipline. We'll certainly look to write business where we can do so profitably, but we're going to have to, I think, keep a real close eye on it. Group insurance, this is our smallest sales quarter of the year, so a lot of work to transpire between now and the end of the year, but the competitive market is one we're going to watch really closely on the new sales front.","I guess the final thing I'd say is renewal placement activity, another place where you'd see competition, we were really pleased with the ability to place rate increase due to the interest rate environment and persistency hanging in just a tick below 90%, earned premium growth up about 6%, feel good in aggregate, but watching the new sales environment is going to be really important.","Operator","We'll go next to Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet Kamath","Just given the current interest rate environment and how much things have changed since the end of the year, Jack, would you envision a discount rate adjustment as we get into the fourth quarter which is when I think you usually take a look?","Jack McGarry","Interest rates have gone down. Spreads have moved. It would be early to anticipate an interest rate, discount rate adjustment. Actually, our interest margin and LTD has held in very nicely over the past couple of quarters and so we will look at it at the end of the year. It's always a game-time decision. But there isn't anything startling about the impact of the first quarter that would drive us in one direction or the other.","Rick McKenney","Suneet, I think I'd just add to that, our margin, the one metric you could look at, there's a lot of things that go into our decisioning process actually got better. From 81 to 86 basis points. So, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in the first quarter.","Suneet Kamath","And then just shifting to the closed block IDI. In the December Investor Day you talked about some strategies maybe to try to get some capital out of that business. Is that really an interest rate driven kind of an event. In other words, in order to execute a strategy you'd need to see higher rates? Or is there -- I guess that's the question.","Jack McGarry","No, I would say that's more of a capital-driven event. The IDI closed block reserves get treated as disability reserves, from an RBC Capital perspective. Anyone who is over age 65 in that block and has a lifetime benefit is really an annuity, as opposed to a disability reserve. And so, our view is that given the stability of the risk there, it gets over-capitalized by the risk-based capital ratios. And so, it's trying to figure out if we can do something about that.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. So, any strategy that you pursue is not going to be reliant on the level of rates.","Jack McGarry","No.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just the last one. In the past, you've given us sort of the quarterly view of long term care GAAP versus Stat reserves. Is that something that you could share with us again this quarter?","Jack McGarry","Yes. So, the difference. It is creeping up. It's probably somewhere around 800 range this quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","So, I realize it's only one quarter, but still results came in above the midpoint of guidance despite interest rates coming in as a significant headwind. Can you maybe highlight some of the things that went better than planned and also maybe remind us what the underlying interest rate assumption is for the guidance?","Jack McGarry","We actually don't take an underlying interest rate assumption. When we set our plans, we assume that the interest environment we're going to face in the future is consistent with the one we're currently in. That's what went into our 2016 plan. Some of the things that went well, we talked about expenses, were favorable. Our tax rate was not out of the ordinary, but was slightly favorable as well. We had good risk results across the board. So, there was pretty much no dip in the risk that some of the line needed to make up. From our perspective, it was just a quality quarter, throughout.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then on the expense side, was the decrease in other expenses as a percentage of revenues, was that a function of just lower sales or was there also other expense management initiatives involved there?","Jack McGarry","No, clearly, we have a focus as a Company on being as efficient as we possibly can. That wasn't sales related. It was more related to just our ongoing pursuit of becoming more efficient as a Company.","Operator","We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had a couple of questions. First, just on group disability margins, obviously, they've improved steadily over the past few years. And improved again in the first quarter. So, to what extent do you think sub-81% level is a sustainable level in the group disability benefits ratio?","Mike Simonds","We did have a good risk quarter in group disability, actually, first quarter of last year was exceptionally good. I would say the group disability loss ratio is going to move 1 point or 2 around that 80% to 82% range. There's a little bit of seasonality as we go you through the summer months. I'd expect some of our paid incidents to pick up just a little bit if prior year proves out. Over time the improvement in the loss ratio that you're citing, a lot of that is us taking rate action in the book to account for interest rates.","So, as our net investment income is falling, we're making up with that through price levels which shows up in our loss ratio. So, I would characterize it as a good, solid to slightly favorable risk quarter and within our targets, looking forward.","Jimmy Bhullar","And any changes in your views on your long term care reserves if we stay at these types of interest rate levels, what's the likelihood for you looking at your GAAP reserves for long term care and then also is it fair to assume that you'd end up adding to stat reserves for the New York sub, if we're at rates close to these levels through the end of the year?","Jack McGarry","I don't think the levels we're at are dramatically different than the levels that we based our last calculation of the New York subs. So, I'm not feeling pressured around that. In terms of the long term care, we said pretty clearly that when we set that reserve, we assumed we'd be in a level interest rate environment for the next four to five years and then we'd gradually revert to a mean over time. We're in that level interest rate environment. Last year for the full year, as well as in the first quarter, we were able to put out new money at a level that was consistent with the reserve assumption that went in there. If it lasts forever, yes, there's going to be some impact. But right now we're pretty comfortable with where we're in the guidance we gave.","Jimmy Bhullar","Lastly, on group life you saw an uptick in the benefits ratio there. Was that mortality? If you could give us more details on what you saw.","Mike Simonds","A little bit adverse, although we talk about that business being a 70% to 72% benefit ratio. We found ourselves just at the top end of that range. It was a little bit of incidence but average size or severity was more the culprit this quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Kovak with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kovak","Just one on capital here. Can you provide us an update, maybe in a little more detail, in terms of how you're thinking about sort of the uses of capital, understanding you didn't really change your share repurchase plans with the acquisition of Starmount, but theoretically some of these capital could have potentially been used for additional repurchases below book value. Can you just update us on your thoughts there?","Jack McGarry","I think our thoughts -- it's pretty consistent with what we've always stated about our uses of capital, that the first place we want to put it to work is in the growth of our businesses. And Starmount through an acquisition provided a great opportunity to do that. We're really excited about the platform that brings to the table and the growth prospects we'll have. We have a large improving distribution system in the dental market. We've had a partnership with united Concordia for some time now.","And so, we're excited about what that brings to the table. So, when we look at that long term value versus a share repurchase, it felt like the right thing to do for us. Again, share repurchase, we understand is important. We'll continue to return capital to shareholders to the extent we have excess capital, but it's a notch below opportunities like Starmount.","Michael Kovak","And then shifting gears, on the long term care business can you give us a sense of any of the progress you've made on rate increases in terms of filings, the percentage of approvals and, potentially, price increases relative to the requests that you've made?","Jack McGarry","Yes, we continue to make significant progress on rate increases. We had built assumptions about the approvals we would get into our reserve assumptions when we took the charge in 2014. Our experience has been very consistent or maybe slightly favorable to that. We think the market for rate increases is actually continues to improve. More and more the states that aren't allowing rate increases are becoming the outliers, as opposed to the states that are. So, we feel good about where we're, we feel good about our assumptions and we feel good about rate increase prospects going forward.","Michael Kovak","And on that, have you seen any shift in terms of whether you're able to get the percent that you're requesting today versus, potentially, I think you've talked about in the past, shifting the benefit, can you sort of give us any of the change in dynamic there?","Jack McGarry","In our last rate increase we filed what we called the lending spot, where our person had the choice of either accepting the rate increase or reducing their future inflation option from 5% to 3%. We've had very good success with that as a result of providing that option, I think it's far more likely that states will award us the entire rate increase that we asked for. Some states spread that out over a couple of years, over a three-year period, as opposed to all at once. And we've had very good uptake on that option. So, there's a lot of customers that are availing themselves of it. And that's favorable for us. We're kind of neutral from a financial perspective, but it does reduce the future liability when they take the option. And so, you do get a decrease in exposure as a result.","Michael Kovak","So, as that's implemented should we expect that to roll through the financials? Can you discuss how that would be impacting your loss ratio?","Jack McGarry","It's not going to impact GAAP results significantly, because it was already assumed in the reserve assumptions. To the extent -- due to rate increases that weren't assumed or we exceed those expectations, you'd see some of that in loss ratio. But I wouldn't anticipate a big change.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just a question on the organic growth in the quarter. Can you comment in terms of the wage growth or employment growth that you see in your premium numbers?","Mike Simonds","I'll take that one. We've talked about it over the last couple of years, moving from a little bit of a drag to a little bit of a lift. I think he's that's what we saw play out here. I would say while we've seen macroeconomic employment growth, a lot of that growth has come from part-time, nontraditional and contract workers, where that's not as big a part of our block, but we have started to see some of that wage come through. I would sort of be thinking of it in the 1% to slightly under that kind of lift. It varies a bit by product.","Humphrey Lee","Also there seems to be an elevation in unemployment rates in the oil patch states. Can you remind us your exposure to those states in general, so in addition to the oil -- to the energy sector, but to the broader employment markets in those states?","Mike Simonds","Yes, sure thing. I think I got the question, Humphrey but tell me if I missed it. Our exposure we would watch most closely is our disability exposure. It's about 2% or a little under of our book. That's looking primarily in Texas and up in the Dakotas. We've actually been watching the incidence, even on that small sliver and we're doing pretty well.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","This is one of the best sales quarters you've had at Colonial in quite some time. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit and give us some more color on the underlying drivers.","Tim Arnold","I think there are a number of factors, Ryan. Certainly favorable market conditions for the voluntary product are helping us. We believe we have a strong strategy and plan for serving all size segments of the commercial and public sector markets. Colonial Life has a proven track record of working with brokers and serving employers on a direct basis as well. We have a complete and competitive suite of group and individual products, strong portfolio of value-added services for employers and employees. A heavily customer-focused employee culture here in Columbia and throughout the organization. We have national enrollment capabilities and a national footprint for enrollment which allow us to serve new and existing customers with face-to-face telephonic, web chat and Internet based self-serve options.","Finally and perhaps most importantly, we have a growing focus and highly effective national sales team. So, very pleased with the first quarter results. I would tell you the year is young and so we'd guide people to the upper end of the range that we shared back in the investor meeting in December of around 8% for the year, probably.","Ryan Krueger","And then just a follow-up on the new money rate comment. Can you just give us a sense of what type of new money rates you're getting on the cash flows back in long term care at this point. I think you had talked about, I think you got around 5% maybe last year, but can you comment on what you're getting kind of today.","Jack McGarry","Yes, 5% is the bogie that we have out there that was what was underlying the reserve assumption and we slightly exceeded it in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Berg with RBC.","Eric Berg","My first question relates to Starmount and the dental insurance business, in general. It would be my sense that dental insurance is a fairly penetrated marketplace. It would be my sense that pretty much every major corporation in America offers it. Where is the opportunity? Is this, like group life, a takeaway business? I mean, I certainly understand the idea that your distribution is broader and probably deeper than the acquiries at Starmount, but is this a growing business?","Mike Simonds","I think your sense is right when you get into the large end of the market, generally, it is a fully penetrated dental and vision business. There is still a reasonable amount of GAAP in terms of coverage as you move down into the small end of the market. I would say one of the key trends I'd point to is the growth in voluntary dental business. Vision is very often voluntary. So, when you think about the opportunity for Unum and Colonial Life, it's about adding two important and employee high demand products into the portfolio and then leveraging client -- distribution client relationships and enrollment capabilities.","So, when we can sit down and walk an employee all the way through a benefits package and really be able to tick off all of the non-retirement, non-major medical categories, I think we see a lot of upside opportunity there.","Eric Berg","One question for Jack and that will wrap up for me. With respect to the closed block as a follow-up to the earlier question, I think you said that the reserves are considered disability reserves. First question of two in this area, that wouldn't relate to long term care. In other words, your comment about, again, the closed block reserve is being treated for statutory purposes as disability reserves, I'm presuming you meant only -- you were speaking only about the disability business.","Jack McGarry","Yes, I was talking about the old IDI block in terms of that. For long term care, most of the reserves in long term care are active life reserves. They're not disabled claim reserves.","Eric Berg","Right. And so just as a follow-up then and this will wrap up for me, just as a follow-up to this question. It's not interest rate related, it's more a matter of freeing up some of the capital associated with what you folks perceive to be reserve, excess of reserve redundancy, because of the age of the disabled individuals. Where are you in this process? We're four months after your Investor Day. Are you further along and are you optimistic about doing -- how would you characterize your sentiment about the probability of doing a transaction this year and where are you in the process? Thank you.","Jack McGarry","I would say, Eric, it's a work in progress. We continue to look at options. There's a lot of capital in the closed block between long term care and IDI and we're continuing to look at options on both sides of the equation. So, I think it's early on in the process.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. At this time, we'll go to our next question with Seth Weiss with Bank of America.","Seth Weiss","I want to ask about just net investment income again and I recognize it's a challenging interest rate environment. I suppose I was a little alarmed at the differential between your premium growth in the U.S. at about 6% and the decline in net investment income which was 3.5%, so it's almost a 10% differential there. Perhaps I'm thinking about it wrong, but could you discuss the falling net investment income maybe within that context and let us know if it was alarming to you as well, internally?","Jack McGarry","Yes, Seth, it wasn't alarming to us. Couple of things drive it. One is, particularly in Unum U.S., the change in miscellaneous net investment income. We were kind of average overall, but a ton of it showed up in the closed block with less in places like Unum U.S. and Colonial, that's a piece of the driver.","The other piece of the driver is because of the risk management efforts in Unum U.S., LTD reserves are actually going down and have been for a while. And so that's a big driver of net investment income, too. So, even though our margins are actually went up during the quarter, the asset base that we earned those margins on went down. So, it's not rate driven as much as it's some other factors.","Seth Weiss","And if you could just remind us on the pace of the decline in the reserves in LTD and where that's -- directionally, how that's moving over the next year or two.","Jack McGarry","You know, I mean, I don't have that offhand. We can get back to it, but it's been pretty steady, the quarterly reduction. We can get back with a number.","Tim Arnold","Seth, you can see the reserves in the statistical supplement. We have those broken out, so you can see that for group disability.","Rick McKenney","I think it's important, Seth, the point that Jack made which is our net income or net investment income is going to trend with those reserves, not with premiums. Those are the two things to keep in mind.","Operator","We'll go to our next question with Ken Billingsley of Compass Point.","Ken Billingsley","Just had one question. MetLife announced that they're exiting individual disability. Can you talk about that, any opportunities there? I don't know how large of a player they were versus what you were seeing, but is there any opportunity or any reasons why they're exiting that's something that maybe is impacting you guys?","Mike Simonds","So, we saw that move. I think you can almost think of it the same way that we think about individual disability. There's really two businesses. One is a single life direct to the individual business and you'd have to engage the team at MetLife. My sense is that's the business that they're taking a step back from. There remains an employee benefit, multi-life individual product, that's what's sold at the work site to typically mid to high earners. That's the business we characterize as recently issued.","It has been a market that's sort of been a slow-growth market that ticked up a bit and it's been a really good story for us here at Unum. I mentioned sales were up about 36% in the first quarter, most of that coming off block growth opportunities. Often, it's cross-sold with our group insurance and voluntary lines and we've got it to a place now where the top line is growing about 5%. It's a good market for us. I don't think that particular move that you mentioned with Met is going to have a big impact for us, but it remains a market that we're pretty excited about.","Operator","That concludes today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll return the call to Tom White for any concluding remarks.","Rick McKenney","Actually this is Rick. I'll take it. Thank you all for taking the time to join us this morning. We're actually over the next couple months going to see many of you at various investor conferences and meetings and we look forward to taking you through some more detail and our progress as we move forward. Thank you very much. That concludes today's call.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
