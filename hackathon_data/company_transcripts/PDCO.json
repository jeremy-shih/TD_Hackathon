Please standby. We are about to begin. Good day everyone, and welcome to the Patterson Companies Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Announcement. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Wright. Please go ahead.","John Wright","Thank you, Kim. Good morning everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Gugino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 second quarter, which exclude the impact of one-time transaction related costs, deal amortization as foreign currency. Additionally, our discussion of result is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical, as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release.","Today's earnings announcement and our discussion also reflects the realignment of our reportable segments. In additional to our Dental segment, as we previously described, our companion-animal business and our new production animal distribution business are reported as the Patterson Animal Health segment.","Our other and more centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the Dental segment are now being reported in a separate corporate segment. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson.","Scott Anderson","Thank you, John. Welcome everyone to today's conference call. We've reached the midway point in a pivotal and exciting year for Patterson Companies in each of our two businesses, Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health.","Since, we completed the acquisition of Animal Health International in June, we've taken a thoughtful and disciplined approach to bring the production animal business together with our legacy companion animal operations.","As all of you know, meeting key milestones is critical for the successful integration. We are pleased to say that we achieved several of these milestones in the fiscal 2016 second quarter.","During the quarter, we made substantial progress on the headquarters relocation of our new Animal Health segment, and are well on our way to consolidating the segments functions in Greeley, Colorado.","We integrated and solidified our Animal Health leadership team. It's worth emphasizing that the combination of Patterson Veterinary with the Animal Health International has led to what we believe is the strongest leadership team in the Animal Health industry.","We completed the integration of our production and companion animal sales forces. We've also made significant progress on our IT system conversions. Let me assure you that we are 100% focused on serving our customers. Of course, we have milestones ahead of us. With these accomplishments under our belts. I believe that Patterson Companies is heading into the second half of fiscal 2016 with the strong ability to execute and grow with momentum.","In terms of the company's financial performance during the quarter, consolidated sales from the continuing operations rose 44% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting Animal Health International acquisition. Our adjusted earnings from continuing operations grew 27% to $0.56 per diluted share.","Let me spend a few moments on things we're seeing our business on a macro level. The market fundamentals we have experienced for the past several quarters largely continued in Q2. In dental and on the companion-animal side of our Animal Health business, we saw a stable to strengthening market conditions in North America. We believe these portions of our businesses will continue to benefit from the gradually improving job market and its positive impact on consumer's spending for dental services and pets.","When we added production animal to our business mix, we not only diversified our product and service offerings, but also diversified the market drivers that affect us. Our production animal business space is a different set of market dynamics in cyclical factors. As we explained in some detail during the last month's Analyst Day, short-term factors can affect the timing of the production in animal revenues. However, we're also not tied to the compelling long-term trend for an ever higher global animal protein demand. Demand, the U.S. livestock industry will play a lead role in satisfying. This brings to Patterson a promising new long-term growth catalyst.","With that backdrop, let's take a look at our segments, starting with Dental. This quarter, Dental represented just less than half of our total sales. The consolidated sales performance on a constant currency basis reflected several factors. First, our sales growth in consumables was a solid 3.3% in constant currency and consistent with prior quarters. We are encouraged by the stability of the consumable market and look to continue to grow our businesses as we help our customers grow their practices.","Second, dentists continue to see technology of the high priority areas of investment. Again this quarter, we are encouraged by technology sales in particular our CEREC sales among new users. We faced a significant comparison from the year ago quarter, and are very pleased we have improved over the last year. And we entered the calendar year buying season with high confidence.","The CEREC 30 event in September was an important success evidenced by the strong attendance and enthusiasm of over 6,000 dental professionals. It is clear that this growing CEREC community is not only passionate about high quality chair side dentistry, but is also taking a leadership role in the advancement of digital dentistry.","As mentioned, we saw a very strong new user demand, but trade up activity to Omnicam during the quarter was lower than we anticipated. Our Bluecam customers continue to have a very high level of satisfaction with the product. However, we believe the benefits and growing feature differentiation of the Omnicam, will create strong upgrade demand over time.","On the traditional equipment side of the business, we're in the process of broadening the portfolio of products we can now offer to our customers. In addition to our valued and strategic relationship with A-dec, a wider range of offerings now include new relationships and opportunities such as with Pelton & Crane, the Belmont Company and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment.","We are seeing early success in gaining access to more customers through this offering. While our revenue in this category declined moderately in the quarter, we are very pleased to have increased our unit volume across the chair, dental unit and cabinetry categories as we now address a wider range of customer needs.","We are very excited to have begun training on the Sirona lines of equipment this quarter. The TENEO and INTEGO products allow us to offer our customers a new level of seamless technology integration in their practice. Initial reaction to the products from our sales force and customers has been very encouraging. We began installing initial sales of this product in November. Bottom line is, we believe no company has a more compelling portfolio of products for the dental community than Patterson.","We dedicated a week in late September for our first North American dental sales meeting. This was a great opportunity to have over 1,800 Patterson sales people get aligned on the significant opportunity in front of our customers and Patterson. Our industry best sales force is absolutely committed to advancing dentistry, growing market share and supporting our customers' business needs.","We are confident in our ability to build on this growth in the second half of our fiscal year where historically the greater percentage of our sales occur. The breadth of our offerings and commitment to exceptional service continues to make Patterson the partner of choice for dentists investing and modernizing their practices and enhanced patient experience and outcomes.","Moving on now to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment represented about 56% of total revenues and more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Our companion animal business continues to benefit from the trends of both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership and spending. Setting aside the acquisition's revenue contribution and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships. Sales in the legacy companion-animal business improved 3% in constant currency during the quarter. U.S. companion-animal performed very well growing organically by 5%. Like last quarter, this growth was partially offset by a milder flea and tick season this year in the United Kingdom compared to last year.","Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and in a differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 17% in local currencies. Our progress continues with Abaxis, a market leader in the point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market, and medical and research customers. While pleased with our Abaxis placements, which include a full line of a veterinary diagnostic products including external reference lab services, and in-clinic testing, we know there is more opportunity in front of us, and we are focused on increasing our sales effectiveness in this area.","As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added $414 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. Keep in mind, what we discussed that at our recent Analyst Day, when we describe the factors unique to this business that can affect timing of product demand and our resulting revenue. For example, during the second quarter cattle producers benefited from the seasonably what milder weather that enable them to leave their herds in the field longer than usual. This factor delays the sales of pharmaceuticals that would need to be applied, when the herds move from outdoor grazing areas to their field lots. While these delays impacted sales in the pharmaceutical category, our diversified portfolio of products and services help us to navigate the natural cycles our customers will experience. While we know end market pricing and customer profitability are currently soft compared to historical levels.","Customers only make minor spending adjustments as they manage the health of their animals over the long term. Most importantly, we now possess the foremost production animal business in North America. And we're especially pleased that how well we executed in the market while dealing with all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we've made the progress we expected in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials.","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, there were several great spots in Patterson Companies financial performance in our second quarter at Marriot [indiscernible]. As we outlined the last quarter, we have some added complexity in our results related to a few items, namely the divestiture of our Medical business and the acquisition of Animal Health International. Therefore, as a reminder, I'll concentrate my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the newly transformed Patterson Companies. Where appropriate, I'll refer to organic sales to provide a more normalized view of sales performance.","With respect to our top and bottom line, we reported consolidated sales from continuing operations that totaled nearly $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis. We're encouraged by the fact that organic growth on a consolidated basis was 3.3%, up sequentially from 1.8% in the first quarter. This quarter's performance also reflects a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International. On a consolidated basis, the currency translation reduced sales by approximately 3%.","We continue to anticipated that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.56.","Now turning to margins. Our consolidated operating margins for the quarter excluding the Animal Health International acquisition averaged 8.1% or 40 basis point improvement over the prior year. This improvement was led by gross margin expansion of a 120 basis points, reflecting solid margin expansion within both of our business segments.","I want to point out that we achieved 40 basis points of operating margin expansion in spite of an anomalous spike in employee health insurance claims, which totaled approximately $5 million in the quarter. While these claims affected the quarter, we do not believe the impact will be ongoing. The Animal Health International acquisition give Patterson a much broader base of revenue and growth opportunity, but at a lower margin.","When we include the acquisitions, operating margins in the quarter declined from 8.1% to 7% and gross margins in the quarter are reduced from 27.7% to 23.8%. Year-over-year operating profit increased 30%.","Now let's turn to our segment. In our Dental segment, organic sales improved 3.1% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.3% reflecting continued stability in this end market.","As Scott noted, our overall equipment sales this quarter were up 2%, and driven by technology. Traditional equipment was negatively impacted by a shift in mix. We have strategically broadened our product line with new manufacturers to offer a wider range of price point. Their sales grow double-digits among new users demonstrating continued strength in this technology adoption.","Dental growth margins were up 50 basis points over the prior year. Operating margins declined 10 basis points year-over-year, after absorbing the entire incremental costs related to our National Sales Meeting.","Turning next to our Animal Health segment. Organic sales methods exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacture change to Abaxis.","On a constant currency basis, organic sales in the segment rose over 3% for the quarter, mainly driven by two factors. Solid growth in both the U.S. consumables and equipment offerings. Organic sales from the legacy U.S. companion-animal business expanded 5%. This was partially offset by only modest growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the UK, which face a tougher comparison this year you see a last year's more intense flea and tick season","As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period, which totaled $440 million. With that contribution failed to the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from that prior year.","Operating margin within the Animal Health segment rose 40 basis points, primarily driven by increases in operating margins in the companion-animal business. In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. We anticipate full year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. We are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve previously announced synergies of between $20 million and $30 million over a three year period.","And now for few balance sheet and cash flow items. We use operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter of $53 million versus generating $98 million in the prior period. This swing is due to our investment in inventories for the Animal Health business and to support new equipment product launches in preparation for the peak selling season in the Dental business.","We continue to expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow for the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.","Second quarter CapEx totaled $24 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate wide information technology initiatives. For the 2016 fiscal year, we're currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. As you know, during the quarter, we completed the sale of Patterson Medical to Madison Dearborn Partners for $715 million in cash. This sale gave us the opportunity to quickly de-lever and immediately apply the net proceeds from the sale to reduce the debt incurred to help fund the acquisition of Animal Health International.","Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $221 million for our shareholders through a combination of $45 million in dividends and a $176 million of share buybacks.","I'll wrap up with a discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance.","Based on our performance in the first half of fiscal 2016, and expectation for second half results, we are maintaining our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range assumes stable North American and international market, includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016, and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. Let me reiterate that due to sales patterns in equipment, we expect sales in the back half of the fiscal year to be stronger than the first.","Our guidance range excludes one-time transaction related costs, integration expense, deal amortization, non-recurring IT training costs and tax costs related to cash repatriation.","With that I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Ann. As I mentioned earlier in today's call, we now enter the second half of the fiscal year which is traditionally stronger from a sales perspective. We do feel from a position of strength. In Dental, we have momentum and are optimistic that dentists will continue to place the priority on technology investments, to help propel their practices to greater levels of productivity.","We are well positioned to capitalize on this trend toward the ever more digital dental practice. Our broader equipment offerings and more diverse product portfolio now appeal to a much larger number of customers. This creates new opportunities for us that are well timed for the second half of the fiscal year. In Animal Health, the integration work is going smoothly, and we are pleased with the synergies, we are capturing. We will continue to drive the current pace of activity. I could not be more pleased as to how our newly formed teams are working together.","We believe, we have the most formidable Animal Health offering in North America and the United Kingdom with strong leadership to drive this business. Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource planning initiative, and are on-track for pilot testing over the next couple of months. Animal Health International has experienced with its own ERP initiative has been highly instrumental in affirming our approach. We intend to diligently execute on our capital allocation strategy. In this quarter, we demonstrated confidence in our future, by investing in our business, paying dividends and repurchasing shares. Together, these three components, will continue driving long-term shareholder value.","Before, we open up the call for questions, I am delighted to welcome John Wright, as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. John joins us from the Toro Company, where he held a variety of leadership roles over 19 years, including time in investor relations. We look forward to the expertise and dedication he will bring to this role.","Now, we'd like to open up to questions. So, I'll turn the call back over to Kim.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations to John on the hire. I guess, Scott, starting off, could you talk a little bit about the Animal Health business. So, $414 million of revenue was much little bit higher than we're expecting. How's that tracking relative to your expectations, and I guess, how should we think about that trajectory for the full year?","Scott Anderson","I'll say, we're, as I said in our prepared comments, Kevin, a lot was accomplished in the quarter. And I think, well, we are very pleased that as well we accomplished the lot in terms of integration activity and just change management, our sales people remain very focused on helping their customers. So, I would say, we're very pleased on how we begun the year, and I think, we'll give more color to the sales volumes as we grow through the second half of the year, but I'll just start by saying, we can be more pleased that how well we started off.","Kevin Ellich","Great. And then with your prepared comments you talked about the milder weather, so the total cattle run probably took place a little bit later. So, should we actually expect Animal Health International revenues to increase sequentially since we should see more pharmaceutical sales in Q4, when those cattle move into the feed lots?","Ann Gugino","Yeah, Kevin, this is Ann. So, what I would say as you will see, I don't know that you would necessarily see a sequential improvement. When I look at the model, the revenue is actually fairly consistent quarter-to-quarter. So, I think it's fair to look at this quarter's contributions and kind of look at that as what we would expect in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. I think while there is some timing, because of the cattle run like Scott suggested, there is also some softness in the end markets around like milk prices. So, when you kind of add all the balance together, I guess what I would say and guide you is that the third quarter and fourth quarters should have volumes similar to what you're seeing in the current quarter.","Kevin Ellich","Got it. And then Ann, since they had - have, could you talk about the 5 million of the healthcare claims. I guess what sort of items jumped out as you guys in terms of causing with higher healthcare claims and which line item did that show up, and was that your operating expense or did that actually hit some place in the cost of sales?","Ann Gugino","Sure. So, I would start out by saying, we're self-insured for health insurance claims up to a certain point and the individual claim and then it kept off. And unfortunately, this wasn't usually high quarter for us. So, historically, the company's averaged about a say a 4% to 5% increase in the healthcare costs over the past several years annually. And in the current quarter, what happened is - as we saw a number of large claims, what they call them, catastrophic claims that were far accessed of what we've experienced in current - in recent years. So, specifically, we saw a 35% spike in the number of high dollar catastrophic claims, which cost us about $5 million. And to answer your question, most of that hit in the corporate segment, I don't have the exact correct number, but most of it hit in the corporate and the operating expense lines. And I think the thing that I would stress here is, because of the caps of the individual limits and just we think the bowling ball is to the snake, so to speak and we certainly don't believe that this will be our continued run rate going forward to the remainder of the year.","Kevin Ellich","And since, I have two, can you talk about how much added expense did you guys incur from the National Sales Meeting. You said Dental gross margin was up 50 basis points, but operating was down a little bit because - partially because of the impact of the National Meeting?","Ann Gugino","Yeah, it was between $3 million and $4 million of incremental expense this year roughly.","Kevin Ellich","Okay, got it. And then Scott, one last one for you. In your prepared remarks, you talked about Abaxis and how placements are going okay. You also said, they sell external reference lab services. So does that mean, are your sales people actually selling VCA lab services and the Abaxis doesn't have a lab?","Scott Anderson","Yeah, it's more joint venture strategic partnership.","Kevin Ellich","Got it.","Scott Anderson","As you described.","Kevin Ellich","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And moving on, we'll hear from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Thanks, guys. I still got to be used to, you guys are talking about cattle lines and cattle runs, but I actually wanted to go back over the Dental side and specifically around Dental EBIT margin. Relative to the full year target, the 12.8% to 13% clearing tracking a little bit below that, but totally understanding that the back half is historically higher than the front half. It does still seem like you're expecting more year-over-year margin expansion in 3Q and 4Q. So, I'm just curious if you could maybe call out a few of the specific things you guys anticipate over the next couple of fiscal quarters that should get you closer to that full year range that you laid out in guidance?","Ann Gugino","Yeah. I mean, I think you actually hit it and as we were talking, so it's mainly leverage that we get after fixed and semi-variable cost in the back half of the year because of the higher sales volumes. And I think the other piece of that, that I was going to point out is that, the vendor rebate tend to be backend loaded as well. So, if you just look historically, about 3% of our profit kind of hit in those past two quarters and you definitely see, even if you look at last year as a model, just continued sequential improvement in the operating margin rates as we move through the year.","Robert Jones","Okay. Got it. And then, I asked this of your manufacturing partner, but who we are again, the government still has not renewed Section 179 tax credit, how was that factored in both if it doesn't get renewed or if it does into how you guys are thinking about the balance of the year relative to guidance?","Scott Anderson","Yeah, I would say, Bob, I think it has less downside impact as the level of uncertainty I think is less this year than it was last year. There are sort of two important dates we think where Section 179 could come through with two different legislative vehicles. It could happen on the 4th with the transportation funding bill or on the 11th with the budget bill funding the federal government. Most of the talk has been about a permanent extension for Section 179 and their negotiations on whether or not potentially they'd settle with a two-year extension. So, we wouldn't have to deal with this issue two years down the road. We believe it's more likely the not - that it will go through just because this is sort of in the sweet spot of helping small business not just in our industry, but across all industries in the U.S. So, our plans and our forecasts are really around business as usual. And if we had a stronger than anticipated equipment third quarter that would help our guidance story.","Robert Jones","Got it. All right. Thanks for the questions. Appreciate it.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Steven Valiquette from UBS Securities.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Thanks, good morning everybody.","Scott Anderson","Hi, Steve.","Steven Valiquette","Well, just a couple of questions from me. I guess, first on the - just a separate question on the - those employee medical costs. Just curious in a normal year when you think about those as a percentage of your revenue, what's kind of the average number just we kind of know what's the baseline is for that?","Scott Anderson","Okay. So I am not sure. But I can do the math on my head as a percentage of revenue. But what I can tell you is that our claims on a normal month run between on a normal year around $4 million a month.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. That's helpful, I guess, as far as the baseline.","Scott Anderson","Okay.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Yeah. And it's a shame that the higher costs were not tied to dental expenses, but I guess we'll just have to typically give the [indiscernible] I guess, but ...","Scott Anderson","Yeah. I hear - yeah.","Steven Valiquette","And just one another question, just curious obviously a little more time has passed since the Sirona Dental disclaimer, just curious if have any further thoughts around what that mean for you guys good or bad or is the message there still pretty much the same that you conveyed at your Analyst Day? Just any further update on that. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Yeah. Steve, I would say, exactly that just reiterating what we said at our Analyst Day that, number one, we're excited about the potential merger. But I think we withhold any further comment till after the deal is closed. And as I said in New York, we have a great relationship with both Sirona and DENTSPLY. And in my 23 years of Patterson, I don't think the relationship has ever been better with either partners. So, we look forward to what the future could bring.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, got it. Okay. All right. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from John Krieger from William Blair.","John Krieger","Hey, Scott, just to go back to Bob's question. Can you just tell us, how your pipeline looks for general equipment as you move into the calendar year end?","Scott Anderson","Yeah, I would say, we're encouraged by the pipeline across the board. At the same time, there is always some volatility in our third quarter, because you have a shorter timeframe of decision-making. But I'll absolutely like where we're positioned not only heading into the calendar year end, but really the momentum coming out of our National Sales Meeting as well and what that will mean to us over the back half of the year.","John Krieger","Great, thanks. And again, just to clarify, you are assuming Section 179 gets a - gets passed in a normal timeframe versus something at 11th hour so to speak, or do you not feel like it's a swing factor either way?","Scott Anderson","I think, it can be a swing factor, but not as dramatic as it was last year.","John Krieger","Okay. Great. And then, you just mentioned in the National Sales Meeting again. Can you - you've talked about a fairly significant goal of I think doubling the CEREC user base over the next four years or five years. How are you feeling about the sales force productivity at this point, and maybe if you put in place any sort of newer initiatives to drive that, just kind of give us an update on it? Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Yeah, without sharing competitive information, I think at a very high level, the meeting talked about the vision and how important it is we feel to the dental industry to reach that goal of doubling the install base for CEREC, it also was a great opportunity to really educate our sales force on the investments we're making internally to help them with productivity and help just become a company that is much easier to do business with in the future. I would say, the meeting was an overwhelming success, and our folks are very focused on what they need to get done here over the back half of the year.","John Krieger","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, John.","Operator","Michael Cherny from Evercore ISI has our next question.","Luke Lemoine","Hi, guys this is Luke on for Mike. I just wanted to know, if you could start off and talk about kind of the next areas of focus for your internal investment priorities, now that the European competition is underway?","Ann Gugino","Yeah, I would say, as I talked about our capital allocation strategy, its investment in the business, which I think we're showing not only through acquisition but also ERP investments to drive productivity within the company. But also having sort of this three-legged stool approach of growing our dividend with earnings but also repurchasing shares in which we activated or executed on, roughly $176 million during the quarter. So, I think we're very focused on the two segments we have currently.","Luke Lemoine","Okay. Great. And then if you guys could talk about any of the synergy capture that you have from AHI and how the integration is going?","Ann Gugino","Well, I can take the synergy piece and then I'll let Scott comment on how he thinks the integration is going. So, we still expect to ramp to $20 million to $30 million of annual synergies by year three. The current year guidance assumes between $7 million and $8 million of synergies were on pace to achieve that, the current quarter had roughly between $1 million and $2 million of synergies in it mainly around, as Scott mentioned in his comments, the integration of the companion-animal business post the sales forces, and then the backend operations as well.","Scott Anderson","Yeah. I would add that from a marketplace strategy perspective. We're on plan, and I'm very impressed at the pace in which our teams continue to move. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think we put together a combination of really strong folks in terms of the management team that's leading the combined business with any acquisition culture is a huge deal, and absolutely we feel we have a very strong cultural fit between the two businesses. And I would also add, I think our - like I know our manufacture partners are very excited to have Patterson as a full line Animal Health channel to end customer. So, we'll continue to execute our plan in the months ahead.","Luke Lemoine","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Michael Minchak","Thanks. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. So, just wanted to go back to dental equipment again. The growth trends there bounced around on a quarterly basis, you commented about growth in CEREC this quarter and discussed some of the basic equipment categories. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in terms of some of the other hi-tech categories? And then maybe just more broadly, what do you see as a more normalized longer-term growth rate for the overall dental equipment category going forward?","Scott Anderson","Yeah, sure, Mike. We're seeing some very nice growth in some of the digital technologies, particularly the 3D cone beam. And it's sort of goes back to what we're talking about with CEREC as well and how all of this is integrated. At the CEREC 30 event, we spoke about the ROI strategy, which is really around restorative excellence, implantology workflow and growing orthodontic capabilities.","So, it's hard to sort of cherry-pick one category over the other, because it really is a story of all of these technologies working together. We've set the underlying market in terms of technology growth should continue to grow at a CAGR of north of 10% and the traditional equipment business will grow in the mid-single digits. And really one of the big catalyst that will help the traditional businesses when you start seeing really a renascence of new construction in terms of office expansion. And we believe, to meet the demands - the future demands that the North American dental population will create, that we will see that expansion over time. But we would probably look towards mid single-digit growth in the traditional equipment over the next one to two years.","Michael Minchak","Got it. And then, maybe, on the M&A front. Obviously, you have a lot in your plate with the Animal Health International integration. But can you talk about your interest in pursuing additional acquisitions and if so, sort of what areas do you feel is attractive from a standpoint of first these availability of attractive targets out there and then maybe in terms of valuations?","Scott Anderson","I'd say, we've been very clear that investing in our business and expanding our business is the top priority, I would say, as we've worked through our strategic plan and it really came to life last year, what we've invested in medical business and really now are concentrating on the dental vertical and the Animal Health vertical. That leaves us with plenty of potential. We believe from a financial perspective, we have the dry powder to execute on any opportunities in front of us. That being said, we've done a lot in the last year and our number one goal is successful execution of the M&A strategy that we currently have on our place. But, from an opportunistic standpoint, we'll continue to survey how we could improve our business by adding different potential companies or products to our portfolio.","Ann, do you want to give any additional color?","Ann Gugino","No, I think you nailed.","Michael Minchak","Great. Thanks for the comment.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And next question will come from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon Block","Great, thanks and good morning.","Scott Anderson","Hi, Jon.","Jon Block","Maybe the first, good morning. Maybe just the first one for you on the consumable trends. I believe you mentioned good tailwinds on the fiscal 1Q 2016 earnings call. The 3.3 was solid, but sort of in line with where it's been not an acceleration. I know there was some chatter that it's been choppy as of late. So, can you just talk about the trends of consumables as you guys experienced throughout fiscal 1Q, and maybe even what you're seeing in the month of November?","Scott Anderson","Yeah, we're continuing to see stable trends in November. I think based off the information we get from all of our manufactures and our manufactures that are public companies. I would - I would say we're comfortable in saying we continue to grow slightly faster than the underlying market. But, I wouldn't say we're seeing much choppiness in the consumable business, it's been fairly consistent.","Jon Block","Okay. Got it. And just second question, maybe two part. Just on the UK event business, there has been some commentary from other guys that international has been weak. So, just your level of confidence that, that is more the overall market relative to market share? And then just - and to conclude, it looks like you guys were aggressive on the share repo once the window opened. Is your commentary is still that sort of the share repo take you to the upper end of your range of the thought for fiscal 2016? Thanks guys.","Scott Anderson","Yeah, I'll talk about the UK market and then I'll let Ann talk about guidance and then give some color after Ann. Yeah, it's been pretty consistent for about the last six months that the UK underlying market is very stable, but is really running into a tough comp issue. So, we're comfortable with what management is doing in the UK to adjust those circumstance and we will drive the business accordingly.","I'll turn it over to Ann to give some color on the share repurchase.","Ann Gugino","Yeah, so the accretive effect of the share buyback to date was about $0.005 and we expect it to add between $0.02 and $0.04 for the balance of the year, based on what we've purchased so far. But of course, in any period, there is a number of items that can effect EPS either way right, and so picking one individual item, so for example, we had the FX tailwind, we had the insurance claim. So, we think it's prudent to keep the original range at this point. And I think, in terms of getting to the upper end of the range, I think Scott alluded to it, I think with 60% of the revenue coming in the back half of the year, it's really going to depend on the equipment pipeline more so than the share repurchase I think at this point, given what I'm looking at.","Scott Anderson","Yeah, I'd say, we - as we look at the back half of the year, our ability to get to that upper end of the range is really going to come down to sales execution. And because of the size and some volatility that can happen in our third quarter, which is the calendar fourth quarter we're just being prudent and keeping our guidance range where it's at, but obviously the share repurchase, I think shows our confidence in the business and strengthens our story.","Jon Block","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, John.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today. Mr. Anderson, I'll turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.","Scott Anderson","Thank you, Cam, and thanks for joining us today. Again, we're very optimistic for the second half of this fiscal year and we look forward to updating you next quarter. On behalf of every one at Patterson, we'd like to wish you all a happy Thanksgiving and hope to see many of next week in New York at the Greater New York Demo Show. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today.

Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Verdell Walker - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Patterson Companies Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Conference Call [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, February 23, 2012. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Anderson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Scott P. Anderson","Good morning, and thanks for taking time to participate in our third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a logistical note, I am at the Chicago Midwinter Dental Show today, so Steve and I are not in the same location. You may hear us confer briefly as we prepare to address questions at the conclusion of our remarks. ","Since Regulation FD provision prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we've provided financial guidance for fiscal 2012 in our press release earlier this morning. This guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.","Turning to our third quarter results. Consolidated sales totaled $895 million, an increase of 9% from $824.7 million in the year earlier period. Net income of $53.1 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, included incremental expense of $0.03 per diluted share related to Patterson's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. Excluding this ESOP expense, third quarter earnings were $0.53 per diluted share compared to earnings of $0.47 per diluted share in the same period of fiscal 2011. As previously reported, the ESOP expense will affect fiscal 2012 earnings by an estimated $0.12 per share. In addition, the incremental interest expense associated with Patterson's third quarter issuance of long-term debt reduced earnings for this period by approximately $0.01 per share. As I will discuss shortly, our third quarter results were driven by strong sales of dental equipment and veterinary products, which carry somewhat lower margins than our other portions of our product portfolio.","Although the resulting shift in our sales mix affected our third quarter earnings, we were pleased with Patterson's results for this period, indicating that we are performing effectively amid the economic challenges in our markets. Sales of Patterson Dental, our largest business, increased nearly 9% from the year earlier period to $605 million. Within Patterson Dental, sales of consumable supplies increased a solid 3.4% from last year's third quarter before the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. This marks our third sequential quarterly increase in consumable sales, an indication of the continued strengthening of the overall North American dental market. ","Sales of dental equipment and software increased 21% from the year earlier level, as this product category rebounded from its unexpectedly weak market conditions in last year's third quarter. This strong growth was driven by double-digit increases in sales of CEREC dental restorative products and digital radiography offerings, including sensors, panoramic, and ConeBeam products. Our Dental Equipment business is benefiting from the growing acceptance of digital technologies in the operatory, which are enabling dentists to strengthen their productivity, generating additional income and improve clinical outcomes. We believe continuing opportunities exist for our digital offerings and we will continue to focus our dental marketing initiatives on this area. ","Third quarter sales of our Webster Veterinary unit increased 17% to $174.6 million, generated largely by strong internal growth of both the consumable and equipment portions of this business. The August 2011 acquisition of American Veterinary Supply Corporation, a full-service veterinary distributor on Long Island, accounted for 3% of the unit sales growth for the period. As we reported previously, this tuck-in acquisition was fully integrated into Webster's operation by the end of the second quarter. It should be noted that Webster's strong third quarter sales growth was attained during one of the seasonally softest periods of the year, when demand is relatively low for flea\/tick and heartworm medications because of the winter months. ","More than compensating for this seasonal factor was a 15% increase in sales of consumable supplies, which constitutes the largest component of Webster's revenue stream. In addition, equipment sales rose a strong 35%. As this sales growth demonstrates, we believe pet owners are continuing to increase expenditures on veterinary care, despite the challenging economy. To more fully capitalize upon pet ownership and spending trends, Webster's continuing to expand its equipment and service business which has strengthened the unit's full-service platform. We intend to continue investing in this component of Webster's business.","Sales of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, declined 2% to $115.3 million in the third quarter. Patterson Medical's performance, which was consistent with our internal forecast, continued to be affected by changes in the nation's health care system, including the impact of new regulations. We believe these unfolding developments have dampened demand for rehabilitation products and equipment throughout fiscal 2012. Although this situation is likely to persist until market uncertainties are clarified, we believe Patterson Medical is positioned to take maximum advantage of global demographic trends fueling the growth of the rehabilitation market.","Finally, as reported in this morning's release, we repurchased 3.2 million common shares during the third quarter under our $25 million share buyback authorization that expires in 2016. Approximately 12.3 million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization. We are evaluating various alternatives for the proceeds from our recent debt issuance, including additional share repurchasing. As we stated this morning in our release, we narrowed our fiscal 2012 guidance to $1.90 to $1.94 from the previously issued $1.90 to $1.97 per diluted share. ","Looking ahead, we believe our markets are gradually recovering from the impact of the recession, although by no means are they back to historic growth norms. We see continued improvement going forward and we will provide our views of fiscal -- Patterson's fiscal 2013 outlook in our fourth quarter release. In closing, I want to say that Patterson's businesses are well positioned to capitalize on their market opportunities and we are aggressively marketing our products and services. Equally important, we are fully committed to delivering strong value to our shareholders. For these and many other reasons, we are optimistic about Patterson's long-term future. ","Thank you. Now Steve will review some financial highlights from our third quarter results.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Thanks, Scott. As Scott's comments reflect, our consolidated revenues were strong in the quarter as both Patterson Dental and Webster Veterinary put up very good numbers, especially in the equipment categories. But then he also indicated our consolidated gross margin came under some pressure, decreasing 180 basis points from the prior year's quarter, due primarily to the shift in our product mix. I want to give more color on this change. ","It was not one overriding cause for the decline, although as most of you know, the strong equipment revenue is relative to consumer revenues in the dental segment, while producing higher gross profit will result in lower gross margin. Also the 15% growth in veterinary consumables reduced our consolidated gross margin since this unit produces the lowest margins of the 3 businesses. Final item affecting our third quarter gross margin relates to an issue that we discussed in last year's results. Due to an accounting rule change, it was necessary to amend the funding agreements in our customer financing business last year. As a result, we deferred gains on the transfer of finance contracts from last year's second quarter to the third quarter of that year. That deferral favorably increased our gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 when the gain was recognized, which made the year-over-year margin comparison more challenging.","Looking at our ratio of consolidated operating expenses in relation to sales, we improved leverage by 50 basis points in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental ESOP expense that Scott mentioned earlier, the improvement in our operating expense ratio for the quarter would have been 110 basis points. On a comparable basis, which exclude the incremental ESOP expense, each of the operating units improved their operating leverage in the current quarter. These improvements resulted from a combination of increased revenue growth and expense management.","The medical unit also benefited from the absence of the incremental expense, including approximately $1.1 million of redundancy cost related to integrating the acquisition of the DCC Healthcare, which were included in the prior quarter's results. By segment, our third quarter operating margins were 11.1% for dental, 12.9% for medical, and 4.6% for veterinary. While I reported consolidated operating margin declined 120 basis points in the quarter, it was essentially flat after adjusting for the incremental ESOP expense and the favorable impact of the gain deferral in last year's third quarter. ","Our DSO stood at 44 days at the end of the quarter in each year, while inventory turns were 6.6 in the current quarter compared to 6.9 a year ago. We generated cash flow from operations of about approximately $109 million in the third quarter, compared to $84 million in the year earlier period. Cash flow from operations in this year's -- in last year's third quarter exclude the impact of $122 million of transferred finance contracts on which sale accounting was deferred from the second to the third quarter. This is the impact on the cash flow statement of the funding agreement amendments that I mentioned previously.","We are still estimating that capital expenditures will total approximately $30 million for fiscal 2012. This year's major capital projects include the completion of the new Midwestern distribution center, built out in South Bend, Indiana, and the new Patterson Technology Center that opened this past fall. ","Scott mentioned that we closed on a debt issuance during the quarter. For those of you who did not see the details in our previously issued public filings, we issued $325 million of non-amortizing long-term private notes with 7, 10 and 12 year tenors with a weighted average interest rate of 3.56%.","We have $125 million of previously issued debt that will mature in March of 2013, and part of the new issuance is intended to refinance this portion of our outstanding debt. The remaining $200 million may be used for possible share repurchases and general corporate purposes. ","With that, I'll turn it back to the conference operator, who will pool you for your questions. Douglas?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","Our first question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe just a couple of follow-ups here. When we think about the gross margin pressure, I know, Steve, that you talked about the shift in the product mix. But is there anything else that you're seeing other than just the shift? Number one. And number two, I think you called out digital on the side of equipment, but maybe could you also give us an update on what you're seeing in the CEREC market?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. Lisa, this is Scott. Steve, why don't you start with the margin mix? And then I'll follow-up.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Other than what we talked about, Lisa, the 3 elements, the strong growth in equipment, in dental and vet, plus the vet consumable growth, and then that year-over-year change in the amount of gain we recognized on the finance contracts from the quarter, I think the only other element I would point out, and it probably had a lesser impact if it had some and that is as you may recall last year, we weren't doing much in the way of promotional activity on the CEREC. We did have promotions running this year, so that would've had some pressure on the gross margins as well.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I think that the thing that I'm trying to get at is just, are you seeing any change in level from a competitive standpoint? So you're talking about a little bit on the promotional activity side, but is there anything else competitively in the marketplace that's impacting margins?","Scott P. Anderson","Lisa, I would say it's still a competitive market as we begin the recovery. So you are competing for deals. We had a very strong quarter in the ConeBeam market, led by GALILEOs and our Planmeca product. We have a lot of competition in that space. So I feel like we gained significant share, but at the same time, you have to compete for deals in that space. I wouldn't categorize it at all as anything irrational, and I think that as the markets improve, you'll see margins improve as well.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And obviously, you can give us some incremental insights into the equipment market, right, as you're at the dental shows? So what are you seeing in the CEREC market? And you did call out digital, but what other kinds of equipment are you selling and what are the trends you're seeing right now?","Scott P. Anderson","I think the core equipment market is stable. But we still have not seen the large projects, the remodels, the big deals, come back. They will, I would say, probably the most positive thing in the last 90 days, as I've talked to customers across the country, talked to a lot of them last night at a big dinner, is just the growing confidence that the economy is recovering, their practices are stable, their cash flow is increasing. And as we've said, throughout really the last 36 to 48 months, as the confidence of the dentists increased about their patient flow and their future, their ability to reinvest in capital goes up. Technology is done very well, it's got a high return on investment and we see a long runway on the technology side. But we also see basic equipment market recovering over the next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Given the strong consumable trends that you guys saw this past quarter, do you think that top line momentum is sustainable as you look out over the rest of calendar '12?","Scott P. Anderson","John, I think it is on the consumable end. This is the third sequential quarter of improvement and we're seeing the sales trends grow fairly consistently over a geography, as well as over product type. I would say this was probably the toughest comp of our fiscal year on the consumables side. So we're really encouraged by where the trends are looking. That being said, it will continue to be a slow recovery, I think until we get back to more historical growth rates. The equipment side, as we've talked about before, can be a bit lumpy, but we're definitely encouraged by how dentists really look to invest back in their practices, particular in the November, December time period.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And second question relating to margins, it seems like if you make the adjustments that Steve mentioned, they are essentially flat year-over-year. What do you think the key, one or 2 things, are to driving positive margin leverage over the next one or 2 years?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think part of it is consumable growth. It obviously has a higher contribution margin. And then I think it's doing all the things we're doing in terms of improving efficiency within the company, as well as driving technology and making our customers more successful. That's part of our story. As we've helped the profession become more successful, we have benefited as well at something I think you're starting to see play out in our Webster unit currently as well. Steve, do you want to add any color to that?","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, I think that covers it.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, given the uncertainty that's currently impacting the Rehab business, what is your sense about when that business starts to turn and grow again?","Scott P. Anderson","I think it'll turn here in the next 12 months. Our Consumable business still is holding in pretty strong. The capital equipment side has been hurt in terms of some of our customers, particularly the DME dealers just sort of being frozen, as they try to figure out what the rules of the road are going to be, in terms of the Affordable Health Care Act. So we're very bullish on that segment long term because of the strong demographic trends, one. And two, we feel we have a very strong competitive position and competitive advantage to adjust to the market going forward. So it'll probably be another 6 to 12 months, I think.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Scott, I guess, or Steve, maybe it's a better question for you on the margin front. It looks like the low end of your guidance for fourth quarter implies maybe an operating margin getting back into the 11%, low 11% range? As I look back at your model over the last 20 years, and I went through this, this morning, I've just -- there is -- I've not seen a sequential fiscal third quarter to fourth quarter 100 basis point or more pick up at any time over that 20 years. So where do we get confidence that we get back to that 11% range, I guess, starting next quarter?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Well, maybe just to correct you, last year, we had a 60 basis point improvement from the third to fourth quarter. We're looking for a little bit more this year. But I don't think it's a particularly high hurdle for us, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, so you don't need to get that 100 basis points? Maybe my math is off a little bit. So it wouldn't be the first time on that?","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, you're right. We're looking for a little over 100 in the fourth quarter. But it's not an unreasonably high hurdle.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, now that's helpful. And on the panoramic side, Scott, I hear that, in your prepared comments, you're talking about that being one of the drivers there. Is that still mainly 2D sales at this point in the cycle? Are you starting to see some of the combos, 2D, 3D sales? And are you seeing any upgrades yet from 2D to 3D in that part of the market?","Scott P. Anderson","I think, Jeff, we saw strength across all product lines, 3D, combo and just traditional digital pan, some anecdotal feedback you can get from our field because you even have dentists who have film-based pans, who potentially are taking a look at just jumping from film to 3D. We feel we've got a great portfolio of products with our partners and what really resonates I think with our customer base and why we're being so successful is our sales and service infrastructure is great competitive advantage. So when dentists are making such a large investment, the fact that someone's going to be there to train, service and support them after the sale, is really one of our key selling factors beyond just product. So the strength across the board on those products.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, I guess I'm just trying to feel out that where in the product cycle we are on that combo, 2D, 3D. Obviously, that came out last year, at this show, to a lot of excitement. Is that yet translating to dentists buying nodes? Are they still buying 2D with the idea that they might upgrade to 3D at some point down the road?","Scott P. Anderson","I think we're still in the middle of it, but I think the 2D, 3D products really have opened up the general dentist market and moved ConeBeam from really just a niche specialist product to a market where the product with a much larger market potential going forward. But we're still in the middle of that transition.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Then last question, I know you're not going to fiscal '13 guidance today, but it's been 2 years here where we've seen in each year, maybe a couple of trims to guidance throughout the year. Conceptually, I think I've asked you this question before, but conceptually, would the thought process be next quarter that you want to guide conservatively and really put out a number there, you can confidently hit and then have potential upside to? Or are you still kind of thinking about what you'll talk to the Street about is kind of what you truly think will happen and if it doesn't develop, it doesn't develop?","Scott P. Anderson","I think we'll talk about that in the fourth quarter, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial Group.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of questions, if I could, maybe just a technical one. And again, I know early we're early on the fiscal '13 outlook, but the ESOP expense for our modeling purposes, we think about that continuing into fiscal '13. Is that going to be a run rate sort of similar to what we have now at this point? Is there any reason to think that would change?","Scott P. Anderson","Steve, why don't you take that?","R. Stephen Armstrong","All right. A.J., that -- I would just guide you to consider that it's an expensive of our structure is going forward. It will move like the rest of our expense structure, particularly our wage base. So if you see wages going up substantially, the ESOP expense is probably going to go up, relative to those like the borrowing and significant change in the wage base. It's going to grow like the rest of the expense structure grows.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Obviously, we welcome the strength in the dental equipment side, particularly and obviously, consumables sequentially improving as well. You have this dynamic around the December year-end and sometimes that gets skewed by year-end seasonal activity. Can you sort of -- can you put that in perspective? I mean, how much of that was going on here versus improved underlying tone to the business and then also obviously, promotion around CEREC just being stronger year-over-year?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, A.J., I think it was looking back 12 months. We really look at our third quarter, the year ago, the calendar fourth quarter, as really anomaly with how weak the market was. And we started feeling this in October, November as we talked to our customers that they had been through really 24 months of deferral and wanted to start reinvesting in the practice. So I think we've had a more normalized quarter traditionally at year-end, but not anything that I think really will spike that would create a tough comparable for us a year ago. I think we executed very well. We have great products in terms of CEREC and Schick and the GALILEOS and Planmeca and A-dec. So I would say, it's a very solid quarter. It sends a good message about dentists reinvesting in their practices, but I don't think it was inflated by promotion at all.","Albert J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And just my last one. On the Medical business, where year-to-year, I guess, that was the one area where you're underperforming relative to our forecast, the other you outperformed. But you're pointing to the ACA getting clarity around that, I guess I also had a sense that maybe there was some impact from the economy, maybe you thought there might be impact from some of the specific areas that are based in reimbursement challenges, either skilled nursing or the Medicare doc fixed issue? Is it really you think ACA that's -- that'll take longer I guess to work out with some of these other things that might show improvement more near term?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, A.J., it think it's a combination of things. And it's just created sort of deferral and uncertainty. We feel that when there is more clarity on a number of issues. The great thing we love about the Rehab business is it's playing into the aging population, a more active population. And that will drive rehab services. As I said, in that business, we're 4x to 5x large as our nearest competitor and have many strategic options in terms of how we adjust to our market. We feel very confident long-term about our Rehabilitation business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to ask you a quick question about share repurchase. It feels like the company, having followed it for a very long time, is -- has a different view today on share repurchases than the past. I mean, we went for years and years where the company wouldn't buy back any stock and then this year, you're buying back almost 10% of the company. And so I'm just trying to reconcile how I should think about that going forward, given the balance sheet and cash flow. Scott, are we seeing something with respect to maybe, were going to pull back from acquisitions? Or do you just see your stock as at an attractive price at this point in time? And then, as a follow-up to that, Steve, I don't know if you can give us a sense for how much share repo added for the quarter and the year.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. Glenn, and I think I started talking about this a few years ago in terms of capital allocation strategy. And also recognizing the fact of what a strong cash producer Patterson is. Our top priority still continues to be accretive acquisitions strategically in the 3 businesses we have. We implemented the dividend a little over a year ago and continue to grow that over time. And then we really look at share repurchase, that's sort of the third leg of that shareholder value building tool we have. So we have been opportunistic this year and we think it'll pay great dividends for our shareholders long-term and maybe Steve can finish off the answer from there.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I can give you the number. I mean, anybody can calculate the number, I think, if they get the last year's outstanding shares versus this year's average outstanding, and accounts to about a $0.01. But I think the bigger point is that in these times, we've talked about this publicly that when the revenues are tough to come by, as far as the growth is concerned, it's tough to get margin expansion. And I think what Scott has embarked the company upon is what he talked about is his 3-legged strategy with regard to the cash deployment. And so we've done that to basically maintain or try to increase the returns to the shareholder when -- necessarily, the operations of the company weren't quite as strong. And we also had to absorb that ESOP expense change in our expense structure as well, so I want to mitigate some of that. So you take the whole thing together. I sort of look at it and say, one sort of cancels out the other. And yet, if you look at it year-over-year and say, what's the sort of the core business is doing still generating significant amount of cash flow, very positive cash flow and we have to put that to work. And some markets gave us an opportunity to use it with share repurchase this year, more dramatically maybe than we have since maybe since 2008. And we'll continue to use it if the market provides that opportunity and we have the cash, we'll certainly use it.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's all helpful. And Scott, maybe if I could just follow-up in terms of what you're seeing in the acquisition pipeline on all the 3 different businesses, is it still fairly fertile opportunity or...","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I think there's great opportunity in all 3 businesses, Glen.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So you'd be surprised if we went through calendar '12 and didn't see any additional acquisitions?","Scott P. Anderson","Well I'm not going to forecast calendar '12. I'd be surprised over the longer term if you didn't see acquisitions in all 3 businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you guys touched on this a little bit. But just given the very strong dental equipment numbers and the fiscal fourth quarter of last year, and then the success in dental equipment sales you had and then just reported fiscal 3Q, obviously, fiscal 4Q '12 then with the comp maybe a little bit of tough. I guess, my question is are there any categories within dental equipment that you think may still be up year-over-year in the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter? Any color by category would be helpful.","Scott P. Anderson","Sure, Steve. The toughest comp for us in our fourth quarter will be CEREC. But we're very bullish on CEREC and take a long-term perspective. We're excited about how customers have accepted the 4.0 software and really feel that the CEREC story is only in the third inning, but we did have a great performance in the fourth quarter last year. Outside of that, I feel confident we'll grow in all categories, outside of CEREC and still have the opportunity to grow on CEREC.","R. Stephen Armstrong","The only thing I would add to that, Steve, is just that you're really looking at 3 rather volatile years and within the years volatile periods because if you go back to last year's fourth quarter, some of that growth was just due to the fact that it came off of a miserable fourth quarter of the year before. It was a fairly weak quarter for equipment. So you've got some volatility quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter in those periods. So going into this quarter, I think Scott, I totally agree with Scott, I think he articulated very well that the opportunity to grow all categories.","Operator","Our next question is on the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott or Steve, did you reference any promotional activity that's ongoing in the current quarter on the equipment side?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, fourth quarter, we have a CEREC promotion going on. I don't want to give the exact details just for competitive reasons, Bob. But nothing that's incrementally more lucrative than things we've done in the past. And our fourth quarter is also historically driven by our branches driving towards the finish line for the fiscal year.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, is somebody else distributing CEREC in North America that it's competitive or...","R. Stephen Armstrong","Well, there's rumors that there's a competitive product out there, Bob. Something else.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just -- it's a small piece of the business, but the vet equipment is just sorting, can you break down -- is that just tables and cabinets? Or we -- is there a digital opportunity that we're now sort of seeing a tipping point for?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, it's a combination, and I would place caution on that, that it is off a small base. And we use dollars, not percentages. But a key initiative on the Webster side has really been to build out a service infrastructure, which we have implemented in this fiscal year and will continue to expand because we truly believe, as we talked to our veterinarian customers, the support after the sale is very important. So the growth has been sort of across the board in terms of product line and really couldn't point out any specific one item that's growing faster than the others. But I -- gaining momentum and as we sell more equipment, our sales force becomes more confident and we see that as a nice opportunity. And just as I mentioned earlier, in the call, it's a great way to help our veterinarian customers become more efficient and deliver higher care when that happens, the relationship grows stronger.","R. Stephen Armstrong","I would like to add to that, Bob, I think you're correct. Your allusion to the digital -- there is a digital element to what the vets are excited about digital radiography and are converting to it at a pace similar to what the dentists are. So that is in a single category probably having as much impact as anything yet.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I think I haven't found anybody who isn't declaring a total victory in vet IT, but I wouldn't think the market is growing that much, can you speak to the some of the dynamics in the IT sector? If there are any dynamics?","Scott P. Anderson","Steve's going to start.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Why'd you throw that one to me? I think you're right, Bob, I think you've seen some changes in ownership of vet IT. People are making enhancements to it. And I think you've seen some realignment. I think people are looking to accumulate sort of a portfolio of electronic capability that they can offer to their customers. But it is from a practice management perspective, it is a saturated market. So I think really what you're seeing is tools that would go into the clinics and hospitals that would help the practitioner either market their practice, become more efficient, communicate with their customers, drive more business. However, they want to these those tools and I think that's what you're going to see going forward.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, not a question, but just to reiterate your view share repurchases and optimal use of capital here the near term.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Bob, I'm sorry, I missed your question.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","No question. Just reiterating your view at share repurchases, the optimal use of capital from our perspective here in the near term? But that's it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ross Taylor with CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Since nobody's asked, I'll touch on the vet consumables. It looks like even if you back out the acquisition, I mean, growth there was very strong, probably north of 10%. And I just wonder if there's any new product that are driving that and how sustainable that type of growth might be?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Ross, I think you're still seeing the benefit of Trifexis in the quarter that will annualize coming into the next quarter. So I would caution you to that, that growth rate is sustainable. But it was a very nice quarter, I think, a quarter where our sales force executed very well. And I think some of the trends looking into the next year for the vet space are positive just in terms of the mild winter and the impact that could have on the flea and tick business here in the spring. So I would bring down that growth rate a little bit in terms of sustainability, but obviously a market with really nice underlying dynamics right now.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Okay, and just 2 minor questions really related to modeling. But can you give the growth in the Medical business, excluding any foreign currency impacts? And then, also the debt issuance cost that you mentioned, does that fall in with the other line item within other income or is that actually buried in interest expense?","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, Ross, on the last points, that's just the interest expense on the debt itself, the issuance costs are amortized over term. But -- so it's just the incremental interest in that portion of the quarter. As far as the Medical business, the currency impact on all of the business was rather nominal, it was just 10 basis points for the period because of Medico's overseas relationship. They have a little bit more impact at about 2\/10 of a point of impact there.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays Capital.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. You talked about the -- both CEREC and digital radiography being up double digits. Just sort of curious, is that either both about the same? I was assuming that's both above mid-teens. Is that the right ballpark or it was one a little bit healthier growth than the other?","Scott P. Anderson","Larry, I think in terms of percentages, we don't give exact the CEREC growth was stronger. I can tell you our basic equipment was up low single digits and that's roughly 60% of our business. So obviously, it was a strong quarter across all those technology product lines.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then I know you talked about the value proposition with CEREC and convincing more practices to make the move to invest in share side dentistry. And I know part of the promotion is really just giving dentist incentives to take a look at the product and such. I mean, would you say that program, generally speaking, is going about as you would have expected in terms of booking visits and sort of feedback so far? Or is there any variation versus your thoughts, Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","I think there's great interest in CEREC and share side CAD\/CAM. We've been doing this for a decade now. The product awareness, brand awareness is 100%. There are great material partners that are bringing out fantastic materials, pushing the product further and further along. And as we've said, from a longer-term perspective, when you look at the next generation of dentists and how they'll embrace technology, that's why we are so bullish on the long-term story of CEREC. So our sales force is very active, obviously had a very successful third quarter. And we'll continue to promote the product. As I said earlier, the 4.0 software has been a real hit, not only with our customer base, but also with the new users in terms of ease of use after they purchased the product. So we -- it's a product that it does have some peaks and valleys in it as we've told people before, but there's no doubt in the underlying demand for share side CAD\/CAM are strong.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very good. And then just 2 quick ones. The tone, you've already talked about tone of the markets. I don't want to believer that, but it does feel like except for maybe an blip 1.5 years ago. The results are a little bit stronger since June of '08. So and I know you guys are trying to be conservative all the way through, to say don't -- let's not get ahead of ourselves, but from you said, being up at Chicago, does it feel a little bit stronger than maybe some of the feedback you've gotten in last 6 months? Such that there are some lags on this recovery?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I think our customers got through calendar year '12 and realized their practices are strong. But at the same time, we still have unemployment in the mid-8s and as I said, it's going to take some time for us to get back to historic growth rates. But when you look at the decade in front of us, in terms of an aging population, keeping their teeth, new technologies helping dentistry, this should be a very strong decade for dentistry, but it's not going to snap back in 6 months. But it's definitely moving in the right direction, Larry.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on that, I spent some time with George, it seems like the tone of that business is very good. Your results are very good. A lot of buzz about Novartis and some of their issues creating an opportunity. From where you sit, good news you got an interesting platforms that is not   a big contributor overall earnings stream. Is this the time to really turn on more that something in the next couple of years and what's going on or...","Scott P. Anderson","I think we've got a great strategy in vet. We've got a strong management team and a great sales force. While it is dilutive to our overall operating margins, it is a strong contributor in terms of return on invested capital. So vet will never be as big as the Dental business, but it is a great space and a space that we're focused on and a space that we're excited about over the next 10 years.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and quickly in the case, your view that the uncertainty in volume and DME and David's business is really just more about the lack of clarity around rules? Or just DME reimbursement cuts is I guess A.J. asked about before, I just want to make sure I understand...","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think it's a combination of both. I think it's just there's just confusion in the market when that happens, people get conservative, we saw it as we get to last third quarter and the dental book and business in North America, when we had that debate over taxes. Though we are not concerned long-term and at the same time, we have very competitive position and we'll adjust to the market if need be and Dave is very active with his management team and sales force around those subjects. So we can't deny the demographic trend of the aging population and the impact that will have on the business over the long term, in a tough patch here in the short term.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Verdell Walker - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Verdell in for Bob. I had just a really quick housekeeping question on the tax rate. It was a little bit lower than we were expecting this quarter. Just is -- I think if I remember this correctly, expected for the year to be in the range of 36.5% or 37%. Wondering if that's still the case and how we should think about that next quarter and going forward?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Scott, you probably want me to answer that one?","Scott P. Anderson","I could take it, but I'll let you do it, Steve.","R. Stephen Armstrong","All right. It's a little bit lower this quarter, as we get deeper into the -- we get more benefit, Verdell, off of that ESOP, or the dividend going to that ESOP. We didn't have a full-year the last year we get a little more this year. So it's going to pull the rate down. We also have, due to some what they referred to as discrete items coming out of the quarter, but I would guide you, the rate is going to be still in that 30 -- mid 36% range, but the third and the fourth quarter are typically a bit lighter than the first and second just because of timing items as far as how items go through the tax provision in today's world. It used to be about -- and this is an editorial comment, but you sort of used to be able to sort of block in the rate for the year and you just sort of record it in every quarter, the accountants in their infinite wisdom have decided you need to be more exacting with your rates throughout the year. So it becomes difficult for you folks enough to predict what our rate is going to be like quarter-to-quarter but the 36.5% rate is pretty good for the year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over for closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson","Thank you, Douglas. Thanks everyone for taking time on our call and your interest in Patterson.

Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings conference call.","Joining me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ann Gugino, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After a review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson.","Scott Anderson","Thank you, John, and welcome everyone to today's conference call.","I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast.","Our end markets are currently presenting us with some unique near-term challenges on both sides of our business. First, in our dental business, the soft but stable market conditions we experienced in our fiscal first quarter extended into our second quarter, and on the Animal Health side, we are experiencing the effects of consolidation among the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. While we believe this consolidation dynamic is short-term in nature, it has resulted in a softer manufacture pricing environment, which has impacted our margins in the Animal Health segment.","Importantly, our current outlook also needs to factor in our recent strategic decision-making. Today, we announced that we will change the nature of our relationship with Sirona for the goal of opening up new opportunities for Patterson and our customers. As we transition toward a new working relationship with Sirona, we can expect some near-term headwinds in exchange for longer-term growth opportunities.","To reflect these dynamics, we have modified our fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP earnings guidance from continuing operations to a range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. As we worked through these factors, we are committed to taking the steps necessary to improve our earnings performance. And we remain confident in Patterson's long-term prospects. We operate in compelling markets and are building a business model that will be increasingly relevant to our customers.","I'll remind everyone that there are important long-term demographic trends that underpin our business and in our view remain very attractive. In the dental market, the long-term fundamentals and trend lines are unchanged, several factors including a generally stable employment market and aging population and dentists seeking new ways to improve both the patient experience and how their practices operate form the basis for our optimism in dental.","We have different but equally compelling factors on the Animal Health side of our business. One is the global expansion of the middle class that will result in an increase in animal protein demand. We expect the U.S. production animal markets to have a global leadership role in satisfying that demand. We believe our entry into this market just over a year ago and into the position as the leading Animal Health distribution company in North America is a compelling long-term growth catalyst.","Relatedly, we continue to have a lot of optimism in the long-term growth trends in the companion animal market. We believe stable market conditions and a persistent rise in both pet ownership and spending per pet will continue to generate long-term opportunity for us. This component of our growth plan remains unchanged.","For the next few minutes, however, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on the dental market, how it's changing and how we are responding. The various ways that practitioners of all sizes need to address the requirements of dental consumers are evolving. These are changes we have been anticipating. We have been adjusting our approach to the market and our business to better position our dental operations for long-term success. These efforts have been methodical, multi-year and expansive. They have included changes in our basic equipment portfolio with the intent to bring a wider range of product offerings to the entire market of customers within the market.","Our commitment to our new ERP platform to ensure that we are building maximum efficiency into our operations and providing the backbone and tool-set for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform that will accommodate modern buying habits. And the investment we have made in our technical service and support capabilities, which we believe, represent untapped value and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Our adaptation continues today.","Three other factors in dental are impacting how we view opportunities and how we are changing to capture them. The first two are trends. Evolving practice models in the North American dental market and the continued evolution of digital dentistry. The third is the voice of our current and potential customers. We are listening very closely to our customers in many ways their feedback is directly influencing our change. This has led to several important decisions and exciting developments over the past several months.","First, in June, we took steps to optimize our sales force in dental with the goal of building a team that is better aligned with where we believe customer needs are moving. We have gone to great lengths to build a value proposition around outstanding sales support with an emphasis on technical and operational needs of our customers. We believe these needs will become more pronounced in the future as practitioner environments of all sizes become increasingly digital. Our sales force needs to reflect this change. We have always been a destination for the best sales professionals in the business and these efforts are putting more opportunity in front of our best people.","Second, regarding digital dentistry, we believe we have a unique perspective. Today, we are having conversations about technological need and preference and digital workflow with a much wider range of customers. Our leading position as a distributor and enabler of dental technology gives us insights into the aspirations and decision-making considerations of practices of all sizes and more importantly how this is changing.","The reality is the dental market is the definition of digital workflow is evolving. It means something different across the practitioners' spectrum. Being the distributor of choice across the full spectrum, means Patterson needs to evolve and leverage our superior support platform to customers. Therefore, to better address the needs of the full dental market we have made the decision not to extend the exclusivity of our relationship with Sirona beyond September 2017. This decision is consistent with our strategy of serving the evolving needs of all of our customers and will allow us to better serve the full range of practice models.","We believe the modern customer wants a partner like Patterson, who can combine both a superior technology support platform with a full range of product options. Our global, best in class support structure for technology is a critical asset. It has been of great interest to many other product manufacturers who recognize the importance of this back-end support to the adoption of their technology.","Patterson's technical service and support has been a major differentiator in the adoption of chair-side technology. We believe that with a wider portfolio of product offerings this asset will become even more valuable and an even stronger differentiator. We are confident that this deliberate shift away from manufacturer exclusives will unlock opportunities for everyone involved in the dental supply chain.","I want to be very clear. We are immensely proud of our 20-year relationship with Sirona and have great admiration for their technology and history of innovation. Through this relationship, Patterson dental effectively built the North American market for chair-side technology. The combination of Sirona's CAD\/CAM technology and Patterson sales, service and support has set a very high standard.","Sirona\u2019s chair-side solutions like rest of their product portfolio will remain a very important part of our offerings. For practitioners that seek single-visit solutions, I believe we will remain the clear supplier of choice. We are fully committed to driving sales performance through the completion of our exclusivity period and then selling their products on a non-exclusive basis with the same commitment to driving mutual success.","For practitioners and operations that need more flexibility and a wider range of technology options, they will now find that in Patterson and we will eventually carry the necessary products that will allow us to meet the digital workflow needs for the entire range of customers in the market.","Lastly, we believe our expanded product and support offering will enhance our ability to serve the full spectrum of customers. That, of course, includes the DSO community. We are very excited by our new relationship with Heartland Dental, the largest dental support organization in the United States.","The hallmarks of Patterson dental, superior sales, service and support with technical applications played a large role in this win. In our conversations with Heartland, it was clear they were seeking a business partner that share the same philosophy of bringing best in class products and solutions to their network. With a strong focus and commitment to helping them improve in the operational areas they outlined for us. Our respective teams immediately began working together to begin delivering the solutions that form the basis of our partnership and the collaboration and cultural fit have been outstanding.","This is just the beginning of what we expect to be a broader and more fruitful period of engagement with dental support organizations and one that dovetails with our efforts to adapt to a changing market.","In terms of capital deployment, many DSOs choose to deploy their resources to expand their reach with additional offices and elect to outsource some of the capabilities to their lab partners. Some of our DSO customers already have or will embrace full chair-side restoration capability. Our superior service and technical support in that arena will be of critical importance to these DSOs and the local success of their practices. Value added distributor such as Patterson needs to be able to address the entire market with whatever the individual customer needs to make their professional office most successful. Undoubtedly, this is the start of a very exciting time for our customers, our sales force, and the product manufacturing community. We expect this shift within Patterson dental to create new opportunities for us and for customers and to highlight the competitive advantage we demonstrate in the market every day.","As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see relatively stable, but soft end markets in dental in the second quarter. As with our first quarter, this was generally in line with what has been more widely reported within the North American dental market and the effects were most evident in consumable sales levels. However, we still believe a portion of this impact resulted from disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As we work through the transition caused by this realignment, we expect this impact to moderate.","On the equipment said, we are pleased with our performance during the quarter. Especially considering the difficult year-over-year comparable we faced with CEREC. From our point of view, we are encouraged that practitioners remain willing to invest for the future success of their businesses. Within the category, volumes on basic equipment and digital x-ray were solid during the second quarter. In particular, we are pleased with how our broader basic equipment product portfolio is performing. You will recall that our basic equipment product category also experienced a change in manufacturer relationships. Adding more product manufacturer options has benefited our customers and has strengthened this category for Patterson dental.","Now a look at our Animal Health segment. We continued to see stable to strengthening conditions across this segment during the quarter. In production animal, we saw overall recovery in end markets with the swine market leading the way. We also saw strength in the beef cattle market; however, recovery in dairy end markets has proven to be more protracted than anticipated.","Companion health markets continue to perform well during the quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, sales execution has been a significant priority for us and we are pleased to see substantial sales growth and share gains across the segment. This is certainly a reflection of our efforts to unify our sales teams and present one Patterson Animal Health segment to the market. However, we currently face a challenging pricing environment with branded pharmaceutical companies, which is the result of market consolidation. This is impacted our ability to translate the significant sales momentum into profit contributions we want to see.","I'll remind you that Patterson Animal Health is the North American leader in this space we believe that our scale and scope are important assets and as we work through this period of consolidation, we will emerge as the partner of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we do so, we continue to be intently focused on our customers and operational excellence.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials.","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today.","During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. Overall, we remain competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened our markets in the dental business and saw substantial sales growth and gained market share in Animal Health. However, certain strategic initiatives combined with challenging marketplace dynamics in both dental and Animal Health adversely affected our year-over-year quarterly financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year.","As I've done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. Where appropriate I will make note of our adjusted results which, as John explained, exclude the impact of certain non-recurring and non-cash items. Also our sales discussions for each business segment will exclude foreign currency impacts to provide a more normalized view of our results.","Taking a look at our top-line performance, consolidated sales for the fiscal 2017 second quarter increased 2.1% to $1.4 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, revenue grew 4.1%.","Turning to margins, our second quarter consolidated operating margin was 6.5%, which was 50 basis points lower compared to the prior year quarter. The operating margin decline was chiefly due to decreased profitability in our Animal Health business, which accounted for the largest percentage of our consolidated net sales. I'll expand on this more in a moment.","On the bottom line, reported net income from continuing operations was $45.8 million, up 12% to $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $42.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations declined 3.2% to $53.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was flat versus the prior-year quarter and $0.56 per diluted share.","Now let's move to our segments. As Scott explained in dental, we saw a softer, but relatively stable market in the 2017 second quarter which led to essentially flat sales on a GAAP and constant currency basis.","On the consumable side, the dental market continued to reflect somewhat slower than historical growth. Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.5% in the second quarter. We believe, however, that the sales force realignment that we implemented in the first quarter primarily contributed to the consumables decline. While this initiative is important to better address the needs of the dental customer it is causing some disruption in the channel.","Turning to equipment, Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader and our equipment category was a bright spot in the quarter. We were pleased with our sales in this category, which grew 4.2% in the second quarter. Sales were led by double-digit increases in core equipment and digital x-ray products, which offset lower CEREC sales.","Looking at segment margins, operating margin improved 30 basis points led by our sales force realignment initiative and lower incremental expense. Overall, we believe that the performance of our dental business in the second quarter was competitive relative to the industry.","As Scott mentioned at the end of the second quarter, we elected not to extend exclusivity with Sirona beyond September 2017. As a result, we expect to record a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge in the third quarter of approximately $36 million or $0.24 per diluted share, related to the distribution fee associated with the CEREC product component of this arrangement. While this non-cash accounting charge will not affect Patterson's liquidity, cash flows, or compliance with debt covenant, we expect this decision could negatively affect near-term operations. This impact is reflected in our updated fiscal 2017 earnings guidance.","Now, turning for our Animal Health segment. We saw sales expansion and share gains in our Animal Health business in the 2017 second quarter. Our Animal Health sales grew 4.2% over the prior quarter on a reported basis. After adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, Animal Health segment sales increased 7.8%.","Second quarter reported sales in our companion animal business rose 3.6%, adjusting for currency, contained in animal sales increased 10.8% over last year. Looking more specifically at the U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth was up 15.8% and 9.8% when adjusted for agency [indiscernible].","Growth in production animal sales in the 2017 second quarter improved 4.9%, versus a year ago. Our overall performance in production animal reflects a stronger swine market and improved beef market and continued softness within the dairy portion of the business.","Looking at segment margins, while we generated solid sales volume increases, that growth did not translate to the bottom line improvement. We are capturing market share although it's not at the profit margin we'd like. A reason for this is a more challenging environment related to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing trends, which contributed to an 80 basis point decline in operating margins during the quarter. We are implementing programs to respond to these challenges and remain focused on our customers along with disciplined execution and integration synergy capture.","Our ongoing Animal Health integration and progress towards plan synergies remain on track. We're focused this fiscal year on more effectively leveraging logistics across both of our businesses and further consolidating our back office functions. We still expect to deliver between $18 million and $20 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year which will enable us to meet the $20 million to $30 million run rate of synergies in year three that we announced at the time of the acquisition.","Now, look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash generated from continuing operations was $17.5 million compared to using $21.7 million in the prior quarter. We believe that cash flow will continue to improve for the balance of the year.","We remain confident in our ability to generate cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85 and a 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. CapEx totaled $14 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter and included investments in our corporate-wide information technology initiatives. Inventories were up by $40 million year-over-year. General equipment inventories came down in the quarter, but higher inventories remain in our Animal Health business and to maintain service levels to our integration and ERP implementation.","Regarding our ERP initiative, during this period we are essentially running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. We believe that our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is totally implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound profit in place to migrate to our newer systems in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and it leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. We continue to make good progress on the implementation.","Our investments [indiscernible] nine additional locations to go live in the second quarter. Three fulfillment centers, one vet call center, two Animal Health branches and three dental branches. Together, this resulted in a $3 million expense increased for the quarter. As previously disclosed, we continue to expect a pre-tax $25 million step up in the operating expense for the full year. This expense will accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to depreciate the investment and scale up deployment.","We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhance shareholder value we returned approximately $48.5 million to our shareholders, in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and nearly $100 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain fully committed to our dividends. Our strong cash flow generation is an asset and allows us to fully support our capital allocation strategy, which includes returning capital to our shareholders.","Given our continued position our financial strengths, we have the ability to step up our share repurchases to deliver additional value to our shareholders. We have approximately 15,000,000 shares remaining under our current Board authorization. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it makes sense to do so.","Now turning to taxes. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%; the adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%.","Now I will review our revised fiscal 2017 guidance. As mentioned in our earnings release, in light of both external factors and our strategic decisions, we have re-examined our financial outlook for the year. When we entered fiscal 2017, our guidance was predicated on end markets similar to those experienced in fiscal 2016. However, Patterson and others in our industry have seen softness in the U.S. dental market and challenges with branded pharmaceutical companies in our Animal Health business.","Just as important as these external factors are the strategic decisions we made in the first half of fiscal 2017. First to realign our dental sales force to enhance our effectiveness and more recently to move away from exclusive manufacturer relationships to leverage our support infrastructure across a brighter range of products and customers.","While both of these decisions are key to evolving the customer centric approach for which we are known and realizing our growth in business longer-term, we recognize they will affect near-term financial performance. Therefore, we're updating our guidance as follows.","As Scott noted, we now anticipate adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. Our adjusted guidance excludes the impact of one-time transaction related costs, integration and business restructuring expenses, deal amortization, and non-cash impairment charges, totaling $0.60 per diluted share.","On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.60 $1.75 per diluted share.","While we are only off a few cents from our internal plans through the first half, we are reducing our guidance to this new range based on what we see in the back half of fiscal 2017. Specifically, in dental, the softness in the market coupled with the transition of our exclusive relationship of Sirona and in Animal Health the impact of the margin decline experienced in the current quarter will continue in the near-term as we diligently work to improve margins.","Our guidance range assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in the first half of fiscal 2017 and includes a $25 million pre-tax step up in operating expense associated with the ERP system implementation.","With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Ann. I'll wrap up with a few additional comments as I mentioned recently Patterson is in the middle of an important period of change. Our portfolio moves, technology investments and shifts and how we address the needs of our customers are all part of an important evolution.","What I'd like to emphasize as just as we have demonstrated our commitment to positioning Patterson in the future we are equally committed to restoring Patterson to a more profitable growth in the near term and have multiple levers to pull to do so. Fortunately, we are able to do this from a position of operational and financial strength. Keys to our operational strength our enterprise resource planning initiative and our sales and support infrastructure. We expect our ERP initiatives to significantly improve our ability to help Patterson stay in front of our customers needs and face a change. I have visited various locations where the cutovers to our new system are taking place and I am pleased with our progress and operational continuity.","I commend all of our hard-working employees who have dedicated themselves to pursuing a smooth implementation of this system. We have built a very robust sales, service and technical support structure that customers truly value as they increase their dependence on technology to run their operations.","Our financial strengths gives us the ability to support each aspect of our capital allocation strategy and this will continue. While we faced a some short-term market challenges and navigate the change we have strategically elected, I'm confident in the actions we are taking to position Patterson for the future and optimistic for the prospects of our customers, employees and shareholders.","Now, we'd like to take any questions you may have. So, I'll turn the call back over to Catherine.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will hear first from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Hi. Thanks very much. Scott, can you just elaborate a bit on your decision to alter the Sirona relationship? And how should we think about the sort of puts and takes to your business over the next 12 months? Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Sure. Thanks, John. I'll talk first about strategy, so I think that's very important and then I'll turn it over to Ann to maybe talk about some of the economics. But, I think it's critical that, as I talked about our decision, we also talk about the history and partnership because we do have people who are newer to the story and I think it gives very important context.","If you go back to the 1990s, it really was a vision towards the future that the Patterson management team had as they approached Siemens dental with the offer that we would sell and service the CEREC II exclusively. At the time Siemens had a game changing idea with single visit chair-site dentistry, but really had very limited commercial success to sell the product.","We'd like to say that agreement was the beginning of what we call a 20-year overnight success story as we partnered with the eventual spin-out of Siemens dental, which became Sirona to really do true pioneer work to change dentistry and I would say, we could not be more proud and I speak for all of the employees at Patterson about the work we've done together or more excited about what we are going to accomplish together in the future.","I think it's important that everyone knows our executive teams both at Patterson and Sirona for years have been very consistent in our approach that there would be a day where Patterson will need to expand the portfolio of products. We sell to meet the needs of our customers. And also Sirona will want to access more of the market through potential expanded distribution. This is the critical point. I think we both, as partners, feel now is the perfect time at the end of our contract to move our relationship to the next level and really, this is predicated on our mutual confidence and I would say strong confidence in our ability to compete in the marketplace.","As a reminder, we've seen this scenario. It's playing out right now in our chair business and our great partner ADEC, we remain their largest partner. We have the ability to sell more products which has helped us access more customers. So the other piece is really unlocking growth for both companies and the commitment of both companies of helping the profession accelerate the adoption of digital dentistry.","So a key part of this strategic decision as we both feel and increased interest in activity that will come from expanded distribution will lead to potential acceleration of sales. Bottom line is more people are going to be talking about digital dentistry, more people will be talking about CEREC and we think we can sell 7 out of 10 instead of 5 out of 5 and overtime net-net this will be a real positive for Patterson and Sirona.","Ann Gugino","So John, as it relates -- oh, sorry.","John Kreger","No, no. Go ahead. Thanks Ann.","Ann Gugino","As it relates to your question around guidance, so as we think about our updated guidance for 2017, it does anticipate some headwinds regarding Sirona. Specifically we anticipate there could be some near-term distraction with our field sales force around the Sirona announcement. And then, in addition to that, we anticipate we'll incur some incremental costs to protect the technology assets we've built over the last 20 years.","When you think longer-term, out to 2018, at this point there's still a lot of moving pieces. In addition to Sirona, we plan to add additional technology products to the portfolio. We're on-boarding large new customers, and then, of course, we should start to benefit from our ERP investment in the back half of 2018. So we'll continue to work through the challenges that we are facing over the next 90 days and our plan is to update you on our longer-term outlook next quarter. But I would just emphasize that longer-term, we do believe that the underlying business organically will be able to grow and continue generating significant amounts of cash.","John Kreger","Great. Thank you. And maybe just one more quick one to clarify that your comments on Animal Health around the pharma manufacturer pricing environment, were you referring to just maybe a more muted kind of inflationary trend on their part or is this more a change in the terms that you can buy those products from them?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Great question, John. And I think we really want to look at it from three points, so I'll sort of talk about the current business challenges, give you full context and have Ann get into the financial impact, and then, talk about our mitigation go forward plan.","Really what we're experienced right now is, I would classify as sort of a near-term disruption as a result of some manufacturer consolidation in the space that as we talked about is putting pressure on our margins and I don't want to call out specific manufacturers, but it's clear that we are in the midst of a significant realignment of some of our key partners.","With that said, we really think long-term and I think the important thing is that we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to move share in the market. And that with our scale, reaching both companion and production animal customers really gives us confidence that we'll be the partner of choice among manufacturers as consolidation settles in. So I'll turn it over to Ann to talk about -- to walk you through the financial impact. And then, I want to talk about mitigation.","Ann Gugino","Sure. So while we saw a nice top line growth in the second quarter, about 10%, in the U.S., our operating profit decreased double digits about 18% on an adjusted basis. And I would just say that the 80 basis point decline that you saw -- the challenges that we're seeing with the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers account for 100% of that decline. And it's a variety of factors, John, whether it's rebates, mix and just kind of overall the changes that we're seeing in the terms of the agreements.","We are implementing programs immediately to respond to these challenges, but it will take some time to work through. And as a result, we're taking down guidance for the back half of the year to more closely align with our current quarter performance. So while we are initially targeting operating margins for the segment to be flat for the year after absorbing and allocation for the step-up in expense associated with the ERP implementation, we now expect margins for the full year to decline between 40 and 60 basis points for the year in Animal Health.","Scott Anderson","Ann, I'll just finish by saying, our Animal Health management team is obviously actively engaged with our key partners as well as myself. And it's clear that our growing sales momentum across the platform that Patterson Animal Health is the growing partner of choice for many end customers and we will continue to drive that value and look forward to deepening manufacturer partnership to serve the market. And this is an issue that we intend to get resolved over the next six months.","John Kreger","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken","Hi. Good morning, guys. In terms of the Sirona relationship, obviously, over a long period it's been very successful, but there's also pressures on the sales force when you have minimum levels and you need to hit certain targets relevant to a certain product. Can you talk a bit about it maybe use the chair example of what you learned? But talk a bit about sort of post the expiration of this exclusivity, what you think it'll do to kind of -- the sales force and how you expect them to react and whether or not this could actually be sort of a rallying event for folks versus maybe something that leads to I don't know departures or more transitionary challenges?","Scott Anderson","Hey, Ross. Great question. And I would say, we've had a very thorough communication plan and we had over 100 of our general managers in Minneapolis last week walking through the strategy of what we're doing and why now is the right time. And I would tell you there is the sense of a rallying cry, both for and I want to be clear -- both for support of Sirona and our long-term prospects, but also we talk about one Patterson and we have some tenants around one Patterson and one of those is customer first. And really the feedback I've gotten and we've done some focus groups as well with some of our top salespeople is the ability to, at every point, with the customer first in the decision-making process, is incredibly powerful.","And I think the exclusivity particularly on CEREC served Patterson and Sirona so well historically because you need focus and commitment to make a market. And we made a market together. But we feel now there's momentum and actually a real chance for acceleration in the space that's going to let both Patterson and Sirona win. So we learn this through the ADEC decision, which had been very powerful and I talked to our sales people all over the country and I can't tell you how many times our best salespeople say, let me compete. Just give me all the products and we'll do what's best for the customer. And then, it also puts I think a really exciting competitive spirit back on the manufacturer that best product wins and most effective, most efficient product wins so in my previous answer I talked about the confidence that Sirona and Patterson share and I have been in this relationship for 20 years. We make this decision together as partners because of our confidence to compete and our confidence that this is right for customers.","Ross Muken","And is it possible that that is helpful to you and sort of gaining share on the DSOs, Scott, because I think their choice and best price, et cetera, would probably be a preference versus having just one product to push in on the CAD\/CAM side?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Obviously, and I think it played into our discussions with Heartland. When you look at those large customers, they want access to all products and then they really truly want a logistics partner, a service partner, to take care of everything. So while we have opened a very large door in Heartland, I think -- and I've had multiple conversations with many customers and very actively helping our dental group as we expand and expect to win sales over time. That this absolutely plays for the strategy. I think it also creates plenty of opportunity for Sirona over time to strengthen their story in the DSO community as well.","Ross Muken","Great. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the details so far. Just using maybe Heartland as another example, obviously I know that was a nice win for you guys. Can you maybe just go through a few more detail specifically about what you can learn in terms of the Heartland sales process and how you can apply that to DSO market, I know it's an area that you're trying hard to go into? Can you talk maybe about from a DSO perspective how much they care about service versus product breadth versus price?","Scott Anderson","Yes, great. Thanks, Michael. Well, sort of a [indiscernible] stakes, you have to be -- have competitive economics and that's the same for all of our customers. But I think what was interesting in the evolution of the Heartland relationship and I'm going to have Ann give some color as well because she was very involved as we built the partnership together as well. But really the value proposition centered around and we did a lot of time listening to the customer, how can we help Heartland meet their growth expectations?","They wanted areas where they can improve their operations. They wanted to maximize their practice investments in the most efficient way. So we really looked at it from a joint partnership on how do we optimize the supply chain? And really position Heartland to meet their growth expectations. I'll have Ann give some color because as I said, she was very involved in the process as well.","Ann Gugino","Yes. Certainly, Heartland is a very exciting win for Patterson and I would just reiterate what Scott said, I think as I met with that team and had the opportunity to work on the RSP. I think it's all about unmet needs. And so I think one of the things that was super exciting for me at Patterson as well while we were potentially a little late to this space, what I can tell you, there's absolutely still a lot of unmet need in the space that fits well with what Patterson does well in terms of our competitive advantage around service, around software, around technology. As Scott said, Heartland is all about the customer. It was great. It is going to be a win-win partnership. And I think the other thing that super exciting for me is that the investments that will partner with Heartland on will help us really build a platform that we'll be able to leverage as we bring additional DSOs online. So definitely the work we're doing together will benefit the entire DSO space.","Scott Anderson","Yes. And I would say there's going to be follow-on benefits in terms of some e-commerce initiatives that are going to benefit all of our customers.","Michael Cherny","Thanks. And then, just one quick financial question. Ann, you mentioned how you have flexibility on the buyback given the outstanding authorization, but limitations you have related to leverage or I guess [any gaining] [ph] factors in terms of being able to act on the buyback?","Ann Gugino","No. So I think just to kind of walk through what we've said so far and then I'll get kind of specifically to your leverage question. But we've spent $50 million on share repurchases through the first half of the year, which is a little over 1 million shares. And as you know we're committed to driving shareholder value and cash generation is a real asset. So we will continue to increase the dividend and view our value enhancing share repurchases.","We've previously communicated as part of our overall capital allocation strategy that will allocate between $100 million to $150 million of free cash flow annually to share repurchases. But depending on market conditions, we may choose to accelerate the buyback further. And given our financial strength, we certainly have the ability to step up our share repurchases if we chose to do so. Our current leverage is at about 2.5x, 2.6x EBITDA, so definitely have room there if we chose to do so.","Michael Cherny","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will now hear from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. So Ann maybe a couple of follow-ups to start with you if I could. You mentioned in one of your answers that some of the disruption here may be protecting that technology assets you built around the CEREC platform or the Sirona platform. I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean there, if you could maybe clarify that?","And then, also wondering on the sales disruption side for CEREC, if that is indeed an issue you're kind of imputing in guidance, why would there be a sale disruption in the near-term? I would think reps who would want to be out there selling this especially before more competition comes in and I've heard you put a quota in now this morning for the next nine months or so before the change happens. So why the top-line impact, I'm a little unclear on that as well? Thank you.","Ann Gugino","Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I'll start and I think Scott will probably follow up with a few comments. But, I think as it relates to protecting the assets that we've built this is really around a couple areas, one is our people. We've been selling this product for 20+ years. We have the expertise so just making sure that we're doing the right thing for our people in terms of as we transition to a competitive environment. And then, it's really the intellectual property around the processes that we built around training and after sales support. We have quite the asset at the Patterson technology center in terms of providing first class support. And we just want to make sure that we're doing the right things. And so there will be some additional investment there just to make sure that we protect that IT.","As it relates to the sales disruption, I think when we put the guidance together; we wanted to make sure that we were conservative. And as we've gone through other transitions in the past historically, whether that's the ADEC change or the change when we change how we saw other technology products back with the Eagle software days. Sometimes when you're going through a transition, there is some near-term disruption in the field, so from a conservative standpoint, we did mute the top line in our outlook just to account for that. But with that said, we fully intend to execute on the contract for the balance of our exclusivity and we have no rock unturned in terms of sales leads but I'll turn it over to Scott to add to that.","Scott Anderson","Yes. Thanks, Ann and thanks Jeff. I think that's a great question. And I just want to reiterate what Ann said. Number one is taking a conservative approach, which we have as we put together guidance for the back half of the year. Two, it's an absolute commitment to defend what we've built and we will do that at every turn because we feel it's an absolute competitive advantage to date that's only going to grow with the time. Now three, to the sales force and I would say I have great confidence in our managers and our sales people to absolutely, as you said, use this as a rallying cry.","We have incredibly deep relationships with Sirona. Sirona is family to Patterson and Patterson is family to Sirona. And it is our intent that we use this as an opportunity to finish off the chapter of the 20-year exclusive. But also use this as a launching pad for what we think is going to be a very exciting time of competition.","And when I had our people in Minneapolis last week, what got me the most energized is the confidence of our managers and how excited they are to compete and leverage what we've put blood, sweat and tears into over the last 20 years. So I think you're right on in terms of the conservatism and the guidance, but it is our absolute intent that we exceed those conservative targets.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. That's helpful. And then, I guess my last question would just be, Scott is there any way or Ann to kind of bucket if guidance was being cut at $0.35, on the year, obviously some is soft end markets, it doesn't sound like the ERP spending is changing. So maybe how do we bucket the $0.35 between sales force disruption with the cuts this past June to Sirona stuff maybe currency and some other factors. Can you help us out there at all?","Ann Gugino","Yes, absolutely. So if we think about what's changed in the marketplace and how those recent events are impacting our second quarter results, and then, the implications to 2017, you touched on two factors with unexpected changes in the marketplace that negatively impact the balance of the year. So there's the softness in the U.S. dental market. And then, challenges with branded pharmaceutical pricing in our Animal Health business.","And then, in addition to those factors, it's the strategic decisions we made in the first half of the year most recently, the move towards a non-exclusive manufacturer relationships within our technology portfolio. So when I think about breaking that down, what I can tell you is about half of the reduction in guidance is due to Animal Health and the other half is due to dental and when I think about dental, Jeff, I would say, probably half to 2\/3rds is really more on the consumable market softening and some disruption from the sales force restructuring, and then, the other third is probably around the Sirona piece as rough bucket.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. That's helpful. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to start and I'll keep it to two, North American consumable growth was, I think the [weakness in Sirona] [ph] recession and you mentioned market and sales force and I believe mostly sales force. So Scott maybe curious and with all due respect why you didn't see this as a potential outcome from the sales pruning. I mean obviously one of your main assets is, the rep relationship with the practice, so now several months later, post some of the changes what took you by surprise on the rep front?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I'll talk about the general market, Jon, and then, I'll talk about the rep piece because I think there two important parts. I would say on the general market commentary that the softness we experienced and the entire industry experienced in the summer continued through the fall. And as we look at the back half of the year, if we decided to take a conservative approach saying that there wouldn't be any market improvement. I would say the market is stable and if I had to look at a growth rate, I would say it's probably zero to 100 basis points. So a more lethargic market.","So while we're disappointed that it didn't swing back post summer, I think we have really strong potential fundamentals for the market that give us optimism going forward. You've heard this before. It's stable to improving consumer confidence. It's low unemployment levels. It's continued trend of customers investing in technology. And then, it's the demand it driven for favorable North American demographics.","So on the sales force side, and I think this is important part of the strategy because we absolutely are committed to it and feel like we made the right move to move the business towards where the market is going. The sales erosion is contained to a certain number of customers, but when you look at the upside opportunity of almost 19,000 new customers that we've assigned some of our best sales people to. We look at the long-term growth opportunity as being substantial and material. What we did not anticipate in the front end and maybe I'll turn it over to Ann to talk about just what consumable softening does to our operating model.","Ann Gugino","Yes. So great question, Jonathan. So certainly, when we put together our guidance for the year, knowing that we were going to do that rep realignment we absolutely factored in some distraction in the field. I think what we didn't account for is the continued and softening of the markets or end markets softening. And if we look across the industry, by my estimate, we're off by about 200 basis points from the trailing 12 months. And it's really that factored that's causing the reduction in guidance. When you go back to my script, what we were trying to say there when we were talking about the rep restructuring accounting for most of the decline is that if you added the rep restructuring back and didn't factor that in we would be growing with the market.","Scott Anderson","Yes. And I would just add one last piece, if you look at the strength of our equipment business in the quarter, and that is what the realigned sales force, I think that shows that the productivity of our sales people and the sales we're making across the platform, we haven't missed a beat on outside maybe Ann has one other comment she can throw in.","Ann Gugino","Yes. I think the other thing when you look at the rep realignment, just to make the very salient point that the upside from these actions is much greater than the current business laws. So when we look longer term, we actually -- we absolutely believe this is the right move in terms of unlocking market potential for our best reps.","Jon Block","Okay. Great that's very helpful. I think just one other one, on the other side of the business, on the vet side, can you just give some more clarity on the issue with the branded manufacturers. I apologize if I missed the details, but the industry has been consolidating for some time now, so I guess what is incremental or new with the marketplace that's resulting in this pressure. And then, just from a margin perspective, is it anything you can do to alleviate the margin pressures from the manufacturers or is it just trying to find other sources of savings to help you guys with profitability? Thank you.","Scott Anderson","I'll start. It's two things, Jon. And as I said in my prior comment, I don't want to get into the specifics of key manufacturers and negotiate in public. But there are some significant realignments going on right now. We're working through that the market is already also working through the consolidation that's happening in distribution. And that's why we are very confident that we will move through this and capture the value that we create for the customers. And I can maybe have Ann add some color to that.","Ann Gugino","Yes. So I think to answer your question is there opportunity with the manufacturers and then internally? I think the answer to that is both. So when I think about the size and scale of our organization with a combination of production animal and containing animal and really, serving both those markets and the value that we bring to the manufacturer community, I really think that as the consolidation settles down, we will be the partner of choice.","But I think that's a little bit longer term. When I think about what we can do in the shorter term, while we're lowering guidance, we are promptly taking steps to address the headwinds that we've identified there are many levers we can pull to offset some of the profit pressure. For example, we've identified additional and we have ongoing cost management initiatives underway to bring savings to the company.","But of course, it's a balance of right because we also have the incremental step ups and expense from our IT investment. And of course, we are just ramping up that implementation. So it's definitely a balance. We also are continuing to work on integration activities and pushing hard to drive incremental synergies so we are all over this. But it will take some time to work through.","Jon Block","Thanks for the color, guys.","Scott Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We will go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Ann, I just wanted to go back to your comments on the consumables market. And if you could clarify how consumables trended during the quarter, I think the comments that you guys had made on your last call about August seemed to be that consumables were moving more in the right direction. So just curious how trends played out in September and October. And then, I know that some others had called out weather is a potential headwind in October, so just curious if you saw that as well.","Scott Anderson","Hey, Nathan. This is Scott. Let me take that first and Ann can give some color at the end. I think it's very important what we're talking about volatility in consumables, we are talking about a very small band. This is a stable market that's moving between 2% underlying market growth and maybe flattish underlying market growth. So we don't want to overreact to the trends. I would say we saw a little pick up coming into the fall but then it settled back down. So what we see is just a stable market. We have a lot of confidence that the market is not receding from where it's at right now.","Obviously a lot happened here this fall politically and it'll be interesting to see how small businesses potentially could see some positive influence from Washington going forward which would benefit the dental market. But I think I just want to caution everyone that these are very small bands of \"volatility\" and maybe turn it over to Ann.","Ann Gugino","Yes. So when I think back to first quarter, we didn't want to overreact to the consumable results. And then, of course, we had a lot of noise going on with our internal restructuring activities. You're right. We did see some rebound in October. But unfortunately, the softness has continued with similar results in Q2. I think as we look at our Q2, our Q2 actually improved throughout the quarter and I think that really speaks more to the sales rep realignment activities as we settled down and began to claw back our customers. But, we lost and win back that share. So I think for us we saw -- and again as Scott said it's a narrow band, but we did see some improvement in October.","Scott Anderson","Yes. And I would just finish Nathan by saying, I don't think weather had a material effect -- you had a hurricane in the southeast but most of that was over the weekend. And Friday, generally can be a bit of a slower day in dental practices, so obviously some impact but nothing I would specifically call out.","Nathan Rich","Okay. Great. Appreciate the comments. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And now, I would like to go ahead and turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks for joining us today. Ann and I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the Greater New York dental meeting. And in the meantime, I wish each of you a happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to updating you to our progress in the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation."],"17041":["Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) Q1 2013 Earnings Call August 23, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Scott P.

Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Patterson Company's First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, August 23, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Anderson, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott P. Anderson","Thank you, Erin. Good morning, and thanks for taking time to participate in our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some highlights of our first quarter performance following my opening remarks.","Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for our fiscal 2013 in our press release earlier this morning. This guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecasts. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report on form 10-K and other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.","Turning now to our first quarter results. We reported results that were largely consistent with our internal forecast for this period. Consolidated sales increased 5% to $889.8 million from $847.4 million in last year's first quarter. We also reported net income of $47.5 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $48.6 million or $0.48 (sic) [$0.42] per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Our net income in this year's first quarter was affected by the absorption of $3.2 million of incremental interest expense related to our debt issuance in last year's third quarter.","We are generally pleased with our first quarter results despite persistently soft economic conditions, both in North America and our foreign markets. Now for the next few minutes, I will briefly review some operational highlights for our 3 businesses. Patterson Dental, our largest business, reported solidly higher first quarter sales growth of 6% or $567.9 million (sic) [$567,392,000]. Within this unit, sales of consumable supplies were below forecasted levels, and we are intensifying our focus on this key component of our sales mix. However, the exceptionally strong sales growth of CEREC products and low double-digit sales growth of basic equipment more than compensated for the below plan consumable sales. Our robust CEREC sales were generated, in part, by strong demand from new users, reflecting the ongoing trend towards the digitization of dentistry. We estimate that CEREC systems have penetrated approximately 10% of the North American dental market, which means this product line has significant sales potential going forward.","We believe sales will receive an additional boost from the recent introduction by Sirona of a revolutionary new camera for its CEREC system. As the latest technological advancement for the CEREC system, the Omnicam camera, featuring powder-free imaging and streaming, photorealistic 2D and 3D clinical images that are displayed in full color. This new camera, which will be available on new CEREC systems, will make CEREC significantly easier to use and provide for improved clinical outcomes. CEREC systems equipped with the Omnicam camera will start selling in the second quarter as Sirona ramps up production.","Also last week, Sirona introduced the introduction of the new Schick 33 intraoral sensor, which provides the highest resolution of any sensor in the market, improved image management and compatibility with existing Schick systems. In addition, Patterson and Sirona, the undisputed leader in digital dental technology, recently expanded our exclusive North American marketing agreement to cover Sirona's complete product line, including digital panoramic and cone beam X-rays. This move further strengthens Patterson Dental's position as the leading distributor of dental technology and other equipment.","Moving on to Webster, we are very pleased with the first quarter performance of our Webster Veterinary supply unit. Webster's internally generated sales increased more than 10% in this period. A change in a distribution agreement for nutritional products late in last year's fourth quarter reduced Webster's first quarter sales growth by approximately 6 percentage points, while the August 2011 acquisition of American Veterinary Supply Corporation added 2.5 percentage points of sales growth. Reflecting these factors, Webster's first quarter sales increased nearly 6.5% to $191.1 million.","Webster's solidly higher sales were generated by robust demand for consumable supplies. This growing business is currently implementing a range of strategies aimed at further strengthening its full service platform. The expansion and training of its field sales force are aimed at boosting sales of both consumables and equipment. To further spur its equipment business, Webster plans to achieve full national coverage for technical service by the end of fiscal 2013. In addition, Webster is continuing to strengthen its growing range of technology solutions for veterinarians and their clients.","Reflecting these and other initiatives, Webster is enhancing its competitive position to capitalize upon favorable pet ownership and consumer spending trends, and we intend to continue investing in this growing business. Before leaving Webster, it should be noted that IDEXX Laboratories recently reaffirmed its long-standing exclusive relationship with Webster, and we look forward to continue growing with the industry-leading manufacturer of veterinary products.","Sales of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, declined 3% in the first quarter to $130.7 million, due primarily to weakness in its equipment business. The impact of negative foreign exchange rates largely offset the nearly 2% sales contribution from Patterson Medical's April 2012 acquisition of Surgical Synergies, a distributor of physiotherapy, rehabilitation and mobility products serving the Australian and New Zealand markets.","Despite U.S. health care regulatory uncertainties and the weak economic environment both here and abroad, we believe Patterson Medical, as the only single source of supply in the rehabilitation market, is strongly positioned to take maximum advantage of worldwide demographic trends that will have a favorable long-term effect on the rehabilitation market.","Finally, as we stated in this morning's release, we remain on plan toward achieving our previously issued financial guidance of $2.10 to $2.16 per diluted share in fiscal 2013.","In closing, I want to say that although our markets have not yet returned to their historic growth norms, Patterson's businesses are continuing to perform well in a challenging economic environment. We are proceeding on track for the successful fiscal 2013, and we are optimistic about Patterson's long-term future.","Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some additional financial highlights from our first quarter results.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Before I start, just to clarify, Scott misspoke. Last year's earnings per share were $0.42 per share, not $0.48 per share. Sorry to do that to you publicly, Scott.","Scott P. Anderson","It's all right.","R. Stephen Armstrong","I'll get flogged later. Thanks, Scott. I'll begin my remarks with an additional comment or 2 on sales growth for the quarter. The impact on consolidated sales from the benefit of acquisitions and the negative changes in currency exchange effectively offset one another in the period. Each was less than 100 basis points.","As we had previously disclosed and as Scott mentioned earlier, the change in a nutritional product arrangement in our veterinary unit reduced consolidated sales growth by 130 basis points in the quarter. This change will continue to affect our sales volumes into the first half of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, but it has a minimal impact on our operating profit as we now sell this product under a national agency commission arrangement.","The primary factor influencing our consolidated gross margin in the quarter was mixed. Gross profit was up 3% in the quarter from the higher sales volumes, but our gross margin declined 70 basis points as the trade-up activity in the Dental segment on the CEREC product and the continued strong seasonal sales of parasiticides in the Veterinary segment depressed our margin. Both of these factors are expected to diminish as we progress through the fiscal year.","Our operating expense ratio improved by 40 basis points on the improved sales volumes as we were able to gain leverage on our fixed cost structure. Two items that dampened this improvement included integration and rationalization costs related to the Australian operations of the Medical unit and the cost associated with the continued expansion of the technical service capacity of the Veterinary unit. We do not anticipate these items to be significant as we move through the remainder of the year.","Our first quarter operating margins were 9.8% for Dental, 12.6% for Medical and 5.3% for Veterinary. Interest expense in the quarter increased over $3 million as we absorbed the impact of the incremental debt that was added in December of 2011. Our lower income tax rate reflects the increased benefit from the deductibility of the cash dividend paid to the Employee Stock Ownership plan in the current period. As you will recall, we increased our cash dividend in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year.","The tax rate for the fiscal year should be in the range of 35% to 35.5%. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $60 million in the first quarter compared to $67 million in the year-earlier period. This change was principally due to the timing of tax payments.","I also want to mention we repurchased approximately 1.1 million Patterson shares during the first quarter under our 25 million share buyback authorization that expires in 2016. Approximately 10 million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization, and depending upon market conditions and other factors, we may make further share repurchases on an opportunistic basis.","A brief review of our balance sheet reveals the seasonality of our businesses. The higher sales levels and resulting increase in accounts receivable in the third and fourth quarter of the prior year are generally paid down in the first quarter of the subsequent year. At quarter end, our DSOs stand at 43 days compared to 46 in the prior year, while inventory turns are 6.9 compared to 6.7 a year ago.","With that, I'll turn it back to the conference operator, who'll pool you for your questions. Erin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the lines of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, I was just wondering how the $0.45 of EPS compares to your internal plan. And following up on that is how do you see the earnings ramping throughout the remainder of the year? Should it follow the same progression as we saw last year?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Kevin, this is Steve. The first part of your question with regard to how did it come against our plan, we were right on our plan, our internal plan. As far as ramping, it would be similar to what you've seen in the prior year, where the bulk of our earnings come in the third and the fourth quarter. But we would anticipate the second quarter should see some improvement over the first quarter relative to performance to the prior year as well.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then how much of an impact did the new Sirona contract have this quarter? Did you see any disruption with any of the other manufacturers?","Scott P. Anderson","No, Kevin, this is Scott. I don't think we saw any impact in terms of the sales line. We continue to have strong sales with our partners that compete with Sirona. If anything, it's -- I think it'll be a big net positive moving forward as our field is very excited about the opportunity to sell some great products in a very integrated fashion. But I wouldn't say anything in the first quarter that was out of normal from prior quarters.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then following up on that, with the new Omnicam, and a lot of excitement and interest by the dentists. How do you think that's going to play out in the coming quarters? Will you see much disruption as the sales force have to go out and educate all the dentists that weren't at the conference last weekend? And is there enough product on the market? Were you guys going to see a lot of sales flow through in the next couple quarters?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, 2  things. First, we obviously had a very successful trade-up program in the first quarter. And part of our strategy with Sirona, and I think I talked about it last quarter, was to get as many customers on the new software platform, with the Bluecam, the 4.0 software, because that is the same platform that eventually, customers, if they choose to move to Omnicam, will move to. So in terms of training of our sales force, I would say our sales force is completely up to speed, because at the end of the day, the software is a really key part of this. Part 2 is we had all of our CEREC specialists in Las Vegas last week, so they are fully trained on the Omnicam and obviously extremely excited to get out and talk to customers. From a sort of a forecasting going forward, we've been working close with Sirona on forecasts and supply chain issues. We anticipate that the next quarter will be a quarter of billing inventory and getting demo units out. We'll concentrate on new users for the majority of the fiscal year. And then as their supply chain grows, which we believe it will and can, we will start to work into that backlog. We already have customers who currently own CEREC who want to upgrade. So obviously, it's very exciting news. I think powder-free camera is a big leap forward in technology. And with the Omnicam and with the Bluecam, we feel we've got the 2 best CAD\/CAM products in the world to sell to our customers.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And, Scott, in your prepared remarks, did you say CEREC penetration in North America was 10%?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, it's roughly over 10%. We're between 14,000 and 15,000 new users. It's -- I always am a little cautious on market share because it's a little bit how you define the market. But I think what we were trying to say is there's a very long runway on the CAD\/CAM opportunity.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. So is that the difference between -- I think last quarter you said the penetration was 12%. So is it just a matter of how you're thinking about the market side?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, you -- we really want to say over 10%. It's hard to, Kevin, give you a specific number. But it's obviously in that 10% to 15% range. But more importantly, as I said, 80%-plus of customers do not have the product, and there's high interest for it.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just lastly, with the IDEXX announcement, with MWI going nonexclusive, just wondering what your thoughts are in that arrangement. And if they're successful, would you want a similar feel that they got?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think it's similar, if you look traditionally at how we partner on the dental side with the leading manufacturers and bringing great products to customers. We have great respect for the technology IDEXX has on the diagnostic side and are very excited. And it was our preference, as we publicly stated before, to continue to grow our partnership with IDEXX.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I just want to dig a little bit more into the margin progression. Obviously, incredibly strong quarter on the equipment side, with CEREC kicking in. You noted that had a negative mix issue. Is there any way to quantify, with regards to specifically the trade-ups, any of the mix issues? And then going on the other line items, just a little more clarity on some of the veterinary-related headwinds with regards to gross margins?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Mike, this is Steve. I don't want to get into a lot of detail as far as gross margin breakdown. We've never historically done that, nor do I think we want to do it for competitive purposes, but I can tell you that the 2 major items I talked about in my comment that affected the margin in the quarter were the trade-up program. We sold a lot of trade-ups during the quarter, and they carry a much lower margin than our average product. As Scott also mentioned, consumables were a little bit softer than we had anticipated, and so our mix between consumables and total equipment change, that had an impact on the margin. And then the strength of the Veterinary business and the mix of their products also impacted the gross margin. So those 3 factors pretty much accounted for what we saw in gross margin. Obviously, as we go forward, you're going to see a mitigation of the seasonal aspect of the parasiticides on the Vet business. You're also going to see, with the new camera now out, you're going to see more new sales or new users sales of CEREC, which will carry better margins, so that should have less dampening effect. And probably the item that we think about the most is the consumable growth and how do we get that market moving in a stronger direction upward. And that can have a big impact on the overall margins as well.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. And then just quickly turning to the rehab market a bit. Obviously, it seems like their macro pressures continued to impact with the strong market share business. In terms of kind of incremental data points or inflection points you're looking for, kind of what are the key signs? Now that we're through the Supreme Court decision, is that the potential driver you need to reaccelerate growth in that business? Or is it just kind of a matter of time in working through some of the macroeconomic uncertainties? I guess what are you looking for in terms of your end markets to get a better sense of a return to growth in that business?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I think that the positive part, Michael, is the core business of consumables in the core rehab market is growing in the low single digits, but we see growth there. Really the 2 areas of weakness are the equipment side, where you still have a lot of caution on buyers in terms of sort of figuring out the rules of the road going forward before they make capital expenditures. And we've talked about it in the past, but the U.K. market, with the austerity moves and some of the changes with NHS, continues to be a challenged market. So the rehab story really boils down to right now the equipment piece and the U.K. But as we talked about before and many times in past calls, this is a business and a space that has great underlying growth dynamics in terms of the aging population. And we'll work through this temporary softness until we've got a very strong competitive position and an exciting story ahead of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Scott, you talked about intensifying your focus on the sales of consumables, specifically within Dental. I guess I was wondering just how much of the below internal expectation results were market driven? If we take a step back and we look at Dental consumable results from you guys this quarter and put them together with some of the commentary from the other dental folks this quarter, it does seem like there's a bit of a slight deceleration in the U.S. market. So I'm just curious, how much control do you really have around reaccelerating the consumable sales within Dental?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. Yes, Bob, there's no doubt the total market softened beginning about May. But we also feel that the consumable business is an execution game as well. So we have many programs underway from a marketing perspective and a customer loyalty perspective as well as an intensification of our new training sales program. So yes, it's obvious that there's a big piece of this that is out of our control, but that's definitely not an excuse for our dental team, and they are taking immediate action to drive that business. We feel we've got a lot of tailwind on the technology and equipment side, and any way that we can potentially couple that momentum together with consumable presentations with our customers, we'll take advantage of that.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And then just one big picture one, if I could. Scott, you obviously called out Omnicam. Seems like you guys and Sirona are very excited about this introduction. I mean, could you maybe just give us a little bit better of a sense of exactly how incremental this introduction will be in driving CEREC penetration? I know you did say that it's approximately 10% in North America currently. I mean, is this a significant enough step forward that you could see some acceleration within that penetration rate from here?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, absolutely, Bob. We see this leap forward, particularly the leap to powder free as a major step forward in terms of driving new user adoption. It's another reason for our sales force to present the product again. And one of the common things you hear from customers who are looking at CAD\/CAM is there's always some sense of fear in terms of implementation. And now, the ease of use, the CEREC 4.0 software was a major leap forward that we talked about a year ago. But you couple that with the Omnicam and just how easy it is to take an impression and then the visual aspect now to the clinical piece of CEREC, we feel this will be a absolute game changer on the CEREC side, and we're very excited about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if maybe you could just further comment on the idea of equipment and consumables and your ability to be able to transfer those sales over. So you talked about consumables being weak, and starting in May, it got a little bit weaker. Can you maybe just talk about that? I mean, equipment seems to be incredibly strong. Do you -- are you able to track if you have 100% of the consumables from those customers, or is there a way to look at that and really target those customers going forward?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Lisa, I think we absolutely believe when you take a longer view, it's hard to do a 90-day chunks. But one of the biggest issues dentistry will have is greater demand for services. As the population grows, patients keep their teeth longer, and the number of dentists, particularly in North America, will be fairly stagnant over the next 10 years. So one of the big challenges\/opportunities is increasing the clinical outcomes and proficiency of our customers. So as we do that through digital X-ray and products like CEREC, the ability for the dental market to grow because it becomes more efficient is a big piece of the growth story. So it's an interesting mixed bag of the dental community right now. But when we look at customers who have implemented digital technologies, cone beam, CEREC and others, their consumable spend tends to grow faster than those that have not.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is there still an opportunity within those? Obviously, consumables are growing, but for you take market share, my understanding is most dentists use more than one distributor per product.","Scott P. Anderson","Absolutely, and that is one of our strategies, not only through the implementation of technology, but through our customer loyalty programs.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Steve, can you just update us on what you're seeing currently in the acquisition environment?","R. Stephen Armstrong","I'll let Scott handle that. He gets to sign the big checks.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. We just want to make sure Steve was still awake, so thanks, Lisa. I think we can say that we're seeing increased activity on the M&A front. And we've been very public in terms of our capital allocation strategy, and that's to put our strong cash flows to work in value-creating acquisitions as well as returning dividends that grow over time and when we do not deliver on the acquisition side to drive shareholder value back through share repurchase. But there definitely is activity right now in the M&A front.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just 1 or 2 actually. On the continuation of the existing relationship with IDEXX -- and, Steve, I hope the flogging from Scott isn't too bad.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Actually, it's pretty thick already there.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So I guess my question is really on the new Sirona relationship and maybe get your comments on that. They've obviously stated that part of that relationship is changed commitments in terms of minimums and as well as the exclusivity, which in our view, it seems like that's going to help you get another, I don't know, $30 million, $35 million of annualized sales just in taking share from others. But I guess is that the right ballpark? And then I guess, Scott, from your standpoint, how would you describe your view of the characteristics of the minimums of the new relationships, the sharing of some of the promotional dollars, or anything else in the new relationship that you think is important?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Larry. That's a great question. I think we really don't look at it as a new agreement, but really it's an evolution of the partnership we've had with Sirona, going back to the days when we became the exclusive distributor on CEREC 2. So one of the things that we've done with Sirona's management is looked at ways at how can we accelerate this digital transformation of dentistry. And together, we came to the agreement that the integrated story is so powerful, particularly between CEREC and cone beam and digital, that the ability to -- from both a strategy perspective and a sales execution perspective and a service perspective, that for us to take our relationship up a notch made a lot of sense competitively. So in terms of minimums, we have obviously sales targets we need to hit to maintain this relationship. But even if you fast-forward 5, 10, 15 years down the road, regardless of what the distribution of those products are, we will always be a very big part of Sirona's history and their success and vice versa. So we feel very comfortable with the agreement and see that it was a great, I think, next step from the prior agreement we had for both Patterson and Sirona.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. But certainly, I mean, is it fair to say that this gives you increased visibility of your ability to continue to what's obviously a very good first quarter into the rest of this year on not only just CEREC but some of your other equipment lines?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, and we have absolute great respect for the R&D prowess of Sirona, their commitment both to putting money back into R&D, but also what is in their Skunk Works, in the pipelines and what the engineers at Sirona dream about in 5 to 10 years. And I think Sirona has great respect for our investment in infrastructure. And you look at our Technology Center in Effingham now with over 400 people there supporting dentists after they buy this technology. It gets us pretty excited about the opportunity over the next decade and beyond.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up, Scott, I know at the show last week, a lot of conversation about the ability to -- if your Bluecam users still have that software as part of the Omnicam process. And you talked about the importance of new users as well as upgrade of current users. But in your mind, as you think about Omnicam, is the target market for this really the Redcam users who want -- need to make that leap? And if that's the case, what percentage of your installed base would you define still is in that Redcam category?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. Well, first, before I get to the Redcam, I would say the focus and the exciting part obviously is growing the CEREC user base with this leap forward in Omnicam. It's obvious that -- and the folks over in Las Vegas are absolute rabid fans of CEREC, and they want the latest and greatest, so we know we will upgrade a lot of customers to Omnicam over time. But I think what this really does is it helps us kick into high gear the adoption of CAD\/CAM with CEREC moving forward. The -- we did the Bluecam trade-up in the first quarter. And I said 90 days ago that one of the big reasons we did that obviously was we've had such positive response from the 4.0 software. But what I couldn't talk about 90 days ago was we also knew that a new technology was going to come out. It was very important for us to give a path for those Redcam users to get on the new software platform and eventually either stay with Bluecam or have the option down the road to get to Omnicam. So there will be an opportunity for Redcam users still to move to either Bluecam or Omnicam, but that will not be our main focus here in the short term.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess, Scott, I mean, would you still say that, what, maybe 1\/3 or more of the installed base is still Redcam?","Scott P. Anderson","Less than that.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess finally -- and it sounds like all this suggests that -- I think you, in the past, have said you continue to view that CAD\/CAM category as a double-digit grower. Obviously, it sounds like this quarter was probably over 20%. I know you don't want to be too more specific, but certainly, as I hear you, and this relationship, certainly sounds like that's still the case, so I just want to confirm that. And I guess the final question is really for Steve, and that is just a little bit of clarification on the CapEx. You may have addressed it in your prepared remarks. It seems a little bit lower. I guess that's just a timing issue. Are you still confirming $25 million to $30 million for the full year? And the tax rate, you're saying 30% -- 35% to 35.5%, is that lower than your original thought, or is it about the same as what you'd been thinking?","Scott P. Anderson","I'll take the CEREC question first, Larry. We absolutely are confident that this space in CAD\/CAM is a double-digit grower on average over time. Obviously, you'll have some swings in 90 day periods. But our confidence, and I think we've been very public about this, even in tougher times, selling CAD\/CAM, is we are great believers in this space and are very excited about the opportunity over the next 5 to 10 years. And I would say the same thing for the digital categories as well. And I'll turn it over to Steve for the CapEx.","R. Stephen Armstrong","CapEx, Larry, where we were investing fairly heavily over the previous 5 years in redoing the distribution center, expanding some of our operations, building the PTC, those projects are pretty much complete. Where most of our CapEx will be going forward is just on replenishment, and then also we have a goal of spending a fair amount on IT systems over the next 3 to 5 years. So it's just a matter of timing. I think we're still going to be in that $25 million range for the total for the year. At this point, to get it up to $35 million, I don't think there's a realistic project out there right now, but something may come along. But we're looking more at the $25 million range right now. But as far as the tax rate, you're correct. We're looking at it, after we completed last year, filed our returns or did most of the work on preparing the returns for filing, it looks like the rate for this year is going to be in that mid-35% someplace, 35.3% to 35.5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The -- Scott or Steve, we've seen these robust equipment sales quarters on a quarterly basis. They're often followed by a very healthy miss the next quarter. So can you get us confident that the second quarter sales trends on the equipment side are robust? I know your enthusiasm for CEREC, but how about that basic equipment? Is there promotional activity or anything else going on that can keep us confident that these growth rates are in the ball park for the second quarter?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure, Bob. First, on the CEREC front, obviously, we're excited. Part of the second quarter will depend on product flow from Sirona. One of the things we've done with our sales force over the last year, in fact, we're completing the last event in Atlanta this weekend, is we've been out in front of 1,500 sales people in the last sales 6 months to really take advantage of what we believe has been pent-up demand on the core equipment business over to last 2 to 3 years. So we're confident that we'll continue to drive that. I think you'll look at our third quarter, the calendar fourth quarter where we have the potential of Section 179 going back to its historic levels. You have the medical device tax issue looming out there. So you'd couple all of those things with, I think, strong execution from our sales force sitting down with customers that gives us confidence that the funnel is building -- the funnel is absolutely building on the equipment side. And then the CEREC story we think could be the kicker on top of that.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as you relate to the veterinary investment to expand the technical capabilities that you do have, I don't know if you tried to size that, what that may have been in the quarter. And secondarily, is this the final step in terms of emulating the Dental business, where maybe it would afford you some pricing power on the consumables front that you're not seeing now? Is it the same strategy?","Scott P. Anderson","Why don't you start, Steve, with the technical service expense?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, that technical service, Bob, we'll continue to invest in it throughout the year. But the bulk of the investment has been made. We're off to a very good start there. Obviously, still some to be made. It will have a lesser impact, obviously, as that -- the revenue picks up from that part of the business. There's also the ancillary as you do more technical service. We would anticipate that you're going to get more capital opportunity with that customer to sell them capital goods as you've built that confidence. So there's a sort of an ancillary or a spray paint effect to that. So that's sort of what we see for technical service going forward.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, and we've talked about this before, Bob, but we see the opportunity, obviously, on the equipment side to garner more traditional-like margins as we build out that piece of our revenue portfolio. It will be, I think, tougher to expand the consumable margins, but that obviously will be one of not only, I think, our goals, but all of distribution over time.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Any idea, you can't give me the absolute numbers, the spread between sales of dental consumables, how profitable they are, versus sales of the veterinary consumables? I assume that spread is bigger than a bread box still.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, the consumable dollar on the dental side, Bob, is obviously more nutritious than the equipment for a couple reasons. One, the gross margins tend to be 2 to 4 percentage points higher on average. And then secondly, there's a higher commission structure on the equipment transaction than the consumable transaction. So you are correct in that consumable growth has a much greater impact on the operating line and -- than the equipment would on an average basis.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But comparing consumables with dental and vet, what's the differential there in the margin?","R. Stephen Armstrong","That really different depends on the mix, Bob, because if you look at traditional consumables or supplies, they're very similar.","Scott P. Anderson","Gloves, white goods, things like that.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, needles, sutures, that sort of thing. If you look at the pharmaceutical, they're probably half, well less than half. So it just depends on the mix. And that's why you're seeing some margin pressure in the Vet business is because the pharmaceutical side of the business with the parasiticides and the heartworm medications and so forth this summer have been growing quite a bit faster than the underlying supply business.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just lastly, Steve, still planning to pay down $125 million in debt here with cash on hand?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes we are, Bob. And that'll happen, I think it's scheduled for March. We may jump some of that and pay a little bit earlier, but we haven't fully decided on that yet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I know in a lot of previous conference calls, the general topic of operating leverage or margin expansion comes up, including on this call. But this is the seventh quarter in a row now you've had operating expense or SG&A expense, whatever you want to call it, growing faster than gross profits. And also, 16 of the last 20 quarters, not that I'm keeping track, but the challenge basically seems to go beyond just the sales mix each quarter. And now you're talking about, \"Intensification of sales focus,\" which some people may read into as code for higher SG&A expense even going forward over the next few quarters. So really just trying to get a better sense for when you think that you may be able to turn the corner on operating leverage in the overall business and also how much this sales intensification may lead to higher SG&A over the rest of fiscal year?","R. Stephen Armstrong","I'll take the numbers side of that, Steve, and turn it back to Scott for the strategy side of it. But we actually gained leverage on the operating structure this quarter, which in a first quarter is not all that typical. So I thought we made advancement in that area across the company. We would expect to see that going forward. I might remind folks that this business typically gets the greatest leverage in the second half of the year as the sales volumes tend to pick up in the third and the fourth quarter. So first and second quarter are typically not great leverage quarters. I think if you're looking at the operating margin line, most of it is in the gross profit. We explained that being the mix in the quarter, we would anticipate that mix changing somewhat particularly with regard to the CEREC trade-up activity and the cost associated with that or the lower margins associated with that activity. And then also as the Vet business would get into the fall, the Vet mix will taper back on the seasonal products, which carry the lowest margins. So I think looking forward, Steven, I'm pretty optimistic that you're going to see that margin expansion that we talked about. Obviously, if something would happen well outside our control with regard to the revenue side of the business, bets would be off. But we think with what we're looking at going forward this year, it should be margin expansion for the business. In terms of the investment, you're right. We're making investment, but we're making investments in the business constantly. I think what we're trying to tell you is that with those investments, we believe we can help drive the top line, which then gives you the leverage that you're looking for throughout the system.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But something, at least for the short term, then is you're talking about sales intensification, that's not necessarily going to lead to higher expense or materially higher than the trend line you're on right now if you're expecting some leverage by the end of the year. Is that kind of safe to say?","Scott P. Anderson","Absolutely. And I would echo that we're very proud of the fact that we are extremely efficient in terms of our expense structure and are an industry leader in terms of the profitability, we can turn on each dollar. And we also have the largest sales force, particularly in the dental industry. So this is not about incremental expense addition, this is about some focus on the assets we already have in the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Scott, hearing your comments just on the dental consumables business, and obviously, we started to see some softness in May. June was particularly soft from what we're hearing. Is it worth even trying to talk about exit trajectory? I mean, did July pick up, which is what we're hearing happened? Is that giving added confidence in consumables maybe picking up over the next couple quarters? Or too volatile at this point to really comment?","Scott P. Anderson","Probably a little too volatile to comment on, but it's a very similar scene that's happened really the last 3 summers, where the air has come out of the balloon a bit in terms of the total market. The confidence I have is just when we look at how our customers are looking at the future and starting to reinvest in their practices and how open they are to looking at technology. And the fact when you look deeper in sort of the micro categories, the market is -- still is very stable. Patient flows are decent, and what we saw and I think the whole industry saw was a little bit of softness in areas like crown and bridge and impression material more than restorative dentistry that happened. And that tends to -- and we've seen it throughout the last 4 years since 2008. When that softens up, it usually does come back because those are mostly deferred decisions by patients.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right, great. And then, Steve, just on the margin front here, your comments there on expecting to see some improvement later this year. I mean, as I look through segment by segment, you gave some real nice margin expansion in the second half of '12 on the rehab side, so those comps do get a bit tougher. Webster, it sounds like you're talking about this bolus of service investments that -- on the technical side, that might continue to pressure there a little bit. And dental equipment sound like it's going to be probably the biggest growth driver on the dental side over the next few quarters, which obviously has the lower margin. So I still struggle to see where your confidence or where our confidence should come from on margin expansion over the balance of this year.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Well, I think it's a combination, Jeff, of things we've already touched on as far as -- this trade-up activity has a definite effect on the dental margins. And even getting back to the impact on the Dental business, even has a gross margin -- or results in a gross margin less than the average equipment transaction. So as you get back to the averages, even for equipment, that's better than what we're seeing coming off at those trade-up programs. So that's one aspect of it. As we get into the Vet business, as I stated, I think it was Bob who was asking the question, you get an ancillary effect if these investments that we've made in technical service and looking at changing how we do business and trying to do more business in the equipment side of that business, that part of the business carries a much higher margin than the pharmaceutical. So you're trying to change the mix of that business as well. And so those are 2 items specifically that will have a, we believe, a fairly positive impact on the margins as we go into the second half of 2013.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And I know you guys wouldn't typically comment, and may not today, on product-specific margins. But we do know -- Omnicam sounds like it's going to be one of your bigger equipment, dental equipment growth drivers here over the next few quarters. Sirona has been pretty open that, that Omnicam system, for them, is probably going to be a slightly lower gross margin percentage, similar to gross profit margin dollars, but lower gross margin percentage product relative to Bluecam. Just will that impact you guys at all? Does that have any impact, or can you guys sell that at a price and what you purchased from Sirona, do those dynamics translate differently in your P&L?","Scott P. Anderson","No, they'll be a positive for our P&L, Jeff, and I think the demand for Omnicam gives us a runway to sell the product with very little promotional expense. So sort of coupling on what Steve just said, we see that as not only a great revenue opportunity, but also a margin opportunity.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But just so I understand, Scott, then your point is Omnicam relative to a Bluecam sale, Omnicam should be a higher gross margin percentage sale?","Scott P. Anderson","It will be in the ballpark of what the Bluecam.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","Roberto Fatta","It's Robbie Fatta, in for John. I just had one more question on the Bluecam versus Omnicam. This is the first time you have a 2-product strategy in this market. How do you think the sales split between the 2 is going to work out over time? And in the near term, is there any risk that as -- the lack of product as the manufacturing process ramps up could hurt Bluecam sales?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think it's too early to tell, Rob, and I don't want to make any public predictions on what the split will be other than just to state the fact that we are extremely excited about both products. And as I talked about before, the underlying software, the 4.0 software, runs both products. And I think we'll be in a off stance, Sirona will be in a very strong position with the Omnicam potential, but also having the Bluecam be a product that we believe will be in the market for a long time.","Roberto Fatta","Got it. Are the incentives put in place for your sales people for each product, are they basically the same? Or is there more of an incentive to sell one camera over the other?","Scott P. Anderson","No, they're the same. Whatever the customer decides, there wouldn't be any additional incentive for our sales people to move product one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hamilton with RBC.","Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Wealth Management, Inc., Research Division","Scott, I'm in the area. Can I come over and help you flog Steve for a while?","Scott P. Anderson","Absolutely.","Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Wealth Management, Inc., Research Division","Good. Just one basic question off of fourth quarter guidance, you had gone into some detail on outlook and consumable equipment med, vet, et cetera. Are you changing your views at all in nuancing as we're getting into the year?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I wouldn't change our views right now because we have gone through a summer slowness the last 3 years and seen the market come back. I would say we're probably -- just because now that we have the Omnicam out and such a positive launch that probably are a little more confident in the equipment opportunity. But I wouldn't really change the underlying market observations we made in the fourth quarter.","Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Wealth Management, Inc., Research Division","One other question, from a technical standpoint, where's your focus in non-medical at this stage?","Scott P. Anderson","Our focus continues to be to drive our North American strategy as the true leader in one-stop shop supply of rehab supplies and equipment, as well as expanding our international presence. We've got, we think, a great business down in Australia, a strong management team that's battling a very tough market in the U.K. right now, but we still see ourselves as a company that has great opportunity in the rehab space. It's a, as we've talked about before, it's a space where we also own the manufacturing and own brands. And so the vertical integration opportunities to not only drive market share but protect and drive margin are exciting to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charley Jones with Barrington Research.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","I had a follow-up on consumable, dental consumable. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail about what you thought impacted the quarter and was curious of a few things potentially are impacting that business line, whether it's the economic environment kind of making the CEREC sales a little bit longer, or more interested if competitors are more aggressive on promotions or price. And I guess finally, I'm curious whether or not you have any gaps in your product portfolio or if you've seen any competitive products that have caused that. And then finally, just what are your plans, sounds like some marketing, to be able to change the trajectory there? But are you thinking about adding reps, a little bit more there maybe?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure, Charley. I'll start with the pricing environment. It's obviously always a competitive market, but we do not see any irrational activity in the market. And as I said in the prior question, we really do see the market as stable when you look at products that are tied to patient visits. We see more of the softness short term and more of the elective procedures and feel those will come back as pent-up demand. I don't feel we have any gaps in our product line. Our main focus is on the independent general dentist at this time. And in terms of execution, we're always looking to add to our sales force. Our sales force headcount right now is about flat to where it is prior year, but we have initiatives to continue to grow that. Part of what we always work on in our branches, and we're very decentralized, is focus on all products. And sometimes, when we get into launches of exciting products like CEREC, it can move the sales force maybe a little too far in one direction or the other. So our sales management team in the field is really working with our sales people to be very holistic in their focus towards the customer.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up, are there any quarters, Steve, that we should be looking for a difficult comp or an easy comp in either Vet or Dental over the next 3 quarters? And finally, do you guys have any take on why Vet is growing so much stronger than Dental? Do you guys think it's just a different kind of competitive environment out there, or pricing, or the weather? Or are we just more willing to spend on our pets than our teeth?","Scott P. Anderson","I think part of it on the vet side is it's been an incredibly strong flea and tick season with the mild winter and then the weather that's gone on. But I also -- I think the underlying dynamics of the Dental business and the Vet business are very similar and we think have a great story as we look forward. So I don't think there's any real great change between the 2 markets.","Charley R. Jones - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And any difficult comps here over the next 3 quarters in either of these businesses?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Charley, they're all difficult.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Erin Wilson, this time with a follow-up. Just a couple questions on Veterinary. Did you see a significant shift owing to, I guess, the weather trends from the first quarter to the second quarter with regards to parasiticide utilization?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Our calendar first and second quarter, Erin, or our first...","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, yes, sorry, calendar.","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, I think that everybody was anticipating the early spring. It was obviously in our fourth quarter, first calendar quarter that things started to warm up. And there were already predictions, I think, that were causing the vets to stock up. Second quarter was strong. I would anticipate that you're going to see some mitigation of that as we get into now, the third calendar quarter or our second quarter, as the leaves start to fall and the temperature starts to drop. But, no, there was a fair -- I think actually, the second calendar quarter was the strongest from a usage perspective, but I think the revenues were actually more in the first quarter because of the stocking that was going on. Now the other thing to remember in the Vet business that we haven't talked about is you had sort of a mix change within the sourcing of some of these parasiticides too that has helped drive some of the revenue of all of the distributors, and that is that the Elanco products, which are sold on buy-sell, have probably benefited at the expense of Novartis, which has basically been shut down since, I think, last December -- November, December because of some contamination problems they had at their packaging plant. So that's basically took -- taken Sentinel, an interceptor, off of the market. So I think that -- which were sold on a commission basis, an agency commission. So that's had a positive effect on everybody's revenue lines. And that will start to mitigate as Novartis comes back online for next season.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Trifexis was a huge driver then?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Absolutely.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And also on the re-upped relationship with IDEXX, have any of the specific terms changed materially with IDEXX, or is it just a renewal and we should assume everything is status quo as far as your relationship goes with IDEXX?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Erin, I would assume status quo.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson","Like to thank everyone for taking their time, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in 90 days.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call.

Welcome to the Patterson Companies\u2019 Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Announcement Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference to [Leslie Nagel] [ph]. Please go ahead, ma'am."," ","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you, Augusta. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in Patterson Companies\u2019 fiscal 2015 Second quarter earnings conference call.","With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ann Gugino, our Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call up to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will be referencing our adjusted results for fiscal 2014, which excludes the impact of the restructuring charge for the medical divestiture. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release.","Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon, Central Time for a period of 1 week.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thank you, Leslie. Welcome, everyone, to this morning\u2019s conference call. As you saw in today\u2019s earnings release, Patterson Companies\u2019 consolidated revenues rose 10.5% in the fiscal 2015 second quarter.","Organic sales, which exclude the impact of the NVS acquisition and last fiscal year's medical restructuring, were up more than 7% over the prior year.","Earnings per diluted share totaled $0.54 and were up 12.5% from adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 in the prior year period. Patterson Companies performed well across all three business units.","Our continued focus on customer success resulted in our business model benefiting from scale and creating financial leverage. We are confident that our businesses will continue to execute successfully and sustain solid gains through the remainder of the fiscal year.","With that as a backdrop, let us take a look at our operational performance in the second quarter, starting with Dental. This business, which accounts for little more than half of our total sales, experienced growth in all categories.","Sales for Patterson Dental rose 7.5% from a year ago on a constant currency basis to $601.7 million. We gained additional share in all of our markets across North America. We were pleased to see continued positive trends in sales of dental consumable, which increased 3.1% on a constant currency basis from the prior year. Accelerated consumables stem from increased patient traffic in dentists offices and solid execution by our industry-leading sales force.","Basic equipment growth, which includes dental cares, units cabinetry and ancillary products were also very strong posting double-digit gains in the fiscal second quarter.","Notably, this marked our fourth consecutive quarter of core equipment growth. We are encouraged to see renewed activity and dental office remodeling and new construction, as this has long been an area of competitive strength for Patterson Dental.","Contributing to our success is Patterson's strong partnerships with equipment manufacturers. Sales with our long-term partner A-dec were particularly strong as dentists continue to look for the highest quality and value when investing in their practices.","While we are encouraged to see ongoing growth in our basic equipment line, let me remind you that the basic equipment category industry-wide has not yet recovered to its pre-2008 levels. This speaks to the ongoing opportunity.","Moving onto our technology products, we had a strong quarter of CEREC CAD\/CAM sales. New unit sales of the CEREC Omnicam grew very nicely, posting double-digit year-over-year gains. Patterson continues to win in competitive sales situations with Sirona's Omnicam leading the way.","We also saw increased interest in customers moving to the Omnicam from their CEREC Bluecam systems. This interest further validates the benefits and functionality of the 4.3 CEREC software improvements that I referenced on our last call.","Our confidence in Sirona as a partner and industry leader in innovation could not be stronger. We see the advent of competitive products as further validation that chairside CAD\/CAM will be the long-term standard-of-care technology in the dental office.","We at Patterson look forward to be in a major catalyst for this [indiscernible] being positive change for our customers. Our industry-leading sales, training and technical support infrastructure, gives customers confidence that we are committed to their ultimate success when they make this investment in their practice for their patients.","Again this quarter we saw nice sales gains with our Schick digital intraoral products as customers continue to seek the benefits that digital x-ray brings to their practice. The growth prospects for our technology offerings combined with the fact that there is considerable opportunity for dentists to invest in their practices position us well going forward.","In the quarter, we also entered into two new strategic partnerships in the dental space. First, while not immediately material for sales level and earnings is our partnership with Straumann, a world leader in tooth replacement solutions, Straumann\u2019s implant systems are among the best in the world in terms of innovative design, precision and quality.","This partnership allows us to further assist the increase in standard of patient care for dental implants in the general dental practice in a very methodical and thoughtful way. The Straumann One system, which used with the latest cone-beam technologies, enables our customers to provide a comprehensive digital implant workflow to maximize quality, efficiency and safety for their patients.","We see the long-term success of this program as additive to the specialist market, where Straumann has a successful direct sales model. We have a very structured training protocol over for both, our salespeople and our customers as this program rolls out nationwide over the balance of our fiscal year. We are excited to work with Straumann to provided education support and a superior product to benefit dentists and our patients.","Second, in late October, we announced a partnership with Quality Systems Inc or QSIDental, which offers powerful and flexible software solutions that allow larger and more complex dental practices to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. We are excited by the potential of this partnership to incremental revenue and further penetrate the large dental practice market.","Moving next to Patterson Veterinary, which comprises just over one-third of total sales, second quarter sales for this unit increased over 22% from the prior year period to $376.5 million. The business performed well both, in the United States and the United Kingdom in the fiscal second quarter.","In the U.S., sales rose 6.4% to $202.5 million. The U.S. experienced an increasing in consumable sales, medications and supplies of 7.4%. Sales of equipment were down from prior year levels to $8.2 million. We continue to see equipment and technology as a growth opportunity and differentiator as we execute against our strategy to be a national provider of veterinary equipment and service.","Earlier last month, we announced a new strategic partnership with Abaxis, a leading manufacturer of point-of-care blood, instrumentation and consumables to the medical, research and veterinary markets.","Patterson will sell the full line of Abaxis' veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. We are excited by the access our veterinarians will now have to the Abaxis' state-of-the-art diagnostic technology as we work towards our core mission of providing quality veterinary care to our customers and peace of mind for their pet owners.","Turning to NVS, we had another quarter of strong contributions from a U.K.-based veterinary business as the unit executed well during the period and captured additional market share in region. NVS has been a great addition to Patterson Companies, and we remain pleased with the integration process and the talented group of personnel that we have in place there.","As we stated, our go-forward strategy for the veterinary businesses to focus on increasing the diversification of both, our equipment and technical service offerings in order to take advantage of favorable marketplace dynamics as pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in veterinary care for their pets continues to grow. We believe that Patterson brings unique capabilities to the veterinary market both, in terms of our technical service and support and what we feel is the premier sales force in the industry.","Moving now to Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit, which now represents approximately 11% of total company revenues. We were encouraged to see sales growth for this unit's ongoing operations in the fiscal second quarter reversing the trends of the past several quarters.","Sales in the fiscal second quarter were up nearly 2% from prior levels after accounting for the planned divestitures of non-core product line that began in the fiscal first quarter of 2014. With the divestitures now behind us, we have aligned our business around those areas that have a high strategic value.","Our renewed focus and strategic execution is having the desired effect on the segment and the unit is poised to capture additional share as the underlying market conditions continue to stabilize.","Our team has done a great job of managing and streamlining this business in the past year. They are now focused on organic growth and taking advantage of the competitive position we hold as the global market leader in physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress of Patterson Medical and know there is much opportunity ahead for this business.","Next, I would like to cover our corporate wide information technology initiative. As stated previously, we have undertaken this effort in order to support the company's future growth, further enhance the customer experience and secure productivity gains going forward.","We see this as a multi-year effort to overhaul our primary systems and review all of our internal business processes. The project thus far is on schedule and in scope. As we outlined in our Investor Day presentations last month, we are taking a phased approach to this project. We have completed blueprinting stage of our IT investment. Now, we are in the building and realization phase. We will update you in the coming quarters as we begin piloting and stabilization before heading into the final stages of implementation and deployment.","Our information technology investments are critical to improve scale in our business platform and we believe you saw that play out in our improved second quarter performance. Our customers will continue to benefit from improvements and we will enhance the customer experience and shareholder returns as we further execute on the strategy.","On a final note, in today's press release, we reaffirmed our EPS guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share for fiscal 2015. We remain focused on execution. First, on capitalize on growth opportunities available through the investments we are making. Second, through our strategies to further enhance our product and service offerings. In summary, we are well positioned as we enter the second half of the fiscal year when we experience our heaver sales volumes.","Before I turn the call over to review our financial results, I would like to take a moment to welcome Ann Gugino to her first earnings conference call as Patterson's Chief Financial Officer.","Ann has been a key leader in both, financial, management and strategic planning for Patterson for more than a decade. Many of you have already had the opportunity to interact with her, no doubt, recognize her deep understanding of Patterson's operations and her superior business financial acumen.","We look forward to visiting those of you who have not had a chance to meeting up with Ann and I would like to take this opportunity to again thank Steve Armstrong who helped facilitate a seamless transition of our finance function.","With that, I will ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Scott. Before I begin the financial review, I would also like to thank Steve for creating a smooth transition and for his guidance and support over the years. I also want to thank all of you, who have welcomed me into this position and I look forward to working with you in the future. With that, let me review our financial results.","Please note that this quarter is the last quarter that the NVS acquisition will have any impact on the year-over-year comparison. Additionally, the NVS acquisition had only a three-week effect on the fiscal second quarter comparison. It impacted year-over-year diluted EPS by less than $0.01 in the quarter.","To demonstrate and focus on the underlying performance of our core business, all of my comments this morning will exclude the impact of last year's NVS acquisition as well as the medical divestiture.","First, I want to highlight that this quarter's results driven by accelerated growth demonstrate the scale and leverage enabled by our business model. Further, our results showed the benefits of the continued investments we are making to create efficiencies across our organization. These points are supported by our improved operating margins in all three business segments.","Gross margins was 31.8%, down 40-basis point from the fiscal 2014 second quarter, which reflects the higher percentage of equipment sales in the dental business and a higher sales contribution from our veterinary business.","On a consolidated basis, the operating expense ratio in the fiscal second quarter improved approximately 70-basis points from prior year level. In summary, this means our consolidated operating margin for the fiscal 2015 second quarter was 9.3%, up 30-basis points from the prior year period. Again, as a reminder, these numbers exclude the impact from the NVS acquisition and our medical business prior year divestitures.","The improvement in margins was seen in all three of our businesses and by segment our adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 9.8% for dental, 4.9% for veterinary and 14.3% for medical.","Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015. This will be in line with our annual tax rate for 2014 after excluding the unfavorable impact of the restructuring cost.","Not including NVS, our DSO held steady at 44 days in the second quarter, while inventory turns were 6.4, compared to 6.5 last fiscal year. Also, please keep in mind a couple of additional items on the balance sheet. A reduction in the accounts receivable categories generally reflects seasonal variances. Also, inventory increases since year end are due primarily to a higher buildup of equipment inventory as we enter our largest equipment sales quarter.","In the second quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled $29.6 million, compared to $72 million in the year ago period. The primary difference between the first fiscal and second quarter was the impact of the timing of tax payments and cash disbursements on accounts payable.","On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $98 million, up from $93 million for the first half of the fiscal 2014. We also continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders.","During the quarter, we returned $20.2 million to our shareholders and dividends, bringing the year-to-date total to $40.2 million. This demonstrates our confidence in Patterson's continued ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 90,000 shares of our common stock with a value of $3.6 million, leaving approximately 21 million shares available under our current authorization.","Our CapEx in the fourth quarter totaled $13.5 million and included payments for normal replacements, as well as the ERP project.","For the full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $45 million to $55 million. Over half of this amount is directly related to the ERP investments.","Finally, as Scott reviewed earlier in the call, we are maintaining our fiscal 2015 outlook for earnings per diluted share. At this, point, we are maintaining guidance as we enter the back half of the year which typically includes heavier sales volumes.","While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I want to take this opportunity to remind you about a couple of items to keep in mind for our fiscal third and fourth quarter year-over-year comparisons.","Several of the expense reduction initiatives we took last year, in fiscal 2014, more heavily impacted the latter half of the year. Specifically, we adjusted the ESOP expense estimate in the third quarter. Also, please keep in mind that we took a non-recurring severance charge in the fourth quarter.","With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some closing comments. Scott?","Scott Anderson","As we progress through fiscal 2015, we believe with our focus on customer success that we can continue to capture market share, drive profitability and create long-term shareholder value. Our strategic partnerships continue to grow and strengthen across all of our businesses, and supported by Patterson's unparalleled service and support platform, we continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers and maintain a leadership position in our markets.","We entered the year with the conservative view of our markets due to the relatively soft performances in the global economies. To recap the base assumptions we used to build our earnings outlook range are stable North American and international markets, with conditions similar to fiscal 2014. No impact from additional share repurchases that may incur during the year, a long-term extension of $250 million of debt that is due in March, no material acquisitions during the year and no material impact from the distribution change announced by IDEXX Laboratories.","While we are seeing stability in certain areas, we continue to take a guarded approach to the economic outlook. That said, we are confident in our ability to execute in any economic environment. With a focus and efficient organization, we believe, we have positioned Patterson for the future and we continue to be bullish on the long-term prospects for our customers and our company.","Now, we would like to take questions. I will turn the call over to Augusta.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Bob Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Bob Jones","Can you hear me okay?","Scott Anderson","Yes.","Bob Jones","Great. Thanks for the question. Scott, I guess the one thing that jumped out obviously on the dental side would be equipment growth in the quarter. I believe last quarter you talked about cycling a strong trade up program. Just curious if you could maybe give a little bit more on what drove the equipment growth in the quarter relative to trade up, so you are seeing better traction. Anything more specific you can give us just within that nice gross number would be helpful.","Scott Anderson","Sure, Bob. I will break it into two parts. First CEREC in technology and then core, you know, it is just a strong quarter across the board in CEREC really driven by new units and we talked about that in the last quarter that our focus would be on new units, but we did also see some trade-up activity, which really speaks, I think, to what a nice job Sirona has done with the latest software update and now there is, I would say, a high level of interest amongst loyal Bluecam users about moving into the new technology, but really the CEREC number was driven by new users, which is great to see and we take a long-term view on CEREC and CAD\/CAM and really believe that chairside CAD\/CAM will be the heart of the dental practice in the future, so we are very encouraged obviously by the CEREC performance.","The core equipment business, you know, this is fourth consecutive quarter where are seeing growth. I think we are encouraged by the fact that we are starting to see some life in the dental furniture and cabinetry business, which speaks to office remodels and the beginning of some new construction.","I think, if I go back to my comments a quarter ago, we still are sort of cautious to call it a turnaround, but I will tell you all signs point to increased activity out in the field. When you look at our consumable numbers, I think it is beginning to firm up in the dental market that there is a bit of higher utilization and that will speak, I think, well long-term to dentists confidence and them investing in their practices.","Bob Jones","Well, I guess, that actually my follow-up, Scott, would just be around the consumable you know, 3.1% growth, up nicely from 2.5% last year. Your peers had all kind of started to report some improvement, sequentially. I guess, what more would you need to see to kind of feel more confident in maybe addressing or changing some of those market assumptions that you highlighted are behind the guidance for this year?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I think, we really need to get through the third quarter, which is the largest volume quarter of the year. As we have talked about many times, we have a good sense of where we sit going into the quarter, but at the same time a lot of our customers will sit down with their financial advisors right around this time and make decisions, so the decision window is always shorter in the calendar November-December time period, so I would say we feel very comfortable and are very pleased with the performance of the business through the first six months that probably need to get through this important calendar year end selling season to make maybe a more bullish call going forward, so we are just - I would say, we are being prudently cautious.","Bob Jones","Fair enough. Thanks for the questions.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo","Yes. Scott, maybe if I can just follow up on Bob\u2019s second question, I am kind of kind of curious about your assessment of the overall market growth, because if I listen to your commentary, it seem to suggest that that better consumable numbers really you guys kind of gaining share, but when I look at your obvious closest competitor, they put up a pretty big number too suggesting that they are gaining share, but I think some of the other dental players all were making the operating under the assumption that they saw some improving strength in the underlying market, so maybe if I could just get your take on where you think the underlying market growth is and how you think about that versus your comment that you are gaining share within the dental segment?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Great question, Glen, I think it is clear if you look at the major consumable company results that we\u2019re growing faster than the market and taking share, I think, you have to be careful, I think, comparing us to our largest competitor.","I would tell you that they are probably growing in some areas where we don't compete head-to-head in terms of some specialist markets where they own manufacturing and compete against many of their partners, as well as the larger DSO space, where they have a large share, I think we are very confident when we look at market data across all of our manufacturers that where we compete head-to-head with multiple people, we are more than holding our own and gaining share.","I think, when you look at the consumable business, we have seen nice sequential steady growth going back to mid-summer. It has been very consistent across geography and I would say the areas of strength, which are, I think, good for the entire industry - our product side of restorative dentistry, so composites and [pricing] [Ph] material, adhesive materials, so really bread-and-butter dentistry, but I think this is the good sign that our customers are seeing increased patient flow in their clinical operatories. Obviously, on the equipment side, I think the numbers speak for themselves.","Glen Santangelo","Scott, maybe if I just ask one follow-up, now with almost a year under your belt for NVS, maybe could you give us some of your take on maybe what some of the surprises were both positive and negative and I am kind of curious, at this point do you feel that the organization is ready to maybe take on another integration challenge, so are you comfortable at this point maybe taking on another opportunity should it come along and where might you be looking at this time?","Scott Anderson","I would say that there are very few negatives around NVS and the positives really have been around the people and their execution and the ability for us to take ideas both from our U.S. dental business and the U.K. dental business and leverage them across both sides of the pond.","We have got a great group of people at NVS, so you definitely they outperformed our expectations in the first year and are very focused going forward.","I would say in terms of next potential steps, we continue to follow our strategic plan. One of those strategic intents is to take a broader view of the markets we play in and part of that was geographic expansion, but we are also very disciplined and patient and we will look for the right opportunities, but could not be more pleased with the first year results from NVS and where they are headed going forward.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Glen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first on the vet business, just wondering if you could provide an update how Abaxis sales are going. Why you chose to do an exclusive with them versus opening up to some other diagnostic manufacturers. Then, also, how much of kind of the lost revenues from IDEXX do you expect to make up with this new relationship?","Scott Anderson","I think, it's too early to give hard data, Kevin, but I would speak to the relationship with Abaxis. It is one of, I would say, Patterson's core tenets that we take partnering with manufacturers very seriously and we really feel comfortable with both the people at Abaxis and the product they have and really want to focus our organization to make sure we are successful and live up to our end of the bargain with Abaxis out of the gate, so it became a pretty easy business decision and very consistent with how we partner with manufacturers to go exclusive at the beginning with Abaxis. I think, we will obviously be able to give you more color probably in the third and fourth quarters as things progress and business migrates back and forth.","Kevin Ellich","Okay. That's fair. Then just turning to margins, we had seen a nice improvement here on medical side. You guys have done a good job with the restructuring that's going on there. I guess, long-term, where do you think those medical margins can go. On top of that, with that margins kind of depressed - just wondering how long it will take to get back to kind of the mid to upper single digits on the vet side if you think you can get back there?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I will start maybe Ann can get some additional color. Really nice progress on medical businesses in the quarter, I would say that margin improvement of, I believe, those 110 basis points in the quarter is probably not sustainable into the third and fourth quarter, because it is bit against a bit of a tougher comparison, but the business is positioned very well and they are focused on growing the business organically and doing it in the right way, so we are confident over time with both, stronger focus and execution and also some stabilization of the market, that they continue to drive margins.","I would say on the vet business, when they made some nice progress in the quarter as well, it really is revenue and scale story and I have Ann get some additional color.","Ann Gugino","Yes. I would just say longer term, Kevin, I think the right ballpark for the medical margins is back to that kind of mid-teens, which is where you are kind of seeing them land year-to-date.","As far as vet business, it will take some time to get it back to north of 5% just because NVS is pretty significant in terms of total revenue contribution, but we are in the process, as Scott mentioned, of brining those value added services across the pond [ph], so it have higher margins, so I think, you will see a slow and steady increase in margin expansion in vet.","Kevin Ellich","Got it. That is helpful. Thanks so much.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Kevin.","We will go next to Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette","","Thanks. Just curious, for the vet space, we obviously have seen some other distributors talk about some larger than average lumpiness in their vendor rebates for the back half '14 versus the back account '13. Just curious if you guys are seeing anything in your book that is worth calling out in relation to that or do you expect maybe some smoother results quarter-by-quarter. Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Yes. Steve, this is Ann. I would tell you that we have seen some lumpiness just in the first and second quarter and some shifting back and forth, just because we have some shifting of products within the buy-sell category between manufacturers as new products have come in and out of the market are into the market and are cannibalizing other vendors, but what I would tell you in the back half of the year, I don't think we have anything significant to call out as it relates to rebates.","Steven Valiquette","","Sorry. Okay. Just one other quick one that I had was just to sort of confirm the vet equipment growth in the quarter, obviously we are -11%, 12%, somewhere near, so was there some impact already on the negative side from the IDEXX situation in terms of either destocking which is deemphasizing some products versus others or was this too early for that to be impacting the numbers, just wanted a confirmation of how much that might have impacted this particular quarter?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Good question. I think there definitely was some channel disruption with the business model change by IDEXX. I would say one of the positives on the equipment side even though revenues were down slightly was gross margins improved.","In terms of driving value and brining technology to the customer and also having us be a part of the value chain, that was probably the positive development, but the full expectation of our dental team is that they will show equipment growth in the back half of the year.","Steven Valiquette","","Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","We will go next to Bob Willoughby of Bank of America.","Bob Willoughby","Thanks. I think, Scott, you mentioned your cash is building here, but you are going to term out to $250 million debt. I guess that suggests maybe some other uses of cash are coming. Is it realistic to assume you can get a decent size acquisition done by the end of the fiscal year?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I wouldn't speak to the timing. I would say we continue to evaluate a lot of M&A opportunities inside our core businesses and we feel we are in a strong position to really execute on our capital allocation strategy, which I will let Ann review just to make sure everyone is very clear on it, but I would really like the position we have right now in terms of driving shareholder value and opportunity for the business.","I will turn it over Ann.","Ann Gugino","Yes. Thanks, Scott. Just as a reminder, our first priority is always to reinvest in the business and of course that would include making acquisitions. Our second priority is to sustain and growth the dividend. If we can deploy the cash meaningfully in either of these priorities and the stock market gives us an opportunity to so, we could be much more active on our share repurchases going forward.","I would just say in summary, we are planning to maintain a flexible balance sheet and we continue to evaluate the market conditions and our cash needs going forward as we get closer to March when that $250 million comes due, so more to come.","Bob Willoughby","Okay. I guess, to push a little harder the share buyback wasn't so meaningful. We haven't seen the dividend bump in a while. It just sounds like that transaction opportunity is close.","Ann Gugino","Well, we can't comment on reasons why we are in and out of the market.","Bob Willoughby","Okay. There was nothing that precluded you in the latest period from buying back stock correct?","Scott Anderson","Bob, we don't comment on those things, Bob. I would tell you that we are in a strong strategic position. In term of strategy, with Ann and I now working together, one of the things we are going with the board is taking a fresh look at our strategy in terms of capital allocation and finance strategy as well as it turns as obviously our operational strategy.","Bob Willoughby","Okay. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. I was wondering, obviously with the strong in the quarter doing better than the street, was the quarter roughly in line with your expectations and I am just curious as to why not narrow or raise the guidance at this point?","Scott Anderson","Yes, Lisa. The quarter was stronger than our internal expectations. It was just strong execution across the board, but I go back to sort of the cautionary statement as we are halfway through the year, our heavier sales volume are in the second and we really want get through the third quarter before we would make that type of decision.","Lisa Gill","Is there something, Scott, that outside of what you call that today that concerns you going into the third quarter?","Scott Anderson","No. I would say I am optimistic about the third quarter, but at the same time we know probably more than anyone since we sell over 50% of capital equipment in the North American market that the calendar year end period, the November-December can be lumpy with both, upside and downside surprises and I would not read anything into it more than us just taking a very cautious outlook as we get into the next 90 days. As I said, we are very pleased with where we are positioned six months through the year.","Lisa Gill","Than my second question would be around that - I mean, honestly we talked a little bit about consumables being very strong today, but if I look at NVS, specifically, it looks like it was up double digits on a comparable basis. One, is that correct? Two, can you maybe just give us a little more color as to what is driving that?","Ann Gugino","Lisa, this is Ann. That was not up double digits on a comparable basis. I think what you are looking at is a full quarter of results last year versus we had three weeks of incremental impact this year, so I would characterize the growth in NVS as being similar to what you saw in the U.S.","Lisa Gill","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","\u2026organic growth. Yes.","Ann Gugino","Yes.","Lisa Gill","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","We will go next to Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just few clean up questions here on my part, I guess. Scott, I wondered if you can maybe address gating throughout the quarter as you exited kind of September into October and so far in November anything changing dramatically one direction or the other on trend line.","Then just on some of your equipment comments are you kind of wanting to get through the third quarter. I guess, anything you would highlight with Section 179 and 168 coming down quite a bit. Is that is that a reason for a little caution or just kind of want to see how third quarter plays out or do you think that will have any impact?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Good questions. First in terms of gating, I think, I mentioned before we are encouraged by really sort of sequential strength in the business around the consumable side, so we continue to see that momentum. The Section 179, as many of you know Section 179, every year has to be renewed and it is stuck in the lame-duck session of Congress right now.","I have been in correspondence with some of our local Congress people and the houses past or has put forward resolution to make step ups to 500,000 permanent, so they don't have to be renewed every year.","I would say, we believe strongly that Congress will act in favor of small business owners as this is as many of know it is not just dentists, it is farmers, it is all small business owners that are making capital decisions right now, so it is a little bit frustrating that our government has sort of kept some uncertainty in the minds of small business owners, so I believe it will all be taken care of here in the next week, but it does I guess give us a little bit of caution that they haven't renewed that to $500,000 yet. I believe it will happen, but unfortunately, we were dealing with a bit of a dysfunctional outlook [ph] right now.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. Understood on that point for sure, but from a gating standpoint I guess just to clarify, Scott, would you say kind of that you are happy with the sequential improvement? Do you feel like throughout the fiscal second-quarter you were seeing sequential improvements as well or you are just talking kind of your second quarter improvement versus first quarter versus last year's fourth?","Scott Anderson","I think, we have seen it throughout the year, Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. Fair enough. Then, Ann, I think several times at our conference at the Analyst Day, you have kind of - physician guidance was having may be more of a conservative bias this year than in years past having more upside potential than downside risk in that. Is we are all trying to feel out how conservative guidance is here. Would you still kind of reiterate those words? Do you still feel comfortable with that?","Ann Gugino","Yes. That is exactly how I would characterize it Jeff, and I think that is why you are seeing us not raise it at this time. If I look at just the guidance for the back half of the year, not considering the over performance in the current quarter, absolutely if you think about where you guys are, I would characterize it is more conservative than historically how we set the ranges with more upside potential than downside risks, absolutely.","Jeff Johnson","Okay, very helpful. Thank you guys.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Cherny of Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Michael Cherny. I just wanted to ask about your guidance in terms of the puts and takes for achieving the high end versus the low end of the guidance. What do you think that the, I guess, swing factors could be?","Scott Anderson","Hey, Liz, this is Scott. I would say the biggest swing factor has come around revenue growth. It really will be the performance of the underlying consumable business and potential strength in the equipment business that would push us toward the higher end. I think we have managed the business very well, so we could anticipate and mitigate any revenue softness.","As I said before and Ann just mention on the last call, we feel very comfortable and we have a high level of accountability in the organization to not only deliver the year, but really have a strong second half and exceed the year, but we are taking a cautious tone right here since we are only six months through the year.","Elizabeth Anderson","Sure. That makes sense. If I could just get one more question in, in terms of the CAD\/CAM market, you obviously mentioned the strong sales in the quarter, but I was just wondering has there been any change in sort of the competitive level or pricing in the CAD\/CAM market or would you say that has been fairly consistent growth quarter-to-quarter for this year?","Scott Anderson","I think the basic competitive landscape in terms of pricing and I believe I mentioned it in the last quarter as well. Dentistry is a relatively small market and I think the technologies are priced appropriately to ensure that there are viable sustainable businesses long-term, so not only can you sell this technology, but you can support service and spare parts and really make sure the customer has a viable product 5, 10 years down the road.","You always see competitive promotional pricing and we will participate in as well, but I think it is a very stable pricing environment. At the end of the day, there is no product that we sell that has a higher return on investment and a bigger impact on the practice than chairside CAD\/CAM.","Elizabeth Anderson","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Scott Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger","Hey, Scott. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about your views of the implant opportunity given your Straumann partnership that you announced? What do you guys perceive as the underlying growth rate at this point and the implant market? If you have a sense about how penetrated that technology is and how much of the volume is flowing through the GP offices at this point?","Scott Anderson","John, we have talked about this in the past. We see that the implant market is being very well served right now in the specialist neurosurgeon [ph] carried on us by the current players and we didn't think strategically for us to private label or buy second-tier brand was a good strategic move for Patterson.","We knew that over time as technologies improves, there would be a market for general dentists to place simple implants and that market will grow just with the aging population. Once that happens, our distribution model makes a lot of sense to a manufacturer when you are dealing with more than just 8,000 customers that now potentially 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, 80,000 customers over time.","It is very early in the game, but I would say it is analogous to what you see in the endodontic market, where general dentist will do simple endodontic procedures that, but overwhelmingly will refer out most of their cases to the endodontic. We see that as being responsible partner with Straumann to make sure that if general dentists are placing simple implants that they are done correctly and that it becomes really as I said in my comments additive to the specialist market over time. To me, I look at this as not material financially in short-term, but potentially very material strategically to Patterson position in the marketplace long-term.","John Kreger","Great. Thank you. That is helpful. Then a question on CEREC, are you seeing any momentum at all in the scanner-only sales or are they pretty much all for chairside systems? I think you said at Analyst Day that you have about an installed base of about 15,000. Can you give us a sense about how much of that this point is Blue versus Omnicam?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Number one is, the majority of sales still continue to be chairside CAD\/CAM. I think, when dentists really take a hard look at the technology and then understand the return and really the patient benefits it is interesting people will start looking at digital impressioning, but almost always will end up at the chairside.","We are now almost up to 16,000 users in North America with CEREC and we don't for competitive reasons give the specific breakout of Blue and Omni. As I said in my previous comments, the latest software update that happened this summer really has been a positive boost for dentists with Bluecam systems looking at Omni going forward and our new users sales are predominantly Omni.","John Kreger","That is great. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, John.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Jon Block of Stifel Nicolaus.","Jon Block","Great, thanks guys. Good morning. I am probably going to ask just a couple of questions, just in a different manner, in different way. Just on CEREC, if you can talk to mix, in other words this was your second straight quarter where I think you talked about double-digit growth in new users. Would that equate into sort of double-digit new user revenue growth or you have had sort of CAD\/CAM for everyone out there now for some time. Is there an increasing percentage of people coming on at the lower end ASP options?","Scott Anderson","Jon, it is revenue growth and I would say the majority of new users the high majority are at the higher end, so we feel like we have a great portfolio of products to bring to the customer with a lot of options on when they can come in price point-wise and functionality-wise, but the majority of customers are opting for the latest technology, and because they really understand the return on investment and I think they also have great peace of mind when they partner with Patterson, because of our commitment to their success and the satisfaction we guarantee our customers when they move into this technology.","Jon Block","Okay. Great. Then I just shift over to the Straumann deal, I know laid that out sort of that deal with Straumann being additive for the overall market, but I am guessing there was going to be situations where the implant at the GP was sort of going to be displacing, what would have been a referral to the specialist and two of your biggest consumable partners have what I call formidable premium implant businesses. In the past, you have always stayed away from sort of stepping on their toes, so can you talk to your thoughts and how you successfully balance that and also could we see Patterson find other innovative ways to make a bigger splash in the specialist market? Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Yes. I think, Patterson will be a key partner for multiple manufacturers in different areas going forward. We have a great history of helping build markets and focusing on launching new products. It is one of our core strategies that we don't see buying manufacturers and competing against our partners as really the way we go to market, so my predecessor Jim Wiltz had a great line if we are going to get into the cold war we are going buy the light [ph] and I think that speaks to the fact that there we are patiently here and available that partner drive business with our great manufacturers and there are many of our manufacturers that sell direct into the specialist markets, but if there was ever a time where we get out and expand our business, I think Saint Paul will be the first place they come to...","Jon Block","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Well go next to Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich","Hey, Scott, just wanted to go back to your comments on the strategic partnerships, with QSIDental, you mentioned incremental revenue opportunity, just wondering if you could size that for us. Then Straumann, did you say they previously had a direct sales model or that they currently do?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I will take the Straumann one first. Straumann has and will continue to sell direct to the specialist market and they serve that market very well. They have partnered with us in the GP market on a product called Straumann One, and it will be a very methodical role out as we help general dentists learn how to place simple implants, but when you look at just pure demographics, the specialist market is going to have, I think, really strong demand for their services for the next 20 years just with an aging population.","Kevin, what was the second piece of your question again?","Kevin Ellich","With Quality Systems, I guess.","Scott Anderson","QSI, yes.","Kevin Ellich","\u2026that opportunity is?","Scott Anderson","Right, that gives us the ability to have a referral relationship with the leading software product in the large group practice space on the dental office, so the revenue opportunities we would have would be from gaining more shares inside of those customers. At this point, we wouldn't quantify that, but I just once again it is short-term, not material to sales, but long-term strategic to how we are going out that the right way.","Kevin Ellich","Got it. I guess, it would be tough to find [Chad] for light at this point in time, so thanks.","Operator","We have no other questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn it back to Scott Anderson for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Augusta. Thank you for joining us today. During the fiscal second quarter, we made progress on our strategic initiatives to offer best-in-class product innovation and services in order to fuel our customers customers' growth.","As a result, we were able to strengthen our market leadership position. We are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities that lie ahead as we continue to enhance our products and services.","I would like to personally thank the great employees of Patterson Companies for their hard work through the first half of our fiscal year, and know that we are all committed to helping our customers grow and continuing to capitalize on the momentum we see in all of our businesses.","We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the Greater New York Dental show and updating you in February on our fiscal third quarter results.","On behalf of Ann and myself, Happy Thanksgiving to all, thanks for being on the call.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. Have a great day."],"16819":["Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) Q2 2014 Earnings Call November 21, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ann B.

Incorporated, Research Division","Roberto Fatta","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Patterson Companies' Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Announcement. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 21, 2013, at 9 a.m. Central Time.","I'll now turn the conference over to Ms. Ann Gugino, Vice President, Strategy and Planning. Please go ahead.","Ann B. Gugino","Thank you, Ron. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies' Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in the room today are Scott Anderson, our Chief -- our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Armstrong, our Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to review this material.","The reported results for the second quarter of 2014 are significantly impacted by the acquisition of National Veterinary Services or NVS in the U.K., and by the previously announced decision to restructure the Patterson Medical unit.","Please note that, in this morning's conference call, we will be referencing adjusted results for the quarter, which excludes only the costs associated with the restructuring activity within Patterson Medical. Also, because the NVS acquisition had a fairly dramatic impact on our various operating ratio -- ratios due to its margin and cost structure, in our press release, we provided a reconciliation for the ratios that adjusts for the NVS acquisition and the restructuring costs at Patterson Medical. We believe that this provides a better comparison against the historical results of the business and a fourth perspective on the go-forward results of the company.","Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we've provided financial guidance for fiscal 2014 in our press release earlier this morning, as well as in the financial slide presentation that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting at 11 a.m. Central Time for a period of one week.","And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thank you, Ann, and welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call.","As you saw in today's earnings release, Patterson Companies reported a solid second quarter with double-digit sales growth and increased adjusted earnings compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated sales reached nearly $1 billion in the quarter at $998.8 million, and earnings were $48.7 million or $0.48 per share.","We are pleased with the progress we have made in many aspects of our business. For example, our NVS acquisition performed quite well and is positioning us to grow in the international veterinary market. Sales of veterinary equipment were robust during the quarter, with double-digit year-over-year growth in that category. Sales in our dental segment increased year-over-year but not as much as we had anticipated. We are focused on building stronger momentum in that unit.","Let's take a deeper look at our operational performance in the second quarter, starting with dental. The business, which accounts for a little more than 1\/2 of our total sales, reported fiscal 2014 second quarter sales of $563.1 million, which was nearly 3 -- which was a nearly 3% increase versus the year prior period on a constant currency basis. We saw second quarter dental equipment and software sales rise nearly 5% from the earlier -- year-earlier level.","Patterson Dental excels at providing customers with industry-leading technology wrapped by a suite of value-added services. Our approach helped generate higher 2014 second quarter results in our dental business. Overall, demand for the CEREC technology remained strong. Also contributing to revenues in the dental segment was a 2.3% rise against, again, on a constant currency basis in sales of consumable dental supplies versus a year ago. While dental consumable sales were up year-over-year, consumable growth remained sluggish, as we have not seen any substantial improvement in the underlying macroeconomic factors that drive those sales, such as the unemployment rate. On a macro level, since the economic downturn, dentists have remained cautious about expanding and upgrading their basic practice infrastructure, which includes chairs, units and cabinetry.","We continue to believe that there is considerable pent-up demand for these investments in their businesses. This factor, plus the growth opportunities from our technology offerings, position us well as dentistry migrates to a digital platform. And as the dental market, post recession, returns to historical growth levels, we expect to benefit and gain market share.","Let's turn to Patterson Veterinary, which is responsible for nearly 1\/3 of our total sales. Second quarter fiscal 2014 sales for this unit rose 67% to $308.1 million. As the press release notes, the NVS acquisition contributed nearly $118 million to this segment. We are excited about NVS because of its market position, and it offers us exceptional platform to expand Patterson's strategies into new geographic markets. We are very pleased not only with the performance of NVS to date, but also with the talented team of managers and employees there. Notably, the contribution from NVS was only for a partial quarter following the acquisition close in mid-August. We fully expect the investment in NVS to enhance shareholder value in the long term, validated by being immediately accretive to our fiscal 2014 full year earnings by $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share.","Looking at our U.S. veterinary business. Our second quarter sales gains stemmed from a nearly 2% increase in consumable sales, such as medications and supplies. The year-over-year growth in this category continues to be constrained due to last year's unusually severe tick and heartworm season. We had a 31% increased growth in the equipment and software category.","We believe that the solid performance across all of our veterinary equipment lines indicates that our strategy to enhance our infrastructure and become a national and international technical service provider is working. Our priority remains to increase both our equipment and technical service offerings so we can take advantage of the favorable marketplace dynamics as consumers seek better clinical outcomes for their pets in order to demonstrate our commitment to delivering value-added services to our customers and enhancing their experience with the Patterson Veterinary team.","We have added our -- we have expanded our team of sales representatives and service technicians. The number of reps has grown from 234 at the end of fiscal 2013 to 255 in the first quarter, to 270 at the end of the second quarter. While many of these new sales people are focused on building the equipment and technology platform, we did add approximately 10 new territory managers late in the quarter and would expect sales contributions from these professionals as they continue to ramp up through the year. We see significant opportunities to grow Patterson Veterinary. And particularly, we believe fiscal 2014 is a growth year on the equipment side of this unit.","Turning to our medical business, which represents approximately 13% of total company sales. Sales for Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, declined nearly 5% to $127.7 million. Sales were essentially in line with our expectation for the period, after adjusting for the reduced revenue associated with the divestiture of certain non-core medical business assets in the quarter. By divesting non-core product lines, we can lower the operating expense levels of our European medical distribution operations and concentrate on more strategic business for Patterson. We believe that these actions will benefit our growth in those markets over the long term.","Beyond the divestitures, this market continues to be affected by the continual uncertainties surrounding this nation's health care system, and in international markets from the ongoing austerity measures that have dampened demand for the past few years. Although these factors are likely to persist in the short term, we are encouraged by our new medical leadership team's renewed focus and vision. Moreover, this business has very favorable demographic -- demographics, and we expect to capture future growth opportunities in the rehabilitation market.","Patterson Medical has attractive operating margins as well as industry-leading product and service offerings.","Next I'd like to update you on our information technology initiative. As previously stated, we've undertaken this effort in order to support the company's future growth, further enhance the customer experience and secure future productivity gains. Patterson's incremental information technology investment over the next 5 years is estimated at $55 million to $65 million. While approximately 1\/2 of this amount will be capitalized or amortized, we continue to anticipate expensing an incremental $10 million on this key effort in fiscal 2014. The financial impact in this year's second quarter from information technology investments was approximately $0.02 per diluted share.","This project has reached another major milestone, as we are in the final stages of selecting our technology providers. We intend to begin moving aggressively into the design phase over the next few quarters.","We believe our informational -- information technology investments is critical to providing Patterson with the flexibility to adjust our platform, as opportunities warrant, and create long-term shareholder value. In the meantime, our customers will continue to benefit from various improvements we will implement to our existing infrastructure. Our progress to date includes making substantial enhancements to our dental and veterinary websites to provide a best-in-class experience for our customers as they seek to fulfill their practice needs. Also, company-wide, we continue to roll out new sales tools that quickly and concisely put more market and customer information in the hands of our sales reps, to build on our already-strong customer service offering. We began the rollout to our dental business in the first fiscal quarter and expanded the rollout to our medical business in the second quarter, with vets soon to follow. In our proprietary product line, updated versions of our Eaglesoft and IntraVet practice management software for the dental and veterinary markets are in the process of being released.","Going forward, Patterson Companies continues to have strong cash generation capabilities and a flexible balance sheet so we can take advantage of opportunistic acquisitions to augment our organic growth initiatives. Acquisitions remain part of our comprehensive capital allocation strategy, which also includes strategic investments, dividend growth and share repurchases.","So before I turn the call over to Steve, let me point out that while dental revenue growth was lower than we had anticipated in the second quarter, we are pleased that our focus on company-wide cost-management initiatives helped to generate strong earnings in the period. We remain confident that as we work our way through markets that are sluggish and difficult to predict, we can provide earnings growth to our shareholders. And while we continue to emphasize strong cost controls going forward, we remain fully committed to our planned technology investments and growth initiatives for long-term success.","Now I'll ask Steve to review the financials. Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Thank you, Scott.","As Ann mentioned earlier the call, the impact of the NVS acquisition and the restructuring costs for Patterson Medical are fairly significant to our second quarter results. My comments will focus on our operating performance, generally excluding the impact of both, which will provide a better comparability to the historical results.","During this year's second quarter, more encouraging exchange rate changes had a negative effect of 40 basis points on our consolidated sales growth, which has a larger impact than we have experienced in the past several quarters.","Turning to gross margins. We saw a slight decline year-over-year of 20 basis points that is primarily attributable to our finance business. We are generally seeing lower interest rates in the market, and volatility at the longer end of the rate curve from quarter-to-quarter, which is reducing the gains recognized when we sell finance contracts.","Fiscal second quarter 2014 operating expenses included an approximate incremental $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share for our planned information technology investments. Our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 9%, up from the prior year when you exclude the impact of the planned information technology investment. By segment, our second quarter adjusted operating margins were 9.4% for dental, 4.7% for veterinary and 13.1% for medical. Note that operating margins for the dental business include the information technology investments.","Excluding IT and the NVS acquisition, we still expect to gain approximately 20 basis points of operating margin for the fiscal year. Incrementally, the veterinary segment expense structure includes the costs from the increases in sales and technical service personnel, as Scott mentioned earlier.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fiscal second quarter was 35.6%. While our overall effective rate for the second quarter is relatively high at 37.9%, this is the result of the tax treatment for certain of the costs from the Patterson Medical restructuring. We are anticipating tax rates in the mid 35s for the final 2 quarters of the fiscal year.","Not including NVS, our DSO were consistent with the prior year at 43 days for the quarter, while inventory turns were 6.5 compared to 7.0 1 year ago. The majority of our balance sheet changes result from the NVS acquisition. Inventory also rose in the second quarter due to the continued rebuilding of our CEREC inventory after last year's successful trade-up program.","In the fiscal 2014 second quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled $72 million compared to $73 million in the year ago period. Our CapEx in the second quarter mainly consisted of regular ongoing expenditures, in addition to the planned investments in information technology.","Before I turn the call back to Scott for some closing comments, I will review our guidance for fiscal 2014. Based on our expectations for the second half and the stability in the underlying markets for our businesses, we are maintaining our EPS outlook of $2.13 to $2.24 for 2014. This excludes the $0.12 per share diluted impact from the restructuring charge in the medical unit we announced last quarter, of which $0.07 was recorded in the second quarter. This is primarily noncash charges, and we expect these actions will generate annual savings of approximately $2 million or $0.01 per diluted share, beginning in fiscal 2015.","Again, our fiscal 2014 guidance is predicated on several assumptions that include stable economic conditions in our markets; modest operating margin expansion, excluding our planned information technology investments; and no impact from share repurchases that may occur during the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some closing comments. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thanks, Steve.","Entering the fiscal 2014 third quarter, we are poised to capture market share as we continue to exceed our customers' expectations. Our very strong strategic partnerships have resulted in a best-in-class product offering, and this is wrapped by Patterson's unparalleled service and support platform. As we've previously stated, the economic headwinds of the past 5 years have constrained consumer spending, as well as capital investments by our customers. We continue to be encouraged, as all of our markets are experiencing some tailwinds from favorable demographics.","Patterson is focused on efficiency and is well positioned for growth, and we are maintaining our EPS guidance for fiscal 2014. We are committed to generating long-term shareholder value through targeted investments, dividend growth and strategic share repurchases.","Now we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back over to Ron.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Nathan Rich filling in for Bob. If I could just first ask on the equipment side, I'd be interested to get your thoughts on the competitive dynamics in the marketplace right now. One of your bigger competitors recently announced a deal to distribute its CAD\/CAM to Aspen Dental. Could you just talk about what you're seeing around pricing and competition right now?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think, it's -- Nathan, thanks for the question. I think it's a very exciting time in terms of the competitive landscape. The fact that we now have the number of competitors we do, I think, leads to the validity that digital dentistry and CAD\/CAM dentistry is a part of the future. And we're excited for that competitive environment going forward. So to me, I look at the competitive landscape as a net positive because I think competition will accelerate decisioning -- decision process over time with our customers. And I think it's always important to remember that there is a lot of opportunity out there over the next decade as dentists migrate to a digital platform.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then for the second question, if I could just ask on the consumables side, growth was a little bit softer than in the first quarter. Could you just go into more detail about what you're seeing in the environment, and your expectations for kind of continued stability going forward?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. We see a stable market. Patient flow at the dental office continues to be stable, but there has been no catalyst that has been an inflection point moving it upward. We're -- feel we're still growing above market rates. So we continue to take market share against the broader market, but obviously, it was frustrating to see that market slow a bit from what it had in the first quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Scott, just wanted to start off on the dental side. It looks like growth was a little lower than you expected, based on your comments. Equipment faced a pretty easy comp. How did the 4.8% growth compare to your internal expectations? And what do you need to see in the back half of the year to hit your guidance?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, sure, Kevin. Obviously, we were expecting stronger growth in the second quarter. One of the issues we ran into, and I talked about it in the first quarter, are the strong backlog we have for Omnicam upgrades for our Bluecam customers. And one of the issues we did run into in the quarter was the process of installing Bluecams to our -- or Omnicams to our Bluecam customers. That process took longer than we had anticipated. Most of these customers are sort of our power users. And our salespeople ended up taking more time in terms of the change management process. The good news is, once we got through the training process, very high level of satisfaction. And then on the flip side, the new Omnicam users, that training process has gone incredibly well and, as well, a really high level of satisfaction. When you look at the tail half of the year, when we look at how we get to guidance, it's not just dependent on equipment growth. We have the ability, and we do every year, to adjust our business plan midstream in terms of how we attack different parts of the business. And we feel comfortable that we can execute on the expense side, as well as continue to drive the revenue side to meet our full year guidance.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. I guess 2 follow-up there, Scott. One, how did basic equipment grow this quarter? And then last quarter, I think you made a comment on the call saying you expected double-digit growth from equipment for the year, sorry to harp on equipment, but just wondering if you're still confident that you can still drive double-digit growth there?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think it's going to be tough to drive net double-digit growth for the full fiscal year from where we're at today. Our basic equipment business was down slightly the prior year. That is a business, the chair-unit-light business, that continues to sort of bounce off of a bottom of about a 20% decrease from 2009 levels. So the replacement business continues to be a tough business. And we still are working with all of our partners on initiatives to drive new programs and new ways where dentists can look at refurbing their offices and building new offices. Actual CEREC growth was very strong in the quarter. We just thought, with the backlog we had on the Omnicam, we would be able to put in more than we were able to execute on in the quarter. And between those 2 things explains the shortfall.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then just one last one on the vet side. You saw some good contributions from NVS and strong growth in the equipment business. Just wondering what drove that strong vet equipment. Was that mainly diagnostics or was there other components? And do you expect that to continue?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, good question, Kevin. It was really across-the-board. So it was strong growth across the whole portfolio of products. While the percentages are big, I still will caution everyone that the base is small. But it -- to me, very encouraging to see strong growth of -- across the whole portfolio of products we sell in the vet business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Sachin Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Scott, this is Sachin, in for Brandon. Could you elaborate what you saw on a monthly basis in the dental business throughout the quarter? Was consumables and equipment demand weaker in October, around the government shutdown?","Scott P. Anderson","There's no doubt that the government shutdown didn't do anyone any favors in terms of consumer confidence or uncertainty in the economy. I wouldn't call that out as a specific, but obviously, it didn't do anyone any favors, as I said before.","Sachin Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC, Research Division",",","Got it. Moving towards the medical segment, what were the impacts of the product line divestitures to the overall growth rate?","Scott P. Anderson","I'll turn that one over to Steve.","R. Stephen Armstrong","It was about 1\/2 of the decline for the period, so about 2.5 percentage points of impact.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Gavin Weiss, in for Lisa. You mentioned that utilization continues to be light but that you're growing above the market. Without the underlying market trend turning around, can you talk about how much opportunity you think there remains to take share from the smaller players?","Scott P. Anderson","I still think, particularly because of the breadth of our value-added portfolio we bring to bear with the customer, that we still have quite a bit of opportunity to grow our business, not only in the customers we have today, but also to find new customers through the introduction of new technologies through Eaglesoft, through CEREC, through introduction to digital x-ray with Schick. So we absolutely are very focused on continuing to grow business and not wait on the underlying markets to recover.","Gavin Weiss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the share repurchase program, it looks like there was no activity in the quarter. What is your expectation for the remainder of the year? And what, if anything, is included in the guidance?","R. Stephen Armstrong","As I stated earlier, Gavin, there's no anticipated repurchases in our guidance numbers. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is that we'll continue to be opportunistic. With the acquisition of NVS during the second quarter, we still haven't placed anything permanent with regard to that financing. And so until we've got that decision crystallized, we'll probably be fairly judicious on entering the market and buying back shares. But there will be some share activity, I'm fairly confident of that. It's just whether it would be in the third or the fourth quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to clarify, the -- as far as -- a couple of financial questions here. Just to move from the $0.41 of reported EPS at $0.48 suggests that you're only excluding the medical restructuring costs. Is that correct?","R. Stephen Armstrong","That's correct, Steve.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's it. So then in the slides and everything else where you're showing all these margin adjustments for NVS and for IT investments, that's sort of just for demonstration purposes, not to obviously try to get to a $0.48 EPS number.","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, you're correct. It's trying to make the historical results, as compared to the current results, as possible where it's relevant.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, just wanted to clarify. I'm over in Europe right now, so I don't have the luxury of anywhere to plug-in all the numbers real-time. But the other question, just you guys provided the size of the restructuring number on an after-tax basis, about $6.6 million. But what was it on pre-tax, just so we can sort of try to adjust the tax rate properly? Do you have the pre-tax medical restructuring cost number?.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Without getting into a lot of details, Steven, the number was just about the same at the operating line and the net earnings line. The tax implications of those transactions that were involved in the second quarter basically netted out to 0, so there's really no offsetting tax benefit, if you will, from the expenses and the charges that we took.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I think that's helpful to work through the numbers, so okay, all right.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe just the first one, to start on vet, I think you talked about consumables up about 2% in the quarter year-over-year in the U.S. Do you have an adjusted number once you look at buy-sell versus agency?","R. Stephen Armstrong","I don't have it.","Scott P. Anderson","No, that would be the number.","R. Stephen Armstrong","We didn't change anything with regard to our arrangements during the quarter, Jon. So we had no impact from switching from buy-sell to agency. Some of the competitors, I think -- some of the other players in the market did change the way they went to market with certain of their products, but we had no impact from that.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So unlike the other guys, you fully lapped that impact, if you would, Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Correct.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And Scott, maybe this one's for you. I mean, just on the basic equipment, you talk about the accounts still being hesitant, the environment not being great, but you alluded to that for several quarters or maybe even a couple of years now. I mean, is there anything that you can point to out in the field where you're starting to see that move forward or maybe thaw out, some reps that believe some accounts are taking a closer look at finally upgrading their offices on the basic equipment side?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I mean, that's a great point, Jon, and I think that's part of our frustration. As we've said before, we're the clear market leader in terms of the capital equipment business and are great believers in the return on investment customers have when they invest in their practices. We have a very stable market. Our customers have strong cash flows. Interest rates are low. And we think there's a very compelling story to be had about making investments now for the future because, when you look out over the next 10 years, dentistry is going to experience some nice demographic tailwinds in terms of an aging population needing more dentistry. So this is -- part of our story we continue to work on with our customers is make sure you are prepared through the future of dentistry in terms of your infrastructure and your facility. You couple that with the technology side in terms of how do you leverage efficiencies and bring higher clinical outcomes through products like GALILEOS and CEREC and our Schick product. We feel it's a compelling story. That being said, we still are fighting a very cautious, conservative customer base right now.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay, great. That's very helpful. And maybe just one last one. The commentary around the Omnicam upgrades, just taking a little bit longer to move some of the guys or train them on the move from Bluecams to Omnicams, that would suggest just that the tail will be longer, when we think about the back half of your fiscal '14. So is that a safe assumption, that you didn't let it all go in fiscal 2Q and we'll see some of those upgrades spill over to fiscal 3Q or 4Q?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, you're correct, Jon, on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Steve, I guess, starting with you, on the core margin side. Obviously, the business has faced some margin pressures over the years. You've got the NVS in there, you've got the IT investments in there. But if I back that stuff out, I know it's a lot of noise around that and you guys helped with the reconciliations at the end of the press release, but if I back that out, it looks like, 2 quarters in a row, core margins have stabilized, have actually gone up a little bit. I mean, does it feel like to you guys we're at the end of kind of a multiyear run here of some pressures and those margins now are at a defensible base and, once we drop out some of these IT incremental investments and what-have-you, that we can get back to an expanding trend?","R. Stephen Armstrong","I couldn't have said it better myself, Jeff. We would agree with you.","Scott P. Anderson","And I would echo those comments, Jeff. That's what we're committed to.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, all right. That's helpful. And how much of that -- Scott, I guess you mentioned in your prepared remarks or in maybe in the Q&A about you can adjust the cost basis, if you need, and what-have-you. I -- how much of what we're seeing on the 10, 20 basis points of core improvement the last couple of quarters are you guys turning those screws down on the cost side versus truly seeing just some longer-term margin expansion opportunities?","Scott P. Anderson","I think it's more on the longer term, Jeff.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then 2 last follow-ups. They've kind of been asked in the Q&A already, but let me -- I want to come back to both points. One, just on the October questions, your competitors, either on the distribution side or even some of the manufacturers, their numbers look sequentially pretty stable on the consumable side. You guys showed some slowing, and you guys go into October. So it would suggest that October was kind of the cause there of maybe the sequential slowing for you guys versus others. And then if I go back to your Analyst Day, which was right at the end of September, it sounded like then you were still pretty confident about double-digit equipment growth, and it doesn't sound like you're as confident today. You didn't deliver that in the second quarter. So it sounds again, October you can blame there. So how much of it was October, kind of government issues, as you said, maybe didn't help versus market softened, how -- or maybe if you could dovetail in there what you're seeing in the first few weeks of November here? Or any of that would be helpful.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I think it's tough just -- and I would never want to use the government shutdown as an excuse. But it's a market that, I think, for everyone in the industry, has been tough to read over the last 12, 24 months. November is off to a nice start. Part of that is our November had a little bit of the Hurricane Sandy comparable. But in terms of across the dental portfolio, November to date has been solid, without giving too much information. So I think what you may see in terms of comparability, us versus the rest of the market, could be a timing issue with months. I would tell you, as I talk to all of our top manufacturers, I am absolutely confident in the statement that we continue to maintain and take share across our portfolio.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And last question then would just be on the equipment side, the basic equipment being flat or down a little bit this quarter. It seems like your largest competitor has delivered some basic equipment growth that has now been leading you guys maybe for a few quarters. Is there something other than comps or anything else in the numbers, a different focus that maybe you guys are placing on tech that they might not be? Product line issues? Anything different between you and your largest competitor on the basic equipment side, why they'd be seeing growth and you guys aren't at this point?","Scott P. Anderson","No, the only thing I could maybe point to is they have a large exposure in the national accounts space. And that space has been fairly active in terms of de novo projects, so they could be seeing some growth from that segment, which really, until recently, we haven't really competed in that spot.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any early traction on that business for you, Scott? And then I'll drop.","Scott P. Anderson","We're making good progress in terms of building out the infrastructure, making relationships, but this is a long-term play.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair & Company.","Roberto Fatta","It's actually Robbie Fatta, in for John today. Just a couple of quick ones on equipment, still. Did you see anything interesting in the CAD\/CAM for everything -- Everyone strategy? Do you have enough experience at this point to know which side of the market people are going to?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, thanks, Robbie. I think it's too early. The strategy's just begun, but I would say we're very excited to be able to go to the marketplace and offer customers different entry points in terms of price and functionality. And we think that will be a winning long-term strategy. And but I would say, right now, it's very early in that process. And right now, the majority of the interest across-the-board is still around the Omnicam.","Roberto Fatta","Got it. That's helpful. Second, in terms of promotional activity, is there anything interesting that you guys are putting into effect for the end of the year?","Scott P. Anderson","I would say, nothing out of normal, but we always -- our third and fourth quarter are large equipment quarters, so we always put together programs with our vendor partners but, I would say, nothing incrementally that is different from what we've done in the past.","Roberto Fatta","Got it. And then finally, in terms of the NVS, it looks like it's annualizing at a little bit higher of a rate than we had initially expected. Is that a level that can continue? Or will we see a little bit of a drop-off?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Revenue side or...","Roberto Fatta","On the revenue side.","R. Stephen Armstrong","I think the revenue side, there's been some activity over there that's been positive for us, Robbie. I'd be a little bit judicious because this is only a partial quarter that shows up in these results, and I wouldn't run too fast with that. But there have been some positive result -- changes in that marketplace that will benefit us in on the revenue side longer term.","Roberto Fatta","Okay. And is there anything that has surprised you so far with that acquisition?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Just how good they are.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next we have a follow-up question from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions here. Scott, on the CEREC upgrades, is this just a matter of timing? Is there enough inventory? Or are you -- is there any backlog building that you guys don't have enough supply to meet the demand, still?","Scott P. Anderson","No, we're in good position with inventory. As I mentioned in the first quarter, we really used the first quarter to rebuild inventory, rebuild our training centers in terms of having the right technology in that spot. So there are no supply chain constraints.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then in your prepared remarks, you made comments about adding a number of salespeople in the Patterson Vet business, and I think you even said another 10 territory managers. I'm just wondering if there's any specific geography or region in the country that you're focused on in that business.","Scott P. Anderson","It's determined by market need through our branch and region manager network. So I wouldn't point them in mass towards any specific geography.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could squeeze one in for -- a couple of questions for Steve. Inventories was up pretty meaningfully this quarter. I think you said that NVS contributed quite a bit of that. Was that entirely the reason or was there anything else there, Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, I commented that there was -- it was due to NVS. And in addition, we had some additional build in the CEREC inventories, as Scott said, to get them back up to our comfortable operating levels. And then there were some opportunities that we took advantage of on the consumable side from a couple of vendors that boosted that inventory a little bit.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And the opportunities that you took advantage of, was that dental or vet or both?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Mostly dental.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Mostly dental, okay. I was just wondering. In the vet business, we've heard that Trifexis is launching in Europe, and just wondering if there is any inventory build based on that launch.","R. Stephen Armstrong","No.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Steve, could you break out the difference between volume and price on the dental consumable business?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Not very succinctly. I'm not prepared to do that on the call, Kevin. We could probably spend some time and work on it. But it's difficult to get the price versus volume on consumables because your mix is changing. If you're looking for how much of an inflation is in there, we'd give you our standard answer: it's usually between 1% and 2%. And there really hasn't been a lot to change that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Taylor with CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two relatively basic questions. But first, I wondered what it is about the upgrade from Bluecam to Omnicam that's just sparking the need for more training than you had initially expected. And then my second question relates to NVS. Obviously, it's still very early days, but I just wondered if you've learned anything so far that -- on the positive or a negative side that may suggest this is either easier or more difficult to integrate into your existing operations.","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. On the upgrade to Omnicam, it's interesting. I mentioned earlier that the Omnicams are going to our really power-user CEREC base, and many of these customers use the product and features and are incredibly efficient in how they've used the Bluecam for, some of them, up to 4 years. So the change management process was larger than we probably had anticipated going forward or anticipated from the beginning. So it's really just a matter of the CEREC specialist spending some additional time and getting the customer used to the fact that the way you take an impression with the Omnicam is different than Bluecam. It's analogous to, for any of us, when we change from one thing to the other. I'll give you an -- I just got an iPhone yesterday after years of a BlackBerry and would love to go back to the BlackBerry today, but I know, eventually, I will never want to go back to the BlackBerry. So the great part about it is, after we get through the training process, customers love the Omnicam. They love the fact that there's no powder. But I think, in an interesting way, it just speaks to what a great product the Bluecam is. Second piece, on NVS, what we've learned, with any acquisition, one of the key things is people. And I think what I'm excited about is the quality of people we have in that organization, management on down. I think they're very excited to be part of the Patterson family. They're excited to be part of a long-term strategic player in the veterinary space. And it's been fun to watch our team in the U.S. and the U.K. interact and start to brainstorm on areas where they can help each other. So obviously, there will be some things we find that will surprise us to the negative as well, but I would say, out of the gate, that the real huge positive is the people.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.","Scott P. Anderson","Well, with that, we want to thank everyone for taking their time today with us. We look forward to updating you in February at the conclusion of our third quarter. And we want to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving and a great holiday season. We look forward to talking to you in a few months. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","John Wright, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","John Wright","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies' fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Patterson President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Walchirk; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Goedken. After a review of the fourth quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The reconciliation table in our press release, adjusted reported GAAP measures, namely earnings from continuing operations, net income from continuing operations, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, or the impact of transaction-related costs, deal amortization expenses, intangible asset impairment, integration and business restructuring expenses, along with the related tax effects of these items, the impact of the 2017 Tax Act and other discrete tax matters.","We will also discuss free cash flow which is a non-GAAP measure and the impact of foreign currency. The reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Walchirk.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, John, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. On today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter results, the progress we are making against our strategic objectives, and our outlook for fiscal year 2019.","Fourth quarter results met our revised expectations. We delivered adjusted Q4 earnings of $0.30 per diluted share, and full year adjusted earnings of $1.68 per diluted share which was within our revised guidance range. As we anticipated, our results for the quarter reflected the ongoing business challenges we faced throughout the fiscal year, including the impact of our sales force realignment and ERP implementation, the market transition to new technology offerings and our decision to broaden our portfolio over those offerings within the dental segment. While we anticipate that these business challenges and trends will continue in the near-term, we are making progress to stabilize the core fundamentals of our business and execute on our growth objectives with the actions we have taken over the last six months. As we continue to stabilize the core, we expect to return to earnings growth in the second half of fiscal year 2019.","Dennis will provide more details on our overall performance but I'd first like to touch on the results across our segments. As we expected, our results in the dental segment reflected softness in both consumables and equipment, as well as a change in estimate related to year-end inventory valuations. In the quarter, we continue to transition our offerings and digital equipment at a time when the overall market dynamic reflects demand for a wider range of digital solutions and a broader mix of products. While results continue to be impacted by the expansion of our digital portfolio, we believe this is the right approach to capitalize on opportunities to sell new digital solutions. Our dental segment is going through a significant transition, and we believe we are focused on the right initiatives to improve performance of the segment in fiscal 2019.","In the animal health segment, we reported revenue growth across both, the production animal and companion animal businesses. Profitability in this segment was also impacted by a change in estimate related to year-end inventory valuations, as well as faster revenue growth from our production animal business which typically carries a lower gross margin profile compared to our companion animal business. Looking ahead to fiscal '19, animal health continues to benefit from stable growing end-markets, and we expect to improve our performance by taking advantage of these market opportunities, implementing a number of initiatives to improve product mix and continuing to manage our cost effectively. While we map our revised expectations in the quarter and for the year, our overall performance certainly did not reflect our potential; we must continue to implement our plans to drive more effective execution and improved performance.","In recent months, our team has been moving to stabilize the business and fix our core fundamentals as we reposition Patterson for long-term growth. Last quarter, I outlined several areas of focus and I want to provide an update on the progress we've made against these important initiatives and how we expect to build upon them moving forward. As a reminder, these key initiatives included improving the customer experience, enhancing our sales execution, stabilizing margins through our focus on strategic sourcing and product mix, driving improved cash flow and reduced working capital, and finally, continuing to build the overall talent at Patterson. Let me touch upon our progress in each of these areas.","Last quarter we talked about the need to improve the customer experience and our focus on making it easier to do business with Patterson. In my recent conversations with customers and our field team, it's clear that our efforts in this area are having a positive impact in the marketplace as our fill rates, payment processing and overall order quality have shown meaningful improvements over the past 90 days. We are pleased with the progress in the area and confident that our plans will ensure we continue to provide our customers with the capabilities and support for improved experience and improved customer satisfaction. Going forward, with the ERP implementation now substantially complete, we are focused on how we can leverage our common platform to improve customer satisfaction; that includes brain-to-market system enhancements that will further improve the customer experience. And two specific examples include the introduction of our new online returns processing tool and an upcoming launch of a new online bill payment platform, again designed to simplify customer interactions and generally improve the customer experience.","As I indicated last quarter, we also developed the set of customer focused metrics to hold ourselves accountable against these service improvements. Now while we are pleased with our progress in this area, our entire leadership team will continue to regularly review these metrics as we seek to -- continue to enhance the customer experience and customer satisfaction. The second area of focus is on sales execution and productivity. We've remained focused on investing in and building out our sales team, investing in tools to enhance their productivity and ensuring our field teams are aligned to support key initiatives and broader Company goals. During fiscal '19 we expect to continue investing in these areas, and believe as we continue to build out our sales organization, we will improve our consumables and equipment results.","In recent months, I've had the opportunity to meet with a number of our sales and field team members across both of our businesses. The relationship between our field teams and our customers is critically important to the future of Patterson, and we are absolutely committed to helping our team enhance those relationships and help make them even more productive. It's clear from my conversations that the investments we are making to support our teams will have an impact and we will continue to invest in building customer relationships and sales productivity. For example; we are in the process of rolling out a new sales productivity tool with our dental field sales organization at our upcoming national sales conference which will give our teams the ability to drive initiatives across the sales organization. This enhanced tool which is made possible by our new ERP system demonstrates one example of how we'll leverage the common platform overtime to drive our business goals.","As we focus on the customer experience and improving sales execution to drive topline growth, we are equally focused on stabilizing our margins through our strategic sourcing initiatives and improving our product mix including our focus on private label. With respect to strategic sourcing, we are establishing important relationships with our vendors and working to drive more value with our strategic partners. During the quarter, we completed several RFPs in our dental consumables business designed to improve our sourcing efficiency. And while we started with smaller categories, we are pleased with the initial results around driving acquisition cost savings and increased marketing and promotional support. As part of this initiative, we are also evaluating our vendor selection criteria and SKU portfolio with the goal of improving supply chain efficiency and ultimately driving greater profitability.","During fiscal 2019, we expect to continue executing our sourcing strategy with the intent of driving additional value for both Patterson and our selected vendor partners. Similar to our other initiatives, we have established specific goals across the business to ensure strong alignment and accountability on this key initiative. In terms of our focus on private label, we established specific private label growth goals across both our businesses and we've aligned management and the sales team around increasing penetration of our existing portfolio, as well as adding new products to our portfolio overtime. Looking ahead, we expect to grow our private label franchise at a faster rate than our overall consumables business. Next, we expect continued improvement in cash flow in fiscal 2019 driven by our initiatives across the Company around accounts payable, accounts receivable and inventory. We've also set specific performance measures in this area to improve our working capital performance and we are committed to using our ERP platform to deliver the fill rates that our customers expect while also managing our business more efficiently and productively.","Finally, we're excited about the progress we are making to buildout our leadership team. As you've seen, we recently announced the appointments of Don Zurbay as Chief Financial Officer, and Andrea Frohning as Chief Human Resources Officer. Both, Don and Andrea come to Patterson with previous public company experience and bring tremendous leadership expertise as we continue to position the Company to drive improved performance. Don will be officially joining us on June 29 and brings more than 28 years of leadership experience in various accounting and finance positions. His strong track record of successfully leading finance teams, particularly during periods of growth and change will be instrumental as we focus on improving our execution and results. And we look forward to Don joining us at what is obviously a key point in our Company's history.","Andrea joined Patterson on May 21. She brings more than 20 years of experience in leading numerous human resource departments across a diverse set of business environments and industries. We are excited to benefit from her experience guiding Fortune 500 Companies through transformations and helping to align our people and resources to our strategic priorities. We are glad to have Andrea on board and she is already off to a great start. I'm excited about the leadership team we have in place and look forward to continuing to build on this momentum. As a result of these various initiatives and actions, we are confident in our ability to drive improved performance in fiscal '19. We've issued fiscal year '19 GAAP earnings guidance to be in a range of $1.43 to $1.53 per diluted share, and adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $1.73 to $1.83 per diluted share. Importantly, as we stabilize the quarter, we expect year-over-year profit growth in the backhalf of fiscal 2019.","Looking ahead to fiscal '19 and beyond, our entire organization is operating with a sense of urgency with regard to what we need to do to enable Patterson to reach it's core potential. We've set clear objectives, we need [ph] to focus on revenue, margin and cash flow to stabilize the platform, improve profit growth in the second half of the year and deliver shareholder value. We are aligned around these objectives as a leadership team and are driving accountability broadly across our business segments and the entire organization. By taking a more disciplined approach with a greater focus on our operational rigor, we believe we are well positioned to execute against our key initiatives. As we indicated last quarter, we have also initiated a strategic time process to review how to best position Patterson for the future. In recent months we've made good progress by taking a thoughtful and broad approach in evaluating Patterson's launch from growth opportunities. Our leadership team and our board are highly engaged in this process and working closely together and we expect to have more to share later in the year.","Before I turn the call over to Dennis to provide more details on the quarter, I'd like to personally thank him for taking on the added role of Interim CFO and helping to ensure a seamless transition. Dennis has done a fantastic job these past several months and has played a critical role in supporting our near-term actions and really helping to buildout our FY19 plan and these key initiatives, and remains a valued member of our team going forward as he will continue to serve as our Corporate Controller.","So with that, Dennis, thank you. And I'll turn it over to you.","Dennis Goedken","Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. My comments will focus on the fourth quarter fiscal 2018 and our outlook and guidance for fiscal 2019.","Our performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of the factors Mark has described. Consolidated sales for fiscal 2018 fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, down 3.1% versus a year ago. Internal sales which adjust for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships declined 3.3%. Our fourth quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin was 3.6%. In the quarter our margin compression was driven by the decrease in sales and margin within our dental business, a contribution to our employee stock ownership plan, and a change in estimate related to our year-end inventory valuations as our new ERP platform now gives us better real-time visibility into our inventories.","On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $20.9 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $61.4 million or $0.65 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was excluded certain non-recurring deal amortization costs, totaled $28.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, down from $65.6 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $0.69 in the fourth quarter of last year.","Now let's turn to our segments. In Dental, the 2018 fourth quarter sales reflected the continued disruption from our sales force changes, the customer impact from the implementation of our new Enterprise Resource Planning System and market transition occurring within the digital equipment category. On a reported basis, Dental sales were down 10.1%, internal sales were just for the impact of currency translation, declined 10.5% versus the prior year quarter. On that same basis, Patterson's sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 6.7% during the 2018 fourth quarter and total equipment sales declined 20.2%. Operating margins in the Dental segment were impacted by lower sales volumes and margins, and the change in estimate related to our year-end inventory valuations.","Now, turning to our Animal Health segment; consolidated Animal Health sales for the fourth quarter grew 2.5% year-over-year. Internal sales was adjust for the impact of currency and any changes in selling relationships grew 2.4%. Looking at our companion animal business, for the fourth quarter internal sales for our global companion animal business increased 1.9%, on that same basis our U.S. companion animal sales grew 1.1% for the quarter. For production animal, internal sales in the fourth quarter grew 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago. As we mentioned last quarter, the third quarter internal sales growth of production animal of 8.8% reflected some timing of sales between quarters. Our overall performance into production animal segment continues to reflect solid top line sales and share gains as the end-markets remain favorable for swine and beef cattle with some continued pressure in the dairy part of the business driven by milk pricing. Operating margins were down in the quarter versus the prior year reflecting the change in estimate related to our inventory valuation and an ESOP contribution.","Now for a look at some of our cash flow and balance sheet items. During fiscal 2018, we generated $179 million of operating cash flow compared to $163 million during fiscal 2017 yielding a net improvement of $16 million over last year. Debt was reduced by $57 million during fiscal 2018. During the fourth quarter, we realized improvements in working capital most notably, in approximately $100 million reduction in inventory. Our goal is to stabilize and enhance our processes to further reduce our investments in working capital, and this objective is a key component of the fiscal 2019 operating plan. Our adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was 29.3%, reflecting the impact of the new U.S. Tax Legislation. For the 2018 fiscal year, our adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations was 30.7%.","Turning to our capital allocation strategy; we continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we returned approximately $25 million to our shareholders in dividends. That brings the total lot returned to shareholders during fiscal 2018 to $187 million.","Let me conclude with our fiscal 2019 outlook and guidance. For fiscal 2019, we expect GAAP earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.43 to $1.53 per diluted share, and we effect non-GAAP adjusted earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83 per diluted share. Our adjusted earnings guidance excludes the after-tax impact of deal [ph] amortization expenses of $27.3 million or $0.30 per diluted share. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 25% to 27%. We intend to invest the year-over-year tax benefit in fiscal 2019 back into the business to lay the foundation for sustainable long-term performance. Examples of these investments include continuing to build out our field sales teams, new sales productivity tools and our digital platform. As a result, our non-GAAP adjusted guidance range for fiscal 2019 of $1.73 to $1.83 per diluted share reflects our expectations for mid-single digit year-over-year profit growth in our business.","As Mark outlined, during fiscal 2019 we continue to intensely focus on execution of initiatives he described which we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. We are working to stabilize the core business and these actions will take time to be fully reflected in our results. In the first half, we will continue being impacted by the challenges facing our business. However, we expect to show sequential profit improvement as we progress through the year. Our annual operating plan calls for year-over-year EPS comparisons to turn positive in the back half of the year. Given our emphasis on decreasing working capital, and on accountability for that objective on our fiscal 2019 operating plan, we intend to generate between $200 million and $250 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2019. Our current operating plan for fiscal 2019 does not factor-in any share repurchases.","In terms of market conditions, our fiscal 2019 guidance assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in fiscal 2018. In addition, anticipate diluted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $92 million to $93 million.","Now I'd like to turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thanks, Dennis. And thank you again for all your great work these past few months. Before we open it up for your questions, I'd like to make a few quick closing comments.","First, we engage in solid and stable end-markets with positive long-term growth prospects, and while the markets will continue to change and the competitive dynamics will continue to evolve we believe the core fundamentals of our end-markets remain attractive. We have a compelling value proposition focused on helping to drive our customer's success and this constant focus on our customers will remain as a foundation of how we continue to invest in building solutions to best meet their needs.","Second, as you are well aware, Patterson has gone through a great deal of change over the past several years. While we have certainly made progress over the past 6 months, the changes we are implementing and the investments we are making will take time to take hold. That being said, we have put the right framework in place to stabilize the core business and we expect to generate year-over-year profit growth in the second half of fiscal '19 and to build on that momentum going forward. We will also continue to take into account the competitive environment and industry dynamics to help inform our point of view, and where we expect to take the company long-term.","Finally, I'm confident in our people and our team's ability to adapt to change, align around and execute on our initiatives and ultimately to deliver results. I'm also inspired by our teams focus and dedication to our customers and the lasting relationships we build that drive mutual success. We clearly recognize the need to operate the business with a heightened sense of urgency, accountability and financial discipline. Our collective focus is on executing our initiatives to improve our financial performance and deliver shareholder value.","With that, we'd like to open the lines so Dennis and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Kreger from William Blair.","Jon Kaufman","This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. So in regards to your fiscal 2019 guidance, can you talk about your expectations for dental revenue next year, as well as your expectations for margins? It seems like the material acceleration of margins compared to Q4 is implied in guidance. We're coming out to maybe about 100 basis points higher than where they were this quarter. So how much of that is better sales force productivity versus better sourcing versus not having the inventory valuation change? Any clarity there would be really helpful.","Mark Walchirk","I'll ask Dennis maybe to start and then certainly add some comments. I will suggest we don't specifically give guidance around segment revenue; so just as [indiscernible] the answer.","Dennis Goedken","But you're on-point there. Basically there were some non-recurring items that happened in Q4 that won't repeat themselves next year. So I wouldn't label or center yourself on the Q4 margins, maybe look more at the full year margins for the business. ","Mark Walchirk","And certainly as we build our plan for FY19, we've obviously taken those factors into account. And certainly we do anticipate. John I think there is a second part of your around how we would continue to generate improved productivity from the investments that we've made in our dental sales organizations over the last 6 to 12 months and certainly will continue to add field sales resources in our dental business in FY19, which is again part of the foundation, of how we've built our expected performance for the fiscal year.","Jon Kaufman","And then switching gears, on dental equipment can you talk about this decline here -- was this a matter of lower volumes in aggregate or is this really just a switch from the higher price full systems to some of the DI offerings that you guys now have?","Mark Walchirk","Primarily the second, so really more an impact of mix. We actually generated pretty significant unit increases on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. We obviously expanded the portfolio of products that we offer the marketplace, but certainly due to those changes in mix and the lower average sales price of the broader portfolio in this category, that certainly resulted in the revenue decline in that segment that you saw in the quarter. And certainly going forward again, as we build our FY19 plan, we certainly took into account the continued dynamics around these products in the market and how we expect the kind of volume mix to play out in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich","I guess just following up on the margin question, Dennis, you made the comment about the inventory valuations; could you give us any detail as to how much that affected the margins this quarter?","Dennis Goedken","I guess I don't want to go into a lot of detail in exactly how much it affected the current quarter. But I'd tell you, it's really a factor putting in the SAP system and having better visibility and having an integrated systems versus our manual system, our manual reconciliation process that we had in prior years.","Mark Walchirk","Just to add, I think, obviously now being on an integrated platform gives us improved visibility and certainly as we head into FY19, an opportunity to improve our processes associated with our inventory and ensure that we can -- have consistent way to estimate evaluation going forward.","Kevin Ellich","And then just switching over to the animal health business; so seeing some decent growth out of that business. Dairy, I just wanted to get your overall view as -- if you think that's going to turn around here in the second half of the calendar year? And then on top of that your largest competitor decided to unlock some value by spinning off it's animal health distribution business; is this something that you guys would consider?","Mark Walchirk","To your first question from a dairy perspective, I think we do anticipate a little bit of pressure in the dairy business, certainly keeping a close eye on the market environment there overall within our production animal business which would certainly has been performing well. Obviously, keeping a close watch on just the general trade environment as well but we don't anticipate any material changes as a result of that as we think about our FY19 growth projections in that part of the business. Certainly to your second question, we're very focused on the platform that we have -- we absolutely like the businesses that we're in. As I indicated, I think we're in attractive markets, we're actually seeing some positive momentum across both our animal health production and companion businesses, and we're focused on improving execution across both our businesses and improving our performance, and that's where our focus is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","I guess can you quantify a little bit more in terms of the salesforce investment that is embedded in your guidance, and sort of your confidence overall in the rampup in the second half and your visibility on that front? You also have a new CFO coming on board; are there elements of conservatism in there or buffers that you could highlight?","Mark Walchirk","I think in terms of the salesforce investments, obviously the Company has gone through a major change in our dental segment over the last couple of years after the salesforce kind of realignment efforts from a couple of years ago. We're certainly continuing to build back from that, we grew the number of sales reps during FY18, we expect to continue to invest and grow the number of sales reps during the coming fiscal year, not only in our territory reps but certainly in our equipment specialists and our CAD-CAM specialists. And so we are very customer focused sales oriented company, I'm very inspired about the ability of our sales teams to develop valuable relationships with our customers and I think that's going to be a key element of our ability certainly to want to drive the performance that we expect in FY19. Certainly as we continue to invest and bringing new folks onboard does take some time for them to ramp up, and certainly as we think about our dental business and the overall Company growing in the back half of the year, the improved rampup of our new folks and obviously the continued productivity and focus of our more experienced salesforce is going to be critically important to that.","And certainly not only are we investing in new people and feet-on-the-street, but also new tools to help make them more productive and help ensure we can drive the key initiatives that are going to support our customers and our company. So I have a strong confidence that as we continue to invest -- we continue to invest in our people and in the tools to help make them successful that we'll see the results of those investments during the fiscal year.","Dennis Goedken","And I would just add that, we have good metrics on how a new rep comes in, what kind of productivity, what kind of commission cost we pay and how that rolls through the plan for next year.","Mark Walchirk","Last comment I should make; I'm heading out of town on Saturday of this week, we're bringing our entire dental field sales organization in for our national North American sales meeting, I'm really excited to have a chance to engage directly with that group and frankly like to get our teams fired up for FY19.","Erin Wright","And on the animal health side; it was a little bit lighter on companion animal which weighed on profitability from its perspective. Were there any anomalies to call out that should improve in that business in the coming quarters on the companion animal side? And then more probably for fiscal '19 and animal healthy year growth and profit projections here, anticipate any sort of major shift in your vendor relationships? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Dennis, why don't you take the first part just in terms of the margin piece, and maybe I'll take the second part on the portfolio.","Dennis Goedken","Sure. So part of our vet business is also on the -- we're on the old inventory processes and we moved them to the SAP processes during the year, so the inventory valuation changed, affected that business as well.","Mark Walchirk","And I think in terms of companion in particular and kind of the product mix, I don't think we expect a material shift. We certainly are focused on mix in that part of our business just as we are across the production business and our dental business, and some of the comments that we made around focusing on private label, we've actually seen some very nice trending in the private label growth within our companion business and albeit on a relatively small base, we're encouraged by the focus that the leadership team has been putting on private label in that part of the business, did a number of new product launches throughout the course of the backhalf. But in terms of our relationship obviously with the large pharma manufacturers, we're very focused on bringing value in having a comprehensive offering. And specifically to your question, we don't expect any material shifts in mix in FY19.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Angelo [ph] from Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Given that you've anniversaried the salesforce reductions, and you sort of have now anniversaried the amended agreement with [indiscernible], it's kind of surprising to see the equipment and consumable numbers continued weaken here and you're expecting that to continue in the first half. Is there any sort of re-through here in terms of industry growth rates on either consumables or equipment? What are you guys seeing in the underlying base business?","Mark Walchirk","I think a couple of elements there. I think, obviously we need to move past the major changes that have gone over our sales organization over the past couple of years and I think we're making good progress along those lines. And I think we've also -- obviously changed our strategy with regard to our technology and equipment portfolio and I think we've built our FY19 plans to support that. I think the dental consumables market is showing low growth, probably in the 0% to 2% range; and certainly we do believe that the initiatives that we've put in place, the investments that we're making, frankly the focus and accountability that we're driving across the organization will help drive the performance that we expect out of the dental business in FY19, and we expect to improve performance, both in our consumables and equipment business throughout the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe I just asked one other follow-up question, I don't know Dennis if you're the right person for this but -- in the backhalf of fiscal '18, the company saw noticeable step-up in corporate expenses and I think it probably cost the company at least $0.10 to $0.15 in annual EPS just in these last two quarters. What are you assuming as we look towards fiscal '19 -- I know, the equipment financing portfolio has a lot to do with that in the recent rising rate. Are you assuming some normalization back to historical trend or you're expecting this elevated corporate expenses sort to continue into fiscal '19? Thanks.","Dennis Goedken","You hit it on the head there, it is related to our equipment financing business which is partially tied to our equipment sales number but it's also tied to external interest rates, and in this rising environment I still see that as being struggle next year as I don't see us going back to what you were termed as historical rates there.","Mark Walchirk","Just to add I think from an overall cost structure standpoint, I mean during our budgeting process we conducted a very thorough review of our cost structure and we are balancing frankly, investments that we need to make in certain parts of the business with the cuts and reductions that we have to make in other. So we're very conscious of our cost structure, we're continuing to run the business with I think increased financial discipline around our cost, and certainly something that we put a very close watch on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendon [ph] from Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Mark, could you elaborate a little bit on the private label opportunity, the gross margin profile -- would you expect some mixed benefit from that? And perhaps, how big of the portfolio that accounts for today?","Mark Walchirk","I think this is an important focus for the Company, I think we have certainly an opportunity to improve our -- really in two areas as it relates to private label. Number one, improving the penetration of our existing portfolio with our existing customer base; and then certainly adding to our portfolio overtime and without getting specifics around penetration rates and margin comparisons. Certainly more private label is good for the Company in terms of our mix and our margin, it's not something that's going to happen overnight, we look at this as absolutely a long-term strategy and an area that needs to become a real strength for Patterson overtime but we've set specific goals for our organization around private label growth in FY19, the leadership team has specific objectives tied to that, we're holding our teams accountable, our sourcing organization is focused on continuing to identify and buildout our private label portfolio and we expect our private label consumables to grow at a faster rate than our overall consumables business across all -- across both of our segments and certainly within animal health, both in production and companion.","Unidentified Analyst","And then maybe two part question for Dennis. Number one, obviously understanding that sell-out, right now particularly in dental is a little bit slower, you took down inventories quite a bit in the fourth quarter; do you still see more room for inventory reductions on an absolute basis over the balance of the year? And then number two, why not quantify specifically the impact of the inventory valuation changes on gross margin in the fourth quarter?","Dennis Goedken","The cash flow question, yes. I think our inventory levels are still a little on the high side and I think we can bring them down over the course of the year. And I mean, I guess it's just our practice not to give much detailed information about one of our business units.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Dennis Gallagher [ph] on for Jon. Just first question regarding FY19, is the right way to think about the dental consumable segment is kind of general improvement throughout the year and exiting the year at that kind of 0% to 2% market rate you mentioned?","Dennis Goedken","I would think that certainly we need to stabilize our consumables portfolio and our revenue there. Certainly, some of the way we've built our plan would assume that ramps up in the second half of the year and I think the exit rate going into FY20, we would expect to be back in line with the market.","Unidentified Analyst","And I guess the other question would be on the salesforce alignment; any additional detail in terms of -- if you do add more reps would they be kind of more territory reps or equipment specialists and where you are in that process?","Mark Walchirk","Really we are adding sales resources across all three of those kind of categories if you will within our dental segment. So our territory reps obviously that have direct responsibility for the customer relationships -- also in our equipment specialists and our [indiscernible] specialists; so while we don't provide specific numbers around how many reps we have and how many we're adding, we invested heavily in this area in '18, we expect to continue to invest in this area in '19. And I would also tell you we're investing in sales resources and field management to support the regional DSO space as well, and so we do that as a nice opportunity for growth in the years ahead. So we're investing across our customer segments, making sure that we have on the ground sales and management resources to support our customers.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Boja [ph] from Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","My first one is more of a clarification question for Dennis actually; in that fiscal '19 model there are a lot of moving parts, right -- we've talked a little bit about the financing element of it but there are a lot of moving parts that we have low visibility. As we try to think about the bridge from EBIT to pretax, or the composition of total other income and expense; can you give us a view for what the total other income and expense line looks like for fiscal '19 so we could just think about the model little bit more smartly?","Dennis Goedken","So the other income and expense, there is not a lot of moving parts in that, a big part of that is our interest expense on our debt, so there is really not a big story there.","Unidentified Analyst","And maybe then add to that -- ask the question in a different way; if we think about the consolidated impact year-on-year between what's going on in financing what you'd call out as been relatively stable and some of the other moving parts that we talked about in the P&L historically that might have been a little bit separate from operating issues are in the top line or even margins. Is there anything else that might be non-obvious in terms of the model bridge that we should think about? I think we're all here on the call just sort of scratching our heads a little bit about the margin or profitability change from year-on-year; anything else non-operating besides financing that you think might be a lever to contemplate?","Dennis Goedken","I mean, we did make a contribution to our ESOP, our Employee Stock Ownership Plan. So we went from kind of a minimal contribution in the prior year to more of a normal contribution this year, so that's kind of a year-over-year factor.","Unidentified Analyst","And then for Mark, I wonder if you could talk just a little bit about the salesforce in a different way. I mean, you've been very clear about the success that you've had growing the team and your plans to continue to invest there but can you talk about the average or aggregate experience level on the salesforce -- where that is today as I compare it to six months ago? And your level of confidence in driving the average or overall experience level of the salesforce higher in fiscal '19?","Mark Walchirk","That's good question and certainly if you look at way that our sales organization is build today and I'll talk maybe specifically about our territory reps; obviously, we've brought on a lot of new folks over the course of the last 12 to 18 months. So the average level of experience with Patterson certainly would be less than it would have been a couple of years ago. But we're also really excited about the folks that we've brought onboard, certainly some that come from other parts of healthcare, some that have specific industry experience; so while their tenure with Patterson maybe obviously relatively new, their experience levels certainly vary. We're obviously also very excited about the continued opportunity we have for growth with our territory reps who have been with the company and have a great deal of experience. And frankly, as we talked about previously, really improving the customer experience, putting obviously the ERP implementation behind us and really getting back to level of outstanding customer service that we would expect, we're excited about our tighter sales team, both of those with great experience, as well as some of our newer reps frankly going back on offence and really driving the results that we expect.","And we're also investing in tools to help them achieve their goals, again, tools not only for our newer reps that are coming onboard and helping them try to be more productive more quickly but also tools that we think will enhance the capabilities of our experienced reps and help them make -- become more productive and more valuable to the customer. So we're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow our salesforce and continue to see the folks that have less experience continue to ramp up and increase that experience level overtime.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael [ph] from Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Alan [ph] for Mike, thanks for taking the questions. So going back to the fiscal '19 guide, does your guidance range imply revenue growth and EBIT margin expansion at the consolidated level? And then, if not, which is more likely?","Mark Walchirk","I would tell you that it does include a mid-single digits growth on the revenue line and more of a flattish operating margin.","Unidentified Analyst","And then moving to the fourth quarter, can you breakdown the dental equipment performance in terms of basic versus hi-tech? And then, what's the current demand within hi-tech for integrated CAD-CAM [ph] versus standalone scanners?","Mark Walchirk","I'm not going to breakdown the specific parts of our equipment business but certainly as I indicated earlier, we did see unit volume increases year-over-year, obviously those are having somewhat of a negative impact on our mix. I would also tell you that just to confirm certainly our continued focus on selling the CEREC product, that's critical to our success in FY19 and while obviously we have a broad portfolio of products, certainly we're big believers in the technology and we've built plans very much in conjunction with the team [indiscernible] to execute on those plans and to continue to ensure we have the right focus and incentive structure in place to continue to drive the CEREC products as part of our overall portfolio. So -- and we've obviously taken those expectations into account as we head in FY19.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones [ph] from Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Mark, I just wanted to ask on the strategic planning process that you and the board are undertaking. I understand it's early but could you talk about what types of opportunities you're looking at in both the dental and animal health segments? And then specifically on the dental side, your peers have talked about investing and kind of broadening their product offering in some of the demo specialty areas, just wondering if that would be an area of interest for you guys as well?","Mark Walchirk","I think at a high level, we're taking a very broad perspective, certainly when I come to Patterson with a lot of experience in healthcare, I've got to take some time to get upto speed on the dental and animal health industries and our business position to competitive environment, certainly I've been very focused on that past six months. And so we're really trying to take a very fresh look. I would tell you certainly there is a lot of things that we would be considering from a business development standpoint, an M&A standpoint, certainly the ability to close gaps in our product portfolio, you named one example and obviously that would be on our radar in terms of how we broadened out our portfolio in the dental segment where we obviously have a scaled position and selling a broader portfolio of products and calling out a broader portfolio of customers I think would be a natural opportunity to continue to buildout our dental strategy. So certainly that's something that we're looking closely at as part of our overall broad view of the markets that we're in in our portfolio and how we want to drive growth and long-term value going forward.","Nathan Rich","Dennis, just a quick clarification on one of your previous comments on the corporate segment; so did you say that this could be more of a headwind from an earnings standpoint in fiscal '19 relative to what you've seen in the past couple of quarters if interest rates rise? I just want to make sure we're thinking about what to expect in that segment correctly?","Dennis Goedken","I guess not more of a headwind than we've experienced in the last few quarters, similar.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross [ph] from Evercore ISI.","Unidentified Analyst","On the revenue acceleration which seems to be that kind of crux of the improved profit outlook; how much is coming from sort of the new sales headcount kind of ramping the productivity? How much is coming from comp in terms of just -- how bad equipment was in consumables in the backhalf of this year? So assumed more normalization -- because it seems like, obviously your market assumptions are really for very low single-digits, at least on the dental side. So just help me on that kind of drivers of that walk from where we've been in the modest decline range for -- I don't know, 12 months now back to kind of mid-singles which -- we've put in a growth rate the business hasn't seen -- I don't know, maybe a decade?","Mark Walchirk","I think with respect to kind of the revenue expectations for dental, I think it's a combination of all the factors that you laid out. I think we expect increased productivity from the investments we've made in our sales organization. Certainly -- obviously, the comps play a role in that and frankly, we also expect growth and execution from our experienced sales reps, and certainly continuing to build out the equipment portfolio. So I think it's really a combination of factors and I think the thing that gives me frankly, good confidence in this area is, we've gone through a major disruption from an operational standpoint over the last couple of years, I think that is substantially complete and behind us, we've made -- we haven't talked about it, we talked about it earlier but we made a lot of meaningful progress in terms of the core day-to-day operations of our business and for the type of business that we're in, we have to provide outstanding customer service and outstanding customer satisfaction. And as we do that, it gives our field teams frankly, the opportunity to have a more comprehensive strategic conversation with our customers so that we can execute on our value proposition and bring the value that we know we can.","So I think as we've certainly turned the corner around, the day-to-day operations of our business and yes, we continue to have progress to make but we expect that all these factors tie closely together to give us confidence in our ability to drive some of this revenue growth that we've outlined.","Unidentified Analyst","And maybe just on the capital allocation side; obviously the free cash flow is going to step up but you've typically been more backend loaded. Help us just think through, where are you right now in terms of your leverage levels relative to the covenants from the AHI [ph] loan and kind of -- what paydown do you have to do kind of in the beginning of the year or over the balance of '19 to kind of keep within the covenance?","Dennis Goedken","We had a very good fourth quarter as far as cash generation and I'd say a significant paydown of our debt during Q4 which sets us up into a nice spot going into the year. I would just tell you there is -- we would need modest paydowns of the debt to stay in compliance and actually well within compliance of our debt covenance.","Unidentified Analyst","The covenant is 3.5 [ph]?","Dennis Goedken","Correct.","Unidentified Analyst","And where are you guys trailing 12-months or I guess what's -- is it TTM or is it forward?","Dennis Goedken","No, it's a trailing 12.","Unidentified Analyst","So where are you guys right now in a trailing 12?","Dennis Goedken","We're well within the 3.5. We're not where we would like to be but it's still well within it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Hagan from RBC.","Stephen Hagan","Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the industry growth in animal health and whether you feel like you're gaining market share in either companion or production animal?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. I think in terms of -- kind of the industry growth rate on our animal health segment, I think we see in the kind of 2% to 4% range and we expect to grow within those ranges across both the production and companion business.","Stephen Hagan","Another question, if you have any update to the FTC complaints? If there are any negotiations or working [ph] anywhere near potential resolution there?","Mark Walchirk","So certainly, we're at this point expecting the FTC trial to commence in October, and that's part of the process that we've been well aware off. And as obviously, we've said and certainly would reiterate, we believe the allegations are without marmot [ph] and we're fighting the situation vigorously. So we don't anticipate this matter will have a material effect on our financial condition, and certainly we're working closely to work through the situation and again expect that the trial would commence in October.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Kedra with Gabelli.","Kevin Kedra","I wanted to follow-up on the capital allocation question, and how you guys are thinking about using cash certainly you want to reinvest in the business and stabilize things in dental but how do you think about supporting the dividend versus share repurchase given current stock levels versus debt paydown?","Mark Walchirk","I'll take a round of it until Dennis can chime in. I mean, in general we're certainly committed to our dividend and that's an important part of our cash allocation strategy. We obviously also are focused on ensuring that. As Dennis indicated earlier, we remain in a very good position with regard to our leverage ratio, and I think as we outlined our FY19 does not anticipate specific share repurchase. And certainly as we drive improvements from a cash standpoint throughout the course of the year and believe that we have the opportunity to take advantage of that, hopefully we'll certainly will but we also want to show we can continue to invest in the business. And I can tell you from a cash flow standpoint, I believe we provided information about -- in the range of $200 million to $250 million, so a nice uptick from where we ended in FY18. And improving our working capital performance across our accounts receivable, accounts payable inventory, we think there is an opportunity for us to continue to do that, we have a very strong focus and emphasis on that, we have accountabilities across our business units and our leadership team around that and we think that can be a positive part of our performance. Anything to add?","Dennis Goedken","No, I think you said that well. Cash generation, I think will be strong this year. Some of it will be -- definitely be used to pay the dividend and then, some debts -- modest debt reduction.","Kevin Kedra","And then, I just wanted to follow-up on the concept of potentially looking at a strategic option like splitting off the veterinary business similar to what your competitor is doing. What would be the roadblocks to doing something like that? I mean, what is the biggest limiting factor should you guys decide that that's something that you might want to consider; is it just kind of separating the systems? Is it something physically of the warehouses -- just where do you see kind of the roadblocks are doing that?","Mark Walchirk","Certainly as I indicated earlier, we're focused on executing more effectively in the businesses that we're in. We like the businesses and the markets that we're in, we think they are attractive, we think they are stable, we like the long-term growth prospects, both of our animal health and dental segments and we're focused on operating those businesses and improving our performance. I think we're upto the end of our hour, are there any final questions? I'm sorry, no more questions, correct?","Operator","We do have additional questions.","Mark Walchirk","I think since we're just after 10:00 AM Central Time, we're going to stop there. I want to thank everyone for joining us today and for those of you that didn't get an opportunity to ask your questions, apologize for that, please feel free to reach out to John Wright directly and we certainly want to be responsive to your questions. But again, thank you for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly earnings call that will take place in late August.

Before I get into the details for the quarter, our outlook, and the progress against our key initiatives, I would like to formally welcome Don Zurbay to his first earnings call as Patterson's Chief Financial Officer.","Don officially joined us at the end of June and has been getting up to speed on the Company by conducting a deep dive into our financials and certainly supporting our key initiatives. We are very fortunate to have someone of Don\u2019s caliber and experience as part of the Patterson leadership team and I know he is looking forward as well to working with all of you.","Our earnings results for the first quarter did not meet our expectations. While our revenue performance was in line with expectations, reflecting some progress in our efforts to stabilize the business, we fell short on our margin expectations due primarily to two factors, competitive pricing pressures at the point-of-sale and an inventory adjustment.","On the top line, our ongoing initiatives to improve the customer experience and enhance sales execution are gaining some traction. Consolidated revenues were up 2.5% in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations and represented a return to positive revenue growth.","Our Animal Health segment delivered solid revenue growth in both the Companion and Production businesses and our Dental segment generated 5.4% year-over-year growth in equipment sales as well as improving trends in consumables. While the Animal Health business performed in line with expectations both on the topline and in terms of profitability, performance in our Dental business did not meet expectations in the quarter.","We are in the process of stabilizing and rebuilding our Dental business and we recognized that improvement in this segment will not happen overnight. However, we believe strongly in the platform and are taking the long view as we work to return the Dental segment to positive earnings growth. As I mentioned, margins in the first quarter were primarily impacted by pricing pressure at the point-of-sale.","While we have always operated in a very competitive environment, the impact during the first quarter was greater than anticipated. We also made an inventory adjustment during the quarter as a result of the increased visibility generated through our new ERP platform, which also contributed to the pressure on our overall operating margins. Don will provide more detail on this adjustment in his remarks. Together, the point-of-sale pricing pressure and the inventory adjustment caused gross margins to be approximately 60 basis points lower than our expectations.","In the coming quarters, we expect our revenue to remain in line with our current plan. However, we expect that the point-of-sale pricing pressure we experienced during the first quarter will persist throughout the year. As a result, we are updating our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance to reflect our revised expectations for the remainder of the year. We now expect full-year 2019 GAAP earnings guidance to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94 per diluted share and non-GAAP earnings guidance to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share.","As we look ahead, you should expect us to carefully analyze our cost structure and make adjustments to our expenses as needed to ensure they are aligned with the needs and opportunities in the business. While we are disappointed that our outlook for the year has changed, we are staying focused on the key initiatives and actions we believe will help drive improved performance.","As a reminder, we are focused on five broad initiatives to stabilize the business. First, improving the customer experience; second, enhancing sales execution; third, stabilizing our margins; fourth, driving improved cash flow; and fifth, continuing to build the overall talent at Patterson.","Now given the pressure on our margins in the quarter, I will start with the actions we are taking in this area before reviewing the progress on our other key initiatives. A central aspect of the margin initiative we have undertaken is to enhance our strategic sourcing capabilities and we are making good progress on this front.","During the quarter, we executed a number of additional RFPs and we started to actively engage with our top 20 suppliers. This work, however, will take some time before we see the benefits. Additionally, we have increased our focus on our higher margin private label products.","As we discussed last quarter, we have established specific private label growth goals across both our businesses and aligned management and the sales team around increasing penetration of our existing private label portfolio, as well as adding new products to our portfolio over time.","We are starting to see the early impact of our focus in this area. And as an example, our Animal Health private label business grew substantially faster than our overall Animal Health sales during the quarter. And in our Dental segment, our private label business performed better than our overall Dental Consumables segment.","So while the pricing pressure we experienced during the quarter was more than we anticipated and while we also anticipate these trends will persist in the coming quarters, we are taking active steps to address this headwind and we are confident that our efforts will result in more stable margins over time.","Now let me come back to our other key initiatives. Starting with our focus on improving the customer experience, I am very pleased with our team's efforts to improve our core business operations over the last six months. We again made measurable progress on this front during the quarter and I am very confident in our ability to meet the day-to-day needs of our customers and to continue providing outstanding service.","We continue to meet or exceed our key customer experience goals, including fill rates, order quality, and customer satisfaction, focusing on the customer and delivering an outstanding customer experience remains a top priority for us going forward. But from my perspective, major issues we faced with the customer experience have been addressed and are largely behind us.","In terms of our goal of improving sales execution, we have made good progress in continuing to hire new sales representatives and rolling out several of the productivity tools we've been investing in. Both our Animal Health and Dental segments recently conducted their National Sales Meetings and I was very encouraged to find a sales force that is energized, engaged in the business, and committed to helping Patterson deliver to our customers.","I heard directly from our sales force at these meetings that the new productivity tools we\u2019ve rolled out are already helping them manage their territories more effectively. I am pleased that we are seeing early positive signs of these investments as we met our quarterly sales targets for the first time in several quarters.","On the working capital and cash flow front, we generated more than $205 million in cash flow during the first quarter as we continue to put strong focus on accounts receivable, accounts payable, and our inventory. In addition, we also implemented a new dental trade accounts receivable facility, which had a significant impact on our cash flows during the first quarter as well. Don will provide more color on this facility in his remarks.","With respect to our final key initiative, continuing to build the overall talent at Patterson, we've already mentioned our excitement about having Don on Board and we expect to benefit greatly from his expertise and fresh perspective. We are also in the process of conducting a search for a new President in our Dental segment and we look forward to bringing someone on Board with the right skills and expertise to lead this crucial segment of Patterson's business. Our leadership team is focused and operating with a sense of urgency to execute on these key initiatives.","Moving now to our specific segments, Animal Health delivered strong performance with revenue growth in both the companion and production animal businesses. Margins were also inline with our expectations. While the Animal Health segment is also very competitive and we experienced some pricing pressure that we expect to persist, we continue to take actions to help mitigate this margin pressure.","One example is the success of our private label products, which as I mentioned grew significantly faster than our overall Animal Health sales during the quarter. Private label has been a key area of focus for us and we are pleased that our initiatives on this front are showing strong results in our Animal Health segment. Importantly, we continue to build upon our value proposition in this segment.","During the quarter, we announced a joint venture with Cure Partners, and the launch of new cloud-based veterinary practice management software, NaVetor. This unique intuitive software is designed to streamline and simplify workflows for veterinary practices and demonstrates Patterson\u2019s commitment to providing innovative solutions to our customers.","NaVetor is just one example of the comprehensive value proposition we offer to our Animal Health customers, which includes a broad range of products, services, technology, and support. I want to thank and congratulate the Animal Health team for their strong performance in the first quarter.","Turning now to our Dental segment. As I mentioned earlier, revenues were in line with our expectations. In consumables, we saw positive trends in our growth rates and our private label product outperformed the overall consumables business.","Equipment and software sales saw solid growth across all categories, which is particularly impressive given our large installed base. However, as noted earlier, the Dental segment is where we are experiencing much of the point-of-sale pricing pressure in the inventory adjustment we've already mentioned. As a result, operating margins for the segment were not in line with our expectations.","Also as I mentioned earlier, we do not expect the improvement in the Dental segment to take place overnight. However, I do want to highlight that we are making progress and are particularly pleased with the growth we generated in the digital and CAD-CAM categories.","While we continue to manage through the transition related to our prior exclusivity with Sirona and are still seeing the implications of this play out in the market, we are pleased with how our field team is responding to a broader portfolio of products. And we are working closely with the manufacturers of these products, executing marketing and sales promotions and as a result, we saw solid revenue growth across all equipment and software categories during the quarter.","While our Dental business overall did not meet our expectations, we are continuing to take the long view and we are taking a very thoughtful and planned approach to restoring our Dental segment back to profitable growth.","First, we've been heavily focused over the past six months on executing against our day-to-day service goals and improving the customer experience. As I mentioned, we are achieving our core service metrics and I am proud with how our team across Patterson has rallied around improving our service performance. We have made great strides in this area and again believe this issue is largely behind us.","Second, we\u2019ve been reinvesting in our sales organization by adding new territory reps and investing in productivity and territory management tools to help our field teams to be more productive. As a result, in our consumables category, we are seeing improving trends.","Next in the equipment category, we have been working through the transition to a much broader portfolio of products. And while this transition is certainly continuing to play out in the marketplace, we generated solid growth in this category and notably across all of our key equipment categories.","However, as we have made progress in our revenue performance, gross margin both in our consumables and equipment categories has come under greater than anticipated pressure, which we saw in our margin results in the quarter.","We compete in a competitive marketplace and expect continued pressure on our point-of-sale pricing in both consumables and equipment. As a result, we have also been focused on improving the buy side of our business in terms of our cost position and improving our product mix. More specifically around product mix, we are seeing some early positive signs in our private label category, which perform better than our overall consumables business in the quarter.","We are also focused on filling the right mix of our branded consumables products and working closely with our manufacturer partners to ensure we have the right cost position and that we are focusing our sales teams on those branded consumables that meet our customer\u2019s need and also generate appropriate margins.","We have much work to do in terms of stabilizing our margins, but I am pleased with the improved results from a revenue standpoint and the improved morale and focus of our field sales teams. So while we clearly did not meet expectations in our Dental segment in the quarter and our guidance reflects what we expect to be continued challenges in the segment, I want to be clear that we have a thoughtful and methodical plan to improve the performance of our Dental segment and we are executing against that plan.","As we've discussed, we are making a number of investments in the future of the business, but we recognized these investments will take time to see results. I am very excited about the focus and engagement amongst our field sales teams as I saw at our recent National Sales meetings and it's clear the team believes we\u2019re focused on the right initiatives.","In addition to the investments we\u2019re making to drive the topline, our focus and energy going forward will be centered on stabilizing our margins. As we've indicated, we believe fiscal 2019 is a transition year for our Dental segment. We are operating with urgency and feel we are taking the right steps to get back on a growth trajectory and reposition the segment for the long-term.","Finally, I want to provide a general update on the long-term strategy process as we've been doing on a quarterly basis. We continue to believe that we are in strong stable end markets and that the Patterson brand is strong in these markets. Importantly, we believe we are building the right team and are providing a comprehensive value proposition to support our customers. It will take time for the work we are doing to take hold, but we believe we are on the right track and making progress.","As you would expect, we are closely evaluating all the markets, trends, competitive environment and product lines in which we operate to identify opportunities for improvement. Across both segments of our business, we recognized the value-added services are a key factor for our customers of all sizes and types and we are constantly guided by the principle of investing in and reinforcing our compelling value proposition for our customers.","Our customers value the products and technologies we offer as well as our ability to tailor a set of solutions most relevant to their needs. But most importantly, we provide the experience and responsiveness to help our customers competently manage and grow their business.","Whether we are working with small private practices or large organizations with national scale, our outstanding dedicated sales support and service teams are focused on enabling our customers\u2019 success. By serving as a trusted business partner, we are able to deepen our relationships and build on the strength of our strong brand, leading products and technology, outstanding service and outstanding people. We look forward to sharing more updates related to our long-term strategy process in the coming quarters.","Now before I turn it over to Don, I would like to provide a brief update regarding the Dental Supplies Litigation. While we continue to believe such claims are without merit and we in no way admit to any liability and while there has been no finding of any violation of law, we recently entered into settlement discussions with the plaintiffs. As a direct result of these discussions, we anticipate entering into a definitive settlement agreement.","We did this solely based upon our desire to avoid the time, expense, distraction and inherent uncertainty of litigation and to refocus our efforts on our business. Based upon these settlement discussions, although we have not yet entered into a definitive agreement and any such agreement would be subject to preliminary and final court approval, we currently estimate that the pretax cost of resolving this litigation will be $28.3 million. We reflected this estimate in our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period ended July 28, 2018.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Don.","Donald Zurbay","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a few introductory comments, then I will walk through the financials for the quarter. And finally, I will explain our guidance revision and outline the assumptions that you might find helpful as you update your models.","First of all, I am excited to be here at Patterson and be part of a great team of individuals. I've been very impressed with the level of talent, passion, and commitment that I've seen from the employees of this Company. We are in growing markets with a strong reputation for serving customers and helping them drive success in their business. I come into this role with eyes wide open to the challenges we have in front of us and look forward to supporting our key initiatives and positioning the business for long-term success.","Now let me walk through the financials for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated reported sales for the fiscal 2019 first quarter are $1.3 billion, an increase of 2.5% versus a year-ago. Internal sales which adjust for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships increased 2.3%. Topline growth has improved compared to Q4 of fiscal 2018 and has also improved on a year-over-year basis compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.","Our first quarter consolidated gross margin was 21.2%, a decline of 170 basis points from the same period one-year ago. As expected, segment and product mix and a decrease in customer equipment financing negatively impacted our gross margin by 110 basis points. In addition to these factors, our year-over-year gross margin declined an additional 60 basis points due to larger than anticipated point-of-sale pricing pressure within our Dental business and unplanned inventory charges related to the transition to our new ERP platform and inventory process. This 60 basis point decline impacted our earnings per share by approximately $0.06. ","Operating expenses were 70 basis points higher than the same period a year-ago and reflect the continued investments we are making in our Dental business to rebuild our sales force, strengthen our value proposition and drive margin improvement initiatives, principally strategic sourcing and expanding our private label business.","These factors translated to a consolidated operating margin of 3.2% versus an operating margin a year-ago of 5.6%. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 27.0% for the quarter, down from a rate of 34.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the new tax legislation. On the bottom line, the GAAP net loss attributable to Patterson Companies Inc., for the first quarter was $4.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $30.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share a year-ago.","Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs and a reserve for the anticipated settlement of certain litigation, totaled $24.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, down from $41.4 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.26 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $0.44 in the first quarter of last year","Now let's turn to our segments. Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 6.0% compared to the same period a year-ago and our Production Animal business, internal sales in the first quarter grew 6.7% compared to the same period a year-ago. Our overall performance in the Production Animal segment continues to reflect solid topline results across all species with particular strength in the swine and beef cattle categories of our business.","For our Companion Animal business, internal sales for the first quarter increased 5.5% over last year and reflect continued solid sales execution and delivering the full Patterson value proposition to our veterinarian customers. Operating margins in Animal Health were 3.4% in the first quarter compared to 3.7% in the same period last year.","Operating expenses in Animal Health were essentially flat and reflect continued disciplined expense management on the part of our Animal Health team. The entire 30 basis point operating margin decline within the Animal Health business was attributable to unplanned inventory adjustments.","In our Dental business, internal sales declined 2.7% versus the prior year quarter. On that same basis, Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 5.2% during the 2019 first quarter, and total equipment sales increased 5.4%. This included year-over-year sales increases in all equipment categories.","Operating margin in Dental were 7.3% in the quarter compared to 11.5% in the same quarter last year and reflect the impact of several factors, including planned investments to rebuild our sales force in the anticipated impact of product mix as well as greater than anticipated competitive pricing pressure at the point-of-sale and unplanned inventory adjustments.","Now let's look at several cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we generated $205 million of cash from operating activities compared to a use of $46 million during the same period a year-ago, yielding a net improvement of $251 million over last year.","There are two components to our operating cash flow improvement. First is the trade AR facility we established earlier this month. This was an opportunity to efficiently access working capital and we used the proceeds to paydown higher interest debt. The other significant component of the improvement in cash from operating activities came from the continued focus and effort and decreasing our networking capital. After subtracting capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the first quarter in fiscal 2019 was $195 million, an improvement of $248 million from the same period a year-ago.","Turning to capital allocation, we continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we returned approximately $25 million to our shareholders in dividends.","Let me conclude with some comments on our fiscal 2019 outlook and guidance. My perspective on guidance is that we want to establish realistic achievable earnings per share guidance is based on a balanced, credible forecast of the business. Since arriving at Patterson, I've been working with the team to refine our forecasting process with the objective of continuing to improve our discipline and accuracy.","For fiscal 2019, we now expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94 per diluted share and we now expect non-GAAP adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share.","Our adjusted earnings guidance excludes the after-tax impact of deal amortization expenses and the legal settlement reserve, which together totaled $51.8 million or $0.56 per diluted share.","For modeling purposes, let me give you some of the assumption we used in establishing our guidance for the remainder of the year. We have assumed modest improvement from our first quarter year-over-year revenue growth rate each quarter as we move through the remainder of the year.","For gross margin, we are using the first quarter gross margin percentage as the baseline for the year and still intend to execute on the margin contribution from strategic sourcing and private label that we have been diligently working on.","With regard to operating expenses, we have made certain adjustments for original plan as we prepared our most recent forecast. We are currently modeling operating expenses as a percent of sales to moderate slightly for the remainder of the year from our first quarter level.","While we plan to make the necessary investments to drive improved performance and still have conviction those investments are correct and showing some early progress. We know we need to balance these necessary investments with the cost structure that aligns with the profit contribution of the business.","As Mark outlined, we should expect us to carefully analyze our cost structure and make further adjustments to our expenses as needed to ensure they are aligned with needs and opportunities of the business. Because this analysis is ongoing, any further adjustments we make in our expenses are not reflected in our EPS guidance.","For our tax rate, we still expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 25% to 27%. Our share count is forecasted to be in the range of 93 million to 94 million shares.","Let me conclude by saying that why I certainly understand there is a lot\u2019s of work to do in a dynamic and changing business. I am excited to be here at Patterson with the new leadership team and looking forward to the opportunity to work closely with Mark and the entire team to improve our performance.","And now I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thanks, Don. Now before we wrap up, I want to reiterate some of the specific examples that help support our confidence in the opportunity to improve the long-term performance of our Company. First, revenue is in line with our expectations and grew year-over-year for the first time in several quarters. Second, we are encouraged by the performance of our private label products across both segments and the opportunity that this represents to help stabilize our margins.","We continue to generate strong cash flow performance. And finally, our team is engaged and motivated and remain focused on our customers and delivering on our key initiatives as we move forward.","Now that being said, our leadership team is squarely focused on taking the necessary steps to stabilize our margins. We will continue to execute against all of our key strategic initiatives and focus on returning Patterson to profit growth. This is a transition year for our business and we recognized that our transformation will take time. We look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of our efforts in building a stronger Patterson.","And with that, we will open the line. So Don and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Kaufman","Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. Can you guys go into more detail around the point-of-sale competitive pricing pressures that you're seeing in Dental? How much of that margin decline was related to discounting CEREC equipment versus promotional pricing on other equipment versus competition from the online channel or price competition among the traditional distributors?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Jon, this is Mark. Thanks for your question. I think there is certainly a number of factors that are driving some of this competitive pricing pressure. And I think you've listed a number of those. I think first, just competitive \u2013 we operate in a competitive market in general.","I think from a consumables standpoint certainly we see greater price transparency in the marketplace around our equipment products. As we obviously have a broader portfolio in our products, certainly there's high levels of competition in that area. Obviously, the evolving growth in the market around the DSOs, I think also has contributed. So I think there are a number of factors that are having some impact and creating some of this point-of-sale pricing pressure.","Jonathan Kaufman","Okay, great. And then if we just do some kind of back-of-the-envelope math regarding the revised guidance, if we keep non-GAAP corporate expenses relatively steady, maybe a modest improvement in Animal Health margins, we\u2019re coming out with an implied Dental segment non-GAAP margin of, call it 8.5% to 9% for the remainder of the fiscal year. I guess number one is that accurate? And two, can you talk about what level of revenue growth will be required to achieve that margin?","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I mean that's probably in the ballpark, but \u2013 this is Don. I don't think we're going to get into \u2013 I think I gave the guidance in terms of the overall revenue profile. I don't think we want to get into the specifics related to Animal Health and Dental in terms of our guidance assumptions.","Jonathan Kaufman","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Mark Walchirk","Thanks Jon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me okay.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Johnson","Great. Good morning, Mark and Don and John. Don, I guess starting with you, just \u2013 you gave some color on what the Animal Health gross margins did in the quarter. I only see operating margins in Dental down to 420 basis points. Can you parse that between OpEx and gross margin changes for us? And then I\u2019ll -- have one other question on the point-of-sale commentary.","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I think the 30-basis point decline in our operating income as a percent of sales was all at the gross profit line. And so operating expenses as a percent of sales in the Animal Health business were flat, and if you really look at that, it's a 30-basis point decline, it relates to the \u2013 it all relates to the inventory adjustments in the quarter.","Jeffrey Johnson","Yes. Thanks. And I was hoping you could do the same in Dental. Sorry, maybe I was unclear there. Just could you give us some color on the Dental gross margin change in the quarter?","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I tried to lay out the impact, I think on the gross profit which was down 180 basis points, there\u2019s about 100 basis points of point-of-sale margin pressure, 30 basis points of mix, and roughly 30 to 50 or 30 to 40 basis points of inventory charges.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And Mark on the point-of-sale answers you just gave on the first question there. I guess I'm trying to figure out, historically if we think about Patterson, you guys always kind of sold to a premium Dental set of customers, if you will, and you've now \u2013 maybe that is changing some. You've also lost some sales reps over the last two years. I would assume you have to figure out ways to get back into some accounts or open new accounts maybe using price a little bit there.","So I'm trying to figure out how much is pricing at the end user level changing across the industry and coming down across the industry versus maybe you're finally having to effect some change here, if you will, by taking out the Patterson premium that's often been there and maybe even using price a little bit to win back some business over time?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Jeff thanks. I mean it\u2019s a good question. I mean I would say that as the industry and the markets evolve, and we too need to evolve, and we're certainly \u2013 we lead with our value proposition and we believe we have a very strong and compelling value proposition, and we don't lead with price, but we also recognize that we need to be competitive on price.","And so I think you're seeing more transparency in the market. Obviously, we have an opportunity to partner with the DSOs that generated a nice growth opportunity. We're working and finding ones that fit with our value prop and really value the things that we bring to the table. But certainly that's part of the market that we need to continue to focus on and we need to think about how our cost structure is aligned to service that customer base that obviously has purchases a larger volume of products and obviously commands an improved price position.","I think also as I mentioned, we've got a much broader equipment portfolio now. Our customers have a lot of choices about which equipment products they purchase. Again, our focus is on helping them find the right one that fits with how they want to practice their craft. But again, it's I think generally competitive. So I wouldn't suggest that our strategy has changed. I think we certainly continue to stay very focused on the private practice positions and bringing real value private practice doctors bringing real value there, but certainly competing in the DSO space as appropriate and again generally I think there's \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say there's one factor in particular. I think there's a number of factors that are contributing to some of the pricing pressure that we're seeing. But again, I wouldn't want to give the impression that we're walking in and competing on price and taking our prices down, that\u2019s not the case at all. We're leading with our value proposition, but we recognize that we need to have a competitive price point as well.","Jeffrey Johnson","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. I understand it\u2019s early days of your tenure Don, but can you give us a sense of I guess where some of the near-term opportunities that you see are? And I understand you are part of the receivable securitization, for instance, I guess what other near-term opportunities you see? And then also what are some of those internal metrics or benchmarks that you're focused on relative to what prior management focused on and contributed to the fiscal 2019 guidance? Thanks.","Donald Zurbay","I think the biggest near-term opportunity that I would talk through is just, well, there's two. I think that we mentioned that Mark and I recognize the need to analyze our cost structure to really dig into this and figure out where it makes sense to continue to make the investments we're making, but also be responsible for and understand the margin profile we're dealing with, and so that's an opportunity.","And then I think just on guidance and clarity, hopefully you'll find that the prepared comments today gave some additional clarity on our thinking around how we put together the guidance and kind of the philosophy. I\u2019d like to be transparent in terms of what we're doing to the extent we can.","But I think that bringing some credibility here in terms of how we set the guidance, a process \u2013 I have a process it's fairly well warm that I think works and give ourselves \u2013 put ourselves in a position to give you reasonable conservative guidance that as we move through the year, we can hopefully move in the right direction.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. I\u2019m curious what your view is on capital deployment and commitment to the dividend at this point and any other strategies that you could speak to that are on our off the table for instance that may not Animal Health? Thanks.","Donald Zurbay","Yes. So first of all, we're very committed to a dividend. I think we feel like this has been \u2013 we have a longstanding history of a dividend. We like this as a recurring return to our shareholders. Obviously, we're going to be disciplined about how we allocate our capital. But maybe as we move forward, Mark and I would like to be a little bit aggressive. I think that that involves looking at anything that's out there that makes sense. M&A, the attractiveness of purchasing our own stock and early days on that, and Mark and I need to get fully aligned. But I think as a regards to the dividend, we're definitely committed there. Sorry, what was the second part of your question, Erin?","Erin Wright","I guess any other strategic initiatives that are on or off the table for instance that may not Animal Health?","Donald Zurbay","Okay. I think that obviously comments on M&A and comments on any other kinds of strategic moves like that probably we wouldn't comment on the call. So look, in the situation we're in, we're just \u2013 we\u2019re evaluating anything that makes sense, but definitely wouldn't comment about that on the call here.","Erin Wright","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, Don, great to have you on the call. I just want to clarify of the 60 basis point impact on margins or $0.06 of EPS as you call it on your prepared remarks, was half of that attributable to the pricing pressure point of sale or \u2013 and then how much was due to the inventory adjustments?","Donald Zurbay","So of the 60 basis points roughly 20 basis points was related to the inventory adjustments and 40 basis points related to the point-of-sale pressure on the dental margins.","Kevin Ellich","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then last quarter, I think there was an inventory adjustment as well, do you think we're beyond that? Or do you think this is possible this could be recurring theme?","Donald Zurbay","No, I think the system gives us improved visibility into our inventory. So I think as we move forward, we will significantly improve our ability to manage inventory levels going forward and really look at the composition of the inventory and be able to analyze it more effectively.","In the month, since we've implemented, I think as you know the systems uncovered some things, some operational efficiencies that we couldn't see through our prior system, which now \u2013 which involve manual reconciliation. So we're really moving to a much more modern system, a system that's going to give us more efficiency and ultimately going to be more accurate. And so I don't expect this to recur on a regular basis. I think it's really going to be \u2013 we think we have this behind us and that we're going to now use this to our advantage.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, just to add. Kevin, this is Mark. I think as we have greater visibility that from a common platform, obviously there are areas where we need to put improved operational processes into place and certainly inventory would be one example. Certainly over the last several months, we've got a team of folks that are working on improving our process management as relates to inventory reconciliation, so that we can minimize these issues going forward. There is always going to have some inventory reconciliation, but certainly we don't expect to the levels that we've seen over the last two quarters.","Kevin Ellich","Great. That's helpful. And then going to the strong cash flow this quarter, I\u2019m wondering if you could parse out how much of the improvement in \u2013 do the operating cash flow came from the trade AR facility versus the effort to just decrease working capital?","Donald Zurbay","Yes. The trade AR facility gave us about $160 million.","Kevin Ellich","Okay. That's helpful. And then does that change or affect your operating cash flow and CapEx guidance for the year? I noticed you didn't mention that.","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I didn't mention it for a reason. I\u2019m honestly not planning on giving that as guidance. I just think that \u2013 that's an area that I think has too many moving parts. There's too much variability and too many different types of things can impact that. So I'm not as comfortable. I know that's been the history here, but I'd like to get us to a point where we're not giving that as guidance.","Kevin Ellich","Sounds good. Thanks a lot guys.","Mark Walchirk","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Block","Great, guys. Good morning. Hopefully you can hear me okay. Mark, one for you and then Don, I think I\u2019ll circle back with you just on the second question. But Mark within Dental, you're talking about investing appropriately for growth and stabilizing margins. And with the magnitude of pricing pressure that you seem to be experiencing with Dental, can you successfully do that in the coming quarters? In other words, invest in the business while supporting margins at the same time? And then Don, I just got a quick follow-up.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thanks Jon. I mean I think it's crucial that we balance that right, so I think we've made some investments in the business over the past number of quarters primarily and rebuilding our sales organization. And importantly as well investing in some tools to help improve their productivity and their ability to kind of manage their territories, so I think that that's a really critical element and we certainly have to gauge and balance the investments with obviously the need to stabilize the margins.","So a) we're going to continue to make investments that we believe are appropriate, again kind of taking the long view. But certainly as I think and I would say those investments primarily on the sell side, but we're also investing kind of time and effort and energy against the buy side of our business and really looking at how we can improve our sourcing capabilities, obviously improve our mix that we believe will have an important element on really stabilizing the gross margin.","And I think in terms of the operating margins, as we decide that we need to make investments in our field, sales organization that may require us to consider what we do or don't invest in other areas. And as I think, both Don and I mentioned, obviously with the margin profile needing to take a real fresh view of our overall cost structure as well.","So can you do both? I mean I think it's important that we continue to invest. We want to take a long-term view. But we\u2019ll have to balance those investments obviously with the need to stabilize our margins.","Jonathan Block","Okay, very helpful. And Don, maybe a small handful of quick ones for you. I just want to verify, the litigation all shows up sort of in that other consolidated line, the litigation charge in the quarter. Is there still the opportunity to bring down inventories throughout the year seem up from year-end, but that might be seasonality?","And then quickly just with all the uncertainties that seem to be swirling around Dental, is that $0.10 range on the guidance the right approach? I know that\u2019s sort of been the historic way for Patterson. But is that the approach you want to take with what seems like a little less visibility specific to the industry? Thanks for your time guys.","Donald Zurbay","Yes. So with regard to your first question, I do think there's opportunity in our inventory to continue to make progress there and help our working capital. Yes, the $0.10 range is a great question. I\u2019ll be frank with you, we are in a period of a little bit of uncertainty. I think that we debated broadening the range. We're in a situation where $0.01 is worth about one \u2013 slightly over $1 million. So we consider that, I think that we're comfortable obviously in putting this out there today. But I think maybe as you fast forward to initial guidance next year, it's a great question and maybe you start the year with a broader range. So appreciate the commentary.","Jonathan Block","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Mark maybe to start, I just wanted to make sure that I understand the commentary on pricing. Would you say that the pressure was I guess mainly a response to other competitors getting more aggressive in the market and you kind of had to match that? Or should we think about this more as you kind of being more proactive in trying to go out and win market share kind of given the new reps that that you've brought on over the past couple of years?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Nathan, thank you. I wouldn't say it necessarily in response to others necessarily in the market. I think the market is generally \u2013 it's a competitive market and not \u2013 I hate to just reiterate some of the things I\u2019ve said, but I think those are really the key factors. Yes, there is price transparency in the market. I think that put some pressure on the point-of-sale pricing.","You've got a broader set of players in the market now carrying a broader portfolio of equipment products. I think that just generally adds to the general nature of the competitive market. And certainly as we're seeing the growth of the DSOs both at the national and regional level and their expectations and ensuring that we want to compete with the right partnerships there.","Again, I think there is kind of multiple factors, so I wouldn't point to one thing in particular. And I would again point to we're certainly not leading on price. We're leading with our value proposition, but we recognized that the need that we need to be competitive, we don\u2019t expect to be the lowest price. But we certainly recognized the need to be competitive in the market.","Nathan Rich","Make sense. And then just a quick question on the dental equipment. Obviously, very nice performance in the quarter, and I think as we get into September, we\u2019re lapping the distribution change with relation to the Sirona portfolio. It sounds like you're working more closely with manufacturers on ways to drive sales. So as we think about the growth outlook for equipment over the balance of the year, do you think we should expect to continue to see or remain positive given some of those dynamics and the fact that you are facing kind of easier comps over the final three quarters of the year?","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I think first of all, certainly the equipment market is far more difficult to forecast then kind of the core sundries market. So our expectations assume that we meet our goals for the year around equipment. We are pleased with the results in the quarter, but again, difficult to \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit more of a choppier business obviously than the consumables are. We're working closely with the manufacturers, really pleased with the meetings that I have personally had with a number of our manufacturers recently. Joint sales and marketing efforts that we're putting together to help create demand.","And so we\u2019re \u2013 as I said, we had a good quarter across really all of our categories. But it would be difficult to give you a forecast obviously and certainly in general, those products are more difficult to forecast. But we're pleased with the results in Q1 and frankly pleased with the work and the collaboration with our manufacturer partners.","Nathan Rich","Appreciate that. Thanks for the question.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. So maybe just on the litigation settlement, can you just \u2013 given the commentary you gave on pricing overall, give us a sense is if you feel while I realize no admission that there is any sort of change in the customer conversation around pricing related to sort of that settlement particularly in some of the areas, where the GPOs and others kind of made noise. And then if it has any bearing on sort of where you are with your process with the FTC around the Section 5 complaint?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Ross, thanks. I mean obviously I\u2019m not kind of go into any more depth with regard to the settlement that we discussed and I covered kind of in the prepared remarks. So just point you to that in terms of anything specific. And as it relates to the FTC case, we're we continue to work through that. I believe we\u2019re planning for the trial that take place in October. Just as a reminder, there is no money damages sought in the FTC administrative complaint. And we're obviously fighting that vigorously. So not sure I completely answered your question, but probably the best I can do on the legal front.","Ross Muken","Thanks Mark. And maybe just quickly on the debt side. Don, you kind of talked about obviously want to sustain the dividend and also maybe thinking about repurchases and M&A and the like, and obviously the receivables agreement gave you some flexibility. I guess this relative to that, what sort of level gross debt-to-EBITDA or net debt-to-EBITDA, or do you think this business in the public markets and sort of \u2013 how do you think about it and on that basis or debt-to-cap given the cash flow profile?","Donald Zurbay","Well, I think our debt-to-EBITDA at least kind of the way we measure it, we ended the quarter at 2.6 times. I\u2019d like to model ourselves in the \u2013 I think that's a decent level and I think that I can look at levels at three maybe slightly higher than that that could make sense and obviously for the right M&A opportunity. I think there's more capacity in that that you might think about given that depending on the profile of the acquired company. So that's really \u2013 at that point and obviously two months into the job, but that's \u2013 those are numbers I'm thinking about.","Ross Muken","Okay. Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Jumping back, I know we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion on the pricing dynamic. Is there an area as you go into the reinvigoration of sales force and having the sales people out and in their commission levels where you're going to start to change your methodology or change your strategy in the event of pricing remains and fairly competitive in terms of whether it's their commission levels or the type of business they go after, but any changing dynamics in terms of the level of profitability pricing dependent that you're willing to underwrite business on.","I know you said you\u2019re not going to be a low price competitor, but will it cause you to start to walk from business or you\u2019re still not at that point relative to the sales force and what you've understood on the new ERP?","Mark Walchirk","Well, thank you, Mike, for the question. I mean the main thing I would say is mix matters. And it's important that we have an aligned organization all the way from our relationship with our manufacturers all the way through to what we are the tools and how we incent our sales force. And I think as we continue to kind of evolve our approach both are certainly both across \u2013 both of our businesses, certainly Dental as well as Animal Health.","I think this idea of mix being really critical is something we'll continue to focus on. And I think over time, you'll see us again ensure that from the buy side through the sell side, we are incenting around the fact that mix matters and creating great opportunities for our sales organizations to continue to grow their incomes.","And by selling the right mix of products, obviously those that meet our customer\u2019s requirements and making sure that the incentive structure for our field teams are aligned with that. So that's work that we're doing. And certainly part of our broader strategic sourcing initiative is a key element of the overall strategy around driving improved mix across our businesses.","Michael Cherny","Perfect. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks.","Operator","Our last question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. First thing I'd like to talk about is private label. You called it out in a number of ways in the prepared remarks. It would be really helpful just to level set on a few things as we think about what it means for the model. I wonder if you could size it for us and how big are those businesses for you in Animal Health and Dental? Who are the customer categories, are there really driving the growth? And what is it doing for you at the margin line relative to the rest of the business?","Mark Walchirk","Steve, good questions. I hope you can appreciate that we're probably not going to get into the level of detail that you might like us to and hopefully you can respect that. I mean I think there's a few ways to think about private label. I think first of all, we have a private label business today across both of our segments. So it's not like we're starting from ground zero. But there is certainly an opportunity for us to do a couple of things.","Number one, to improve the penetration of our existing private label portfolio across really our Dental and Animal Health segments; secondly, we're also working aggressively to introduce source and introduce new private label products, so we can expand the portfolio. So what we want to do is we want to increase the penetration with our existing portfolio and then obviously make the pie bigger by expanding our portfolio. And the margin profile for those products is better obviously than the non-private label products.","And I would just also say, we absolutely are committed and focused on the branded consumables products as well and we recognized that those have a crucial \u2013 are crucial part of our portfolio. We expect to continue to carry a broad product line. And as I indicated, our sourcing efforts focused on working with our top 20 manufacturers or so is to ensure that we have the right cost position there.","So I think there are multiple things that we're focused on to help to stabilize margins. Private label is certainly one of them and we see that as a good opportunity. And as I indicated, we're seeing some early signs, some early results across both of our businesses there.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks Mark. The second thing I'd love to touch on in the little time we have left here is actually the DSO space. We're approaching the two-year anniversary of the Heartland win, and there have been comments, since then confirming that you guys want a stepped up approach, trying to go after the DSO space.","I wonder if you could just talk to us about how that progress has evolved over the last year or so. Where you've seen DSO contract wins and how you think you might modify the approach to try to go after that very important segment of the market? Thank you.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thank you. And then we\u2019ll just need to wrap after this. But \u2013 I think it's important, we're not just going after all the DSOs. I think we want to be strategic about the DSOs that we work with. We're very pleased with the relationships that we have and we believe that both parties are bringing good value to each other there.","We obviously see that that's an evolving growing part of the market and we need to have a position there, but we want to do it with those entities that see some value in the overall value proposition from Patterson.","We're investing in that area. We're building the teams to support that space. And we're also making sure that we have kind of an appropriate operating model to support that space to ensure that we can generate a reasonable return. So certainly as we think about continuing to grow the topline and to be part of the overall growth in the segment. That is one of the numbers of things that we are focused on. So thank you for the questions Steve.","End of Q&A","Mark Walchirk","And just really \u2013 as we wrap up here, thank you all again for joining us today. We appreciate it. Sorry for those of you that we didn\u2019t get chance to answer your questions. We look forward to providing another update during our next quarterly earnings call at the end of November. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. And you may now disconnect."],"16825":["Patterson Companies, Inc.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Patterson Companies First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Announcement. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Leslie Nagel. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Leslie Nagel","Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. And thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Gugino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties.","These factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and 2016 first quarter, which exclude the impact of one-time transaction related costs, deal amortization, non-recurring training costs related to our IT initiative, tax costs related to cash repatriation and currency.","Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results and foreign currency impact can be found in this morning's press release.","Today\u2019s earnings announcement and our discussion also reflects the realignment of our reportable segment, which organizes our legacy Veterinary business and recent acquisition into one Animal Health segment, and move certain centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the Dental segment into a separate corporate segment.","Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thank you, Leslie. Welcome everyone to today\u2019s conference call. Our fiscal 2016 first quarter marks the beginning of the transformation of Patterson Companies. Over the past several months our goal is to fundamentally shift the company's long-term growth profile began to take shape and culminated in two transactions, the addition of Animal Health International and the pending sale of Patterson Medical.","I am pleased to say that the thoughtful measured approach we have taken to this transformation has allowed us to stay focus and continue to execute on our plan. We demonstrated this in the 2016 fiscal first quarter.","During the quarter, we began the all important work of starting to unify Animal Health International and our legacy Patterson Veterinary operations. This process has produced some important observations and reconfirmed our conclusions after our due diligence was complete.","In particular, it\u2019s apparent that our organization\u2019s clearly share the qualities that will be absolutely essential for the success. We found a deep commitment to professionalism and delivering an exceptional customer experience.","The leadership team at Animal Health International is collaborative, strategic and results driven, which has helped to make our early integration effort very smooth, and like our team they have a highly motivated sales team that\u2019s driven to succeed. Today, we have a clear integration and synergy roadmap that matches our assumptions at the outset of transaction and we believe we are executing against it.","During the quarter, we held successful national sales meetings for both the companion animal side of the business where we integrated our two sales forces and the production animal side.","Further, we have made significant progress on the cross-selling front. We are already seeing the benefits of the brother product portfolio for the new companion animal sales reps and Patterson Veterinary sales reps to call on mixed practices. Given that we are only two months into the integration process, I am very pleased with our progress and momentum.","During the quarter we also signed a definitive agreement for the sale of Patterson Medical business. While the transaction has not yet closed, the sale will allows us to dedicate our entire focus to the two highly promising end markets we have chosen.","I want to take a moment to extend my gratitude to the management and employees of Patterson Medical. They delivered solid performance in the quarter and we look forward to seeing Patterson Medical thrive under its new owner. We expect the sale of Patterson Medical to close in the second quarter.","In terms of the company\u2019s financial performance during the quarter we came in on plan. Clearly, there are many moving parts to the financial picture as Ann will clarify later. Consolidated revenue from continued operations rose 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 18% to $0.47.","The market fundamentals we have seen for the past several quarters continued in Q1, stable to strengthening market conditions, gradually improving job market and the long-term trend for ever higher global animal protein demands give us confident that we are taking on this transformation at the right time and that it will create both near and long-term growth.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our segments, starting with dental. Dental which represents roughly half of our total sales going forward, consolidated sales performance on a constant currency reflected a number of items. Looking at dental consumables, sales growth excluding the extra week was 3.8% in constant currency. We are confident in our ability to expand this growth.","On the equipment side, you recall that our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was particularly strong and we took full advantage of the heightened demand. Equipment demand soften slightly in the first quarter and during the period we invested in further building our relationships with new core equipment manufacturers and training our sales force.","Of course, our relationship with A-dec remains strategic to our future growth plan, but we're bringing to market a wider range of offerings, including new relationships with company such as Pelton & Crane, the Belmont Co. and the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment this fall.","These along with our existing partners, gives us a great portfolio of products to present to our dental customer as they update their practices. It's important to remember that approximately two-thirds of our equipment sales typically occur in the back half of our fiscal year. We are in the strong position to meet demand we anticipate in the fall and winter buying season.","Patterson remains the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We're excited at the prospects of this broader portfolio of equipment offerings and believe it will stimulate additional growth in quarters to come.","We're certainly pleased with our growth during the quarter and technology-oriented sales and at the same time are very excited as we move into the balance of our year and look forward to the CEREC 30 event coming in September. Over 5000 dental professionals will join us in Las Vegas for this event. We remain confident that dentists continue to see technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes as a critical and high priority area of investment.","We believe that our offerings and the continued healthy conditions of the dental market position us well for continued growth and market share gains. One the additional initiatives we have undertaken to boost our effectiveness in detail, is to restructure our management team.","Paul Guggenheim is now Chief Executive Officer of Patterson Dental, with responsibilities for all North American dental operations. Dave Misiak, formerly Vice President of Sales, now serves as President, U.S. Dental and leads our U.S. Sales, Branch and Technical Service Infrastructure.","John Bettencourt, formerly Vice President of Core Equipment and Technical Service, is focusing purely on our Next Generation Systems initiative as Vice President of NSG and Organizational Change Management. John will report directly to me. His extensive background with Patterson will be critical as he takes on his vital role in assisting our technology transformation over the coming years.","Josh Killian, formerly Vice President of Digital Technologies, is serving as Vice President of Marketing for Technology and Equipment. And Tim Rogan, formerly Vice President of Merchandise, is now Vice President of Strategy and Organizational Effectiveness for Patterson Companies reporting directly to me.","Tim is responsible for driving the companywide strategy process and key strategic initiatives to make the most of the natural synergies that exist between our dental and animal health businesses. These changes are being made to improve our performance and create further development opportunities.","We continue to benefit from a deep management bench and look to build on that strength in the years to come. Overall, our offerings in dental, operational discipline and formidable sales force do advance make us encourage by what we can achieve in this segment over the fiscal year.","Moving on now to Patterson Animal Health. By adding production animal to our revenue mix, we have significantly diversified the market dynamics and growth drivers that will contribute to our success. Like in dental, we are well-positioned today in animal health to more fully capture the opportunities before us. In companion-animal, the trends at both stable to improving market conditions and the rise in pet ownership continue.","Add to this the long-term global acceleration in demand for animal protein and we have now more catalyst for growth and diversified sources of revenue to balance out some of the volatility that can occur.","Animal Health sales were up 48% on a constant currency basis, mainly reflecting the contribution from Animal Health International. While we're just now beginning the process of setting the bar for performance and growth in production animal portion of this segment, we are pleased with the early results produced by Animal Health International. These results were solidly in line with our internal plan and we believe that we are taking share in the production animal market.","Excluding the acquisition, sales rose marginally due to partially offsetting factors. We are pleased with the solid constant currency organic sales growth in the U.S. and stability in the U.S. consumables during the period. However, this growth was offset by a flea and tick season in the UK that was less than tense this year than last, which ultimately provided the tougher comparable.","Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator in this segment. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 15% in local currencies. We continue to make progress in our new relationship with Abaxis, a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers.","As you know, IDEXX adopted the direct sales model starting in January that impacted the entire industry. Patterson is selling the full-line of Abaxis veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing and we are pleased with stability in our Abaxis placements.","All-in-all, we are where we want to be in our Animal Health segment and excited about the prospects ahead.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, the overall financial performance of Patterson Companies came in on plan for the quarter. Of course, we have some added complexity in our results related to a number of items. Therefore, I will be concentrating my remarks on sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to help focus on the transformed Patterson Companies.","It\u2019s helpful to run through the main items that shaped the character of the quarter and the year-over-year comparison. They are as follows. The definitive agreement to sell Patterson Medical resulted in the reclassification of this business segment as a discontinued operation at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year. Accordingly, results from Patterson Medical for the entire quarter have been excluded from our EPS.","The closing our Animal Health International acquisition added a 1.5 month contribution to our Animal Health segment. As I will discuss later in my remarks, the timing of the closing of the acquisition and the sale of Patterson Medical changes the basis for our fiscal 2016 guidance.","Sales for the 2016 quarter include the impact of an additional reach. Where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales within the segment discussion to provide a more normalized view of sales performance.","The extra week added roughly 5 to 6 percentage points of incremental growth for the quarter. Reported results for the quarter reflect tax costs to repatriate about $200 million in foreign cash.","Lastly, my discussions of adjusted EPS exclude deal amortization, deal-related one-time costs, nonrecurring IT training expenses, and the cash repatriation tax costs, I just mentioned.","Now to our top and bottomline, reported consolidated sales from continuing operations totaled $1.1 billion, up 24% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the contribution from recently acquired Animal Health International. Going forward, between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.4%.","On the bottomline, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.47. This excludes $0.10 of earnings per share from the discontinued medical operations and includes 1.5 months of operations from Animal Health International.","Now a look at results in dental. In this segment, my reference to organic sales excludes the impact of the extra week. Organic sales in dental improved about 2% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew 3.8%, which was consistent with the prior three quarters.","As Scott noted, we are excited about the new core equipment offerings we are bringing to market and our technology sales in the quarter, especially demand for CEREC final users. Their sales were up high-single digits in constant currency. But as Scott mentioned, we experienced some softness in overall equipment this quarter, down 1.9% on a constant currency basis.","This reflects some disruptions from adding new manufacturing relationship to our offerings. Due to factors such as time from orders to installations, which can span several months, the extra week has little impact on equipment sales.","Turning next for Animal Health segment. Here references to our organic sales will exclude where relevant the extra week, the contributions from Animal Health International and the impact of the diagnostic manufacture change to Abaxis.","On a constant currency basis, organic sales in the segment were up nearly 2% for the quarter, mainly driven by two factors. First, organic sales from the U.S. companion legacy animal business expanded 5.1%. This, however, was partially offset by a 2.3% decline in constant currency organic sales in the U.K., which faced a tougher comparable this year due to last year\u2019s more intense flea and tick season.","As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the contribution from Animal Health International during the period and they are performing on plan. Sale from Animal Health International were $171.9 million in the quarter. Adding in the contribution of Animal Health International, consolidated reported sales grew 44%. The acquisition contributed about $0.02 of adjusted EPS in the quarter.","Now turning to margins, it\u2019s important to note that excluding the acquisition, Patterson Companies expanded operating margins by 60 basis points during the quarter due in part to leverage from the extra week. When you add in the acquisition, operating margins were largely flat and on plan.","Consolidated gross margin was 25.2%, down 145 basis points in the same period last year, reflecting the acquisition of Animal Health International. Excluding the acquisition, consolidated gross margins expanded by 40 basis points. From an operating leverage standpoint, Patterson Companies gained 145 basis points of leverage on expenses mainly due to the acquisition.","Excluding the acquisition, the business gained 20 basis points of operating leverage. Operating profit including the acquisition increased 20.7%. In Dental, operating margins improved 30 basis points year-over-year.","In the Animal Health segment, we expect operating margins to improve as the year progresses. Operating margin within the Animal Health segment declined 60 basis points, mainly due to two factors. The first is a function of the sales growth in the U.K. reflecting the tougher comp that we discussed. The second is due to a bad debt write-off associated with one large customer in the U.K.","We anticipate full-year operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment. As Scott noted, we are executing on a solid integration and synergy plan and fully expect to achieve between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a three-year period.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss cash repatriation. The acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of the medical business created a unique opportunity to efficiently repatriate excess foreign cash balances.","We are repatriating roughly $200 million in cash from both the Patterson Medical Group and Patterson Dental Canada. Performing all of these repatriations within the same fiscal year will allow us to gain tax efficiencies with estimated tax savings in the range of $15 million to $20 million.","It also allowed us to pay down $100 million on the revolving line of credit that was needed for the Animal Health International acquisition and save on future interest expense. The full cost of the repatriation was recorded as additional income tax expense in the current quarter and is about $12 million. For the full year, we expect a more normalized income tax rate of about 35%.","A few balance sheet and cash flow item, operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter generated $8 million of cash versus $68 million in the prior period. The swing is due to the timing of quarter end and the extra week which increased the accounts payable disbursement between this year\u2019s first quarter and the prior year\u2019s quarter.","We expect to convert 100% of net income in the free cash flow for the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash return on our business investments and growth opportunities. First quarter CapEx totaled $17.1 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative.","For the fall of fiscal 2016 year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy in the full range of options for delivering shareholder value, including share buyback, dividends and additional investments in our businesses.","I\u2019ll wrap up with the discussion of fiscal 2016 guidance. Today, we are updating our guidance to reflect the continuing operation basis on which we now report. Previously we have provided an adjusted earnings guidance range for 2016 of $2.40 and $2.50 per share, a range that was predicated on full year contribution from dental, our legacy veterinary business and Patterson Medical.","As such, this range excluded the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition and the planned sale of medical. Excluding $0.42 to $0.44 per share for the discontinued medical business, Patterson\u2019s prior adjusted guidance on a continuing operations basis would have been $1.98 to $2.06 per share. With these transactions now completed or pending, we are changing the basis for our guidance.","With the June closing of the acquisition, we are now including ten and half months of operations from Animal Health International. So, on a continuing operations basis, our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2016 increases to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. The guidance range assumed stable North American and International market. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016.","Our guidance range excludes transaction related cost, integration expense and dealer amortization, non-recurring IT training cost and cash repatriation. All-in-all, well I know this is a lot to process, we are performing as anticipated and look forward to the balance of the year as a transformed company focused on dental and animal health.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thanks Ann. The success of any transformation really hinges on the commitment, enthusiasm and ambition of those involved. These qualities have to come together right at the outset. I\u2019m deeply proud to say that the employees and leaders of Patterson Companies and Animal Health International have and continue to rise to the occasion and stay focused on success.","Many of you will get the opportunity here from these leaders for transforming Patterson Companies this October. We have scheduled an Analyst Day in New York on October 14. There is more information to come but please mark your calendars.","So far in fiscal 2016, we have achieved some very important early milestones that will be crucial to leveraging the combined strengths of our new organization and accelerating the growth we aim to achieve.","In Dental, the work we are doing to broaden our equipment offerings and enhance our performance, combined with our industry-leading salesforce puts us in a solid position for growth this year.","In our Animal Health segment, our shared experience with the Animal Health International team reaffirms for us that they are the ideal partner with whom to build the comprehensive platform in the production animal industry.","They immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, diversify our revenue mix and expose Patterson to additional highly compelling market opportunities. Their expertise in serving beef, dairy, cattle and swine producers complement the strengths both company share in its companion animal and equine markets.","Operationally, we continue to move forward with our enterprise resource funding initiative. We remain on track for pilot testing of this new system in the fall. Animal Health\u2019s International experience with its own such initiative will be an invaluable resource as we move through pilot towards implementation. We are confident that as we go forward, our concentration on thoughtful integration, everyday execution and organizational effectiveness will bear itself out in our results.","Now with that, we\u2019d like to take your questions. I will turn the call back to Catherine. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our question first from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Scott, just starting off with the Animal Health segment, could you give us a little bit more color as to what\u2019s going on with in both the livestock and companion animal trend? And I guess how much impact did we see from the diagnostics manufacture change this quarter on an apples-to-apples basis and then can you give us more detail on the bad debt write-off in the U.K. that you talked about?","Scott Anderson","Well, I will talk about the first two and then I will have Ann give little more color on the bad debt. We are seeing really good market trends across all segments and more then anything I would say strong execution in our U.S. companion business and with the new production business. A big piece of acquisitions is culture fit and I will tell you as I spend a lot of time with our sales people at both the national sales meeting for our companion group where we put the two sales forces together and then with our new sales reps.","I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the quality of people and really an excitement throughout the organization about the size and scale and scope we have and the ability really to leverage so many different capabilities of Patterson Companies to really increase the experience for customers. And I have also had a chance to talk to some of our key customers about what Patterson brings to the table. So on that I\u2019m excited.","The diagnostic front, I would say we continued to make progress and I\u2019ve said many, many times, this will be long turn game for us. We are absolutely committed to being a major partner for Abaxis in driving those technologies and I would say we are pleased but there is still a long runway ahead and room for improvement on execution on our front and we are right on point on that. I will turn it over to Ann for some color on the bad debt.","Ann Gugino","Okay. Just to quantify, Kevin, you asked for the quantification of the impact of the diagnostic teams. Net, if you pull out the net impact of the diagnostics and the switch, it hurts reported revenue growth by about 5% or 5 percentage points. And then with regard to the bad debt, it was $4 million write-off in U.S. dollars and it reduced the Animal Health segment margins by about 70 basis points. I would say it was with one large customer as I mentioned in my remarks and I would say there weren\u2019t really any huge bad debt swags. The business was never delinquent. They were actually paying where we were deducting directly from their bank accounts.","With that said, anytime you have an expense like this you always take the opportunity to review your processes and controls and improve the more you can. But I would just say all business occur some bad debt expense and in our course of business, it\u2019s just the risk of doing business. But I think the difference in the U.K. Animal Health business is that there is a greater concentration of large customers. So unfortunately, when a customer there defaults, it\u2019s a little more impactful and painful unfortunately.","Kevin Ellich","And then has that situation been rectified or you seeing any other potential issues in the U.K.?","Ann Gugino","Yeah, no -- so that issues have been rectified and it\u2019s a non issue going forward. And I would say that this was pretty isolated and unique about customers. It\u2019s not prevalent across the market in anyway.","Kevin Ellich","Great. And then just one quick one, Scott, on dental. So you mentioned equipment, I think was little soft in the quarter, wondering if you\u2019ve seen any rebound in the equipment business and kind of what we should expect for the year?","Scott Anderson","Yeah. I would say we are very confident about the full year. Our sales force is very excited as we are getting them trained in new products and at the same time, I think we\u2019ve got a great marketing plan with our largest partner, ADAC. I think if you look industry wide and sort of results over the summer time, there was some softness on the core side. But I feel like we really have a lot of potential tail winds behind us including the Section 179 issues that impacted us last year.","I think that will be rectified and then a lot of momentum coming out of CEREC 30. So, I would say we are very cautiously optimistic about the dental equipment scene going forward. And as we\u2019ve always said, there is a correlation between consumable growth and the stability of dental practices with our customers\u2019 willingness to invest and the North American markets are very stable and we are continuing, I think to see some nice tail winds on consumables that we are seeing right now in the summer time months as well.","Kevin Ellich","Great. Sounds good. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Thank you. Now, we will go onto our next caller, Michael Cherny with Evercore.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, guys. Thank you for the details on moving pieces. That being said, I just want to dive in a little bit, understand -- make sure I understand everything. So your guidance range stayed the same, the pure headline numbers. Obviously, you called out the $0.42 to $0.44 on medical. If I\u2019m doing the math, that\u2019s the negative. The positive adjustments are on AHI and then also there is shift into what I believe is a pure cash EPS number. Is there anyway you can give us on the positive side what gets you back to the $2.40, $2.50 number in terms of breaking out AHI versus the other moving pieces.","Ann Gugino","Sure. And you\u2019re right. First of all, I just want to kind of start by backing up and saying, when we originally announced the two transactions, we said that the divestiture of medical and the acquisition of AHI would be neutral to earnings and that really was predicated on the simultaneous closing of the two transactions. So since the closing did not closed simultaneously and they were staggered, that cost hurt us by about $0.05 and $0.06.","So, medical pulled out, hurtful 12 months, that\u2019s the $0.42 to $0.44 and then AHI is only in for about 10.5 months. And I would quantify that net of interest expense and synergies but excluding deal amortization at between $0.36 and $0.39. And then the prior deal amortization is about $0.07. So the way, I would characterize it is that prior deal amortization helped us by $0.07 and then the timing of the transactions hurt us by about $0.05 to $0.06 and you net those two together and yes, you get to the same range.","Operator","Thank you. And Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Just a follow-up on dental equipment. Curious to know if you saw any delay in purchasing ahead of Sirona\u2019s launches their new imaging system, which I believe is coming up in the next several months and if so, any quantification on how that might have impacted equipment results?","Scott Anderson","Yeah. I think there is definitely excitement about the ORTHOPHOS SL project that will come up this fall. It\u2019s hard to quantify any pullback in the market. And I would really say that would be one of a, sort of a net catalyst going forward. All-in, our digital business performed well but not great. And I think there could be some reasoning of some delay because of ORTHOPHOS SL. So as I said to Kevin in the prior question, we really like how things are stacking up as we move into sort of the key selling season.","Nathan Rich","Great. Thanks. And then just a question on guidance. Could you just kind of go through what you\u2019re assuming in terms of both debt pay down and then any share repurchases that you are thinking about for fiscal \u201916?","Ann Gugino","Sure. The proceeds from medical will go directly to pay down the debt and right now we\u2019re anticipating the net proceeds at about $670 million to $680 million. And then the rest we will leave outstanding on the term loan just because it\u2019s a pretty attractive interest rate, I think that leaves around $325 million outstanding under the term loan. The interest expense going forward actually pay that down would be just under 2%, I believe.","And then as far as share repurchases, I think the expectation in the intermediate term would be that we plan to get back into the market as soon as we can. I\u2019m just throwing out the reminder that we\u2019re still technically out of the market in some medical clauses in the second quarter. With respect to guidance that share repurchase isn\u2019t specifically baked in, but I would say, it\u2019s a lever that could help us get to the upper end of the range.","Nathan Rich","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","Robby Napoli","Hi. Good morning, guys. It\u2019s actually Robby in for John. Thanks for taking the question. Just the first one on the Dental business. So how does the margins of the new equipment lines that you\u2019re bringing on compared to the historical lines and are there any special promotion planned as you ramp those throughout the remainder of the year?","Scott Anderson","Yeah. Robby, they would be very consistent with our historical margins and I would say, there would be nothing incremental in terms of marketing expense versus what we\u2019ve historically done.","Robby Napoli","Okay. Thanks. And then, I know, in recent quarters you\u2019ve talked about some performance in larger sales with large customer groups? How had did that trend in the quarter? Did you see any meaningful difference between growths trend, is on the consumable side or equipment side with large versus small practices?","Scott Anderson","Yeah. I would say, our growth was consistent to probably the fourth quarter, but our special market division is very active in the marketplace and we definitely look at that segment as a growth opportunity, not only through the rest of our fiscal year, but beyond. So, I would say, we\u2019re very pleased with the reception we\u2019ve gotten in the market.","Robby Napoli","Great. Thanks very much.","Ann Gugino","Thanks, Robby.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, Scott and Ann. I guess, for me really just a couple of questions on some of the margin trends. I got first, the question that kind of in related, but the first one is, for these the one-time items in the quarter, the transaction related costs, I guess the integration expense, the non-recurring IT training costs. Are those all essentially in your operating expense line or SG&A line and hopefully, none of them were in your COGS? I\u2019m really just trying to figure out whether or not the 25% gross margin as reported in the quarter is kind of a good run rate, just giving all the moving parts? But also if you want to back out some of those one-time items, so you sort of gave us obviously, the net income result, but if you want to pull some of those out of the P&L and the various line? I\u2019m just to make sure exactly where we would pull those out? Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll take that. So, yes, all of those one-time items that we listed are SG&A items. They differ by segments. So I would say a lot of the transaction costs would be pulled out of our corporate operating margin and when you think about that segment operating margin and then the deal amortization would be allocated to the new Animal Health segment, but all lot of the SG&A.","And I think, the gross margins are very -- a pretty good run rate, although, obviously, with the softer equipment sales. I would just point out, when you think about going forward or expecting the equipment growth to accelerate in that mix because there is 30% gross margin on equipment versus say in the 35% range for consumables that 5% delta can sometimes from a mix perspective hurt the gross margin rate. I would just expect the only caution I would give you as you\u2019re moving that run rate forward.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. And now the other quick question to is the -- with your new segment breakdown you had roughly that $10.5 million of corporate expense on the quarter. Now just curious if that\u2019s a good run rate to use going forward or whether there is some one time thing than there is such that might be different run rate on that line?","Ann Gugino","Yes. So, there are some one-time costs in there. And as I mentioned, if you think about that breakout, it\u2019s really the transaction-related cost of the professional fees. I think we labeled it.","Steven Valiquette","That\u2019s really all of it then.","Ann Gugino","Most of it. Yeah.","Steven Valiquette","But that corporate expense theoretically be zero going forward then if there is no sort of point in time to start\u2026","Ann Gugino","No. No, it\u2019s not zero. There is some -- it\u2019s not a 100% of the transaction cost. That was just kind of a rough estimate. I do not have the corporate segment numbers in front of me but what I can tell you is when you look at it, it should increase at about 5% rate on a normalized basis. And I think there is about we\u2019re estimating for the full year to have about $18 million to $20 million of one-time cost hitting that segment.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful.","Ann Gugino","Yeah. But I would tell you it\u2019s not zero for the current quarter.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. All right. That\u2019s great. We can follow-up maybe a bit more offline, probably little too granular for the earnings call. Okay. All right. Thanks.","Ann Gugino","I just don\u2019t have all the detail in front of me. So, yes I\u2019ll give you a call.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll continue onto Jon Block with Stifel.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys and good morning. A lot of moving parts, so maybe just one, your dental seem to have some more statements should add a consumables in other, and I think that falls last year\u2019s add a consumables in equipment when you should have reclassified some of the hand pieces. I know these adjustments are being made, I believe to both periods. But I guess, there are two questions. One, are we done there with the moving parts within dental and then two is it all aiding the consumable reported growth rate because you are essentially just lowering the base or am I not thinking about that correctly?","Ann Gugino","Yeah. Jonathan, first it\u2019s really office supply that we reclassified out of consumables and into other and we restated the prior year to answer your question. Yes, we are done. We don\u2019t anticipate having any more moving pieces. I do not believe that it aided consumables growth in any way, it\u2019s just too small to really move the number.","Scott Anderson","Yes. I think it just gives you more consistent look for the industry that really we\u2019re normalizing how most people would classify the consumables category.","Jon Block","Got it. Perfect. And then Scott, you went down the road a little bit earlier on dental equipment. I guess that at least relative to our estimates is where some of the weakness was. But, was there just a little bit more disruption with the manufacturer specific to the quarter? And do you believe you are fully through that and guys are trained on all options out there?","And sort of the last question, I think the last quarter you said, do you expect the equipment to accelerate from fiscal '15\u2019s call it 3%, 4% range. Is that still intact even with the 1Q numbers now in place? Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Yes. I would say absolutely. As a reminder, the Q1 is the lowest volume quarter. I would say from the macro tailwinds of consumable business strengthening, job market improving, really interesting a year ago calendar fourth quarter, our third quarter with the Section 179 effect. And then increased portfolio, I would tell you we are very comfortable with the back half of the year, it could be particularly strong.","And as a reminder and I had said in my opening remarks, two-thirds of our equipment is sold in the last two quarters. So I wouldn\u2019t say we are changing our story at all on dental equipment. And it potentially could be a upside improvement to the business if we outperform.","Jon Block","Perfect. Thanks, guys. Ann, we'll bother you offline for some of the details. Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Sounds good.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll now hear from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert Willoughby","Thanks. Scott, do you have any plans for that call little office supply business? Is that something you'll hold onto? Or is there value in parting with that? And then just secondarily, more broadly, you haven\u2019t commented on M&A in this call still in the cards for you going forward?","Scott Anderson","I would say on office supply business, it\u2019s a strong cash flow business. It\u2019s a nice part of our value proposition. And I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we would look to divest that. On the M&A front, I would say we are going to take a little short-term breather here. Obviously, we\u2019ve digested a lot. But I would say from a balance sheet perspective, our ability to act on really good smart strategic acquisitions is absolutely there for us.","So our roadmap is still in place. I would say sitting here today with 95% plus of our profit coming from North America, I think it positions us in the short term very well, but also speaks to our growth opportunities as the company over the next decades if and when we expand in these two verticals internationally.","Robert Willoughby","Good. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Anderson for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott Anderson","Thank you, Catherine. And thanks for joining us today. Again, the transformation of Patterson is off to an excellent start. And we really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Analyst Day in New York and giving you a deeper look into the company. And we also look forward to updating you in 90 days out as to our progress. Thanks for your time this morning.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded February 21, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to you, Jeff Lichner, with Patterson Companies. Please go ahead.","Jeff Lichner","Thank you, Alisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you participating in Patterson Companies Fiscal Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me in the room today are Scott Anderson, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Armstrong, our Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","But before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to review this material. Also, since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for fiscal 2013 in our press release earlier this morning.","Be advised that this call is being taped and will be available for replay starting today at 11 a.m. Central Time until 1 week from today. To access the replay, please dial (303) 590-3030 and provide the conference ID number 4594665 when prompted.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thank you, Jeff, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. Steve and I are in Chicago where we will be attending the Chicago Midwinter Meeting over the next couple of days.","Overall, we were pleased with Patterson's performance in the third quarter, as our markets continued to stabilize. Financial results were in line with our expectations. Not only did we see more than a 2% year-over-year growth in sales despite what continues to be a challenging worldwide economic environment, but that growth lapped a particularly strong performance in the third quarter of last year. Yet, we are confident we will do even better and take full advantage of our growth opportunities as we see further economic recovery.","As I will review in the next few minutes, we saw improvement across all of our businesses, especially in Patterson Dental and Patterson Veterinary. We continue to make internal investments to position the company for long-term competitive advantage. These investments are critical to reinforce our leadership position in Patterson's chosen markets, as we respond to shifting demographics and market dynamics.","Patterson Dental, our largest business, reported sales of $626.5 million, which was up 3.5% from the prior year on a reported basis. Within this unit, the key driver was double-digit growth in our digital equipment categories.","Within our technology categories, which are benefiting from the ongoing trend to the digitization of dentistry, sales of CEREC systems and digital radiography products were strong during the quarter. As you remember, sale of Sirona's industry-leading CEREC Omnicam system, an innovative 3D CAD\/CAM camera for dentists had been constrained in the second quarter due to product availability issues we outlined in our last conference call. In short, demand for this next-generation system outstripped product availability last quarter. However, third quarter sales for this product were robust, as Sirona fulfilled their delivery commitments.","Consumable sales, which consists primarily of disposable dental items and office supplies, were up modestly from prior year levels. When you take into account the 2 few -- fewer selling days in this year's fiscal third quarter, as we stated in the past, the consumable market is stable. But until we see an improvement in employment and a boost in consumer confidence, sales levels lack a catalyst to return to historic industry growth rates.","Sales of basic dental equipment, including chairs, units, cabinetry and lighting, were down slightly from the prior year. Dentists remain cautious about expanding or remodeling their practice in this uncertain economic environment. While we continue to work with our customers on investments in their basic operations infrastructure, sales growth in this category faces the same economic headwinds as consumables. As the market for basic infrastructure stabilizes and begins to grow, we will be there with our industry-leading offerings to assist dentists in achieving greater efficiencies for their practices. We believe that we are well positioned with our complete sales and service offering to support the modern dentist's office.","We were very pleased with the third quarter performance of our veterinary unit, which currently constitutes approximately 20% of Patterson Companies. The veterinary division grew over 9% in the period. This is adjusted for 2 factors: 2 fewer selling days in the quarter and the continued effect from the change in the nutritional products distribution agreement that we made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. They also expanded their operating margin by over 100 basis points during the third quarter, which is typically the slowest selling season for this market.","Most noteworthy during the quarter is that we re-branded Webster Veterinary Supply to Patterson Veterinary Supply effective January 1 of this year. With this name change, we are now able to leverage the Patterson brand across all 3 of our businesses. By doing so, we are enhancing our visibility and position in the U.S. companion pet veterinary market. We believe closer public identification with Patterson will also facilitate our marketing initiatives in this growing sector.","We are already seeing the benefits. At the recent North American Veterinary Conference in Orlando, we had a very strong showing, with increased booth traffic and interest. This show was a great opportunity to interact with our customers in a way that demonstrates our commitment to technology and innovation.","Earlier this quarter, Patterson Veterinary acquired the assets of Universal Vaporizer Support based in Foster City, California. UVS provides cleaning and calibration services for a variety of anesthetic vaporizers used in veterinary medicine. In combining our operations, we plan to expand our current vaporizer service to include more models and additional factory-trained expertise in the area of vaporizer maintenance. We are now able to address this very important aspect of modern veterinary clinic management. This is another extension of the value-added service offerings that we provide to our customers.","Patterson Veterinary has been one of our growth engines in recent years, and we are confident its positive trajectory will continue well into the future. We look forward to the growth opportunities that will come from our industry-leading sales and service model in the veterinary business.  We are committed to building our equipment and technical service strategy to capture market share, as veterinarians expand their practice capabilities to meet increased pet owner expectations. We believe we can continue to reshape the market as Patterson redefines the industry sales model.","Turning to Patterson Medical. Our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit constituted approximately 15% of Patterson Companies' sales and was down slightly from prior year levels. Sales were essentially in line with our internal forecast for the third quarter, and performance continues to be hampered by health care reform uncertainty and global economic malaise. Although this situation is likely to persist in the short term, we believe Patterson Medical is well positioned to leverage its technology and portfolio of value-added products to capture future growth.  Long-term demographic trends make rehabilitation services and products an attractive market to be in.","Earlier this month, we announced the resignation of Dave Sproat as President of Patterson Medical. As we outlined in the announcement, I will assume the leadership of the medical business on an interim basis until a successor is named. The process to identify the new president of Patterson Medical has already begun, and we look to fill the position in the first half of the upcoming fiscal year.","I want to personally thank Dave for his 16 years of service to Patterson but most importantly, for building a very capable team at Patterson Medical and a business with a reputation as the world's leading distributor of rehabilitation and sports medicine products. We look forward to continuing to work with Dave, as he joins Young Innovations, one of our dental suppliers.","Finally, as we stated in this morning's release, we are maintaining our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.06 per diluted share. I said at the outset of this call that while we were pleased with this quarter's performance especially in light of the comparison with last year's strong results, we are not satisfied. We believe we can do better. We will continue to make internal investments designed to further strengthen both our competitive position and long-term performance.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Armstrong to review the financial highlights from our third quarter results. Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. As a backdrop to our performance and as Scott noted, all Patterson Companies business lines in the fiscal 2013 third quarter were affected by 2 fewer days in the selling period due to our fiscal calendar and the timing of holidays. This was most notable in the consumable categories with an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact on a comparable basis to the year-ago results. We also were affected by the disruption of Hurricane Sandy. In addition, the change in the distribution agreement for a line of nutritional products in our veterinary unit reduced consolidated sales by 130 basis points in the quarter. This change, which will continue to affect our sales volumes through mid-March, has had minimal impact on our operating profit, since we now sell this product under a national agency commission arrangement.","Even with these factors, reported sales rose 2.3% on a consolidated basis. This includes a combined benefit of slightly less than 1% from foreign currency and acquisitions. We were pleased to see a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in our consolidated gross margin for the third quarter due to a better mix of product sales.","In the dental division, the mix of CEREC revenue shifted to a much higher proportion of new user sales of the Omnicam product. Additionally, veterinary margins were up approximately 160 basis points, due primarily to product mix and vendor rebates.","Operating expenses rose 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue from last year. The increase reflects continued investments to support our growth initiatives.","By segment, our third quarter operating margins were 10.5% for dental, 5.7% for veterinary and 11.9% for medical.","As I have mentioned in previous quarters, our effective tax rate has been favorably impacted by the dividends paid on the Patterson shares owned by our ESOP. As the dividend increases, our tax rate has declined further. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34.4%, down by approximately 1.5 percentage point on a year-over-year basis.","A review of our balance sheet shows that inventory levels increased by approximately $33 million from the start of the fiscal year. The growth in inventories resulted from normal seasonal fluctuations during the quarter. Our DSO stands at 42 days in the current period, down from 44 days in the prior year period, while inventory turns are 7.1 compared to 6.6 one year ago.","Our cash flow from operations in the quarter was impacted by the increase in inventory, as well as the timing of tax payments. We generated $46 million from operations in the period compared to $110 million last year. I would expect a good portion of this working capital swing to turn by the end of the fiscal year.","Our CapEx in the third quarter principally included regular ongoing expenditures in addition to investments in our IT infrastructure. We are still anticipating fiscal 2013 CapEx of approximately $25 million.","Also in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million Patterson shares under our 25 million share buyback authorization that expires in 2016. Approximately 7 million shares remain available for purchase under this authorization. We will continue to make open-market purchases as part of the capital allocation strategy that we have outlined. Unless the markets change dramatically, I would expect future purchases of shares to remain consistent with our past few quarters.","With that, I'll turn it back to Scott with some closing comment. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thanks, Steve. As we move towards wrapping up fiscal 2013, entering a new fiscal year and looking beyond, I want to emphasize why we are confident about our future. I believe we are well positioned to capture market share as the economy rebounds and starts to recover and reach pre-2008 levels. The economic headwinds of the past 5 years have constrained consumer spending as well as capital investments by our customers, leading to pent-up demand. Coupled with this pent-up demand is the demographic shift that we continue to see as well as the emergence of new technologies. Combined, these factors present growth opportunities for Patterson Companies as we have built the size and scale to serve customers across our 3 markets. Our competitive strengths is buoyed by our market-leading product and service offering, as exemplified by our strong partnerships and supported by our state-of-the-art technology center. Patterson's complete end-to-end solution uniquely positions us to extend our leadership position. And importantly, it enables our customers to provide outstanding service to their patients and pet owners.","We also maintain a strong financial position, and we are committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value through targeted investments, dividend growth and strategic share repurchases. In short, there are many reasons to be excited about Patterson Companies and our future success.","With that, I'd like to open up the call to questions. Alicia, please open up the calls.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, on the dental side. Scott, could you give us a general outlook for Omnicam demand? Obviously, it's been pretty good and Sirona has indicated the supply has now caught up to the demand. Are you expecting strong growth in that segment for the next couple of quarters? Or what should we expect?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Kevin. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're very excited about Omnicam. But I would also maybe reframe as we are very excited about the entire CAD\/CAM opportunity and the portfolio of choices we have for our customers. And we believe with our partner Sirona, we offer more entry points and different modalities for customers to implement CAD\/CAM. Obviously, this last quarter was very strong. We had strong demand, and Sirona absolutely met their commitments to us. But at the same time, I think it's worth noting that in terms of our sales infrastructure and our training infrastructure, that became really fully in place in late January. So we look at this space, both CAD\/CAM and digital, as having a very long runway for growth.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. Then also you mentioned in your prepared remarks that basic dental equipment was slightly down. I think that's kind of what the trend has been like. Do we have any more visibility? Or is there light at the end of the tunnel in terms of seeing an inflection point when you can see the consumable and the basic equipment sales come back?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. I think one thing that's important to note is we came off a pretty strong quarter last year. So while we were slightly down, it was pretty significant volume. We don't want to call it turnaround, but we are encouraged by our pipeline on the basic equipment side going into the fourth quarter. And we really think we have a unique story coupled with the leading-edge technologies we present and really strong partnerships with industry leaders like A-dec, that we'll continue to take share and are excited to really tap into that opportunity in the years to come.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just switching over to vet really quick. Steve, I think you made the comments on the nutritional product change. Did you say that, that annualizes mid-March?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, it could be about mid-March of this year when that arrangement changes over.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Got it. And then of the margin improvement that you saw in the vet business, how much of that was attributed to mix versus, I guess, vendor rebates?","R. Stephen Armstrong","It was a combination, Kevin, round numbers in relative terms, probably 50-50 rebates and then product mix, equal portions.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then last kind of big picture, more for Scott. In the vet space, given the diagnostic distribution agreement changes that we've seen in the business, just curious if you've given any more thought to kind of expanding your offerings and the ability of your salespeople to sell other products as well.","Scott P. Anderson","I'd say, Kevin, we are very excited about our relationship with IDEXX at this point. We think they've got cutting-edge products that really help our customers build their practices and help the pet owners. So at this time, I would just reiterate our excitement about our partnership with IDEXX.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Do you think it puts you at a disadvantage by not being able to sell the other products?","Scott P. Anderson","I don't think so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Scott, you talked about the pent-up demand, and I was wondering if you've looked historically around consumer confidence and the -- what consumer confidence impact has on a practice's willingness to think about to buy equipment, et cetera. So if I look at consumer confidence, that continues to fall. As you're talking to these dentists, does that have a big impact on how they think about buying equipment, would be my first question. And then secondly, in the quarter, did you see any pull-forward due to tax incentives in 2012 or the device tax coming in '13 around sales that you saw in the quarter?","Scott P. Anderson","I'll answer the last part first, Lisa, and then we'll talk about consumer confidence. Obviously, we were very pleased with the demand on the equipment side at the end of the calendar year. As we've talked about in the second quarter, a lot of decisions are made post sitting down with financial advisers. And we saw robust sales as we talked about particularly around our digital category, so strong Schick sales, strong 3D sales, obviously coupled with CEREC. I would say the med device tax probably had less impact than the uncertainty around Section 179 at the end of the year. Obviously, we were very pleased that Section 179 was extended for 2 years after the first of the year. But based on what we've seen in January and starting off into our quarter, we would not say that, that business was pulled forward and would create a backwash in the coming quarter. And then secondly around consumer confidence. The dental industry is very stable right now. Our customers for the most part, their practices are in strong financial position. But as we said in the past, part of the cautious outlook really has been around major expansions and remodels of their dental practices. As we've proven, the strong return on investment of technology products has resonated with our customers. So we see, as the market continues to grow again, the ability for the basic equipment market to return to pre-2008 levels is complementary to growing technology sales.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And are you seeing the demand? I mean, obviously, you're at the Midwinter Meeting right now. Are you seeing -- when you talk about that pipeline, can you give us any kind of idea of over what period of time that you think you can return to those pre-2008 levels? Is that in the next 12 to 24 months? Or do you think it's a longer period of time just given the economic uncertainty?","Scott P. Anderson","I wish I was that good of a prognosticator. I think we'll continue to see stability. And obviously, different things are going to need to happen in the economy for it to return back to 2008 levels. But I would just reiterate how excited we are, both about the technology story we have when we sit down with customers, but also when you look at the demand for dentistry and for the veterinarians' practice and for rehab over the coming decade. As this demographic shift happens, we will be there to help our customers meet that demand for their services.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Scott, I'm sure you don't want to give guidance yet for fiscal '14. But maybe broadly, can you tell us some of the key things you're thinking about, what are the puts and takes? And do you think with that kind of a stable macro environment, you'll be able to deliver improved earnings growth versus what you're seeing in fiscal '13?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. We've talked about before, part of our story comes down to revenue and really to see operating leverage expansion. We need growth north of 3%. But at the same time, as we've talked about, we are making investments to position this company for the future, and it's something I'm strongly committed to. So obviously, we won't give guidance today. But as we look at the stability of our markets, we probably go into next fiscal year for the first time in a while with slightly more headwinds than tailwinds out there. But as we've seen over the last 3 years, particularly in the summer months, there's been a lot of unpredictability in the economy in the underlying markets.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That's helpful. A question now about calendar '13 and the impact that the med tech tax is having, particularly on your revenue growth. Now that we're moving through '13, what percentage of your revenues are being impacted? And is that having any bottom line impact as far as you can see?","R. Stephen Armstrong","John, this is Steve. At this point, it's really hard to say what the med tax is going to do to overall revenues. We did some early studies, we only saw it for basically 3.5, 4 weeks of January, so it's a little difficult to say what its impact is going to be over the calendar year. But dental is obviously the division that's going to be most impacted by it, and we're estimating somewhere around 75% to 80% of revenues will be impacted by the med device tax. It won't have really any effect on the bottom line. As expected today, it could. It really just depends on how the total cost of operations goes and what kind of costs of manufacturing are passing on, and how the markets are receptive to those costs.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then lastly within the rehab business, do you have a time line yet for getting a permanent replacement for Dave?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. I said we'll probably look to the first half of our fiscal year. We're fortunate to have strong internal candidates in our organization, as well as some nice interest from the outside. We have a very capable team in place in terms of the vice presidents who run that business. And I feel confident that we can deliver in the short term while we look for a replacement for David. So I would anticipate probably early summer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott or Steve, you had something of a CAD\/CAM backlog at the end of the second quarter. How much of that did you get through? Is much of that sitting out there? Or did you blow through all that in terms of delivering the orders?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think we -- probably the best way to put it, Bob, was Sirona met the commitment. So we definitely had plenty of demand for the product and look at really demand for that product being at a fairly high level for the foreseeable future. So I don't want to make the statement that we emptied out the demand just in one quarter. That's not even close to being true.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And you did mention, Scott, some targeting -- targeted marketing, was just a comment, I think, that you threw into the discussion. Is there any promotion going on at the moment? Or is that selling at full list price, the Omnicam?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, full list price, Bob. So definite excitement in the product. And I think the other thing to note that I said in a previous question was the fact that we really met the demand, the early demand of the product launch. But we are just starting really in the last 3 weeks of actively getting out and showing the product to dentists in North America. So we really are at, in essence, the executional beginning of the launch of Omnicam in terms of face-to-face demos with customers.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe bigger picture just on the vet business. I've attempted to redefine the equity research effort here quite a few times at no great return, unfortunately. But what does redefining the vet sales effort mean to your sales and profit outlook here near term? And what -- do you really think you're in on that -- with this effort?","Scott P. Anderson","Good question, Bob. One of the things we are doing at Patterson Veterinary is we're really trying to refocus our sales force in a very similar fashion that happened in the dental business 20 years, to be more than just consumable sales people and to really look at being a partner in helping the veterinarian grow their practice. And obviously, equipment and technology is a big piece of that. We saw a need 2 years ago for our veterinarian customers to look to us as a service provider in terms of technical service. So in this last year, we set off on that initiative. By the end of the fiscal year, we will have national coverage. And part of this is retraining our sales force to be more than just gatherers in terms of equipment sales, to really go out and proactively make markets. So to me, we're in probably the first or second inning of that. But I'm excited at the progress I see. As I said in the comments at the NAVC meeting, I think if you walked up to our booth and saw the way we present technology and talk to our customers, it's very different than what you would have saw if you went into the Webster booth 2 years ago.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And what does that ultimately mean for margins of the business then? Does this -- do they move up?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, it's definitely part of the strategy to create a more margin-rich portfolio in terms of our products because of the higher margins we will get on the equipment side, as well as on the technical service side. So as we talk about our long-term goals of getting operating margins and our veterinary unit up into the high single digits, this is an important part of that strategy.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And lastly, just the time frame for that, Scott, potentially?","Scott P. Anderson","We're making great progress. Patterson vet is exceeding our internal forecast this year, and I think you'll continue to see momentum over the next 2 to 3 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, on the medical business, in the press release, you seemed to cite uncertainty of health care reform and continued austerity measures. Could you give us a sense for maybe what could turn those sales around? I mean, in the dental business, you clearly think it's consumer sentiment, maybe it's unemployment. How should we think about that medical business returning to growth? And if you could give us a split between international and domestic, that'd be helpful.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, great question. Glen, I think the bright spot in our rehab business is if you look at our core business, which really is the North American rehab business, that business is growing low single digits in a market that we think is maybe down 2% to 3% right now. So about 50% of the revenues is that core rehab space. Then we have sports medicine in the U.S. Our international business is roughly 20-plus percent of revenues. And as we've talked about, that's been a challenged market, particularly in the U.K. as austerity measures have been implemented. So the 2 drags on that business in the last 12 months have been international operations, primarily around the U.K., and then a pretty soft equipment market in the U.S. But if you look at just core rehab supplies, we actually feel pretty confident about where we're at. So the catalysts for turning this around are adjusting our market approach internationally, which we are doing right now to take advantage of what still will be strong demand for those services, and then really getting the equipment pipeline built up again here in the U.S. As our customers, now that the Affordable Health Care Act is law, the rules of the road are being more well understood, they'll start moving ahead on making capital purchases.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Scott, maybe if I could just follow up on Bob's question on margins. I mean, for those of us who have followed the company for a while, I mean, the company has always had a historical goal of expanding margins consistently year-over-year and you've kind of defined that differently throughout the years. But as I look over the last kind of 5 or 6, margins have consistently trended down, and maybe, obviously, slower utilization has played a part in that. Obviously, mix probably has played a part in that. But could you maybe opine on maybe what's led to some of the margin contraction over the past couple of years and then maybe your plan over the next kind of 2 or 3 to return to some consolidated margin expansion?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. Good question, Glen. And I think you sort of hit 2 of the big points. One has been mix. Obviously, the veterinary business with the lowest operating margin has been our fastest grower. But also part of our story is a revenue story. We are very proud that we have industry-leading profitability and have made the strategic decision to really not cut in to our value-added proposition here in the short term because we do believe our markets will recover. And when revenue growth returns above that 3% to 4% level, our ability to expand margins is quite significant. So we have not stopped in terms of investments. We're putting money right now into IT infrastructure and other things that we feel will position us in a very strong way going forward. We always are looking for ways to become more efficient, so we can get more profitability out of each sales dollar, where we can help our sales reps become more productive. I will tell you that we are, as a management team, absolutely aligned with our shareholders in terms of our incentives that profitable revenue growth is -- and return on invested capital is the goal of Patterson Companies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Maybe just the first one on vet. The adjusted numbers were solid. And I think once you adjust for nutritional, you approached about 10% internal. But it still lagged some of the other -- your 2 other main competitors in North America. Maybe can you speak, do you think you're holding share? I know there's a lot of noise in the numbers, but do you think you're holding share in vet? And then the second part of the question would be, again, the numbers are strong, so can you talk to how the market growth looks for vet currently and going forward?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. On the first part, I think from a comparable basis, we're a November, December, January quarter, which affects comparability, I think, on the vet side a little bit more just because the flea and tick business is probably the weakest in that January month. We were up 12% in our last quarter. And when we look on an apples-to-apples basis, we are absolute confident we are holding our own and putting plans in place to take market into the future. We feel really good about the vet industry, about the underlying growth characteristics. I would say anecdotally the mood of our customers at the last 2 large shows in Las Vegas this week and in Orlando at NAVC was exciting to talk to customers and have them talk about the future of their practices. And we think the way the population takes care of their pets will be a tailwind for the entire industry for the decade to come. So we see continued nice underlying growth dynamics for the vet industry.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe one on rehab and one on dental. On the rehab side, to the previous question you did a very helpful job of sort of breaking out what was austerity, if you would, versus some uncertainty. But can you tell us too when you would sort of lap some of the issues in the U.K., in other words when the specific U.K. comps ease? And would that mean that you\u2019d -\u2013 it\u2019s possible you restore growth in medical when we get out to fiscal '14?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I think the U.K. and international markets are still going to be challenged here for the foreseeable future, just because there was such a massive change in terms of rehab delivery that has happened. On the other side, I think we'll start to see a rebound on the equipment side in the U.S. business. And we are absolutely committed to this business, and we get very excited about the demand characteristics. And the market is being reshaped a little bit right now, but we're 4x to 5x larger than our nearest competitor. And we think we're nimble enough to position Patterson Medical in a way where we can be big winners in the future in this space.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last one just quickly on dental consumables. Your consumer confidence remains choppy. But if you isolate private job growth, it's actually been decent, if you would, especially over the past 4 to 6 months. And arguably, that would be some sort of a leading indicator for consumable growth, which should lag. So can you talk to what maybe the disconnect is? Maybe if you isolate the past month, have you seen a pickup? Or do you just think that maybe consumer confidence is an even more important variable when you sort of stack it up versus that of private job growth?","Scott P. Anderson","You still have a lot of moving parts. I think we're still dealing with underemployment problem as well, which is going to affect -- I would say we're cautiously optimistic about the consumable market. And I absolutely can state that it is a stable market and will continue to grow in the year ahead. But as I said, there really isn't -- I don't think we will see a catalyst that will create a sharp turn in the trajectory of the industry here in the next 12 months. But it definitely, we believe, will be a market that grows, albeit slow growth in the coming year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Stephan calling for Bob. Just to stay on consumer. Could you, I guess, expand a little bit on the trajectory, so throughout the quarter, so January versus December and November? And also on the guidance range for fourth quarter, it seems a bit wide. Anything we should be thinking about there, some of the pushes and pulls?","Scott P. Anderson","Stephan, was the question about the consumable trajectory?","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, just how December, January look versus the other 2 months.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. We did have an interesting quarter. And I think it's fair to say the entire industry did, with the fact that we had Hurricane Sandy shut down the East Coast for some time. And then we sort of had a unique holiday situation this year. So I would say taking those 2 factors out, the trajectory of sales was pretty stable throughout the quarter. I'll turn it over to Steve on the guidance question.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes. I'd just add maybe one comment to Scott's. There may have been some elevated activity in December just as people were thinking about the medical device tax on consumables and whether they were buying ahead. But it was a bit of an usual December, but nothing, as Scott said, that really laid any patterns, as far as we were concerned. As far as the guidance, we probably could have tightened the range, Stephan. We left it where it was. We typically ramp it -- ratchet -- I'm sorry, ratchet it down as we get later in the year. But since we've done that at the end of the second quarter, we really didn't see any need to do it further at this point. We are very comfortable with the range as it exists today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So Steve, maybe just one quick housekeeping question. You talked about the -- a little less than 1% from M&A and FX. Would it be possible to break it down between the 2?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes. I think they were both about 30 basis points, Michael.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then seeing big picture, I know you had mentioned the fact that you view kind of more headwinds than tailwinds for next year. Going to 2014 with the advent of the exchanges and implementation of ACA, it seems like there should be some incremental benefit related to the dental from increased coverage. Have you guys thought about what that impact could be on your business yet and what the drivers could be in terms of the potential for upside of growth? Or is it still too early to understand that?","Scott P. Anderson","Probably too early to understand that, but maybe I need to clarify my comments. We believe there are potentially more tailwinds than headwinds going into next year. So that's an important clarification there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So Steve, one question on consumables, and I think we're all sticking around here trying to just make sure things are stable. And Scott, I appreciate your comments that the market is very stable here. And [indiscernible] being put in kind of that bucket of being one of the bigger goals on dental in general out there. But even as I look at these numbers for you and for some of your competitors and some of the manufacturers this quarter, it's hard enough to feel like maybe the consumable markets slowed again this quarter, maybe very slightly but slightly this quarter, slightly last quarter, and we're definitely not at that 2% to 3% range we were late '10 through early '12 or so. So what really gives you the confidence? I mean, Steve, can you break it down even kind of a day's selling rate? Has that stayed pretty stable for you? Just looking for anything to kind of help here.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Jeff, I think there's some moving parts underneath that, that make it difficult on a comparable basis. I think I would tend to agree with you that from where it was maybe late '11, early '12 to where we are today, the market seems to have slowed. But as Scott jotted a note here, reminding me that last year's winter probably was very unusual across the entire country, and there might have been a bit of a false positive that maybe the market was moving higher than it was just because you had 2 fairly different periods, as far as traffic in and out of the dental office. But if you kind of adjust for Hurricane Sandy and some of the other noise in the last few quarters, I think it's probably fairly stable right now and it's probably in that 1% to 2% range, as far as underlying market is concerned. Really hasn't changed a lot for the last 15, 18 months.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And then, Scott, I guess just a bigger picture question on the dental equipment business especially as it pertains to CAD\/CAM and CEREC and what have you. As new products roll out here over the coming month or 2, and maybe we see kind of a multitiered pricing structure for CEREC and for CAD\/CAM in general. How many price points do you think are going to settle out here. We did a span all the way up from 1 36 9 [ph] for Omnicam. Are there going to be 5 or 6 different kind of iterations of things you can put together with different milling chambers versus different acquisition units all the way down to a $10,000 or $12,000 stand-alone digital impression system?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Jeffrey. Great question. We think with our partner Sirona, we'll be able to offer multiple entry points in terms of price, but also with price comes functionality. And what we're excited about, and we've been a leader in this CAD\/CAM space for a decade now, is there still is such a strong return for the chair side CAD\/CAM product, particularly vary at the top end of the Omnicam. And we've had multiple other products to offer here in the last few years at lower price points. But generally, the return on the investment had always come out the highest when you put the top product with a one-visit dentistry chair side application together with it. I think from a competitive standpoint, one of the things we love about Sirona is their commitment to research and development. And we're very excited about how deep the pipeline is. And as I've said many times, we're in the early innings of this digitization CAD\/CAM game, and we're excited to go to the market with multiple options for our customers.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any thoughts -- this is my last question, I promise. Any thoughts, Scott, if 4 or 5 different price points on even a Sirona branded system, so you could tout their name, obviously, their repetition, but have 4, 5 or 6 different price points there. Any thoughts on how to think about where kind of -- or where demand for the highest of high end of those versus what percent may fall into some of the 100,000, sub-100,000 type price categories?","Scott P. Anderson","I think it's too early to make a prediction on where the market settles out. But just to remind everyone, we have roughly 14,000 CEREC users in North America. So the runway is extremely long for this technology. And as I said, I think you have to focus more on the patient benefit and the return to the practitioner in terms, both clinically and economically, as to who the big winners will be at the end of the day. But the ability to offer multiple modalities, I think, is a great strategic advantage for Patterson and Sirona.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Anderson for any final remarks.","Scott P.

Welcome everyone to today's conference call. It's been nearly one year since we completed the combination of portfolio changes that have led to the more aligned and focused Patterson Companies that we have today. The same boldness that led to broadening our view of our end markets and reshaping our business is now driving a renewed and intensified effort to look deeply at every aspect of our operations.","We are striving to ensure that we are serving our customers with maximum effectiveness, anticipating and capitalizing on changes in our industry, and running our business with optimal efficiency. This is the enterprise-wide mindset at Patterson today, and it is carrying us forward into fiscal 2017. Ensuring that our go-to-market approach is best aligned with and anticipates changes in the market will be a centerpiece of our growth efforts, I\u2019d like to share some perspective on how that is playing out, especially in our Dental business.","Patterson Dental has been the market leader in transforming the customer experience. Through the years, we have implemented multiple initiatives that improve the lives of our customers and employees. Our early leadership in e-commerce helped evolve the Patterson sales force to a truly value-added business partner. Today, our customers are ever more technology focused, relying on a combination of e-commerce and high touch, call it consultative sales support to accommodate their needs and desired purchasing patterns. This means a significant opportunity for Patterson, and we intend to be at the forefront of this change.","We have been laying the foundation for several quarters, and during the first quarter, we once again began the process of transforming the market with the realignment of our field sales force in our Dental division. For some time, we have underscored our clear strengths and market leadership in technology and equipment sales. We have made clear the importance of our enterprise resource planning initiative, and we have committed to obtaining the necessary talent and skill sets needed to enhance our competitiveness. All of these efforts are components of a larger strategy to modernize and optimize our go-to-market strategy for a successful future.","Our new ERP system will provide the backbone and toolsets for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform designed to accommodate the evolving buying patterns of our customers. You likely saw that we recently made a strategic hire in Todd Marshall who joined us from Target Corporation as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer. Todd is responsible for further building out our enterprise-wide marketing and e-commerce platforms. He is leading our efforts to enhance our digital roadmap and strategy. Todd will also be responsible for taking the business intelligence gained from our new systems and help shape the customer experience across our businesses. We welcome Todd to our team.","The realignment of our sales force leverages our strongest performers and broadens their responsibilities. Our goal of this initiative is to generate higher productivity per salesperson and deeper market penetration. But most importantly, it is to deliver our customers the sales experience they increasingly need. While creating more opportunity for our best-in-class sales force, it also allows us to increase investment in our technical service capabilities.","We believe that enhancing our go-to-market strategy in Dental will not only address the changing marketplace and customer but plays directly to Patterson\u2019s strengths. Our passion for customers\u2019 success is unwavering. We are committed to serving customers with the best sales, technical service, and customer service expertise. Combined with an evolving best-in-class digital experience, we are excited to serve the needs of all types of dental professionals.","Now some perspective on our markets and overall performance. Our first quarter results reflect a combination of general stability in our markets, Patterson strengths, and our willingness to make the short-term sacrifices to capture long-term opportunities. During the quarter, we continued to see overall stability in the dental market and our results support that view. Consumable sales were slightly lower sequentially during the quarter and while we did witness some end market softness in the sales category, we believe a significant portion of this impact resulted from the disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative.","As I mentioned earlier, we believe the longer-term benefits we intend to realize from this initiative are worth the short-term revenue impact. In fact, we are already experiencing some upside opportunities, particularly around equipment and technology purchases. In equipment, sales during the period were solid and our pipeline trends are positive. We believe this supports our view that dental practitioners are generally confident in patient volumes and remain willing to invest for the future success of their business.","Within the category, volumes of basic equipment were healthy this quarter and we were pleased with how our broader product portfolio is performing. Technology sales this quarter were led by CEREC, which had another outstanding quarter. Clearly, there is still considerable excitement around the Zirconia workflow for CEREC and we were delighted by the level of traffic and buying interest at the SIROWORLD event earlier this month. This was a highly successful event for us and we expect the momentum that we have built to continue.","In the intraoral digital x-ray category, the softness we experienced last quarter continued. As I stated last quarter, the market in this category is substantially penetrated, and Patterson has earned significant share over time. However, we continue to see opportunities here and expect our go-to-market initiative to generate momentum as we move forward and access new customers.","Now, a look at our Animal Health segment. Once again this quarter, we executed well against stable to steadily improving market conditions across both our companion and production animal businesses. We believe this is a direct result of our integration success and our team's ability to unify under the Patterson Animal Health banner. I'll remind you that the summer months are typically the softest for the production animal industry as animals have yet to be brought into feedlots.","Considering this, we are particularly encouraged by the sales performance in our production animal business this quarter, which outpaced our expected in-market growth rates. Like last quarter, we saw improvement in swine end markets and stable to improving conditions in beef cattle. In companion animal, we continue to execute well against steadily improving market conditions in all of our regions.","In the U.S., our companion animal business recorded double-digit organic growth and NVS, our UK division, posted solid currency adjusted gains this quarter. We are confident in our market position and ability to execute within our Animal Health segment and believe we are off to the right start in fiscal 2017.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials.","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company\u2019s performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scott mentioned, we made continued progress in our efforts to build a platform for long-term growth and efficiency in an evolving marketplace.","In reviewing the company\u2019s first quarter performance, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses, as I\u2019ve done in the past. Please note that we had one less selling week in the fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter.","Our first quarter sales also include a full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Animal Health International. As of June, this acquisition is now annualized into our results. Our contribution from Animal Health International was only six weeks in the prior period. Where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales which strip out the incremental contribution from the Animal Health acquisition, currency effects, and the extra week. This will provide a more normalized view of results.","Taking a look at our top line performance, consolidated sales for fiscal 2017 first quarter increased 16.6% to 1.3 billion on a GAAP basis. The extra week in last year\u2019s first quarter reduced this year\u2019s reported sales by 5% to 6% and currency translation negatively impacted this figure by about 2%. Organic revenue was in line with our trailing 12-month performance and grew 6.1%.","Turning to margins. As we\u2019ve previously stated, the core rationale for our portfolio realignment over the past year is to begin building platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital. In exchange, we anticipated some margin dilution. Our consolidated operating margins reflect this and with one less selling week in this year\u2019s fiscal first quarter, we had lower operating leverage.","Our consolidated operating margin declined 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter consistent with our expectations. On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations grew to 38.9 million, roughly doubling to $0.40 per diluted share compared to 20.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago.","Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which exclude certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs totaled 48.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 8.5% to $0.51 per diluted share reflecting the company\u2019s sound performance in the current market.","Now let\u2019s move to our segments. In Dental, we experienced stable markets in the 2017 first quarter. Patterson Dental sales declined 3.5% on a GAAP basis but expanded by 2.1% organically. As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our dental equipment sales, which grew 5.4%. We believe our momentum in equipment helped support our confidence in the end markets.","Equipment sales in the first quarter were driven by a combination of strong demand for CEREC CAD\/CAM systems and solid volumes in basic equipment. On the consumable side, consumable dental supplies increased about 1%. This growth reflects several factors, most notably the impact of our sales force realignment. As Scott said, dental purchasing patterns are evolving and we are adapting to meet these needs.","While we expect our dental sales force realignment will better position us for growth, it contributed along with the extra selling week in last year\u2019s first quarter to a 30 basis point contraction in dental operating margins. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader and we expect to lead this industry change in order to adapt to our customer shifting needs. Overall, we believe that our performance in the first quarter was strongly competitive relative to the industry.","Now, turning to our Animal Health segment. Results in this business reflect a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International in the 2017 first quarter compared to a six-week contribution from Animal Health International and the extra sales week in the year-ago period. At the end of June, the Animal Health International acquisition is annualized into our results.","Again, in the first quarter, the company executed well in stable to steadily improving market conditions and we saw solid performance in our Animal Health business in the 2017 first quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Our Animal Health sales grew 36.8% on a GAAP basis. Currency translation lowered this number by 3%.","We were pleased with the first quarter sales of our companion animal business. Organic companion animal sales grew 11.7%. Normalizing for changes in selling arrangements for certain products, U.S. companion animal sales grew 8.1%. Our performance in the production animal industry reflects some encouraging improvement in the swine market. Overall, we believe we are well positioned in the production animal sector and we expect the beef end markets to continue to improve as the year moves on.","The first quarter sales contribution from our production animal business totaled almost 362 million, a 3% increase on a pro forma basis. Operating margins for the Animal Health segment decreased 20 basis points to 3.2%. The first quarter margins reflect a combination of factors; a seasonally low sales quarter in production animal, the timing of product rebates and a less favorable product mix.","In Animal Health, our ongoing integration activities and progress to our planned synergies remained on track. Our synergy focus this fiscal year is to more effectively leverage our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidate our back office functions.","To this end, I\u2019m pleased to say that we have achieved a major milestone and completely integrated the back office operations of Animal Health International with Patterson. Further, we remain on target to achieve our stated goal of capturing between 20 million and 30 million in annualized synergies over a three-year period.","Now, a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations was 72.8 million versus cash flow generated of 7.7 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow period.","Additionally, inventories were up by 77 million year-over-year due to increased dental equipment purchases as well as higher inventory levels related to our ERP implementation to maintain service levels. We also continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash for shareholders.","Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately 49.2 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.","We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. CapEx totaled 15 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter and included investments from normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative.","Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share related to the new accounting standard on share-based compensation. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%.","Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. As we said, Patterson is midstream in a process of repositioning the company for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense executions on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion.","It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. At this early juncture in fiscal 2017, we currently anticipate stable markets in both Dental and Animal Health. Our annual guidance range includes a pre-tax 25 million step up in operating expense associated with our ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation later this year.","During this period we will essentially be running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. This step up in expense includes cost for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is completely implemented.","That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support, and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. We continue to make progress rolling out the ERP system.","After the first quarter end, two more pilot locations of dental branches went live in August. These sites are in addition to the previous five dental branches, one companion animal call center and two shared distribution centers that went live in our new ERP pilot program on February 1st.","For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the 25 million step up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments.","We are monitoring various factors that can affect our end markets and therefore Patterson\u2019s performance. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share.","Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Scott for some further comments.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Ann. On balance we are entering fiscal 2017 with several positive dynamics in our business that we believe put us in position to have a successful fiscal year. We face a full plate of initiatives designed to expand our top and bottom lines. We continue to make the progress and achieve the milestones we set for ourselves on the integration of our Animal Health platform.","Today, we have a unified culture and a single voice in the market and we are poised to capitalize on market conditions as they improve throughout fiscal 2017. As Ann mentioned, pilot implementation for our enterprise resource planning initiative remains on track and we are capitalizing on the learnings we are gaining from this process.","While just the efficiency possibilities from this initiative is encouraging, the prospects of what this new system holds for us as part of our go-to-market efforts in Dental and Animal Health are truly exciting. Market conditions across our business continue to create opportunity for us. While we continue to closely monitor the health of our end markets, we are striving to build the Patterson Companies that can compete in any market environment.","Now with that, we\u2019d like to take any questions. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dom.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Jon Kaufman with William Blair.","Jon Kaufman","Hi. Good morning. Jon Kaufman here on for John Kreger. Can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing in the dental market currently? And more specifically, can you hit on the dental consumables market this past quarter? And then what are your expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2017?","Scott Anderson","Sure. Thanks, Jon. In looking at the North American consumable market, I will say we have seen some summer softness to the market but really don\u2019t want to overreact to it, because when you look at it, there are really multiple signs towards a thesis that this will be short term in nature. I think we have a North American economy with strong consumer confidence. We have unemployment levels under 5%. We look internally to a strong pipeline for equipment and technology, and we also have done some pretty in-depth customer survey data that points towards a rather encouraging outlook that our customers have going forward, so we obviously don\u2019t want to overreact to just a little softness over the summer months, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor the trend. Really some key months are August and September in terms of patient traffic, and remember, consumable sales lag patient traffic. So as the dentists get into sort of the back-to-business time of mid-August to September and back-to-school, that will be something that we\u2019ll be watching very closely, but I would say the underlying fundamentals of the market continued to be we think strong.","Jon Kaufman","Okay, great. And then one follow-up question here. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it. Can you provide us with this quarter\u2019s AHI sales? And then there\u2019s a small portion of that in companion animal, correct. And then on a pro forma basis, what were the production animal sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2016?","Ann Gugino","Okay. So, I think I caught all of that, but you might have to remind me again. So the total sales for Animal Health International is a little bit tricky because of course we\u2019ve got six weeks sort of annualized into our results, and then you have six weeks of incremental impact. So if I look at the production animal business only, the revenues were 362 million. And then you\u2019re right, there\u2019s about 50 million of incremental revenue that you\u2019d have to add to that that would be coming in from the companion animal. So I think that was part one of your question. Production animal business on a pro forma grew 3% versus the prior year, but I feel like you had one more question that I maybe didn\u2019t hit on, something related to 2015.","Jon Kaufman","No, I think that was it. Thank you.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go next to Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan Block","Great, guys, thanks and good morning.","Scott Anderson","Good morning.","Jonathan Block","I\u2019ll start with maybe the dental op margins, they were down 30 bps and Ann you gave a lot of good reasons, the extra week, et cetera. But you\u2019re holding the guidance which I think initially implied that op margins in dental would be up about 35 basis points at the midpoint for the year. Obviously, you had some of the restructuring. Maybe if you can talk to how we can see the op margin expansion unfold for the balance of the year, the cadence that we should see, because again it implies a pretty big move, maybe 50 bps over the next three quarters to get to the midpoint of your guide? Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Sure. So you\u2019re right. We saw some margin contraction in the current quarter on an adjusted basis of about 30 basis points, and I would say that\u2019s simply a function of the extra week and that margins were actually in line with our expectations for the quarter. So we do continue to expect operating margins to be between 13 and 13.5 for the year. As you know with our model, our margins do increase as the year goes on in line with increasing volumes, and then we have some rebate activity in the back half of the year. So what I would encourage you to do is if you look at last year\u2019s margins by quarter and then you kind of take that 35 basis points increase that we\u2019re looking for and kind of spread it evenly throughout the back half of the year, that should get you close.","Jonathan Block","Okay, got it, very helpful. And then, Scott, just to follow up on the prior question but obviously there has been a lot of questions as to the market. And so maybe if I could just ask you, anything that you can provide from sort of a monthly standpoint, how the quarter unfolded, maybe even a glimpse into August just to sort of see if this is, \u2018a blip\u2019 or something that\u2019s closer to a trend? Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Yes, I\u2019ll let Ann start and then I\u2019ll give some color.","Ann Gugino","Sure. So May was in line with our trailing 12 months. We did start to see some softening in June. But again, as Scott pointed out, this is when we implemented the sales force transition. So it\u2019s a little bit hard to decipher exactly how much of that softening is internally imposed versus externally driven. July was similar to June, maybe a little bit softer but August seems to be rebounding a bit.","Scott Anderson","Yes, and Jon I would point back to my previous comments about quite a few indicators that would lead us to be more confident that just was just a little bit of summer softness but it\u2019s going to be very critical, as I said, as we get into September-October which really becomes the busier season for the dental practice. We\u2019re also very encouraged by obviously our equipment performance and not only the current performance in the first quarter but also our pipeline. So we definitely do not want to overreact to just some softness in the summer, because over the last 25 years I\u2019ve been in the business, and we have seen this in the past.","Jonathan Block","That\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Scott Anderson","Hi, Jeff. Yes.","Jeffrey Johnson","Great. So, Scott, just wanted to start maybe on the dental equipment side. Obviously, a pretty decent number this quarter, a pretty good number especially in the context of the end markets. But it does sound like dental equipment inventory was up. So just trying to figure out, I heard what you said on pipeline but as we\u2019re all trying to figure out end markets here, is any of that inventory moving up a reflection of the equipment sales out-the-door have slowed here in the last month or two? I could also imagine a scenario where when you were making the sales force changes in June that maybe you were a little hesitant to buy equipment then, so it was just July equipment purchase and that kind of caused some timing issues when how your balance sheet closes in the quarter in that. So just trying to figure out why those dental inventories maybe were up as much as they were this quarter?","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Jeff, and thanks for the question. The inventories are up but I would say this is really a continuation of really managing the technology and equipment supply chain and something we\u2019ve worked through many times. I would say if I would point to anything, I would point back to our softer third quarter last year. And the one thing about technology products is you really want to make sure you\u2019re in a position to be able to fulfill demand, because selling cycles are shorter. So while we feel we\u2019re in a very good position going into the selling season, we\u2019re bullish about the opportunity ahead. But this is really more a function I think going back to the third quarter of last year. That being said, I would say we\u2019re very well positioned right now obviously in terms of inventory to meet the demand of what we think we\u2019ll see in our second and third quarter.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right, that\u2019s helpful. And Ann maybe two questions for you. I found your production animal comments kind of interesting that beef was stable and swine obviously has bounced back the way it has been. You didn\u2019t mention dairy, but when I look at dairy price charts, they\u2019ve rebounded quite nicely here. You\u2019d put up 3% pro forma organic in that segment. So it actually feels like to me maybe this could be the low point at 3% pro forma if dairy gets better from here. And the other markets are doing what they\u2019ve been doing here recently. Just kind of what\u2019s your outlook there and is that the way I should be thinking about how those three segments come together into the production business overall?","Scott Anderson","Yes, Jeff, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll have Ann finish. We held a joint national sales meeting with both our production and animal health teams and I got to spend some time with our dairy folks. And obviously it\u2019s an awesome team that has worked through many different cycles. And I think they feel like we\u2019re coming out of the cycle and we\u2019ll be able to put the market plan together to benefit from improving markets. But I would say the general mood of that whole team was pretty upbeat as they looked into the future. And pretty much what I like about the team we have is they have so much experience, they\u2019ve been through these cycles and pretty much this market is playing out as we had planned about six months ago. And obviously you never can plan perfectly predicting the future but we\u2019re pretty confident in our position right now. And I\u2019ll let Ann finish off the question.","Ann Gugino","Yes, so you\u2019re right, Jeff. We definitely think swine is on the upswing and we\u2019re taking some good market share there. Beef is improving. Milk prices, while they\u2019re better, are still a bit soft when you look at the historical averages. So that would probably still be our most challenged market. With that said, when you combine it altogether, our outlook at this point is that the combined market should grow at about 2%. And then of course our goal would be to continue to grow faster than that.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay. And then the last question Ann for you just on the 6% organic growth. I just want to understand, I think that\u2019s the number you gave 6.1%. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s just an average of your dental 2.1% and your companion animal at 11.7. It doesn\u2019t adjust out the [indiscernible] buy-sell stuff and it doesn\u2019t adjust for the production animal growth in the quarter. Is that right? It\u2019s just a combination of companion animal and dental.","Ann Gugino","Yes. That\u2019s correct.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","For our next question, we\u2019ll go to Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. You just answered all the questions I had on the vet side of the business. The one other one I had though was more of a clarification, and I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. But within the EBIT, the dental, the 60 million this quarter versus 67 million last quarter. Is the restructuring charge for the sales force included in that number for this quarter or is that in the corporate line? So in other words, is the 60 million versus 67 million apples-to-apples without any charges, et cetera? Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Yes. If you\u2019re looking at the reported number, you\u2019re right. There\u2019s a line item in our reconciliation between reported and adjusted called restructuring and that\u2019s mostly for the dental piece, and that would be in the dental margins but was recorded in the dental segment. So if you look \u2013 I think the easiest way to think about it if we go to our slide presentation, we have a segment on dental that shows the adjusted margins and that would have the severance taken out.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, got it. Okay. All right, great. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Scott, I wanted to start with your comments on the changing customer needs and evolving purchasing patterns. Could you give us a better sense of just what you\u2019re seeing in the market now, and how customers might be buying from you differently than they have in the past? And does their behavior differ whether we\u2019re talking about them buying consumables versus technology?","Scott Anderson","Yes, thanks, Nathan. I think it\u2019s really an evolution of the market. It\u2019s different customers, different customer sizes. And I think this is one area where Patterson has always been a leader. Just from personal experience, if I go back to my days as a sales person in San Francisco 20 years ago, we were installing electronic commerce systems before the Internet. We have been a leader over well over 80% of our consumables come electronically. That being said, when you think of all of the technology our sales force has in front of us right now and the productivity opportunities and how customers want to interact to us both face to face but also digitally, it just leads to a model that we feel is going to evolve. And really this at the end of the day is about putting more opportunity in front of our best sales people and really being easy to do business with for a wide variety of customers. So we\u2019re pretty excited about how the market evolution will really play into the Patterson competitive strengths of great sales expertise, great customer service expertise and a technical service team with vast coverage in North America. So it\u2019s really a continued evolution of a strategy that we\u2019ve really played out over 20 years.","Nathan Rich","That makes sense. If I could maybe just follow up on that. Have you seen any changes in the competitive landscape or the channels that your customers are buying through? And is that any kind of what might have led to you taking these actions?","Scott Anderson","No, I think it\u2019s really about Patterson and our customers and I think this is important. Let me give you a little context, because I think it\u2019s important. Number one, we have a history of constantly evaluating the best way to leverage Patterson and our sales force in the most effective way for the customer. And two, I think it\u2019s very important to remind everyone, no company in North America has a wider sales and technical service coverage than Patterson. And we have a history of doing this. So as a reminder, nearly eight years ago, we took a hard look at our technology sales force and we felt there was a more efficient way to sell digital technology products that made us easier to do business with. And we wanted to create more opportunity for our best sales people. So we eliminated that sales role and we moved the selling responsibilities to our established team. In doing so, we dramatically accelerated our digital x-ray sales and Eaglesoft placements if you look at what we\u2019ve done over the last eight years. So bottom line is we created a better customer experience. The moves we made in June had a really similar underline strategy, so we feel we can leverage technology with our sales force and we have an opportunity to become more productive. And we know we\u2019re leaders in e-commerce. So this is really about the customer and leading the market not reacting to a market. But I want to be really clear and don\u2019t want to have anyone misinterpret that our sales force and our service coverage today is our competitive advantage and it is incredibly important to our ongoing strategy. And bottom line we\u2019re just putting our best people in front of more opportunities to drive the market and drive customer success.","Nathan Rich","Great. Thanks for the comments.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Nathan.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back to Mr. Scott Anderson for any additional remarks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Dom, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Again, we\u2019re optimistic as we move into fiscal 2017 and we look forward to updating you on our next quarterly call.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Joining me today are Jim Wiltz, our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Gugino; our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After a review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties.

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Jim Wiltz.","Jim Wiltz","Thank you, John. Welcome everyone to today\u2019s conference call. As you all know, I am back on an interim basis serving a company I know well. Prior to the conclusion of my time as CEO of Patterson in 2010, I saw Patterson navigate change on many levels. Today, the company is again in a period of important transition. There are several factors that play a part in this transition including changes in the needs of dental practitioners, their demand for innovative technology, and our corresponding changes in how we go to market, our sales and margin improvement efforts in our animal health business, and the progress we're making on our ERP implementation. I'd like to touch on some of the performance characteristics and contributing factors in our business starting with dental.","As we have communicated before, the dental equipment market is in a period of flux, and combined with our internal changes, our dental segment has significantly impacted - significantly impacted by these factors during the first quarter. Stable and relative low growth end-market conditions impacting consumable sales in quarter one as did the ongoing effect of our sales force realignment. I want to make it clear that we are focused on doing everything we can to anticipate and meet both the current and future needs of our customers. Our sales force realignment was no exception. ","Our ability to address the full range of customer needs will be more important as clinical environments become more technological dependent. While we have cycled the initial impact of this move, clearly a portion of the softness in both our consumables is due to the impact of the realignment. Our focus in quarter one was to bolster the ranks in our dental sales force, and I'm pleased that we have made significant progress.","In addition to sales force related impacts, our equipment sales during the quarter reflected several factors. First, as we demonstrated in the international dental show in March, the market is poised for an influx of new digital equipment that will allow more customers to access a significantly wider range of digital dentistry options. I have witnessed numerous occasions in the dental industry where a customer had taken to evaluate new innovations on their way to adoption. We believe the market is in a state of wait and see. ","As these new offerings come to market, such each new product offers a distinctive set of features at a particular price point. While this market related transition significantly impacted equipment sales in our first quarter, we're taking advantage of this period to position for success. Dentsply Sirona continues to be an important strategic partner for Patterson and we intend to grow this relationship and the market for chair-side restoration we have built together over the past 20 years, but we have been preparing for the transition in our relationship.","We are pleased to announce that we have formalized new manufacturing relationships including 3Shape and Align Technology. We devoted a portion of the first quarter to training on these new products. These efforts continue as we expect to see revenue impact later this year. The support and service infrastructure we have is ideal for helping customers embrace innovation and our manufacturing partners recognize this. We believe these efforts to broaden our technology portfolio will follow a similar path to the changes we made in our core equipment portfolio where we have successfully expanded beyond our value relationship with [indiscernible]. ","Turning to animal health, we are concentrating on two key areas within this segment; margin improvement through stronger partnering with product manufacturers and sales execution. While we certainly have room to improve, our performance in the quarter did move ahead. During the quarter, we saw stable to moderately improving end market conditions across our companion and production animal businesses. Broadly speaking our production animal customers experienced more favorable farm economics during the period with lower feed input costs and stronger end-market pricing for animal protein. ","In the first quarter, we saw sales strengthen across all species categories in our production animal business. Against this backdrop, we executed well and gained share in the quarter. As discussed last quarter, margin improvement is a critical initiative in our animal health segment. We are taking a multifaceted approach to this aligning our marketing initiatives more closely with our manufactures and better managing our sales mix. These efforts are having an impact and this resulted in improved margins in the quarter.","On the whole, Patterson remains focused on the enterprise-wide productivity and efficiency initiatives that are essential to optimizing our operating model as we work towards creating more revenue momentum. We are becoming more disciplined in our spending, marketing, and working capital optimization, and this is reflected in our lower level of operating expenses in quarter one. Before we move on, I want to briefly acknowledge animal health leadership change this quarter. We are happy to welcome Kevin Pohlman as President of the Animal Health business. Kevin has held a wide variety of leadership roles at Animal Health International since 2001 and most recently served as Vice President of Sales and Marketing. We believe his customer-centric thinking and leadership experience will serve him well on this new role.","With that, I\u2019ll ask Ann to review some of the financials. ","Ann Gugino","Thank you Jim and thank you all for joining us today. As Jim described Patterson is in the midst of positioning our business for the future through major concurrent initiatives. The initiatives impacting our business in fiscal 2018 include our dental sales force realignment, the decision to move away from CEREC exclusivity to be able to sell other exciting digital technologies that our customers are asking for, the ongoing integration with animal health, and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system. We have undertaken these major customer-centric initiatives to improve Patterson's long-term performance while also recognizing the short-term disruption these choices may cause. I will say more about these initiatives as I go through our results. Now looking at our topline performance, we had a challenging 2018 first quarter for many of the reasons I just stated.","Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2018 first quarter were 1.3 billion on a reported basis, down 2.1% versus a year ago. When adjusting for currency translation, sales declined 1.1%. Turning to our margins, our first quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin was 5.6%, a 40 basis point decline versus the prior year quarter. While we demonstrated a year over year operating margin improvement in our animal health segment, this gain was more than offset by the planned incremental costs from our ERP implementation. We are committed to improving the net margin profile of our business through a variety of initiatives including stronger sales execution, more effective product mix management and intensified cost containment. These initiatives are an enterprise wide focus at Patterson. On the bottom line, GAAP net income was 30.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to 38.9 million or $0.40 per diluted share a year ago.","Adjusted net income which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs totaled 41.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, down 7.4 million from the same quarter last year. It is important to point out that on a pre-tax basis, the step up in ERP expenses represented approximately 7 million of the decrease in adjusted net income in the quarter compared to last year. ","Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.44 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.51 in the first quarter of last year, a decline of 14%. Now let's turn to our segments. In dental, the first quarter sales reflected the impact of our strategic initiatives. While we anticipated some level of sales interruption related to our current business initiatives, sales were lower than anticipated in the 2018 first quarter in both dental consumables and technology equipment.","On a reported basis, dental sales were down 6.5% and in constant currency sales decreased 6.3% versus the prior year quarter. On that same basis, Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 3.6% during the 2018 first quarter. Moving onto our dental equipment sales, on a constant currency basis, equipment sales declined 15% in the first quarter. Sales of core equipment were up slightly for the quarter. The decline in equipment sales is due to the decrease in sales of CEREC products and other digital technology equipment. ","We anticipate that the headwinds in our technology equipment business will persist through fiscal 2018 as we transition to our new go-to market strategy with an expanded technology product portfolio. During the quarter, we also made progress in adjusting our go-to market strategy in dental through a combination of initiatives, specifically, more effective customer segmentation, additional marketing support, and expanding sales coverage necessary to meet our customer's changing need and increases in sales volumes.","We also invested in product training on the new digital technologies being added to our portfolio. We believe that these initiatives will begin benefiting our dental sales in the second half of this fiscal year and we are committed to regaining growth and margin profile in the dental segment. Now turning to our animal health segment, we are encouraged by the sales performance and market share gains across our animal health business in the 2018 first quarter. On a reported basis, consolidated animal health sales grew 1.8% year over year. ","In constant currency, animal health segment sales rose 3.4% year over year. Looking at our companion animal business, for the first quarter, global companion animal sales rose 1.2% on a constant currency basis. When normalizing for a change in product selling arrangements, global companion animal sales grew approximately 6%. Production animal sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 6% in constant currency versus the year-ago period.","Overall performance in the production animal segment reflects stronger sales and share gains across all species. We are encouraged to see the production animal market showing improvement in end market pricing enabling our producer customers to improve their profitability. While gross margins in our animal health segment remain under some pressure, we continue to make progress on improvement at the operating margin level. Our margin challenges in animal health are largely a function of our integration efforts where operational priorities lead to under investments in marketing support and less focus on product mix. ","This quarter we achieved a year over year adjusted operating margin improvement of 50 basis points due to improved sales mix, discipline expense control, and delivering on our synergy capture target for the quarter. I want to acknowledge the disciplined effort within our animal health team as they have tackled this challenge with the necessary analysis and actions to improve margins. We believe these are within our control to correct.","We will continue working to improve animal health operating margin in three primary ways. First through better marketing and focus on sales product mix, second, by more effectively partnering with our vendors, and lastly, continued focus on cost controls and capturing the remaining integration synergy which will truly leverage the strength of our combined animal health platform. We are in the final year of our three-year integration window with animal health and both the pace and the level of synergy capture remains unchanged. ","Regarding the enterprise resource planning system rollout, the implementation of our ERP system rollout continued to progress in the first quarter as planned. During the quarter, we brought another large portion of the total business onto the new platform. Currently, we are running over 75% of our US computing animal and dental business on this powerful new platform and we are nearing the major milestone of completing the roll up phase of our enterprise resource planning system. We are already realizing some efficiencies in our distribution centers and how we pick, pack and ship orders.","Also we are building the data hierarchies to provide the foundation for a more ambitious and customer centric e-commerce platform. Ultimately this new platform will help us run our entire business with greater agility and with less working capital to free up cash for other strategic uses. However, the journey is not over and we recognized the inconvenience and disruption the implementation process has caused the customers and suppliers. ","As we have moved through implementation, we have taken appropriate opportunities during the rollout to improve the experience of this new system for our customers that they do business with Patterson. We have also been carefully mapping out the enhancement steps that we must complete but that only makes sense to do so when the system is fully in place. We are beginning to shift our focus and resources to this next phase of work so we can accelerate and deliver the experience that our customers should expect from the system and from Patterson.","On behalf of our senior leadership team, I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of our Patterson employees who have worked so diligently to cut over to the new system and take care of our customers during this transition. Their commitment to serving our customers and perseverance have been displayed in countless ways during this transformation. We thank them as we finish the roll out and continue enhancing the capabilities of this powerful new platform. Now, a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. ","During the quarter, we reduced working capital by 33 million, our inventory levels did increase during the first quarter, which reflects normal seasonality as well as incremental gains to ensure fill rates. However, our inventory is still lower than it was a year ago at this time. Working capital continues to be impacted by EPR deployment. As these deployments wrap up in the near future, we expect to stabilize and enhance our processes to further reduce our investments and working capital over time.","Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 34.9% nearly 200 basis points higher than the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate last year was lower because a year ago we adopted a new accounting treatment for share-based compensation and realized a greater benefit in 2017 than we did this year. For the 2018 fiscal year, we still expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35.5%. Turning to our capital allocation strategy, we continue to execute on our strategy to return tax for our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we returned nearly 63 [ph] million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We remain fully committed to our dividend and we have increased it every year since it was instituted. Our strong balance sheet along with our newly expanded debt capacity also gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically.","With that I'll turn it back to Jim for further comments.","Jim Wiltz","Thanks Ann. I\u2019ll wrap up with just a few additional comments. We have several significant and achievable goals to accomplish including reinforcing our sales team and improving our sales execution in dental in a way that anticipates the future needs of our customer. Leading the change in bringing dental technology innovation to all clinical environments, making additional progress of sales and margin improvement in animal health and optimizing the ERP platform after the rollout is complete. Patterson is 140 years old and I've seen it adapt to new positions of strength time after time. This is no small credit to our dedicated employees who are tasked with driving through the change. There is much yet to do but much to be proud of.","Now we'd like to take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great thanks for the questions Jim and I guess first just congratulations on the new distribution agreements with 3Shape and iTero. I was hoping maybe you could talk about where you are relative to where you ultimately want to be from a supplier standpoint as you continue to build out the broader portfolio of equipment. And then I guess just related to that maybe where you are as far as onboarding some of these lines and bringing the sales force up to speed on these new products and relationships.","Jim Wiltz","Robert I\u2019ll give you a half answer, probably that I really don't care to comment on because I don't want it to be public knowledge just yet on some of the timing. So we are starting almost immediately on training on some of those new products, and I think that you will see some roll out of the product and the sales force completion of trading sometime in the fall; September, October time frame.","Robert Jones","So I guess safe to say without getting into specifics, you're moving along kind of as expected relative to where you want the ultimate portfolio of equipment to be.","Jim Wiltz","Yeah, the answer to that is yes.","Robert Jones","And then, I guess just the second follow up on the changes you guys mentioned in the selling relationships in the animal health segment. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit on what specifically led to those changes, and then how should we think about any impact from those changes to both revenue growth and profitability within the animal health segment.","Jim Wiltz","I think I'll have to turn that to Ann, Robert.","Ann Gugino","Sure. So this is really just a change with one manufacturer, where we moved from a distribution relationship where we inventory the product to what we call an agency relationship where we sell the product, but then it is delivered drop ship, and those changes do occur from year to year and it really depends on the contract terms and what we think is the best situation for Patterson in terms of maximizing profitability. If you look at the impact in the current quarter, it reduced our reported sales by about 4 to 5 percentage points, so the real growth within our companion segment is close to the 6%. And we would continue to see that through the balance of the year in terms of top line. And as I just mentioned, we made that choice because we think it helps profitability on the bottom line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger","Ann, can you just give us a little bit more on the ERP implementation plan? What sort of additional costs are included in your budgeted guidance for fiscal \u201918?","Ann Gugino","Sure. So we have the -- or the $7.2 million step up in expense this quarter. And so for the balance of FY18 or for all of FY18, we're still expecting annual expenses for the ERP to be in the range of 30 million to 35 million. The way it\u2019s trending, probably a little bit closer to the lower end of the range, but that amounts to an incremental expense for FY18 of another 5 million to 10 million for the full quarter. So I think the way to think about it quarterly is the step up in expense for Q2 will be similar to this year or to this quarter, but then when you look at Q3 and Q4 because we started the roll up in Q3 of last year, you\u2019ll actually benefit the expense rate. So you'll see our operating expenses benefit between 3 million to 5 million in Q3 and Q4.","John Kreger","And then a related question. So as you said, your inventory levels went up sequentially even though revenue came down. Is that primarily extra inventory for the implementation? When do you think you'll be able to start seeing inventory declines with the benefit of the new system?","Ann Gugino","Yeah. So part of the inventory increase from the end of the year to now is seasonality and that's actually the bulk of it. So if you look at a year ago and just historically, we always have an increase in inventory from the end of April to July. Just most of this is seasonality. We run the inventories down low at the end of the year to minimize the impact of LIFO. And then really, there's seasonality in the animal health business, particularly in production animal. ","So actually, the majority of the increase is in the animal health side of the business. We are definitely carrying higher inventory levels overall to maintain fill rates through the implementation. As far as when we can expect to draw that down, we\u2019ll be through the full implementation here this fall and then that's when we think we can really turn to refining and enhancing our business processes. So I would expect us to continue to make steady progress throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum.","Kevin Ellich","Ann, just following up on the animal health questions, you gave some good color on what you're planning to do to improve margins. Can you talk a little bit about the product mix, what are you going to do on the product mix side? Is it really more twitching the relationships from buy sell to agency and then also what are you doing with some of the manufacturers on those relationships?","Ann Gugino","So I think it's a combination of things, Kevin. So certainly, evaluating what we\u2019re carrying through the distribution center versus what\u2019s agency is a key piece. I think there is definitely, from a mix perspective, the private label angle and house brands and how you drive that and think about that. And then there's just mix in terms of, there are manufacturers that you want to partner with and then there are manufacturers that you carry. So, what's the optimal basket of goods and how do you position that to the customer.","Kevin Ellich","How should we think about what products you want to -- which manufacturers you want to partner with in those products? Are we thinking more companion animal or production, any more color on that front?","Ann Gugino","I mean, it's certainly across the animal health portfolio when we're making those comments, but I would say that the gross margin challenges have been more on the companion animal side. What I will say in the current quarter is that we made great progress in companion animal this quarter. You can't necessarily see it in the total gross margins for that segment, because the production animal gross margins this quarter were a little bit soft, but that was more timing and seasonality of revenue than anything. So we feel like we've made really solid progress this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to do so.","Kevin Ellich","And then one quick dental question. So consumables, we know you guys are going through the strategic initiatives and sales force restructuring. Just wondering if you have any comments on, if you normalize for that, where consumable sales might have been and also how things are trending in July?","Ann Gugino","So, we're not going to specifically quantify the impact of the sales rep initiatives, but I will say it did anniversary in to our results this quarter and what I would say in general is that if you remove that impact, we were definitely in line with the market growth and where other folks are reporting the market at.","And then what was your second question?","Kevin Ellich","Just how July was trending?","Ann Gugino","I think for us, just looking at those individual month trends, we don't really want to get to in depth on one particular month. So I would say we're not going to give specifics on July.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Jim, wanted to start with you, maybe the last time you and I spoke, I think it was still early on in the process of the CEO search and the board was still trying to define kind of roles and expectations and characteristics that you would focus on. Any update you can provide there on kind of what are key characteristics you're looking for in a new leader, number one? And number two, as you've reached out to candidates, anything you can talk about kind of interest in the role, is there interest out there from people you're reaching out to. We\u2019d just love to get an update on that.","Jim Wiltz","Jeff, you ask a lot of questions, but unfortunately I can\u2019t answer many of them. But some of the stuff is not ready for public release yet. We do have a search firm that we\u2019ve engaged. We do have candidates, interviews have started. And I really don't have a timeline to share with you and I think sometimes that process is hard to pinpoint anyhow, because once we select a candidate, and they\u2019re employed somewhere, you don't know how long it's going to take them to wind down from their old job and go for it. So some of the things that you're asking are pretty hard to pinpoint, but we do have a committee in the board. I don't happen to be on the committee, but we have three members of the board that are on the committee that are working with the search firm to coordinate that.","Jeff Johnson","And my follow up question, I guess just on the stability of the sales force. I would love to get your take. I know obviously you made the cuts last June, you've anniversaried through those now, but there have been several large team departures, it does sound like maybe some of the CEREC and other training specialists and what have you on the Sirona side maybe have left recently. So two questions I guess. One, how do we think about consumables once the transition happens September 1? Does it need to get a little bit worse, before it gets better from here or do you think that's not the case? And number two, just what are you doing internally with the sales force at this point? Is it possible to hold kind of sales numbers steady to up going forward from where we are today? What's your outlook there?","Jim Wiltz","Well, I think that we've continued to have some departure of sales reps and that's -- really that goes on all the time. It's not new, but I do think we have seen that slow down a bit and we've developed some programs specifically targeted at, we\u2019re helping them grow their business and stabilize their business and to streamline their job a little bit if you will, take a little bit of the workload off of them that's been thrust at them as we go through this ERP changeover. And so I think we hear them loud and clear and I think we're responding to their wants and needs and issues. ","We very definitely are trying to make as easy as possible for both customer and the sales reps to get their orders entered and to do business with us and we're working on streamlining those very hard. And I spend a lot of time trying to communicate that we are sales organization, we are sales organization, we are sales organization. And we\u2019ve got a lot of product distributors, but Patterson is a sales organization. So we\u2019re trying very hard to make them feel good about where they are and that they\u2019re important to us.","Jeff Johnson","And just to follow up there, I didn't hear an answer on maybe the consumable side. I know you don't guide by segment, but should we think about it maybe getting a little worse before it gets better or do we think we can hold closer to these levels for the next couple of quarters.","Ann Gugino","Sure. There's a number of puts and takes, Jeff. So as you mentioned, we don't give revenue guidance, particularly by quarter, but I think in general, we're going to be a back half of the year story for a couple of reasons. One is we\u2019ll be onboarding the new equipment partners to then, to, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, for aggressively adding reps as well as strengthening the marketing programs. ","But Jim was talking about, so I definitely think there is some upside potential. I think the potential new headwinds that we're working very hard to defend, but the real headwind is the CEREC block business, which is in the consumables and so that will change for us on September 1 with the open distribution. Again, we're going to defend that business, but it will be a bit of a headwind, so there are some puts and takes, so we're absolutely committed to growing the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon Block","Ann, maybe just to start with you, you mentioned that equipment headwinds should persist throughout fiscal \u201918, but is it fair to assume that the equipment performance sort of improved sequentially throughout fiscal \u201918 off of the 1Q lows that we saw this morning and then the follow-up to that question and I got one other one would just be how should we think of a margin profile of some of these additional technology offerings that you will be selling relative to your current relationship with Dentsply?","Ann Gugino","Sure. So as far as the equipment headwinds, I would agree that this should be kind of the low point. Q2 will remain challenging, just because anytime you're changing, will be changing out and learning the new products. So there will still be disruption. With that said, there is great excitement over Dentsply Sinora overall, so we feel bullish there. So, Q2 will continue to be challenged, but then as you stated, it should get better in Q3, Q4 was a really soft comparable because that's been kind of announced to change. ","So I would again, just to reiterate that we think that this is kind of a back half of the year story in terms of returning to that growth profile. As far as the margins, they are not significantly different. In our relationships with Sirona Dentsply, what I would just say though is that, it\u2019s a lower price point when you're selling digital impressioning versus full tray size. So, it\u2019s kind of a three to one on the top line, but the margin profile from a percentage basis is not significantly different.","Jon Block","And then maybe the follow up, you sort of ran me a little bit on the CEREC blocks, but that's certainly been part of our concern with these and so you seem to open the door a bit. So if I can just follow up there, you mentioned that you're positioning yourself or actively defending that business. Jim or Ann, any details you can give there in terms of what you're doing to actively defend that business? And then secondly would just be, if I am at CEREC practice, are there any goalpost that you could put up in terms of, of my total consumable spend, is it right to think that CEREC blocks are around 15% to 20% maybe of that total consumable spend?","Jim Wiltz","First of all, I don't want to comment about specifics about the block business, but you're a little high with your percentage of total spend with the block.","Jon Block","And maybe just some of the -- some color around how you're actively defending that business?","Jim Wiltz","Well, I mean it's all related to CEREC and the blocks, it\u2019s all, they're all rolled into one and I guess I would say to shine and welcome to the neighborhood and it's not as easy to sell as you think it is.","Ann Gugino","I think the other thing Jon that I would just add in terms of the stickiness factor, just kind of commenting on the CEREC block business and then just CEREC owners in general, it\u2019s just the aftersales support and the training that we provide in terms of just that stickiness factor and that is, as Jim alluded to, is the complicated product, not only to sell, but to service after the fact and we have a real core competency and competitive advantage there. So I think that that would be one factor and then we have a number of marketing programs and different initiatives that we're not going to get in to the specifics, but we're actively defending the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Just wanted to ask a question for you Ann. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re actually able to return in course of the product back to Dentsply that may be in excess of what you're capable of selling, given the exclusivity change now. Are you able to actually put back any product to them?","Ann Gugino","Well, certainly, we\u2019re great partners, so we work through inventory challenges together or opportunities together all the time. We're always, the first and foremost is making sure that we have products to meet the customer demand. And then, we\u2019re always working with them to help make sure that they've got efficiencies from a production standpoint. So it\u2019s definitely a give and take in a partnership, but I'm not going to comment on any specific return policies per se, but we're good partners there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kedra of Gabelli.","Kevin Kedra","First, I want to ask about the dental market. I know you've addressed some of the disruptions you're having in your business, but certainly seeing, what feels like a bit of slowing in the broader consumable market, it sounds like that's consistent with what you're seeing, but any insight on what exactly is driving that and whether that's something that you expect to continue in the back half of the year, again excluding the specific impacts you have to your business?","And then secondly, Ann, I know you had spoken before about the opportunity to get the animal health business back to that 5% operating margin in a couple of years. It sounds like you're moving towards that. Is that still -- 5%, is that still a target.","Ann Gugino","Sure. So I think when we think about the underlying consumables market, we would agree with the general consensus that the market is stable, but it's low growth. In terms of the specific why, that\u2019s something we continue to dig into, but that would be our outlook for the remainder of the year at this point. As it relates to the animal health margins, absolutely, we're still committed to that 5% and getting there in the next two years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America.","Steven Valiquette","Just a couple of questions for me, somewhat interrelated. The first one is obviously, it's good to hear about the new dental equipment deals with a line three shape and maybe a few others coming up as you mentioned and also the expectation that they will add to revenues right away in FY18. Obviously, you can't really quantify expected sales around these new deals, but are these expected to be big enough to move the needle just on the overall company EPS in FY18 or is that more likely to occur maybe in FY19 and beyond?","Jim Wiltz","Well, I think it's more likely to happen in FY19 and beyond and it takes a relatively slow start up on these types of products. You've got a lot of people that train lot of sales reps to get comfortable with the product, how it works. They want to make sure that it\u2019s something that they don't want to [indiscernible]. They want to make sure it works before they start selling it around their territories. So just by the nature of these beats, it takes a fair amount of time to get it by providing to their peak.","Ann Gugino","I think the other thing that I would add there is I do think that the market is a bit frozen right now, because in addition to the change in the distribution relationship, there are a number of new products coming to the market. So I think that that\u2019s also having an impact on the, could have some near term, continued near term impact.","Jim Wiltz","Yeah. That's a great point. Sales reps don't want to react too quickly and sell their own product.","Steven Valiquette","And also just to clarify, I'm guessing these new deals are already kind of factored into your outlook just in general, so these would not be like newly additive just now to guidance with the announcements this week. Is that the right way to think about it?","Ann Gugino","Yes.","Jim Wiltz","I think so. These things are hard to foresee and predict accurately, but I think we have done a pretty good job of factoring in what we think that will do.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Final quick one. I know Ann you didn\u2019t want to comment on July, but do you want to comment on August and I\u2019m just kidding, don\u2019t worry.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Mike Minchak","It\u2019s actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. So shifting gears a little bit, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape and sort of competition from online players across both of your market segments. Can you give us a sense for how market trends should -- market share trends have evolved with respect to online players and sort of what you see is the main hurdles for companies like Amazon or other online players to gain incremental share within both of your segments?","Jim Wiltz","Well, couple of comments. We don't really see any activity yet. There's a lot of talk. But if you start looking at two things, I would suggest two things that you look at closely. Number one, the size of this market that and a little bit level of interest that Amazon may have once they figure out exactly what the size of the market is versus the other marketing plays. I think that\u2019s going to have some factor. And I don't know, it's too early to tell. The Internet play has been predicted for a long time. We\u2019re yet to see it happen. It\u2019s not moving very rapidly in that direction.","Ann Gugino","And I think I would just add in terms of the main hurdles, it\u2019s really going back to the sales and service infrastructure. So when dental practice is down and they can't see patients, that has a direct impact on their revenue stream and so the benefit that Patterson brings is that we'll have that service and that practice back up and running as quickly as possible. We do that with the core equipment and then just the complexity and the digitization of the dental office, that's going to become a more compelling and important service as that dental office gets more and more complex. I would say that holds true for that clinic as well. And so that really is a stickiness factor.","","I think the other thing to keep in mind is just what percentage of the overall spend a clinic is spending on consumables. So while it\u2019s a really important part of our business, it\u2019s kind of less than 10% of their overall spend. So how much time are you going to spend trying to save 10% on 10%, particularly when if you're loyal to Patterson, you're going to get an immediate response time on your service and equipment needs.","Jim Wiltz","Yeah. I\u2019d take another comment to make that is important. From a delivery standpoint, Amazon really has no advantage over us. We delivered next stage of the majority of our customers. So it's not like they\u2019re going to package there any quicker. So we'll see. They\u2019re certainly big enough than you have to pay attention to them, but so far, we\u2019re not going to call them the bogeyman.","Mike Minchak","Got it. And then maybe just one very quick follow up for Ann. Historically, you guys have targeted a goal of expanding operating margins by 20 basis points annually. Are you building a similar assumption into the forecast for fiscal \u201918, given where the first quarter shook out?","Ann Gugino","So certainly, we saw some margin compression in the first quarter. I would say that was in line with our expectations for the full year, just because of the increase that we\u2019re having with the ERP step up in expenses this year. We're actually targeting flat margins for the current year.","Jim Wiltz","Okay. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and we look forward to updating you on our next quarter. Thank you again.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Patterson Companies Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, May 24, 2012. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Anderson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Scott P. Anderson","Thank you, Douglas. Good morning, and thanks for taking time to participate in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review some highlights of our fourth quarter performance, following my opening remarks.","Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with any earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we provided financial guidance for fiscal 2013 in our press release earlier this morning. This guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause Patterson's actual results to vary from our forecast. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings, and we urge you to review this material.","Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Sales totaled $936.3 million, an increase of 6% from $883.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Net income of $62.1 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, included incremental expense of $0.03 related to Patterson's Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP. Excluding this ESOP-related expense, fourth quarter earnings were $0.61 per diluted share. We included an ESOP expense reconciliation table in this morning's release that provides a full detail on this item.","Patterson's reported earnings of $62.7 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2012, consolidated sales rose [Audio Gap] to $3.5 billion. The additional sales week in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which made that a 53-week period, negatively affected fiscal 2012 sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points.","Net income in fiscal 2012 [Audio Gap] $212.8 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, included $0.13 per share of ESOP-related expense. Excluding this expense, earnings were $2.05 per diluted share for the year. Earnings in fiscal 2011 were $225.4 million, or $1.89 per diluted share.","While on the topic of our recent operating results, I also want to mention that Patterson repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares during the fourth quarter under our 25-million-share buyback authorization that expires in 2016.","For the year, we acquired 12 million shares, with approximately 11 million shares remaining available for repurchase under this authorization. In addition, Patterson's quarterly cash dividend was increased 17% to $0.14 per share in March 2012, bringing our annual dividend rate to $0.56 per share.","Including share repurchases and quarterly dividends, Patterson returned $400 million to shareholders in fiscal 2012, reflecting our commitment to generating value for our stakeholders.","Now for the next few minutes, I will briefly review our fourth quarter operating results for each of our divisions. Each of the 3 businesses performed at planned levels during this period despite persistently soft and unsettled economic conditions both at home and abroad. We believe our ability to perform effectively in the current environment bodes well for Patterson's performance in a stronger economy.","Within Patterson Dental, sales of consumable supplies increased 3.5% before the impact of foreign currency exchange rate. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of solid consumable sales growth, an indication of the continued strengthening of the overall North American dental market.","We are also encouraged by the 6% improvement in fourth quarter sales of dental equipment, given the fact that equipment sales were particularly robust in the year-earlier period. In addition to mid-single-digit sales growth of basic equipment, we benefited from strong double-digit sales growth of CEREC systems, which was generated primarily by new users. We believe this reflects the growing acceptance of CAD\/CAM and other new digital technologies [Audio Gap] which are enabling dentists to strengthen productivity, generate additional income and improve clinical outcomes.","We estimate the CEREC systems have now penetrated only about 12% of the North American dental market, which means this product line has significant sales potential going forward. To help spur continued demand for CEREC and other next-generation products, we will continue to focus our marketing initiatives on Patterson Dental's industry-leading lineup of technology offerings.","Fourth quarter sales of Webster Veterinary increased 13% to $207.5 million, a record level for this unit. The August 2011 acquisition of American Veterinary Supply Corporation, a full-service veterinary distributor located on Long Island, accounted for 2 percentage points of the unit's sales growth for the period. Webster's fourth quarter sales growth was driven by robust demand for consumables supplies, including flea\/tick and heartworm medications as the relatively mild winter led to an early onset of these summer pests.","Despite the challenging economy, pet owners are increasingly -- increasing expenditures on veterinary care. Through its full-service platform, which includes equipment and a new technical service capability, our companion and pet veterinary unit is positioned to capitalize upon positive pet ownership and spending trends. We intend to continue investing in our efforts to diversify our revenue offerings in this growing business.","Sales of Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, increased 3%, excluding the impact of currency, to $130 million in the fourth quarter. Patterson Medical's fourth quarter performance was paced by above-plan sales of consumables in the North American market. The unit's equipment business continued to be affected by the uncertainty around the proposed changes in the U.S. health care system.","We believe this situation, which dampened equipment demand throughout the past year, will likely persist in fiscal 2013. Patterson Medical is positioned to take maximum advantage of worldwide long-term demographic trends, fueling the growth of the rehabilitation market. Consistent with its global business strategy, Patterson Medical acquired Australian-based Surgical Synergies this past April, a $10 million distributor of physiotherapy, rehabilitation and mobility products that strengthens our previously established position in the Australian and New Zealand rehab markets.","Finally, as we stated in this morning's release, we issued financial guidance of $2.10 to $2.16 per diluted share for fiscal 2013. As we look ahead to fiscal 2013, we believe the market for dental consumables will grow in the 2% to 3% range, while the equipment market will grow in the 5% to 7% range.","The companion pet veterinary market is forecasted to grow in a range of 3% to 4%, while the global rehabilitation market is not expected to increase in fiscal 2013. We believe each of our sales units will continue to grow at faster rates than their respective markets.","As we look back on fiscal 2012, I would like to highlight a few of the important investments that we've made to enhance our opportunities for success in the future.","First, we completed the multiyear extension of our domestic distribution capacity with the completion of the South Bend, Indiana facility. This should allow us to double our business without significant additional investment in our distribution capacity.","Second, we completed and opened a new facility for the Patterson Technology Center. This state-of-the-art industry facility will provide our customers with a full complement of resources to support their ongoing investments in technologies for their practices.","Third, we developed and deployed updated customer service and order management systems throughout the domestic dental operation to better support the growth of the business and address the changing needs of our dental customers.","Fourth, we made investments in educational programs for our sales organization that will continue into fiscal 2013, and we accelerated the buildout of our technical service capabilities in the veterinary unit.","While these investments added incremental expense in the short term, we believe that the return to the shareholder over the long term will be substantial.  In all, we believe our markets are gradually recovering from the impact of the recession, although they have not returned to historic growth norms.","I want to emphasize that Patterson's businesses are well positioned to capitalize upon their market opportunities, and we are looking forward to an exciting and successful fiscal 2013.","In closing, I'd like to thank the over 7,000 Patterson employees around the world for their dedication to our customers and their fine work in our fourth quarter and throughout our fiscal year. We together are optimistic about Patterson's long-term future.","Thank you. Now Steve Armstrong will review some additional financial highlights from our fourth quarter results.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Thank you, Scott. My comments will focus primarily on some of the significant aspects of our financial results in the fourth quarter and matters affecting our guidance for fiscal 2013.","Let me begin with a few brief comments on consolidated operations. Currency had only a 30 basis point negative impact on our consolidated revenue growth, although our medical unit was negatively affected by 90 basis points. Our consolidated gross margin declined by 90 basis points in the quarter compared to the prior year but improved sequentially as anticipated by 120 basis points. The year-over-year decline was due primarily to sales mix and some increase in promotional costs.","Our operating expense ratio improved 10 basis points despite the incremental $5.6 million of ESOP expense, as we were able to gain leverage from revenue growth and expense management.","The ESOP expense increased accounted for the majority of the decline in the operating margin, with the impact of the product mix and promotional costs accounting for the remainder.","Specifically, the Dental operating margin was 11.7% for the quarter. As a reminder, this segment absorbed the largest portion of the ESOP expense. The Veterinary and Medical segments reported operating margins of 5.8% and 16.2%, respectively.","Interest expense was increased by approximately $3.1 million from the prior year due to the issuance of the debt in the third quarter. While we have absorbed this increased expense in the near-term, we believe this new debt provides very competitively priced long-term capital to support the growth of the business.","Our fiscal 2012 tax expense continued to benefit from the dividends paid on the shares held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. This portion of the dividend is deductible on our income tax return and provides an increasing benefit to our overall tax rate as the dividend rate grows.","In addition, during the fourth quarter, we summoned an Internal Revenue Service audit, and as a result, we were able to release approximately $1.4 million of previously provided tax reserves. This release of reserves positively impacted our fourth quarter tax rate by 150 basis points. As we look to fiscal 2013, we expect a tax rate of approximately 36%.","Looking now at our cash flow. We generated approximately $92 million from operations in the fourth quarter compared to $71 million in the prior year. This increase was a result of better working capital management and a larger amount of finance contracts sales during the period compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","A couple notes on our balance sheet. Our DSO stood at 45 compared to the year ago of 48 days. Our inventory turns declined slightly to 6.7 from 6.9 last year.","You may also have noted that $125 million of our debt has moved from the long-term classification to short term. This portion of the debt matures in March of 2013, and we intend to retire it at that time using proceeds from our debt issuance this past December.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2013, revenues in our Webster Veterinary unit will be adversely affected by a change in our distribution agreement with a nutritional vendor. We formally distributed this product for the vendor under a buy-sell arrangement in 1 region of the U.S. market.","Beginning in fiscal 2013, we will represent the vendor under a national agency arrangement. This change is expected to reduce revenues by approximately $45 million, although the effect on operating profit is expected to be minimal.","In addition, our expense structure during the coming fiscal year will reflect the comparable amount of ESOP expense as in fiscal 2012, thus the change in accounting for this item has been grandfathered into our expenses.","Finally, our guidance for fiscal 2013 reflects the outstanding share count with which we ended fiscal 2012. As Scott noted earlier, we have approximately 11 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization, and we expect to continue to purchase shares if the opportunity present itself.","A final note on our view of fiscal 2013. We expect CapEx to approximate $25 million to $30 million, while depreciation and amortization should be about $45 million.","With that, I'll turn it back to the operator, and we'll pool you for your questions. Douglas?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Steve, quick question on the guidance. What sort of assumptions did you make about the medtech tax? And are you assuming that has any impact on your P&L going forward?","R. Stephen Armstrong","The medtech tax, it's baked in there, John. It's a combination -- we'll probably have to absorb some of it in the near term. We expect to pass most of it on. These are fairly inelastic markets, although we know there's going to be some loggerheads at certain points in those market. It's going to be more difficult the pass that tax on. We have projects underway currently to revise our pricing arrangements in our taxing collection processes, so I think we'll be in good shape by the beginning of 2013. But it is a nuisance item, but I don't think it's going to have a significant impact on our operations, John.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. If you could just expand a bit more on the CEREC results, the strong momentum. Can you give us a sense about how much that's being driven by the full chairside system versus in-lab versus maybe scanner-only [ph] sales?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure, John. Yes, the majority of sales are the full chairside units in the quarter, so continued interest in CEREC by our customer base. But it's predominantly all full chairside units.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, more broadly, if you think about other key technologies in dental, what -- where are some of the other classes where you're seeing particular momentum at this point?","Scott P. Anderson","We continue to see momentum in the ConeBeam space. We continue to see momentum in our software offerings, both at EagleSoft and Dolphin, as well as momentum over the year, obviously, in our Schick digital offering. So as the customer base moves from an analog world to a digital world, which obviously makes that more efficient, we think it improves clinical outcomes. Our commitment to best-in-class products but also best-in-class service we feel creates a definite competitive advantage for Patterson.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. Just wondering if you could give some incremental insights into the trends you're seeing on the dental equipment side? How does the order book look? And are you assuming incremental growth in that segment in the guidance for fiscal '13?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, we will see incremental growth in the coming fiscal year, and we see the pipeline beginning to solidify. I always put the cautionary note in there that equipment even in strong economies can be volatile at times. But we feel very good. Sort of -- to dovetail out of what I just answered on John's question about our overall equipment offering, in terms of our partnerships with companies like A-dec and others, that we think this will be a good year for equipment.","Michael R. Minchak - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up. The balance sheet really remains really strong here. Can you talk about the acquisition environment? What are -- which of the 3 businesses are you sort of seeing more opportunities then? And how do valuations look on a relative basis? And then is there any willingness to move outside of those 3 segments where you currently compete?","Scott P. Anderson","I would say we see opportunity in all 3 businesses and are very focused on those 3 at this time. In terms of valuations, we always feel that we are a strong strategic fit for many companies, and we'll pay accordingly for good businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Elliot filling in for Larry. Just a quick question on the Vet segment. Obviously, another quarter of pretty strong results there. Scott, I mean, just a broad sense of kind of what you're seeing there. Actually, we're seeing some pretty strong numbers from all 3 distributors. Just trying to get a sense of the overall dynamics there. A lot of share, you may take it from the smaller distributors. And I know there's some pricing dynamics there as well, but just trying to get some broad factors there as we see some pretty good results continue there.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I think it's a market with some unique underlying strengths in terms of how people take care of their pets. We also, much like our Dental group, with the initiatives we're running at Webster, feel we've got strong competitive advantage going forward. Definitely, it benefited, as I said in my remarks, from weather in terms of flea\/tick and heartworm. But we are absolutely pleased with the performance of Webster in the quarter in the year.","Elliot Feldman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it. And on CEREC. I know that you touched on this a little bit. But were there any special promotions in Q4 that may be different from what we'll expect to see here on the rest of the calendar year? Just trying to get any insights you can share on maybe some additional promotional activity we might be able to anticipate for the rest of the year.","Scott P. Anderson","Elliot, I don't you think you'd see any incremental to the type of the things we've done in the third and fourth quarter. I would say we were quite pleased because we had a very strong fourth quarter a year ago in CEREC, so to put up those type of results in this quarter, I think, just speaks volumes about the interest from the practitioners in this technology.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Scott, maybe still hitting on that. I guess, it looks like a very good quarter for you. My immediate concern would be that you did pull something forward from the first quarter on an equipment standpoint. Is there any possibility you did get a little bit of a boost from some activity, promotional activity in that fourth quarter? And are there any specific promotions going on now that we should know about in the first quarter?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Bob, I don't think we pulled anything from the first quarter. What we did announce is we are running a trade-up program for CEREC. And primarily the reason we've done this is about 25% of the CEREC user base still is using the older technology, and there's been such a positive response to the 4.0 software from our new users as well as people that have upgraded that we just felt with Sirona a decision with them that we needed to go back one last time to give customers the opportunity to get into the latest technology. But we anticipate a strong first quarter.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Actually, I'm sorry. That promotion started this quarter, Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","The trade-up promotion started in the first quarter.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Wow, fantastic. And Steve, just on the guidance, you referenced share buyback but is there a number you'd have us throw in our models for what you might be able to accomplish this year under the authorization?","R. Stephen Armstrong","I don't like to forecast that, Bob. That's the difficulty with this situation. We've got 11 million shares left. We've got cash obviously deployed wherever we want to. But I'd sort of guide you to think about it, if it's a rational market and we don't see too much volatility, probably a more measured repurchase in 2013. If the market gives us the opportunity, we'll obviously put the cash to work at a faster pace.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So in terms of the $400 million number this past year for total return to the shareholder, we're probably going to come in a bit below that then?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I think the -- without trying to forecast anything, we've got more opportunities for other investments in the business going into 2013 as we see it than using the cash for share repurchases. If none of those come to fruition, then we'll turn around and put the cash to work in a different way.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And the CapEx number for the year, Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong","About $25 million to $30 million is our best estimate at this point, Bob.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","With respect to, I guess, the Webster business, can you quantify the impact if you'll ultimately switch to generalist nonexclusive relationship with A-dec?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Erin, we wouldn't comment at this time because we're obviously in the midst of discussing things with A-dec. We have a very strong relationship with them. We have great respect for their technology. And together, we're evaluating our options. But I would probably not comment on anything else at this time.","Erin  E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, there were some recent launches of prescription heartworm medication at Walmart and through other channels. Do you anticipate this to have any sort of impact on your business?","Scott P. Anderson","We do not see an impact in the short term.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Block with SunTrust.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Scott, maybe just some more color on dental equipment, specifically basic. I think go back in the past 4 quarters, your basic went from sort of flat year-over-year to low single, low single and now a little bit more of a step-up to mid-single-digits. So can you talk about visibility there, maybe backlog? And then is this something where you're finally seeing some new projects come online? Or is this just a situation where some of those deferrals are finally being pulled forward?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Jonathan, we're definitely seeing some deferrals. In terms of the smaller deals. I would say we have not to date seen the larger projects come back. But anecdotally, as we talked to our equipment specialists throughout the country and our largest partners, the projects planning is beginning to pick up. So that's one of the reasons that gives us confidence going forward. It's also something our sales reps spend a lot of time sitting down with their customers and planning for the future. And even though we've been through 3 flattish years for the dental economy, the prospects over the next decade for dentistry are so fantastic that part of our job is to make sure we help our customers prepare for that.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then maybe just some color on your comments around market growth for dental. If you can remind me well, you think the market grew, I guess, for you guys over the past 12 months, if you would. And then in your assumptions, are you making the assumption that the dental market picks up significantly and more of a flat line from where you've been the past couple of quarters?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I'd say looking back, consumable market probably was a 1% to 2% grower in the last 12 months, and the equipment market was probably in that 2% to 4% market. So we feel like we took some share in the consumables side and probably took a definitely larger share on the equipment side. So I think we see strengthening, but it's still a gradual strengthening and not near the historic norms in terms of growth rates. It's particularly given the fact that unemployment still sits above 8% and consumer confidence, while somewhat improving, is still a bit fragile.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then just last one, just from -- a detail.  When do you guys lap -- trying to is [ph] on the Vet side? What quarter does that come on in fiscal year '12?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Jonathan, we've already lapped that. It lapped on January 1. I think it goes back to what Scott talked about is that the flea and tick season has gotten off to a roaring, start which I think is helping everybody. There's a lot of volume in flea and tick and heartworm right now.","Jonathan Block - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And very last one then I'll jump off. Just from a capital allocation standpoint, I now you guys you touched on it earlier, but without showing your cards too much, where do you see some of the biggest opportunities when you look across Dental, Vet and rehab right now?","Scott P. Anderson","I see them in all 3 businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions on the Medical segment. You mentioned in the press release, do you still think that the uncertainty with the health care system will kind of weigh on the equipment in fiscal '13. Just hoping if you can maybe give some sort of quantification around that, if possible. And also you talked about your position to take advantage with acquisition, et cetera. Are there any acquisitions in that segment that are baked into the guidance? Or that would still be addition on the kind of what you're looking at for this year?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I'll talk about the market and then flip it over to Steve for the guidance. We see the equipment market as not degrading but being flattish this coming year, and we feel confident that in a tough competitive environment, the advantages that Patterson Medical brings to bear in terms of size, vertical integration, technical service capabilities give us the ability to hold our own and a full expectation that Patterson Medical would grow beyond market. And Steve, do want to touch on the guidance?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I would just -- we challenge all of our operating units to grow faster than their market. And obviously, some element of that could be provided by acquisitions. But there's no specific acquisition targets built into our guidance. Never has been.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Bednar with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to start on the medical side. Scott or Steve, I believe in the past you'd talked about margin improvements for this business coming from improved product sourcing that came from the DCC acquisition. I'm just wondering if you could provide an update on where we're at in the process and to what extent we should expect this improved sourcing to provide a lift to medical margins in fiscal '13.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, that definitely is one of the key strategies of our medical unit. They have a goal to move operating margins into the upward teens over time, and I wouldn't want to quantify what is coming out of that initiative here in the short term. But definitely, it's one of their key initiatives, which I would say they're executing very well on. Steve, do you want to comment on just their operating margin improvement here in the fourth quarter?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I think most of their margin improvement you saw in the fourth quarter was a combination some pricing, but most of it was due to expense management. And they rightsized some of these acquisitions we've made over the last 30 months. They are working very hard as is the rest of the organization, but medical particularly with their international scope on their sourcing. Dave Sproat [ph], not quite a year ago promoted one of his VPs or assigned one of his VPs to totally international sourcing, and they're in the throes of that in multiple ways. So it's very difficult to tell you when you're going to start to see it. But as Scott said, we expect those margins to start moving up. You saw some of it, I think, in this fourth quarter as we've sourced product differently, smarter, and we expect some of that to carry over into the other divisions as well.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And I guess, then maybe switching over to CEREC, an impressive quarter from the system sales, no doubt. But I guess, and I know you touched on this a bit, but I guess the question why do another trade-up program or why is one necessary, especially if previous trader programs seemed to have been maybe a distraction in selling new CERECs. So maybe you can just talk on maybe the puts and takes there?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I talked about it before that the really reason has been the excitement and the acceptance of the 4.0 software, and really with Sirona taking on a, customer-first approach. We felt it was important to go back one more time. The summer months traditionally are slower months on the new user front. And we obviously have a lot of momentum coming off the fiscal year. We grew our new users for the year in the high teens, and we're slightly down in trade-ups because we had a very robust trade-up program under the gate. So we feel we can balance the 2 over the summer and also absolutely maintain the momentum of CEREC going forward.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Okay, helpful. And then finally, last question for me and I'll hop back in queue here. Just wondering about the gain of the quarter, if you can comment on February, March, April, just how you saw dental trends really play out throughout each of those months. Was it sustained? Did you see any strengthening, weakening, any month stronger than another?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I would just say at a high level, I think the entire industry benefited in January, February, March from a mild winter, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. So on a macro level going forward, we see continued strengthening of the equipment market. We see the consumable market continuing to slowly strengthen. And one of the encouraging things is just seeing the growth of sort at the basic dentistry -- crown and bridge endodontics, things like that. But there's no doubt that the winter months had a bit of a tailwind because of the mild winter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Steve, looks like you've made pretty good progress on the working capital front here. What should we expect for fiscal '13, I guess, particularly on the inventory front? And if you could give us some sense of where you see operating cash flow shaking out for the year, that would be helpful.","R. Stephen Armstrong","I don't think you're going to see significant changes, Brandon. We continue to work on our -- all levels of our working capital, trying to make it as efficient as possible. But I would also take you back and remind you that Patterson's full-service value add, we carry probably more inventory than some people might want to justify just because we want that capacity to deliver to the customer immediately. So I don't think you're going to see any significant changes in it.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the acquisitions, can you quantify -- what's the Surgical Synergies deal contributed in the fourth quarter? And then it looks like the American vet supply run rate seems to be coming in a little bit lower than the $25 million I think you pointed to earlier in the year. Can you give us a sense of how that business is performing on a core basis? And then maybe the EPS impact from that deal in the fourth quarter?","R. Stephen Armstrong","I don't think I can quantify -- well, first of all, Surgical Synergies a had very small impact. We completed that transaction in April, so it had very little impact. It was only about a $10 million deal. We had sold to that company previously. So when you look at the net revenue contribution we'll get out of it, it will be less than that $10 million of historical revenues they recorded. But with regard to AVSC, we're very pleased with that acquisition. It worked out well. As with most acquisitions, you do get some fallout in shifting, and it becomes -- the further away from the acquisition date you'd get, the more difficult it is to track the exact revenue contribution. But Brandon, we're very happy with that transaction.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to be clear, your formal guidance did not assume any incremental buyback and assumes that the shares just remain constant, that's within the formal numbers?","R. Stephen Armstrong","That is correct.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over for closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson","Douglas, thank you. Thanks, everyone, for taking time, and thank you for interest in Patterson. We look forward to meeting with you at the conclusion of our first quarter. Have a great summer.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today. We'd like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"16821":["Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) Q4 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call May 22, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ann Gugino - Vice President of Strategy & Planning","Scott Anderson - Chairman, CEO, and President","R.

Baird","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Patterson Companies' fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings announcement conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ann Gugino. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. ","Ann Gugino","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our chairman and chief executive officer; and Steve Armstrong, our executive vice president and CFO. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to review this material.","Also, please note that in this morning's conference call, we will be referencing our adjusted results for the quarter in Steve's detailed financial discussion. Adjusted results exclude the impact of the restructuring charge for the medical divestiture. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release.","Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we've provided financial guidance for fiscal 2015 in our press release as well as in the financial slide presentation supplementing this conference call that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting at 11 a.m. Central time for a period of 1 week. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Ann, and welcome everyone to this morning\u2019s conference call. As you saw in today\u2019s earnings release, Patterson Companies consolidated revenues rose approximately 14% in the fiscal fourth quarter. Though the year over year growth is attributable to our acquisition of NVS, we believe we were able to maintain market share in a very challenging macro-environment.","Severe weather conditions did play a role during the quarter, and no doubt you\u2019ve heard about weather on other conference calls. It did have an impact on us, along with currency fluctuations and a particularly strong prior year fourth quarter comparable.","These factors combined to constrain the company\u2019s 2014 fourth quarter performance. As we enter the spring months, we were encouraged to see our business activity normalize. On the revenue side, we exceeded $4 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2014. ","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we made during the year to add scale to our business model and leverage our industry leading platform. Looking back on fiscal 2014, we took a number of steps to both secure short term results and set the stage for future success.","Importantly, we continued to make key investments in the business. We purchased NVS to expand our veterinary footprint. We reinforced our technology leadership position with our dental customers. We took steps to strengthen our medical business. As part of our capital allocation strategy and commitment to our shareholders, we significantly raised the dividend and executed on our stock repurchase plan. And on the operations side of the business, our IT platform investments have allowed us to streamline parts of the organization and redeploy our resources to high-potential initiatives.","All of these moves stem from the strategic plan that we rolled out to our leadership group almost a year ago. We will continue to execute against that plan. It guides our decision making and priorities.","Now let\u2019s take a look at our operational performance in the 2014 fourth quarter and full year, starting with dental. This business, which accounts for just under 60% of our total sales, reported fiscal 2014 fourth quarter sales down approximately 1.5% on a constant currency basis to $622.8 million versus the year ago quarter. ","Contributing to dental sales in the quarter were slight gains on a constant currency basis and consumable product sales and solid growth in basic equipment sales. Notably, this was our second quarter in a row of strong dental core equipment sales. ","While technology sales were down in the fourth quarter, this is against excellent performance in the year ago quarter and we remain confident in the underlying strength of our technology and services platform. Our fiscal fourth quarter dental results were also impacted by unfavorable Canadian currency fluctuations and their effect on pricing in that geography. ","Patterson Dental is poised to continue to capitalize on the growing digital trend, and we continue to offer new radiography and CEREC CAD\/CAM technologies along with Patterson\u2019s unmatched sales, service, and support offerings. ","During fiscal 2014, our North American CEREC user group base grew in the high single-digits, and now totals over 15,000 dentists. The growth prospects for our technology offerings, combined with the fact that there is considerable opportunity for dentists to invest in their practices, position us well going forward. ","Moving on now to Patterson Veterinary, which comprises nearly one-third of total sales. Fourth quarter sales of the Patterson Veterinary unit increased over 77% from the prior year period at $361.8 million. U.S. sales rose to $205.8 million, and included a nearly 25% increase in equipment sales.","In the U.S., we saw a slight decrease in consumable veterinary sales of medications and supplies, driven by a weather-delayed flea and tick season. Strong growth in equipment sales reflects successful investments in partnerships with our equipment manufacturers and Patterson\u2019s best-in-class service and support model. Our performance represents the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in equipment sales. ","In the quarter, we continued to execute against our strategy to be a national provider of veterinary equipment and services. We had another quarter of strong contributions from NVS, our UK-based veterinary business. ","Our strategy for growth is to increase both our equipment and technical service offerings to take advantage of the favorable marketplace dynamics we are seeing, as pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in veterinary care for their pets grow. Veterinarians will require sophisticated equipment and capabilities in their clinics and hospitals to meet this market need. ","Turning now to Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, which now represents approximately 11% of total company revenues. Sales in the fourth quarter were essentially flat with prior year levels after accounting for the planned divestiture of noncore product lines in the fiscal first quarter.","Results included approximately a $0.06 per share charge for the previously announced restructuring, which was completed during the fourth quarter and reduced fiscal year results by $0.13 per share.","From both a strategic and financial perspective, the divestiture was the right course of action. We can now focus our efforts on those rehabilitation areas with the highest growth potential. We also expect the restructuring will generate annual operational savings of approximately $2 million or $0.01 per share, beginning in fiscal 2015.","We are excited about the new leadership in this division and the approach they are taking to reposition the business in our selected markets. We continue to be encouraged by this business\u2019s potential, given our substantial industry leadership, as well as our extensive branded and proprietary product and service offerings. Patterson Medical is poised to capture additional market share as conditions improve. ","Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our information technology initiative, which crosses all three businesses. As we\u2019ve previously stated, we\u2019ve undertaken this effort in order to support the company\u2019s future growth, further enhance the customer experience, and secure productivity gains going forward.","We are now well into our second year of this initiative, which we see as a five-year effort to overhaul our primary systems. We are taking a phased approach, and are currently in the design and blueprinting stage of our IT investment. We will update you in the coming quarter as we begin piloting and implementation.","We believe that we have already started to benefit from certain of our technology improvements. Specifically, our progress includes making substantial enhancements to our dental and veterinary websites that make it easier for our customers to do business with us. Patterson is now a stronger and more efficient ecommerce player. That has helped us serve our customers and enhance our sales and marketing efforts. ","Also during fiscal 2014, we completed the company-wide rollout of a new sales tool called Pat Edge that quickly and concisely puts more market and customer information in the hands of our sales representatives. This is one more way that we have continued to reinforce our already strong customer service offerings. ","Our information technology investment is critical to improve scale in our business platform and provide Patterson with the flexibility to adjust as opportunities warrant in order to accommodate growth. Our customers will continue to benefit from improvements as we further execute on this strategy.","So looking ahead to 2015, we enter the year with a conservative view of our markets due to the relatively mixed performances in global economies. We expect conditions in our markets to be pretty much the same as they were in fiscal 2014. That said, we are confident in our ability to execute in any economic environment.","With the streamlined and more efficient organization, we believe we have positioned Patterson for the future, and we continue to be bullish on the long term prospects for our company. With that as a backdrop, we are setting our fiscal 2015 earnings per share guidance range from $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share. This represents a 5% to 10% growth from fiscal 2014 EPS of $2.10 per diluted share.","Now, I\u2019ll ask Steve to review the financials. Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","Thank you, Scott. As Ann mentioned earlier in the call, my comments will focus on our adjusted results, which exclude the impact of the restructuring charges for the medical segment. In addition, for comparative purposes, the operating metrics will generally include the results for NVS.","The impact of foreign currency exchange was greater this period than recent experience, which is why Scott provided certain growth amounts for sales on a constant currency basis. Our consolidated sales growth was negatively impacted by 50 basis points in the quarter, and operations absorbed an unfavorable $1.2 million swing in currency transactions expense, predominantly from our Canadian operations.","The sales growth in our dental business absorbed nearly 100 basis points unfavorable currency movement, but also experienced gross margin compression due to the weakening of the Canadian dollar during the last half of the fiscal year. With a high percentage of products sold in Canada purchased in U.S. dollars, our dental gross margins came under pressure in this market. ","In addition, our consolidated gross margins reflect the impact from the acquisition of NVS and the change in mix within the historic businesses during the quarter. Despite a relatively soft sales quarter, we were able to improve our operating expense ratio through our expense management initiatives.","Scott stated that we have taken steps to streamline the organization and redeploy assets to higher potential opportunities. To accomplish this, we took a $3 million charge in the quarter, principally for severance costs. A portion of the annual savings from this effort will allow us to fund some of our strategic initiatives while the remainder is expected to improve our operating performance.","Consistent with earlier quarters, fiscal fourth quarter 2014 operating expenses included approximately $2.5 million pretax, or $0.02 per diluted share of incremental cost, from our planned information technology investments. ","On a comparable basis, our adjusted consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2014 improved by 20 basis points to 9.9%, which was one of our goals entering the year. This comparison excludes the operations of NVS, the impact of the planned information technology investments, and the medical restructuring charges.","By segment, our fiscal adjusted operating margins were 10.9% for dental, 5% for veterinary, and 13% for medical. Note that operating margin for the dental business excludes the incremental $10 million of information technology investments and veterinary excludes NVS.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fiscal fourth quarter was 34.1%, a 20 basis point increase from the prior year due primarily to favorable items in the year ago period. Looking ahead, we anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015. This will be in line with our annual rate for fiscal 2014 after excluding the unfavorable impact of the restructuring costs.","Not including NVS, our DSOs increased 4 days to 46 days for the fourth quarter, while inventory turns were 7.2 compared to 7.1 last fiscal year. The majority of our balance sheet changes result from the NVS acquisition.","Three additional items of note on the balance sheet, beginning with accounts receivable. Due the timing of sales within the quarter, and the relative change between March and April volumes year over year, our accounts receivable increased approximately $35 million. ","Second, as we noted in earlier releases this year, our dental equipment inventories have increased year over year as we rebuilt our CEREC inventory from last year\u2019s depleted levels following the introduction and production ramp of the Omnicam product during fiscal 2013. ","And lastly, we deployed our cash reserves to pay down the advances under our revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisition of NVS earlier this year. You may recall that we had drawn $135 million on our revolver to originally fund NVS.","We will reevaluate the need to place a longer term component of debt for this acquisition early in calendar 2015, as part of the refinancing of the $250 million tranche of debt that matures in March of 2015.","In the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled $46 million compared to $120 million in the year ago period. This decrease primarily resulted from the increase in accounts receivable I mentioned previously, the timing of settlements within our equipment financing business, and the timing of accounts payable disbursements between this year\u2019s fourth quarter and the prior year\u2019s quarter. We expect these timing matters to return in fiscal 2015, such as next year\u2019s cash generated from operations should exceed earnings by a comfortable margin. ","We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned approximately $20 million to our shareholders in dividends and for the year, we returned over $85 million.","In March, the board of directors increased our regular quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.20 per share from the prior quarterly rate of $0.16 per share. This increase demonstrates our confidence in Patterson\u2019s ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock, with a value of $49 million, leaving approximately 22 million shares available under our current authorization. In fiscal 2014, we repurchased a total of 2.4 million shares with a value of approximately $97 million. ","Our capex in the fourth quarter totaled $10 million and included payments for normal replacements, as well as the ERP project. For fiscal 2015, we are currently estimating capex of approximately $45 million. Over half of this amount is directly related to the ERP system, with this year\u2019s estimate to be the largest single year of spending on that project.","On a final note, earlier in the call, Scott gave you our EPS guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share for fiscal 2015. The base assumptions we used to build that range include stable North American and international markets with conditions similar to fiscal 2014, no impact from share repurchases that may occur during the year, the long term extension of $250 million of debt that is due in March, and no material acquisitions during the year.","In addition, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, since we operate the business with a longer-term view, we would like to provide you with a few items to consider as you model our fiscal 2015.","First, we have slightly more than one quarter of operations from NVS to grandfather into our results. This impact is expected to be similar to what we had reported for the past several quarters. Next, with the medical business restructuring now complete, with the sale of the remaining two product lines that had been identified, this business will have a modest revenue headwind of approximately 4.5% for all of fiscal 2015, resulting from these divestitures.","Several of the expense reduction initiatives we undertook in fiscal 2014 more heavily impacted the latter half of the year. Specifically, we adjusted the ESOP expense estimate in the third quarter while we took a $3 million charge in the fourth quarter.","Also, as a consideration for the second half of the year, our guidance does not anticipate a winter as severe as we experienced this year.","The final reminder is that a significant portion of our operating expense structure is fixed or semivariable in nature. Because sales levels tend to be higher in the second half of the year, we generally gain more expense leverage in that period with our first and second quarter operations not improving at a rate that would be expected for the entire year.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Scott for some closing comments. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Steve. As we enter fiscal 2015, we believe we can capture market share as we continue to exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. Our very strong strategic partnerships continue to grow and strengthen across all of our businesses. Wrapped with Patterson\u2019s unparalleled service and support platform, we continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers.","Additionally, we are proud to have been honored earlier this year when Patterson Companies was named to the 2014 Forbes list of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America, and believe that this further validates our business model. Patterson is one of only four companies in 2014 that have appeared on the list three times in the past seven years. Congratulations to all of our employees who have embraced our core values and are responsible for this recognition and our fantastic company culture.","So before I open up the call for your questions, let me reiterate what gives us confidence in the new fiscal year. It stems from the fact that in the prior year, we set the table for growth going forward. In addition to purchasing NVS, we reinforced our leadership position in technology with our dental customers. We restructured the medical business and hired new leadership to focus on the most attractive segments. ","As part of our capital allocation strategy and commitment to our shareholders, we significantly raised the dividend and executed on our stock repurchase plan. Our IT platform investments have allowed us to streamline parts of the organization and redeploy our resources to high-potential initiatives.","Finally, we also took steps to augment our already strong board of directors. We added two highly accomplished executives to the board recently: Neil Schrimsher, who is president and CEO of Applied Industrial Technologies, and Sarena Lin, who serves as corporate vice president of strategy and business development for Cargill. Both bring broad-based experience and a fresh perspective. ","We know that with Neil\u2019s deep wholesale distribution and executive leadership experience and Sarena\u2019s vast global and strategic management expertise our board will be an even greater resource for Patterson\u2019s shareholders and management. We believe that Patterson is well-positioned for the future.","Now, Steve and I would like to take any questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And our first question is from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. ","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Steve, on the ESOP expense, did you say you took a $3 million charge in Q4?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","That had to do with the repositioning or fine-tuning we did to the staffing throughout the organization. The adjustment for the ESOP was in the third quarter.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","So could you give us what the ESOP funding was in Q4? And I guess what you guys are baking in for 2015?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","We\u2019re looking at about a 3% contribution level for the eligible employee base, which is predominantly the U.S. based employees. Should be somewhere between $10 million and $12 million. And in the fourth quarter, I believe that we recorded a little over $2 million of expense in the fourth quarter. ","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","And just going back to the dental segment, consumables came in kind of light versus our expectations. What do you think 2015 is going to look like? Do you think it\u2019s going to be very similar? Or do you think we\u2019ll see a little uptick?","Scott Anderson ","I\u2019ll just answer the weather question first, because obviously there\u2019s been a lot said publicly about it. The Midwest, Ohio Valley, northeast, southeast were particularly hard hit. It\u2019s tough to quantify, but probably 100 to 200 basis point impact on our consumable number. And I would say the severity of it really disrupted supply chain and selling cycle in the quarter.","That being said, we saw the business normalize across all business lines and in all three businesses in April, and have seen sequential improvement into March. So I would say from a marketing perspective, I would expect the market growth to be close to GDP, and it would be our expectation to exceed that on the consumable end.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","And since you gave us the weather impact for dental, could you give us the impact for the vet consumables, which was pretty weak as well?","Scott Anderson ","Yeah, vet\u2019s a little different, and I think it\u2019s consistent with what our main competitors said. You had two impacts on the veterinarians. One, you had visits impacted with sick pets, but two, you also had a lag on the flea and tick season. And I would say just as we had predicted when we came out of April, we\u2019re seeing nice growth into May.","And I just want to add one piece to Steve\u2019s on the ESOP, because I think it\u2019s important to sort of put that in context. You know, one of the things we always evaluate on our compensation strategy is the performance of the business, and really the strength of the underlying markets. ","And our strategy over the past five years has been, like many companies, very conservative on increasing short term cash compensation. And at Patterson, we\u2019ve had retirement programs that really have been on the high end of market norms. ","So going into the coming years, our strategy really is around rebuilding that short term compensation at market or above market levels, and then we will determine the retirement program growth by company performance against the market. And obviously, things that we\u2019re doing to improve productivity and efficiency all help us support that compensation philosophy. ","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","Two last quick ones. On the vet equipment side, it\u2019s a pretty low base, but we\u2019ve seen some pretty good growth. Are there any specific products or categories you can call out that are driving that growth? And then also, on the IT initiative, are you seeing an increase in ecommerce ordering? Or I guess how are you going to measure the success of those investments?","Scott Anderson ","On the vet equipment, we\u2019ve seen nice growth across the board, strong growth in digital, as well as just more traditional equipment. We\u2019ve done a great job with programs throughout the country on sitting down with our veterinary customers on helping them realize their dreams and building new offices.","So it really is a nice balance to the portfolio, and more than anything, I\u2019m very proud of our veterinary team. I was just with all the sales people at our national sales meeting last week in Fort Worth, and they\u2019re really embracing the strategy and seeing that they can really change the lives of their customers and really help their veterinarians deliver great care and have a partner that stands behind them that not only can sell great things, but more importantly, can fix and service them and keep them up and going.","So you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a small percentage of our business today, but it\u2019s a strategy that the vet team is executing nicely against. What was the second part of your question again?","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","The IT initiative.","Scott Anderson ","Yeah, on ecommerce, Patterson\u2019s been a pioneer in ecommerce going back 20 years, even to when I was a sales person in San Francisco, where we were getting orders electronically from our customers. In our dental business, over 80% of our consumable revenue stream comes to us electronically.","But we realized you need to continually make your website more and more robust, better images, better search capabilities, and we\u2019re excited about the growth on that side. On the vet side, I think that\u2019s probably what has been really exciting. We used the back-end technology that we used on our dental website to then replicate it on the veterinary side, and we\u2019ve seen some dramatic growth in our web traffic over the last year.","And we believe it\u2019s that combination of great electronic commerce, easy to do business with your customer, and then add in great sales expertise and technical serve expertise that is a winning combination for the professionals we call on.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. ","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Just going back to the dental equipment, coming into the year I think you guys were looking for high single-digit growth in that category. Clearly, as we close the books here, it looks like it finished down slightly year over year. I just wonder if you could talk about what the major drivers were of that shortfall. And then I guess more importantly, as you look out to 2015, any thoughts on the key growth categories within dental equipment, specifically maybe around CAD\/CAM and how you\u2019re thinking about imaging?","Scott Anderson ","Great question. I would say starting on the core equipment side, we saw a nice pickup in the traditional core equipment over the last six months of the year, but for the full year, the category was essentially flat. And that category has been flat really going back to 2010. So while encouraged, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to call a breakout in traditional equipment. I would say it\u2019s a good sign to see not only our growth but to see industry growth in this category.","Talking about total market share and equipment growth, I think it\u2019s important to put a few things in perspective. One is in this quarter, we were up against really three really strong consecutive years in equipment. Going back we were up 11%, up 6% last year, up 14%, and then this year slightly down. So it\u2019s clear from a market share perspective that we\u2019ve taken share over that time.","With regard to the technology piece, and I think that\u2019s important to take a long view on as well, and to me that would include CEREC, digital sensors from [Schick], digital [pans] and [unintelligible] machines, we have said repeatedly that this category in total is a 10% grower over time.","And there will be times where you exceed that, and times where you come under that. And if you go back and look at our results over the last five years, that is exactly what we have produced, roughly 10% compounded annual growth rate in technology.","I would say these products, without doubt, have the opportunity for the foreseeable future to grow to a 10% rate over time. And the CEREC and CAD\/CAM category, particularly in my opinion, could accelerate at a pace much quicker. So the fact that we\u2019ve delivered 10% compounded growth in technology against a pretty tough macroeconomic background, I think, is one of the things that gives us so much confidence about really the digital transformation opportunity in front of us, but more importantly, in front of our customers. ","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs ","And one follow up, maybe taking a step back. It sounds like the guidance is really calling for conditions to be similar to what we saw in 2014. This obviously implies the market growth that you guys are assuming is still well below that normalized 4% to 6% growth range. Some of your competitors, I think, are calling for a little bit better of an environment in 2015, in 2014 versus last year, particularly in the U.S. I\u2019m just curious what factors you\u2019re seeing and what keeps you more cautious on the health of the underlying markets.","Scott Anderson ","I think what we really wanted to do, when we set up guidance, was to take a conservative approach to the underlying markets. Because we did not want to build a plan with an assumption of economic tailwinds. So what we\u2019ve done and how we\u2019ve positioned the company going into the year and the moves we\u2019ve made to be able to really make a commitment to deliver performance even in a flat underlying market is what we\u2019re saying. You know, do we want our markets to improve? Absolutely. And if that happens, there would be upside to where we\u2019ve put out our year. But really, that was our strategy on how we built the year from both a revenue and profitability standpoint.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. ","John Kreger - William Blair","Maybe just a quick follow up on the dental equipment market. How\u2019s the pipeline at this point? And within that pipeline, are you seeing it dominated more by upgrades, particularly around CEREC or more from new users?","Scott Anderson ","I would say we continue to see very high customer interest in CEREC CAD\/CAM with the Omnicam leading the way as the product of choice. We have competition in the market, and as we\u2019ve talked about before, we think viable competition is a positive sign for the long term growth of the category, and that more folks talking about chair-side CAD\/CAM, the closer we\u2019ll get to a tipping point for that technology.","So we\u2019re encouraged, one, by the core equipment trends, and are very careful not to call a breakout. But I would say the future for digital technologies, when you talk to customers, and the feedback we got through the spring selling season at dental meetings is, as I said before, these categories have a long runway of double-digit growth opportunities ahead of them.","John Kreger - William Blair ","And then a second question relating to NVS. It did a lot better than what we were expecting. Can you comment on what drove the outperformance, if it beat your expectations as well? And what sort of organic growth do you see for the U.K. vet business once you anniversary the purchase?","Scott Anderson ","I think we\u2019re very pleased with the integration and probably most importantly the cultural integration of NVS and how our management team in the U.K. just hit the ground running right after the announcement was made in August. And George Henriques, our president of our veterinary unit, I think, has done a great job in helping connect information that will help that business leverage marketing programs and other things we have here in the States.","They have exceeded on the revenue line, but also operationally. I would say from a growth perspective, we would say the underlying characteristics are fairly similar to the States, with the underlying market growing 3% to 4%.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","What\u2019s a reasonable timeframe for growth in the medical business, and would the proceeds from a potential divestiture be more productively applied to maybe share repurchases?","Scott Anderson ","I would say we would look, as the next 12 to 24 months, and the challenge for the medical team is to grow that business. We feel like it\u2019s positioned well. The underlying markets, we feel, will be stable, probably flat this next year and outside of a government action of contraction or austerity, that company is focused on growth.","You know, as a reminder, it\u2019s our highest margin business, it\u2019s a great contributor to profitability, and it does drive cross-company synergies. So one of the things we\u2019ve talked about before is we always evaluate how the pieces of the company fit together and how we can leverage that scale for the benefit of our customers, but also the benefit of our shareholders. ","So we still have a very positive outlook for that franchise. We\u2019ve talked about it before. It\u2019s five times nearest its largest competitor. We feel it\u2019s in a great space, physical therapy, and its attachment to an aging population and how that industry will be impacted by future demand gives us confidence that having it as part of the Patterson portfolio and having some patience to have that investment payoff is the right thing for our shareholders. ","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And what about the $250 million in short term debt? Would you seek to maybe raise more than you\u2019re retiring there and use the excess to buy back stock?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","Our intention today is to refinance that $250 million that comes due in March of 2015, push it out probably another 10 years at least. That gives us a good balanced capital structure for the business. Could we take on more debt? Absolutely. I talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about the possibility of at least funding what we paid for NVS.","Our priorities continue to be to invest back in the business first, share repurchase sort of being the third leg of the stool, with the dividend being stuck in the middle. And depending on market conditions and a lot of things, whether it\u2019s acquisitions. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look first. But if we can\u2019t deploy the cash appropriately and the stock market gives us an opportunity to do it, we\u2019d be much more aggressive on a share repurchase program.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","What were the reasons behind the DSO build?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","Primarily that spike in the receivables we saw at the end of the year. It was more of a timing issue, where April sales were quite a bit more robust than early in the period, as Scott alluded to in his comments. And we just couldn\u2019t turn the cash fast enough to hold down that receivable balance.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. ","Jon Block - Stifel Nicolaus ","You commented on April, and then you said things improved sequentially, but I think you called out March. Just to clarify, did you say dental trends had improved further into May? Can you circle back on that one?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","Yeah, thanks for the pickup. My intent was to say that the consumable business sequentially improved not only in April, but that it has in May as well. We\u2019re so shell-shocked by the winter that we still think we\u2019re in March.","Jon Block - Stifel ","Fair enough. And then Scott, just to take a step back, if you can just sort of detail how things played out throughout last quarter. In other words, maybe I\u2019m just a little bit surprised by the magnitude of the [unintelligible]. You got on the call in late February, you spoke a couple of times to a decent backlog. I know that was more specific to basic, but still, a decent backlog. And then you\u2019re referencing that things picked up in April. So what played out throughout March maybe that led to the extent of the revenue and EPS shortfall at the end of the year. ","Scott Anderson ","Late February was tough. March continued to be tough. And then I\u2019m actually very proud of our U.S. and Canadian employees on how they fought back in April. Because against a very good April. And Steve just talked about it in the last question, in terms of our DSO, we put up actually the largest April we\u2019ve ever had in the company. And I hate to talk about single months. So sort of the magnitude of the hole that we got into in March we did not anticipate when we were sitting there in February. ","It\u2019s a little easier to call out backlogs in the core equipment side of the business, because generally those are projects with longer selling times and install times, so you have a little more clarity around the core business. The technology side of the business, as we\u2019ve talked about many times, is a shorter sales cycle. And we really feel like we had a disruption in the selling cycle throughout late February and March.","And I would say we had some issues in Canada that have been rectified and they\u2019re off to a good start, particularly on the [unintelligible]. Probably one area that underperformed that I would say we\u2019re disappointed in was the yield on the trade up of the CEREC was lower than we had anticipated. And sort of the silver lining in that is what we found is that there\u2019s a very high level of satisfaction among our Bluecam users. And many customers who had signed up to upgrade to Omnicam have decided to continue to use their Bluecam.","That being said, 95% of the new users we\u2019re selling, and we had a very good quarter for CEREC in new users, are all Omnicams. So we sit here, I think, with two great products. The best product in the market at [80,000] and the best product at the high end. So I would say those are some of the factors that sort of led to the shortfall in the quarter.","Jon Block - Stifel ","And last one, just to shift gears over to vet, the contribution from NVS was big, but just isolating the U.S., you did see a deceleration from sort of 7% to one and change. I guess both quarters had a bad month of weather. January last quarter February this quarter. So has anything changed dynamics in that? And then there\u2019s been some chirping about the competitive landscape between distributors, and maybe you can just talk to your relationship on the exclusivity with Idexx. ","Scott Anderson ","I think the underlying fundamentals of the vet business are solid. I think just the dynamics around weather impact hit that business a little harder, but that\u2019s a one-time event that goes away. And we wouldn\u2019t change our positive outlook on the vet space at all. From a competitive standpoint, I think you have three strong strategic players that are looking to do the same thing. That\u2019s bring great value to our customers. And we\u2019re excited to compete against them every day. ","I would say on the Idexx front, we continue to be very pleased with our relationship with Idexx. We think they\u2019re a great company that drives innovation, and as we\u2019ve talked about going back now almost two years, it was always our intent that we wanted to be a strategic partner with them. And we\u2019re excited about some of the new products that they\u2019re going to launch here in the next 12 months.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group. ","Michael Cherny - ISI Group","Along those lines, on the competitive dynamics, on particularly the vet market, but I guess also across the entire book of business, can you talk about how pricing trends are moving for consumables? You talked about a healthy market from a competitive perspective in vet, but are you seeing any type of pricing pressure in any business? Are you able to take price in any specific line? I\u2019m just trying to get a general sense of what you\u2019re seeing across your portfolio.","Scott Anderson ","Great question. I would first couch it as I believe we\u2019re in very rational markets. That being said, if you go back over the last five years, these markets have seen low underlying market growth, which I think increases competitive pressures across the board. But that being said, I don\u2019t see any irrational behavior in the marketplace. ","And you know, the real focus is how do we help our customers across all three businesses drive their future growth. So I believe we still have the ability across the board to take price, both at a manufacture and distribution level. I think your price increases are going to be much more muted, though, this year versus last year, given the impact of the medical device tax. And that will create a bit of a headwind. ","Michael Cherny - ISI Group ","And then Sirona announced just recently the next CEREC major anniversary celebration. As you think about that, given in the past you\u2019ve been a venue for them to launch new products, is there any thought into how that factors into your full year guidance? I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but how some of their product introductions will factor into your growth outlook?","Scott Anderson ","What we love about Sirona is their innovation pipeline is deep, and I think they\u2019ve got an incredibly talented group of R&D folks in [unintelligible]. We don\u2019t comment on what\u2019s in their pipeline or what their schedule of innovation is. Obviously, next year is traditionally a big year, as an IDS year. We\u2019re very focused in the Patterson business on presenting the products we have, and we feel we\u2019ve got great breakthrough products, really, in the Omnicam and just an amazing product in the Bluecam at an $80,000 price point. So I would say there\u2019s no new product innovation built into our guidance. ","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse ","Scott, I just wanted to follow up. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of questions regarding the growth in dental, and the growth in vet. And I appreciate the comments on weather, but I just want to make sure I\u2019m interpreting what you\u2019re saying correctly. You seem to suggest that March got incrementally a little bit better from February and maybe April, and maybe even May continued to get a little bit better. How should we think about the growth within those segments? If I look over the last four quarters, looking back over the last year, it kind of seemed like dental in that 2% to 3.5% range and maybe even a little bit stronger organically on the vet side. Is that kind of roughly where you\u2019d say we\u2019re trending today? ","Scott Anderson ","Yeah, I think you pretty much nailed it, and I think we talked about seeing real no marketable improvement to that. Just for clarification, the sequential improvement was in April and May. I misspoke earlier. Both February and March were tough months.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse ","And so when I look within the guidance that you put in the press release, and you say sort of stable North American and international markets, you mean stable at those rates we\u2019re seeing in April and May, not February and March, obviously?","Scott Anderson ","Exactly, but low growth. I mean, not the traditional 4% to 6% underlying growth. I would keep the underlying growth number closer to what you\u2019re seeing in the GDP number right now.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse ","And so Steve, maybe if I could just translate that through to margins, when I look at the sort of midpoint of your guidance range, if we assume that we\u2019re seeing revenue growth rates in that sort of range we\u2019re talking about, it doesn\u2019t really feel like we\u2019re making any sort of heroic assumptions on the margin line. And given all the cost initiatives that you\u2019ve gone through in the last year, I\u2019m wondering if you could just maybe put that into context for us a little bit in terms of what you\u2019re thinking with respect to profitability in fiscal 2015?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","There\u2019s a couple of items I would mention. With regard to guidance, if you take out the impact of NVS, our guidance pretty much assumes another 20 basis points of improvement in our operating margin. We\u2019ve done a lot to the organization over the last year plus to try to attack our expense structure with these low growth environments that Scott has alluded to and talked about. ","But we need some of that to reinvest in the business. We can\u2019t let it all just drop to the bottom line prudently. We could, you could harvest the business. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing for the long term. So some of what we have done to restructure the expense nature of the business, we\u2019re putting back into the business through various initiatives to push us into the next decade of this organization. ","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse ","I think in your prepared remarks you said that there was some mixed performances in the different global economies. As you look at your business today, what percentage of your revenues are U.S. versus international? And are there any specific international markets that you think are worth calling out, that you\u2019re maybe a little bit more concerned about, or paying a little bit more closer attention to?","Scott Anderson ","Sure, about one third of our revenues are international and the predominance of that would be in the U.K. and Canada. In the U.K. business, particularly on the physical therapy business, as we\u2019ve talked about, really went through a tough 24-month run with deep austerity cuts in that market. We feel that is behind us.","So I think what\u2019s important to take away is as we look out over the macro-environment over the next 24 months, and we see a lot of mixed signals, and we as a management team have said we\u2019re going to drive this business, we\u2019re going to drive strategies, we\u2019re going to do the right things for the long term, but we\u2019re going to drive operational performance regardless of what is happening in the underlying economies. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve set up the year internally with our business units. ","Operator","And our next question is a follow up from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","Just a couple of quick follow ups. First, looking at the segment margins, specifically in vet, it looks like it was down about 100 basis points year over year. Was that primarily due to weather, or was there anything else that impacted that?","Scott Anderson ","I would not call out weather on that. I think it was predominantly around margin pressures from manufacturers, particularly as you had some new products reenter the parasiticide market. So that\u2019s what put some pressure on their margins.","R. Stephen Armstrong ","The other thing is that they\u2019ve been investing fairly heavily, both in their service capabilities and their sales force. I think they\u2019ve added close to 30 sales people over the last 24 months. And so it takes a while to absorb those costs. So it\u2019s going to have somewhat of a short term impact on their operating performance.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","Scott, you said products have been reintroduced, so I assume you\u2019re talking about Sentinel Spectrum, then?","Scott Anderson ","Yes.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","And then in the past you guys gave us your market growth outlook. Would you say there\u2019s anything that\u2019s changed on the dental consumable or equipment side of the business?","Scott Anderson ","No, I\u2019d just go through it, once again, we expect dental consumables to grow at GDP over the next coming months. We would see the equipment market both in dental and vet, the underlying market, to be in the low single digits, and we would expect to grow faster than that. I will absolutely stick with the fact that we see the technology opportunity as a double digit grower for the foreseeable future. And we\u2019ll accomplish that over a longer period of time.","Medical market, we would see as flat. The only thing that could cause a change to that, I think, would be a government imposed contraction or austerity measures. So that\u2019s sort of the underlying assumptions we made as we built out strategies for the year.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","And Steve, did you provide D&A guidance?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","I did. I said about $45 million, with about half of it going into the ERP project. With the consultants or the integrators now on staff, or on board, we\u2019ll be incurring a lot of cost on that project in fiscal 2015.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","Was the $45 million for capital expenditures? Or that\u2019s depreciation and amortization?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Did you ask for D&A?","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray ","Yes.","R. Stephen Armstrong ","I didn\u2019t give you a number on it, but it would be very similar to this year.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS ","I was also going to ask about [unintelligible] pricing, but it sounds like we\u2019ve covered that. That\u2019s stable and still pretty good, so no real issue there. The one I wanted to hit on maybe just for a second here is that as far as weather impact on the overall company, some of your peers were able to quantify some of the impact, just based on number of days that distribution centers were closed in the quarter. So I was just curious if you had any of that data available, just to give a bit more color, or is that not really at your fingertips right now.","R. Stephen Armstrong ","I don\u2019t have the exact days in front of me, but I would say it\u2019s very similar to what some of our competitors reported in terms of number of days of closure and number of days of disrupted service from UPS. And as I pointed out before, it was really Midwest, Ohio Valley, southeast, northeast, and really a lot of communities that aren\u2019t used to handling tough weather. But I would say very consistent in terms of what\u2019s been put out there in the public market in terms of disruption to both supply chain and selling cycle.  ","Steven Valiquette - UBS ","And then I may have missed this, but did you guys provide an expected accretion number for NVS within the FY 2015 guidance? I know the previous guidance was for $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion in the first year post closing, but did you guys give any number for FY 2015 specifically?","R. Stephen Armstrong ","We\u2019re still looking at a nickel of benefit from that.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jason Bednar with Robert W. Baird.","Jason Bednar - Robert W. Baird","Scott, I know you\u2019re not going to like this question. I\u2019ll preface it with that up front. But you know, the questions I\u2019m getting from investors today are where does the buck stop here? Where is the accountability? I know you went through a round of layoffs on May 1, but the business continues to struggle, it seems like. At least our perception from the outside is it continues to struggle. Does some of this accountability have to go all the way up to the senior levels on the segment wide basis? Or even further up? Just how are you thinking about the board\u2019s opinion here, and generally just about performance here that\u2019s continued to struggle the past couple of years.","Scott Anderson ","I think your question\u2019s a little over the top in terms of our performance versus our peers. We really look at our company as a leader in both profitability in industries and efficiency. We are doing things strategically with the full support of our board and executing in the field, in an attempt to accomplish many things in a lower-growth environment, and are absolutely committing to making these investments to drive our long term strategy.","You know, so we see FY 2015 as a year where we will deliver operating margin performance even in a potential lower growth market. If we get some tailwind from our market, we will see the benefit from that. But I couldn\u2019t be more confident in the people and the Patterson company, and I think our long term supporters are going to benefit dramatically from the performance of this company over time.","I wish you would have listened to the whole call. ","Jason Bednar - Robert W. Baird ","That\u2019s my fault. I couldn\u2019t get out of a meeting I was in. So I do apologize for that, but it does feel like, whether I look at your performance versus peers on the consumable side, on the equipment side, if we\u2019re talking dental, it feels like the medical business continues to be somewhat disintermediated. It does feel like there\u2019s some secular issues here that aren\u2019t just one quarter, one year in the making.","Scott Anderson ","I would ask you to go back and listen to the call, Jeff. Thanks for your question.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to management for a brief wrap up.","Scott Anderson ","Thanks, operator. First of all, I\u2019d like to thank all the Patterson employees for the hard work and the things we\u2019ve accomplished to really position the company going forward. During the fourth quarter, we made progress on our strategic initiatives to offer best in class product and innovative services in order to fuel growth. As a result, we were able to maintain our market leadership position in a particularly challenging selling environment.","We\u2019re focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities that lie ahead as we continue to enhance our products and services, and we look forward to updating you in August on our first fiscal quarter. Thanks, everyone, and have a great summer. "],"16929":["Patterson Companies, Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","John Wright, in Investor Relations you may begin your conference.","John Wright","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Patterson President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Walchirk; and Chief Financial Officer, Don Zurbay.

The reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release.","This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon, Central Time, for a period of one week.","Now I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Walchirk.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, John and welcome everyone. As you saw in our earnings press release this morning, Patterson had a strong fourth quarter to conclude the first full year of our strategic plan where we made great progress. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth as internal sales grew 4.1%. Our Animal Health segment grew internal sales 4.1% as a result of continued strong performance in both our Companion Animal and Production Animal businesses. Our Dental segment grew internal sales 4.2% marking its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth fueled by strong growth across the equipment category and continued positive trending in consumables.","For the company, we achieved year-over-year quarterly EPS growth for the first time in over two years and delivered fiscal 2019 earnings in line with our guidance. Our strong fourth quarter results reflect the successful execution against our key initiatives throughout the year, including our efforts to improve the customer experience and our team's laser focus on stabilizing the core business. The combination of these helped enable us to drive strong topline growth.","We also continue to see our margin stabilize from our ongoing initiatives to improve our strategic sourcing, grow our private label portfolio, manage our costs effectively, and drive enhanced performance in our higher margin value-added services. These areas of focus improved our profitability resulting in our return to year-over-year quarterly EPS growth in the fourth quarter.","Importantly, the strength of our results also enabled us to make strategic investments in our business to best position Patterson for future success. We invested in our people, who have been working hard to drive our turnaround, and in the technology and services that enable strong execution and create customer value and loyalty. Taking advantage of opportunities to invest in our business motivates our employees and helps to build sustainable long-term value for our customers and shareholders.","Overall, our fiscal 2019 performance demonstrates that the execution against our strategic priorities has enabled us to achieve our objective of stabilizing our core business and return both of our segments to growth. Following a successful first year of our three-year plan, I am confident we are well-positioned to build upon our performance going forward.","Looking ahead, we issued fiscal year 2020 GAAP earnings guidance in the range of $0.99 to $1.09 per diluted share and adjusted earnings guidance in the range of $1.33 to $1.43 per diluted share. We believe this is an appropriate earnings guidance range based on a balanced forecast of the business. Don will discuss this in more detail shortly, but I will remind you that we had a $0.04 benefit during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 as a result of the accounting treatment of non-operating income that we do not expect to recur in fiscal 2020.","Importantly, our fiscal 2020 guidance calls for Patterson to deliver continued sales growth in both our Dental and Animal Health segments and we are confident in our ability to meet that expectation. It also takes into account additional strategic investments that will contribute to Patterson's long-term success.","Finally, our outlook reflects our strong conviction in the fundamentals of our business, our compelling value proposition to our customers, and continued execution to further improve performance on both the top and bottom line.","Let me now touch on the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results across our two business segments starting with Animal Health. As I noted earlier, our animal health team delivered very strong results with over 4% growth in the fourth quarter and over 4% internal sales growth for the full fiscal year. As the competitive landscape continues to evolve, our results reflect the performance of our Animal Health team as we continue to gain market share in both the Companion and Production Animal businesses based on our estimates for the underlying markets. Our Animal Health team's strong performance included growth in all channels and all species.","Importantly, we also saw our operating margins for the Animal Health segment increase by 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis for the quarter, reflecting our ongoing disciplined approach to cost management, pricing considerations and thoughtful product mix management. On the Companion Animal side of the business, throughout fiscal 2019 we have continued to build out a comprehensive suite of solutions by adding new capabilities that allow vets to better build relationships with our customers and serve them more broadly while enhancing their customers compliance for the treatment prescribed for their pets.","For example, in fiscal 2019 we launched and integrated our NaVetor practice management software into our offering to help vets manage every aspect of their practice through innovative and easy to implement technology solutions. We have continued our partnership with VetSource, which helps vets in animal hospitals better run their business through a range of technology solutions. VetSource also enables veterinarians to provide e-commerce solutions for patients and script write home delivery which has now been installed in over 21,000 vet clinics and hospitals across the country.","Also in the fourth quarter, we continued to enhance our international veterinary business through the acquisition of VetIT; a leading cloud-based practice management software in the United Kingdom. With this acquisition we enhanced our service offerings and technology capabilities to support more vets and build our position in a key geography. It also represents Patterson's focus on investing in high-value products and services as a key piece of our growth strategy for this business.","We are also encouraged by the positive feedback we continue to receive from the manufacturer community about the trajectory of our performance and the experience of our team, and who view us as a true strategic partner to reach veterinarians and producers.","On the Production Animal side, we exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter driven by solid sales execution, a continued focus on meeting the product and service needs of our customers and increased international demand in the swine market. While the dairy end market continues to present challenges, we posted gains across all species and channel segments during the fourth quarter.","Our Animal Health results in fiscal 2019 underscore our ability to grow despite the competitive environment and I was particularly pleased with the growth of our private label portfolio and the strong performance of our equipment team. Last month we held our Animal Health sales meeting, theme was Accelerate, which really captures the essence of where we believe this business segment is headed. Our sales team is energized and excited about the opportunities ahead in both the Companion and Production Animal markets and left the meeting focused on meeting and exceeding their fiscal 2020 sales and operational objectives.","Turning now to our Dental segment, I am very pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and the momentum we are building. The execution against our strategic priorities resulted in strong revenue growth compared to the same period a year ago with internal sales up 4.2% in the quarter. I am very proud of the progress our Dental team has made over the past year.","Following the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 when we are just beginning our turnaround efforts we shared that we are working hard to continue transitioning our offerings in dental equipment to reflect the demand for a wider range of digital solutions and that we expected to return this segment to growth in the second half of the 2019 fiscal year. I believe those efforts have paid off and in the fourth quarter our Dental segment delivered a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. These results were fueled by strong performance in our equipment category which was up 13% in the quarter driven by double-digit growth in both the CAD\/CAM and core equipment categories.","We are also encouraged by the increased equipment and technology purchases, which suggests that our customers are confident in the future growth of their practices and reinforces Patterson's expertise in delivering innovative new technologies. Given our large installed base, we are very pleased with the over 5% growth we delivered in Dental equipment in fiscal 2019. In addition, we saw a strong growth in our higher margin labor and repair business during the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.","I often hear from our customers about how important it is for them to have a partner that can support them with exceptional service, especially when they make such a significant investment in their practice. The ability to connect our customers with our highly experienced technology support staff at the Patterson Technology Center and our local branch teams of service technicians is a clear competitive advantage. The ability to support our customers via this comprehensive national support and local service is a crucial part of our value proposition. It saves our customers time and money and drives customer loyalty and retention.","Turning now to dental consumables. Our year-over-year growth trends demonstrated continued sequential improvement and we accelerated the pace of our progress in the fourth quarter. While we still have work to do to deliver growth in our consumables business, we are confident that our strategy is working and we will maintain our focus on improving execution, continuing the expansion of our private label franchise, enhancing our sourcing efficiencies, and making investments in our field sales organization to drive stronger performance.","We were very pleased to deliver our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year topline growth in our dental business. Our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2019 Dental results clearly indicate that we have stabilized the business which was the major year one goal of our turnaround plan. Our Dental team just held its North American sales meeting earlier this week. The theme of their meeting was Momentum, which really resonated with our Dental team and sales organization who are energized, focused and poised to capitalize on the opportunities ahead in fiscal 2020.","Turning back now to Patterson's business as a whole. While I won't discuss all of our strategic initiatives in detail, there are a few specific accomplishments that I would like to highlight. We aligned our teams around key customer experience goals like fill rates, order quality and customer satisfaction. We made investments in our sales force and productivity tools that contributed to our topline growth we delivered in fiscal 2019. I am proud of the strong leadership team assembled during fiscal 2019 to oversee our continued transformation, including our new Chief Financial Officer, Dental President and Chief Human Resources Officer.","Importantly, we also improved our operating margins throughout the year through strategic sourcing, private label, and cost management initiatives, and notably improved our working capital performance as well. The results of our efforts is clear. Sharp execution and focus on our strategic plan drove continued progress throughout fiscal 2019. We are confident in the core fundamentals of our business, our value proposition to our customers, and our ability to deliver value to our shareholders.","Fiscal 2019 represented the first full year of our three-year turnaround plan. Our focus during the year has been to stabilize the core business and I believe we're right on track as we transition into fiscal 2020. Looking ahead to year two of the plan, we will be focused on leveraging this momentum to grow our business on the top and bottom line. To achieve this goal in fiscal 2020 will continue to align our focus on three strategic priorities. First, we will continue to focus on delivering revenue growth.","Using the momentum we built we will focus on the levers that have driven our sales growth in FY2019, including sales execution, measuring and improving the customer experience, investing in our digital and service capabilities, and broadening our value proposition to our customers. Second, we will continue to hone our strategy around strategic margin management through ongoing improvement in strategic sourcing, the continued expansion of our private label portfolio, as well as increasing sales of our higher margin software and e-services products.","And finally, we will continue driving improved cash flow through a combination of ongoing profitability improvement and working capital management. Over the longer term in year three of our strategic plan we will focus on investing to expand our products, capabilities, and service offering via both organic and inorganic business development efforts. By continuing to stabilize the core and execute our growth initiatives, we will enhance our ability to invest for the future as we work to deliver increased value for our customers and our shareholders. I look forward to updating all of you on our progress against these focus areas throughout fiscal 2020.","And with that context, I'll turn the call now over to Don for a deeper dive into our financial results.","Don Zurbay","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. My initial comments will highlight our performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as I walk through the financial highlights for the entire company and each of our two business segments, and then cover a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Then I will walk through our outlook and guidance for fiscal 2020, including our thought process, guidance philosophy, and several modeling assumptions for the new fiscal year.","As we have done on prior calls this fiscal year, I will generally be focusing more on the sequential view of the business instead of the typical year-over-year comparisons. We believe it is helpful to highlight the progress we are making in the business as we continue to focus on the business improvement initiatives that Mark has already reviewed in some detail.","Now let me walk through the financials for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, an increase of 2.6% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translations and changes in products selling relationships increased 4.1%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth and 160 basis point improvement in our year-over-year sales growth rate from what was reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We believe this reflects the continued positive impact of our initiatives to bring growth back to the top line.","Our fourth quarter consolidated gross margin was 21.8%, an improvement of 40 basis points on a sequential basis from what we achieved in Q3 of fiscal 2019. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter were up sequentially reflecting the investments that Mark previously referenced in people, technology, and services for the long-term health of our business, including investments to fund our ESOP and other employee incentive programs.","We continue to carefully manage our operating expenses while also balancing the need for certain investments to improve and grow the business for the long-term. In the fourth quarter, our consolidated operating margin was 3.9% which included the investments I just mentioned and maintains the trend of flat to improving operating margins during fiscal 2019 as we work to stabilize our core business.","On the bottom line GAAP net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc. for the fourth quarter was $28.0 million or $0.30 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs and discrete tax matters, totaled $35 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.37 in the quarter representing 23% growth over the same period a year ago.","Now let's turn to our business segments. Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 4.1% compared to the same period a year ago. In both, the Companion Animal and Production Animal businesses, our topline growth rate is at or above what we believe is the current rate of growth in the market.","Operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.9% in Q4, a sequential improvement of 100 basis points over the operating margins in Animal Health in the third quarter of 2019. The sequential improvement in operating margin primarily reflects the impact of higher sales volume due to the seasonality of this business. As Mark outlined earlier, operating margins in our Animal Health segment were up 50 basis points in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Now let's move on to the Dental business. In our Dental business internal sales increased 4.1% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. On that same basis Patterson's sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 0.9% during the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Consumables sales however continued to improve sequentially as the experience and productivity of our more recent sales team hire steadily improves. Total equipment sales increased 13.1% versus last year. As Mark already highlighted, we've posted solid performance for both core equipment and CAD\/CAM equipment which were up double digits compared to the same period one-year ago.","Operating margins in Dental were 9.5% in the quarter and reflects a slight improvement from our operating margins in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. On a year-over-year basis, operating margins improved 100 basis points. This operating margin improvement was the result of continued sales execution, price discipline and expense management.","Now let's look at several cash flow and balance sheet items. During fiscal 2019 we generated approximately $48.2 million in cash from operating activities. We collected deferred purchase price receivables of $402.4 million on a year-to-date basis which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. This amount includes both, the trade AR [ph] facility that we established in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and our existing equipment financing facility.","To fully appreciate our improved cash flow, the combined total of these two items equals $450.6 million, a significant increase over the $228.5 million in fiscal 2018. That allowed us to reduce debt during fiscal 2019 by $265.5 million and also have an additional $32.7 million of cash on our balance sheet compared to the beginning of this fiscal year. In addition to the proceeds from our trade AR facility, our year-to-date improvement in net in cash flow is also the result of our continued focus to decrease our net working capital and I'm pleased to report that our net working capital numbers have improved by $237 million during fiscal 2019.","We continue to believe there is more potential here for improvement in working capital and we will remain diligent in our focus and efforts to continue this trend and free up additional cash to put to work in the business and return to shareholders.","Turning to capital allocation, we continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. During fiscal 2019 we returned $99.5 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Our Board continues to view our dividend as an important component returning value to our shareholders and the current dividend yield of over 4% provides a nice baseline return to shareholders as we continue focusing on our plans to drive improved performance of the business.","Let me conclude with some comments on our fiscal 2020 outlook and guidance. We finished fiscal 2019 with an adjusted EPS of $1.40 per share and landed in the guidance range I established on the first quarter earnings call. throughout the year we delivered sequential improvements and we are very encouraged by the positive trends in the business and the improvement shown throughout the year as we stabilized the core business during fiscal 2019.","For fiscal 2020, as Mark mentioned earlier, we expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.09 per diluted share and we expect non-GAAP adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.43 per share. As I articulated during my first Patterson earnings call last fiscal year, my guidance philosophy is to establish achievable earnings per share guidance that is based on a balanced credible forecast of the business. Our team is squarely focused on driving EPS growth in fiscal 2020.","To help give additional context to our fiscal 2020 guidance, I would remind you that our adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 included a one-time gain of $0.04 related to equity accounting that we recorded in the second quarter. Excluding this one-time gain, our fiscal 2020 guidance implies year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of approximately 2% to 5% in the upper half of the guidance range.","This guidance range assumes low to mid single-digit sales growth likely declining gross margin primarily related to segment mix and modest leveraging of operating expenses as a percentage of sales on a year-over-year basis. You can also assume an effective tax rate for the business in the range of 25% to 27% and our share count is forecasted to be in the range of 93 million to 94 million shares.","For modeling purposes, I would like to highlight an additional item. We expected approximate $0.04 headwind in our adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to differences in accruals for incentive compensation related to our earnings per share revision that occurred at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This dynamic could impact comparisons for the remainder of the fiscal year.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, Don. Now before we wrap up and take your questions, I want to reiterate that we had a strong fiscal 2019 fourth quarter that clearly demonstrates the result of our key initiatives and our performance allowed us to make strategic investments in our people, technology, and systems, to drive future growth. We are very confident in Patterson's value proposition, which continues to benefit customers in both our Dental and Animal Health segments.","We are experiencing good momentum that we will leverage going into fiscal 2020 and we are focused on delivering growth. Our improved performance during the fourth quarter is evidence of our team's hard work and execution, and I am grateful for their ongoing commitment to Patterson's long-term growth and success. Our focus is clear, to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders, and after the first year of our three-year plan I believe we are right on track.","And with that we will open the lines so Don and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Your line is open.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. Mark, can you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the dental and vet markets? And specifically are you seeing any leakage to other nontraditional channels in either the vet or the dental business? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, John, thanks for the question. Certainly as we look at both of our markets, our end markets certainly some evolving trends that continue, I think first of all both markets are very stable. From a dental perspective I think we see the growth rate on a 0 to 2% probably a little higher on the equipment side and perhaps a little bit lower on consumables side. I think in the Animal Health segment we see the market growth in the 2% to 4% range, perhaps the Production, just given some of the dynamics there, a little bit lower than that the Companion market.","And while we are seeing some channel evolution, I think we are very well positioned given the fact that we serve all those channels and we're not seeing any significant impact from a leakage standpoint at this point. So again both markets we view as stable certainly evolving, and we feel good about our team's performance across the markets.","John Kreger","Great, thank you. And then a followup on your strategic plan for the coming year, are you still in the mode of investing in the sales force, are you going to be adding new reps? And I guess the other question is, where is the private label build out, where does that stand at this point?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, so first of all, with regard to our field sales organization and we certainly are continuing to invest in our field sales team, both in terms of making sure we have adequate coverage across all of our geographies across North America. We continue to invest in building out the teams and the support infrastructure for the DSO market.","We continue to invest in sales tools to help improve the productivity of our field sales teams and also in our digital capabilities from an e-commerce standpoint to improve the customer experience. So a wide range of investments that we're making, really all focused John on how we can continue to drive improved customer satisfaction, loyalty, and an obviously the improved performance that comes from that.","And certainly private label will absolutely continue to be a key focus for us. We view that as a big opportunity to help our customers address their needs for competitive products and we'll certainly continue to focus on that, both our existing portfolio and adding new products to the portfolio going forward. And consistent with what we've shared on some of the last calls, our private label consumables business continues to grow faster than our overall consumables business.","John Kreger","Great, thank you.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, good morning. This is Jason on for Jeff. Mark, I just wanted to start with you for may be a two part question and then I have a quick followup. So first on the Dental consumables business, you said you still have work to do in that segment, but maybe hoping you can speak to your confidence in that part of your business grow in fiscal 2020? ","And then connect to that maybe you can help us understand for earnings guidance in the range of outcomes or scenarios that could play out for the year, is the performance of Dental consumables and the associated incremental margins with that revenue the biggest swing factor embedded in your guidance assumption?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. May be I'll cover the first part, Don can weigh in on the second part as well. First of all, we continue to see improving trends every quarter in our consumables business and certainly we would expect to be in a growth position for that part of our business in FY 2020 and certainly can expect to grow at market rates going forward in our consumables business.","And certainly, the investments that we've talked about in our field sales team, we continue to see improved productivity from our sales organization and a big focus for us, as I mentioned our national sales meeting earlier this week for our Dental team a big focus on our consumables business and just making sure we have the right tools, the right programs and services for our reps to deliver in that area in FY 2020. So Don, may be can add some color on the guidance piece.","Don Zurbay","Yes, I think, the consumables piece here, I wouldn't call it necessarily the biggest swing factor. Obviously, the margin profile of consumables as you know is higher than that of our equipment sales. So to the extent we can boost the growth rate in consumables that's going to help not only obviously the revenue growth, but really on the EPS front, that's a higher margin product that we think is going to add - it could add. So it is a factor, I wouldn't call it the biggest factor. There's just a number of different moving parts with regard to the guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just one quick one on Dental equipment. Hope you might be able to give us maybe a bit more context and the source of growth beyond the color you gave on the call there, and I know you don't want to get into too many details by manufacturer, but just any other color you can give on whether that 13% organic growth you posted was broad-based across all your relationships and product categories?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thank you. This is certainly, a really strong part of our Q4 performance. And I think, if you look back a bit in terms of where we were from an equipment and technology standpoint, the decision that we made to really broaden our portfolio of products, clearly that decision is paying off and we're seeing that show itself in terms of selling a wide-range of products.","So the strength is not only in one specific product area or one specific manufacturer. Certainly, we see strength across the categories and in particular, in the overall equipment and technology area, both in core equipment and in CAD\/CAM. And I would also add, while we won't speak about a specific product or a specific manufacturer, we welcome the continued innovation of the manufacturers in the space.","And I think they know that Patterson is a fantastic partner to help launch new product innovation in the dental space and really our comprehensive support structure, local service, installation, support after the sale, really I think sets us apart frankly in terms of our ability to execute and drive the new innovation into the Dental space.","And we're also very encouraged by the fact that our customers are investing in technology, which we also believe sends a strong signal about their confidence in their businesses and the strength of the overall segment going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks for taking the questions.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I wanted to start-off with the Animal Health business. You guys saw some pretty good growth there. In your prepared remarks, you did make some comment about, I guess, demand for swine products. Could you give a little bit color guys to what you're seeing from the impact from African swine fever? Also any impact from flooding in the Midwest? And then there was also a 40 basis point other negative impact in fiscal Q4. Just wondering, if that was a manufacturer switch to agency business?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. So with regard I think to the end markets, there are certainly some dynamics there, Kevin. We talked a little bit about the continued pressure on dairy. Certainly, I think the swine market is the healthiest just given all the various dynamics there. We certainly saw maybe some modest impact from the Midwest flooding, but I wouldn't say any tremendous impact, and I think more around a kind of delay and a timing issue.","Obviously, we feel for those producers in those markets that were directly affected, and our teams are absolutely supporting our customers that were affected in that area. So there's some dynamics that I shared in each of the end markets there in the production space, but we still believe that we're positioned well. As I indicated we continue to drive growth across all channels and species and really pleased with the performance of our Production Animal business in FY 2020, excuse me, in FY 2019, and going forward in FY 2020.","Kevin Ellich","Got it.","Don Zurbay","Hey and Kevin, this is Don. Was the second part of your question related to the 40 basis points impact on our sales growth rate in Animal Health?","Kevin Ellich","Yes.","Don Zurbay","Okay, yes. So, just to kind of clarify on that, the total sales growth for Animal Health was 2.2%, but there was a 1.5% foreign exchange impact and then a 0.4% impact related to going agency basically. And that was that 0.4% impact that gets you to the 4.1% Animal Health growth rate that we reported.","Kevin Ellich","Got it and then Don, since I have you, inventory was down $85 million sequentially. You guys talked about working capital management. Is that really where you see the greatest opportunities and levers? And then we see $60 million of CapEx guidance for fiscal 2020. How should we be thinking about your free cash flow going forward?","Don Zurbay","Yes, I think, yes, CapEx, we expect to be relatively flat. I think, if you look at our free cash flow opportunity, we would really think that inventory is the best place. We're going to be obviously looking at all the levers, but we think inventory has the most potential. We're not where we need to be yet, and so that's going to help us next year.","And yes, I think free cash flow should really track. We're going to have improvement. I think it should track roughly with - the way the business operates, and I expect it to be another year of improvement next year.","Kevin Ellich","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Nathan Rich","Hi thanks for the questions. Mark, you talked about the progress that you guys have made kind of over the first year of the strategic plan. The guidance for fiscal 2020 though came in a little bit lighter than I think consensus had been expecting, and I know you highlighted some of the ongoing investments that you're making and also the $0.04 one-time benefit that you're cycling. So I'd just be curious to get your view of what you feel like the normalized kind of earnings growth is for the business as you get further into your strategic plan?","Don Zurbay","Yes, we will be a little careful to give any kind of long range guidance on a call like this. I think, we're obviously focused on - this is Don. We're obviously focused on EPS growth. I think the way the guidance was set up, if you take out the $0.04 gain that we don't expect to recur, we really think the starting point for looking at EPS growth in fiscal 2020 was $1.36 in fiscal 2019.","And we would focus a bit on the upper half of the range and we're thinking about this and that would imply 2% to 5% growth. I think for us, 5% growth at the top end is a number we like. We think, that's really essentially what our forecast outlined, but it's also a number where we don't want to get ahead of ourselves.","We want to make sure we have the top end in a position that we can achieve, but we're trying to be a little cautious, obviously first earnings call of the year in giving guidance, and also just given where we're at in the three-year plan and given the state of the business, which we really like the trends, but it's still a little bit early. We wanted to be somewhat conservative as we put that together.","Kevin Ellich","Great, thanks Don. I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow up on your expectations for gross margin. Obviously, you guys had made some nice improvement in the back half of the year, but I think you said for fiscal 2020 you think - you expect it to be down slightly. Could you maybe just talk about kind of what the puts and takes are and what we could - should kind of keep in mind in terms of what will drive gross margin over the course of the year?","Don Zurbay","Yes, well, we always have a certain amount of downward pressure on our gross margin at the moment, just given our segment mix and that would really be the fact that our Animal Health business has been growing at a faster rate than Dental with a lower margin.","So we're dealing with that. We have been dealing with that. I think as Dental sales growth improves that should help that dynamic. And then there's always pressure in the market. We're in a very competitive environment, but we also feel like we have good programs and plans to offset that private label focusing on higher margin products that kind of thing.","So, I think when you put all of those things into the mix, I would maybe say flat to slightly down. I think we have the headwinds and we have the tailwinds, the things we're doing and that kind of comes out, in terms of guidance and how I would put that together again in the interest of being somewhat conservative, I would put that at flat to just very slightly down.","Kevin Ellich","Okay great, thanks for the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Hey Mark, I just want to follow up on some of your prepared remarks where you were talking about the organic growth trends within the dental sector. If I heard you correctly, I think you said about 0% to 2% on equipment and maybe a little bit lower on consumables, that's kind of where you see the market right now. And so, if you aggregate that, it feels like you're saying maybe 1%, maybe even a little less. I'm a little bit surprised that we're seeing growth rates at low in this economic climate. Do you have any thoughts as to maybe what the disconnect is versus a more robust economy?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Glenn. Thanks for the question. And maybe just to clarify a couple of things, I think we do see the overall growth rate in that called 0% to 2%, maybe a little higher in the equipment, although equipment is a little more lumpy, so trying to get kind of a true market growth rate with equipment is pretty difficult. Also when you have new products that are entering the marketplace and I think that's just the fact that the market is stable.","I think there is lot of hypotheses out there in terms of the millennials and are they going to the dentist, the - as frequently as maybe they should. And I think there's a variety of different factors out there that are driving the market. I think there's a lot of competitive activity that has always been in the marketplace. I think customers are looking to make sure that they have a competitive portfolio of products.","And so I just think there are a variety of factors. I don't know I would put - pin one factor higher than the other, but I think it all works itself out where the market is stable. We have it in that kind of 0% to 2% growth and we certainly like the long-term demographics of the segment, but that's how we are thinking about the growth rate at this point and perhaps taking a modestly conservative view.","Glen Santangelo","I appreciate the conservatism. May be Don, if I could just follow up on one of those points. I think if I heard your answer to a previous question, you said maybe one of the bigger swing factors within the guidance may be the margins on the consumable side of the business. Maybe could you guys comment with respect to what you're seeing with respect to DSOs, the evolution of sort of your customer and the impact that, that may be having on the margins, and you touched on it a little bit market with the competitive landscape, maybe is evolving, any sort of thoughts on the competitive landscape and your customer segments and the impact on margins?","Mark Walchirk","Well, Glen, this is Mark again. I think there certainly, as I mentioned earlier, a wide range of factors that all are impacting where the Dental market is going. And certainly the DSO space is one of those factors. And so, that's an important area of focus for us. Obviously there's some scale impact there. And certainly as we look to continue to grow our consumables business and continue to improve trends there, an opportunity for us to grow in the DSO space is certainly on our focus area and we continue to invest in that area.","And I would say, certainly we are focused on finding the larger DSO customers, regional DSOs that worked well with our value proposition and are looking for a broad solution set to work with Patterson on, not only around the consumables, but also I think our expertise and service, support, technology, equipment, et cetera. And so, certainly that's a dynamic going on in the marketplace and one that we expected to take advantage of.","Glen Santangelo","Okay, thanks for the comments.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. And one of the questions I had, you mentioned about obviously making some investments to support future growth. How are you thinking about that going forward into fiscal 2020 sort of any seasonality we should be thinking of as you go through your sort of multi-year restructuring plan?","Mark Walchirk","No, Elizabeth, thanks for the question. I wouldn't think that there's any seasonality from that standpoint. I think we will obviously want to balance the need to ensure that our cost structure is - meets the existing performance in our go forward expectations for the business, while also making sure we're making the right investments for the long-term.","In some of those areas that we're focused on, I think we've spoken to earlier, continuing to invest in our field sales organization, and in the tools and resources to help the productivity of our field sales organization, continuing to invest in supporting our customers via digital capabilities, continuing to invest in things that drive customer loyalty like our service and support areas. So in terms of any seasonality of those investments, I wouldn't suggest that there's any notable seasonality there.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, that's very helpful. And then in terms of some of - you mentioned in terms of what you used to thought the overall dental market growth was? If you help just to couple of those into like pricing and volume growth, well, how would you say that would be split out maybe for consumables and equipment?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, I wouldn't want to get into specifics around that. And obviously, there are dynamics with regard to price, volume and mix. It's certainly in the consumables segment it's very difficult to provide specific details around the equipment category especially in a time right now where we're seeing some great new innovation in the marketplace. But obviously as we think about the market, what we anticipate the market growth rates to be - we take those variables, price, volume and mix into account and obviously we believe that the markets in that 0% to 2% range.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi thanks for taking my questions guys. Oh, just getting back to Dental growth and the thoughts you said in your prepared comments that you felt like you were taking share in Animal Health, but you didn't make the same comment particularly about Dental, unless I missed it. Are you - do you think you're growing along with the market? Do you think you're losing share, how should we think about that, or do you think there's an opportunity to gain share in Dental?","Mark Walchirk","Well, first of all, I think as it relates to our equipment technology categories, I absolutely believe that we're growing at a faster rate in that we're getting certainly more than our fair share of the new - the investment that our customers are making in equipment technology. And I think our performance in the quarter would certainly be evidence of that. So we believe that we're performing well there. As I mentioned earlier, we believe we're a fantastic partner for manufacturers that are bringing innovation to the dental industry.","With regard to the consumables, we're continuing to see positive trends there. And as I mentioned, I think our goal is to get back to market growth rates in our consumables business. We expect and are focused on that into FY 2020. And hopefully that gives you some color as to how we're thinking about that.","Kevin Caliendo","Is there any real correlation between the equipment and consumables? Meaning, is higher equipment sales potentially driving consumables or not? And I ask that, we're trying to as we think about the product launch or product cycle of digital imaging, is there a corresponding technology service element that could increase or consumables sell-through related to that or not, is there really no correlation?","Mark Walchirk","Well, I think it depends certainly on the type of equipment and technology that's purchased. Certainly with regard to the kind of service and support areas of our business, which is certainly highly accretive for us and we're seeing some very good results there. We believe that that's an important kind of add on fees to the growth that we've had in the equipment and technology side. But in terms of connecting specifically equipment and technology grow directly to consumables, I think that would be difficult to do.","Kevin Caliendo","And I guess the thing where we're struggling just a little bit here, is just trying to reconcile the guidance with sort of the expectations around growth. It would imply that the margin overall for the Company would still be flattish or maybe down a little bit depending on where you are within the guidance range. If we look at the two business segments, where would we have the chance for margin expansion on a year-over-year basis and where would we be most at risk in terms of margin expansion or margins year-over-year?","Don Zurbay","Well, I think - this is Don. I think that obviously, the Dental business is the business that's been most challenged for us and has a higher margin profile ultimately. And so I think if you really wanted to parse it into those kind of pieces, you'd say that we're still in the stages of the turnaround of the Dental business and so there's opportunity there.","Animal Health with low margin lower margins, maybe you'd put it as a piece that's more at risk, but I think \u2013 I mean, I guess if you want - if you put it in those two buckets that's what I would say as an answer","Kevin Caliendo","Now that's very, very helpful guys. Thank you so much.","Mark Walchirk","Thanks and maybe just since we've got about a little less than 10 minutes, we want to make sure we get to everyone's questions. If you could just try to limit your question to one or maybe one with a second part, but we'll try to keep it moving. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Larsen from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","David Larsen","Hi, sorry to harp on that Dental consumables piece, but we've done some survey work, it shows that the online suppliers like Net32 and Amazon are taking share on the consumable side. Are you seeing that? And you've mentioned that you've invested in digital capabilities and technology solutions. Does your sales force have the ability to go in and sort of see in a rapid manner what the spending trends are by customer for consumables?","How is your share of wallet doing for consumables for each client? Is it shrinking? And then are they able to go in and match price sort of, if they are in fact losing share to Amazon and Net32, can they do that, or do they need to sort of get authorization from higher level managers within the firm? So any color there would be helpful. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, sure. So I think with regard to - that was - your question from an online perspective. Certainly, we stay very close to the marketplace and various companies that are selling in the marketplace. We're not seeing any significant impact from a share shift standpoint with regard to some of the non-traditional players. Certainly, they're there and we're very aware of them.","In terms of kind of share of wallet, as I mentioned earlier, we just spent several days with the entire dental field sales organization and certainly as you can imagine a big focus on continuing to drive momentum in our equipment and technology business and also continuing to drive improved trends in our consumables business. And we launched a number of new tools to help our reps understand exactly what's going on in their accounts with ways to identify opportunities to improve share of wallet, et cetera, as a couple of examples.","So we're investing in our field sales organization to help them be more productive and help them be more efficient and help them bring more value to our customers certainly across the consumable space and we've put some great new tools in their hands to do that. And as I indicated we expect to continue to see our consumables trends improve in FY 2020.","David Larsen","Okay thanks, that's it from me, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny","Good morning, thanks for all the color so far. Mark, Don, you talked about the gross margin performance. You talked about kind of some of the mix for the overall corporation. Diving into Dental maybe even more specifically on gross margin in particular, how do you think about the other swing factors there? I know we talked about swing factors, but I want to get a little more granular regarding the opportunities around new equipment and what that means for contribution, what it means as you invest and grow into DSO market and how you think about that trade off? And then do you have any intermediate plans for your private label penetration? What that can mean from a gross margin contribution perspective?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thank you for the question. I mean, obviously, you're laying out a lot of the things that are the dynamics in our Dental business and there are certainly different margin profiles for different customers, different products, margin profile of the different mix of products that we sell, et cetera. So, I mean, there's a variety of elements that obviously drive that gross margin. I think, Don shared what are our expectations are going forward in FY 2020. Certainly, I can assure you that we're very focused on driving the parts of the business that help us continue to sustain and improve our margins over time.","Certainly some of our service and support areas are very accretive for us. Software obviously is a very accretive area for us. And that's a big focus in terms of where we have our sales teams, but there's mix issues in consumables, there's mix issues from a customer standpoint, and we obviously take all of those elements into account as we think about managing the portfolio and the P&L.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Great, good morning Mark and Dan. Thanks for taking the question. I also have one here on Dental equipment, obviously it makes sense that your fiscal 4Q 2019 equipment sales were strong because of a key new scanner introduction in the marketplace. But now there's some discussion around potential supply shortages for the new scanner over the next three months to six months relative to demand. In the meantime there may be some pressure on sales for older scanner products from that same key vendor as customers may just prefer to wait for the new product.","So I guess my question is, since you don't want to talk about specific products or suppliers, I'm curious how much the - let's just say the general concept of potential supply shortages and key equipment products may be negatively impacting your fiscal 2020 guidance. I mean could there just be some general back-end loading of the equipment sales for you guys in your fiscal 2020 because of these types of shortage dynamics in the first half of your fiscal year? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Well - so short answer is, we're not anticipating any type of significant shortages in certain product areas. And like we indicated, the equipment and technology sales can be a little bit more lumpy obviously just because of the nature of it. And certainly, there's promotional activity in the marketplace from various manufacturers that has some time element to it. But certainly in terms of any specific shortages of specific products, we don't anticipate that at this time.","Steven Valiquette","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","If you've got time ask couple of questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi good morning and thanks for the time here. Don, I'll apologize for piling them all in your direction. But I wonder if you could just help us understand some of the moving parts on the margin bridge in the next year. I think everybody knows kind of what the items are, but would you be able to put any numbers around some of the variables that we're considering, including the incremental investments that you're making? What might be any offsetting savings associated with the ERP, install wind down or other cost cutting initiatives you had last year? Any numbers around any of those would be really helpful as we just try to get to an organic trend.","And then the other piece from me on the outlook for fiscal 2020 is and you are obviously two months into the first fiscal quarter here. There are a couple of moving parts, right, seasonality in the business on margins and comps on the top line. Can you help us put any guardrails around 1Q, and how 1Q compares to 4Q and the trend? Thank you.","Don Zurbay","Yes. Then sorry - Steve, I'm not going to try to not be helpful here, but I think in terms of a bridge on our forecast, we're really - we don't even - we just don't give overall gross margin guidance that's too specific and we're really not in a position to give a lot of the details behind it.","And then, in terms of seasonality, I mean, the one thing I'd point out in terms of the quarterly cadence is the comments I made at the end of my prepared remarks that we have that kind of $0.04 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 on a year-over-year basis that related to how the accruals for incentive compensation played out over the year, just given the significant guidance reduction in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.","So, I would probably point that out maybe as the seasonality topic that I would be comfortable sharing in terms of our overall financial guidance.","Mark Walchirk","I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Kevin Kedra from G Research. Your line is open.","Kevin Kedra","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe one more to continue the theme on gross margins. You mentioned flat to slightly down being kind of the outlook for fiscal 2020 and I just want to get a sense, longer-term actually is that, how we should be thinking about where do you see the business, or as you kind of get Dental kind of back up to speed, can we see that being a bit more favorable as kind of flat to slightly up? And then I know you don't want to go into details on the mix between price mix in Dental, but - and the growth rate, but can you at least say if the mix between the two has been stable, or is it kind of shifting more towards a volume versus price outlook?","Don Zurbay","Well, on the first part of the question on gross margins, I think, again, not really - I don't really want to be in a position to give too much long-term guidance on a gross margin basis. I mean I would tell you that, obviously as the Dental growth rates continue to improve that as I mentioned earlier, that right now at least has a higher margin profile. And so, from a segment mix perspective that would - that eliminates to some extent that headwind.","And then as we move into our - the next phases of the strategic plan that we're executing, a lot of the focus is on our higher margin parts of the business that I think as we get those more and more into the mix should have a good impact on gross margin and help potentially more than offset the other kinds of headwinds we have. So that's probably the most color I can give you on that.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Just to add quickly, I mean with regard to - I mean, there are so many factors that go into the consumables profitability, price, volume, mix, et cetera, both at the customer level. And certainly there's customer mix issues with the various types of customers, private practice, regional DSOs, national DSOs, that are in the space. So, I think there's a lot of factors in play there and obviously something that we closely watch and monitor and we've used to build our plans and our guidance around for FY 2020.","So, thank you. Thank you very much for the question. And thank you again all for joining us today, and we certainly look forward to providing another update on our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16928":["Patterson Companies, Inc.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies Fiscal 2019 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Patterson President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Walchirk; and Chief Financial Officer, Don Zurbay.

Welcome and good morning everyone to Patterson's fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings call. Today, I will provide a summary of our third quarter results, an update on our progress against our key initiatives and some context and perspective on our strategic priorities going forward.","We were pleased with our performance and continued progress in the third quarter. Our results reflect our sharp focus on execution across our five key initiatives, which are driving improved topline growth and profitability.","We delivered the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth, which we attribute to the actions we have taken to improve the customer experience, stabilize our field sales organizations and enhanced sales execution. It's also worth noting that we achieved these strong topline results with one less selling day in the quarter compared to the year-ago period.","We also generated the second consecutive quarter of sequential operating margin improvement, demonstrating the positive impact of our ongoing focus to improve our strategic sourcing, grow our private label portfolio, manage our costs effectively and drive enhanced performance in our higher margin value-added services.","All of these areas also present further opportunity for us to stabilize and grow our margins over time. Based on our year-to-date performance, we have narrowed our adjusted EPS within the existing range to $1.40 to $1.45.","Turning briefly now to the results across our two business segments. We were pleased with the performance of our dental segment in the quarter, which realized internal sales growth of approximately 1% compared to the same period last year, marking the first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in more than two years.","The revenue trends in our dental consumables category continued to improve, which we believe reflects our strong focus on improving execution to stabilize our dental business and the continued investments we are making in our field sales and operations teams.","Our dental private label portfolio is also progressing well. We are seeing increased customer demand in this area and believe we have a lot of runway to increased private label penetration with our existing customers as well introduce new products to expand the portfolio. In the dental equipment category, we delivered nearly 6% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by double-digit growth in both the CAD\/CAM and core equipment categories.","Increased equipment and technology purchases suggest that our customers are investing in their practices and are confident in their future growth prospects. This area will continue to be a key differentiator for Patterson and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this growth.","Our third quarter internal sales growth demonstrates that our team's hard work is starting to pay off and we are committed to driving continued improvement in our dental business going forward. I will provide more color on our dental segment performance in a moment.","Turning now to Animal Health, we achieved another solid quarter in this segment. Internal sales grew nearly 3% compared to the year-ago period. We believe we continued to gain market share in the quarter based on our estimates for the underlying markets in both companion and production.","We have taken a number of steps that position us well to compete in the exciting and evolving Animal Health segment and we fundamentally believe in the strength of our value proposition and our capabilities.","We have and will continue to capitalize on the significant market opportunity in Animal Health through the delivery of a full and comprehensive suite of solutions that allow veterinarians to offer all methods of serving their customers, including home delivery with tools that drive greater levels of compliance.","We are constantly adding new capabilities to strengthen our Animal Health value proposition to meet the evolving needs of all types of veterinarians and help enhance their relationships with customers.","As I've shared on a number of our previous quarterly calls, we remain focused on executing our five key initiatives, which we believe are contributing to our improved performance. As a quick reminder, they include improving the customer experience, enhancing sales execution, stabilizing our margins, driving improved cash flow, and finally building the overall talent at Patterson.","Let me touch on a few of these initiatives in more depth. Our improved dental equipment and technology sales during the third quarter is evidence of our efforts to continue to enhance sales execution. Equipment is a key area where Patterson has and continues to distinguish itself in the market. Given our expertise in selling the latest high quality technology, Patterson customers know that when they purchase these products from us, they will receive exceptional support and service long after the purchase is complete.","Our ability to serve our customers' needs throughout the lifecycle of their equipment is a key element of Patterson's value proposition and we believe it helps drive customer retention and loyalty. Dental equipment and technology sales also have a positive effect on our overall performance by supporting other higher margin aspects of our business, including equipment financing and our comprehensive technical service and support infrastructure, all of which also performed well in the third quarter.","We recently attended the Chicago Mid-winter Dental Show and are excited about the upcoming International Dental Show in Germany in March, where we have a great opportunity to interact with our manufacturing partners to learn about new technology innovation in the Dental segment.","We're particularly excited this year, given our ability to compete across the market with a broad and complete portfolio of high-tech products from different manufacturers at various price points. When new innovation is introduced, we believe Patterson is exceptionally well positioned, given our differentiated expertise in selling and servicing the latest technological equipment.","We also made notable progress in stabilizing our margins during the third quarter. Private label was up double digits in Animal Health from strong growth in the companion market and in our Dental segment, our private label business performed better than our overall Consumables segment.","We are gaining momentum in this area and we continue to launch new products to build out our private label portfolio. We also remain focused on additional margin levers, including strategic sourcing and managing our cost structure while also balancing our expenses with the need to continue to invest in the business.","As we announced last month, following a thorough search, we appointed Eric Shirley as President of our Dental Segment, effective February 4. Eric was the clear choice to lead our dental business into the future, given his significant industry leadership experience and a strong track record of performance. We are excited to have him on board and believe his appointment is further evidence of our efforts to continue to build the overall talent and leadership at Patterson.","Finally, I want to provide a little context on how we're thinking about the business going forward. As we've discussed, our efforts throughout fiscal 2019 have primarily been focused on stabilizing our core business and we are confident that the continued progress we have made across our dental and Animal Health segments will position us well for the future. While we recognize the continued importance of near-term performance, we're also thinking ahead about how we can expand and grow the business longer term.","As we look forward, our strategic objectives are centered on three key areas. Continuing to stabilize the core business, accelerating our performance via continued execution on our key initiatives and pursuing opportunities to expand our product and service offerings via both organic and inorganic business development efforts. These key strategic objectives are all centered around our relentless focus on our customers and continuing to increase our value to them.","First and foremost, we will remain focused on execution to drive growth, working capital and margin improvement to continue the progress we've made during fiscal 2019. Next, we plan to invest further and accelerate growth in our software and technical service platforms, which represent accretive margin opportunities.","We will also invest in modernizing our dotcom platform to ensure it is easy for our customers to do business with Patterson. And finally, as we think about growing the business for the future, we'll be thoughtful about potential M&A opportunities that help support and drive our strategic initiatives.","I want to emphasize that we believe we have a compelling value proposition and continuing to invest in that value proposition is critical to our ongoing success. We operate in healthy, growing and stable market segments with attractive underlying fundamentals and positive margin profiles.","As a leader within both of these segments, we know our customers are looking for a trusted partner to help them achieve their business goals. And as the needs of our customers have evolved, so has Patterson. We provide our customers with a comprehensive portfolio of products, services and technology solutions to help them be more productive and efficient, all executed by our local field sales, operations and support teams. Our teams are aligned and focused on continuing to be a trusted business partner to our customers.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Don for a deeper dive into our third quarter results.","Donald Zurbay","Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. First, I will walk through the financial highlights for the entire company. Next, I'll focus a bit on each of our two business segments. And finally, I will cover a few balance sheet and cash flow items. On today's call, I will focus both on the sequential view of the business in addition to the typical year-over-year comparisons to highlight the progress we are making in the business, as we continue to focus on the business improvement initiatives that Mark has already reviewed in some detail.","Now, let me walk through the financials for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.4 billion, an increase of 1.6% versus the third quarter a year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships, increased 2.5%. It is also worth noting that the third quarter of fiscal 2019 contained one less selling day than the same period one year ago.","This was our third consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth and we experienced a 70 basis point improvement in our year-over-year sales growth rate from what was reported in the second quarter. We believe these results reflect the continued positive impact of the initiatives Mark discussed to bring growth back to the topline. Our third quarter consolidated gross margin was 21.4%, an improvement of 40 basis points on a sequential basis from what we achieved in Q2 of fiscal 2019.","Operating expenses for the third quarter were consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2019, reflecting initiatives to proactively manage expenses in the quarter. We continue to carefully manage our operating expenses, while also balancing the need for certain investments to improve and grow the business for the long term.","In the third quarter, our consolidated operating margin was 3.9%, reflecting a 30 basis point sequential improvement from the operating margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which continues the trend of improving operating margin during fiscal 2019. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, up from a rate of 21% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, when the new tax legislation was enacted.","It is worth noting that the year-over-year comparison in tax rates translated to a slight headwind in the third quarter of $0.02 of EPS. On the bottom line, the GAAP net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc., for the third quarter was $31.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share.","Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs and discrete tax matters, totaled $35.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.38 in the quarter.","Now, let's turn to our operating segments. Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago. In both the companion animal and production animal businesses, our topline growth rate is at or above what we believe is the current rate of growth in the market.","Operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 2.9% in Q3, a 70 basis point sequential decline over the operating margins in Animal Health in the second quarter of 2019. The sequential decline in operating margins is consistent with the prior year and primarily reflects the impact of lower sales volume due to the seasonality of this business.","In our dental business, internal sales increased 0.9% versus the third quarter of fiscal 2018. On that same basis, our third quarter fiscal 2019 sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 1.9% during the 2019 third quarter compared to a year ago. However, our total equipment sales increased 5.6% versus last year.","Although dental consumable sales declined during the quarter, they continued to improve sequentially as we experienced improved stabilization and productivity in our field sales force. Additionally, keep in mind that the impact of one less selling day in the third quarter would have only added to the improved sequential performance. ","As Mark already highlighted, we posted solid performance for both core equipment and CAD\/CAM equipment, which were up double digits compared to the same period one year ago. Operating margins in dental were 9.4% in the quarter, and reflecting 100 basis point improvements from our operating margins in the second quarter.","Now, let's look at several cash flow and balance sheet items. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we have generated approximately $76 million in cash from operating activities. We collected deferred purchase price receivables of $309 million on a year-to-date basis, which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.","This amount includes both the traded AR facility that we established in the first quarter and our existing equipment financing facility. To fully appreciate our improved cash flow, the combined total of these two items equals 385 million, which allowed us to reduce debt in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 by $231 million and also have an additional $54 million of cash on our balance sheet compared to the beginning of the fiscal year.","In addition to the proceeds from our AR facility, our year-to-date improvement in cash flow is also the result of our continued focus to decrease our net working capital and I'm pleased to report that our net working capital numbers have improved by $68 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2019. We believe there is more potential here for improvement in working capital and we will remain diligent in our focus and efforts to continue this trend and free up additional cash to put to work in the business or return to shareholders.","Turning to capital allocation, we continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2019, we have returned 75 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends.","Let me conclude with some comments on our fiscal 2019 outlook and guidance. For fiscal 2019, we expect to deliver on the range we outlined during our first quarter and are confident in our fourth quarter expectations. We are narrowing our guidance range and expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.94 per diluted share and our non-GAAP adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45 per diluted share.","Our adjusted earnings guidance excludes the after tax impact of deal amortization expenses, legal settlement costs and a tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act, which together totaled $47.6 million or approximately $0.51 per diluted share.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, Don. Now before we wrap up and take your questions, I want to say how pleased I am with our team's focus and execution, as we approach the end of fiscal 2019. While we still have much work ahead, we are on track with our expectations and we are confident in achieving our forecast for the fourth quarter.","We have spent a lot of time and energy on stabilizing our core business to build a stronger growth platform for Patterson. Our improved performance in the third quarter is a testament of our team's hard work and I'm grateful for their dedication and commitment to help driving our key initiatives and to help support our customers' success.","With that, we will open the lines, so, Don and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Your line is open.","John Kreger","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Can you maybe just get a little bit more specific on how the companion animal part of the business did versus the production. I know you said both did better than the market, but can you give us the growth rates for those two pieces.","Donald Zurbay","Yes. John. Thanks for the question. I think as you \u2013 as we showed you last quarter, we're really not going to break those into pieces. We want to continue to just report that segment the same way we do our Dental segment and show consumables equipment and other.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. And just to add, John, thanks for the question. This is Mark. Certainly, we do believe that we continue to grow slightly ahead of the market across both of our \u2013 both our companion and production segments. We did see a little bit of softness in production during the quarter, I think, as a result of several factors.","Certainly, some seasonality, some end market softness, I think particularly in dairy, which I think has been a tough end market for some time. Also given the fact there was one less selling day and our production comp from the same period last year was on a pretty significant growth quarter. So we're pleased with the performance of our Animal Health business, both across companion and production. But as I mentioned, maybe a bit of seasonality softness in the production segment.","John Kreger","Great, thank you. And then one other follow-up on Animal Health. I think you mentioned in your remarks, one kind of service offering as home delivery. Are you seeing a greater uptick of that offering and how does that flow through and impact your business. Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thank you. So, certainly, there's a lot of evolution going on in the companion animal space. I mean, we're very \u2013 we continue to be very focused on supporting our vet clinics and hospitals and really enabling them to take advantage of the changes that are going on and the evolution going on in the marketplace. We partner with an offering called ScriptRight, which is a home delivery platform, which is actually installed in over 20,000 vet clinics and hospitals across the country.","So we believe squarely in the focus of the vet hospitals. Obviously though the market continues to evolve and we want to make sure that we're providing the tools and resources and technology to support our vet hospitals and the vet clinics to take advantage of those, of the continued evolution and the shift in demand that take place across the market. So we feel certainly good about how we're positioned there. We feel very good about the resources that we provide to the vets to take advantage of some of those evolving trends.","John Kreger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. On the Dental segment consumables, can you parse out the different components here of growth, whether it relates to the private label. The one less selling day as well as what you're seeing in terms of underlying demand trends across general consumables as well. And then if you could speak to that quarterly progression you saw throughout the quarter in terms of underlying dental demand trends that would be great. Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Erin, thanks. It's Mark. I'll maybe start and then turn it over to Don. Maybe to, I don't know that we're going to get into the actual specifics of each of these different elements. But certainly, I think a couple of things that I would comment with regard to the dental consumables. I think there is perhaps a bit of end market softness over the last several months, but certainly our revenue trends in the consumables continue to improve on a sequential basis.","Obviously would have been stronger, given the fact that we did have one less selling day. So I think that's important to note as well. And certainly, we're very pleased with the growth in our dental equipment category, which I think also would suggest confidence in the overall demand for dental services in the market. So again, maybe a bit of end market softness from a consumable standpoint, but we think generally demand is positive and certainly maybe any additional color that Don would add.","Donald Zurbay","Yes. And just a couple of things, Erin. Our private label grew faster than our overall consumables growth. So that continues to be a dynamic. On the extra selling day, we're not going to quantify it, mostly because we don't have an exact detailed calculation that would show that kind of dynamic.","I think obviously if you do the simple math on that, it could be worth as much as 1.7% of growth. We don't think it was worth that, but there is some number there. It did have an impact, particularly on the consumables business, probably more for both Animal Health and Dental versus the Equipment business.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then what are some of the key components or drivers that should contribute to any meaningful ramp, implied in the fourth quarter with the guidance, and just what's driving that ramp and where you've seen the biggest step-up in the fourth quarter and what are the embedded profit assumptions. Thanks.","Donald Zurbay","So yes, thanks. So I think if you look at the dental side, we think there's going to be continued improvement in our consumables. So that trend continues. I think what we saw is some of the usual Animal Health seasonality that comes in to play in Q3, same dynamic last year that contributed to lower revenue than Q2 sequentially and sequentially, there's always been a bit of a margin down stroke on Animal Health, given that dynamic.","We expect that obviously to moderate in Q4. So there should be some up \u2013 margin improvement as well. Otherwise, we really think Q4 is going to be roughly with those dynamics, but beyond that, just kind of a continuation of all the things we saw in Q3.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, good morning.","Donald Zurbay","Yes.","Jeffrey Johnson","Okay, great. Mark and Don, just a couple of questions here. Let me, I guess, focus on the equipment side, on the dental equipment side, if I could. First on the imaging side, we've seen some price points come down, it seems like $80,000 is kind of the new price point for some high-end 2D, 3D imaging systems. It seems like that is stimulating some good demand. Can you maybe point to how that new price point that some seem to be zeroing in on is driving demand and did that help that equipment number in the quarter?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Jeff. Thanks. I think there's a lot of things going on in the equipment market right now. Obviously, you have some changes to ASP, you have some different price points, you have new product introductions that are taking place and so really this is a very exciting time, I think as it relates to dental technology and the innovation that continues to come to market.","And frankly, we're really excited about that and we believe that Patterson is positioned incredibly well to take advantage of the evolving market, to take advantage of new innovation and also to take advantage of different price points for the different categories of products.","And I think that's a good example of the decision that was made to really broaden our portfolio of products and really to ensure that Patterson has the opportunity to offer that broad portfolio of products, also a broad portfolio of products at various price points into the marketplace and so we believe that evidence of that is in our results in the quarter, double-digit growth across both CAD\/CAM and our core equipment categories and certainly given some of the price points and some of the promotional activity that took place in the quarter, our unit growth is actually certainly higher than our revenue growth.","So we are really pleased with our performance there. And certainly, again not only do we think we are very strong at selling these high-tech products, but also really the add-on effect of the other services that we provide, well after the sale, whether it's our technology services, our technological and software support, be our Patterson technology center, we have a comprehensive support and service infrastructure that we think really is a differentiator for us. So we're excited about continued innovation in the dental equipment and technology area and we expect to take good advantage of that going forward.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right, great. Maybe a follow-up just on that same theme on the digital impression side. We're starting to see maybe some three shape and plan that shake out kind of $25,000, $30,000, obviously, den supply is going to go with the high-end premium price with their new Primescan. Just what are you hearing in the field? Where is dentist mindset on kind of high-end premium versus kind of other price points for DI.","Just how do you think that evolution of DI uptake occurs over the next couple of years. And then just a very quick softball for you, you've been getting some good new hires here at the company. What's the internal morale like over the past year or so? It seems like it's on the uptick, we think, Eric is a home run add for you guys running the dental business. So we just love kind of internally to hear how morale is trending at the company too.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thank you. Let me start with your first question. Without getting into any specifics on specific manufacturers, I mean, I think the main message that I would send here is, pretty consistent with the earlier answer.","Look, we're really pleased with the fact that we are offering a broad and full comprehensive portfolio of technology products in the dental space and that portfolio includes products at various price points. And I think what that does is really open up our ability to sell these products and also our add-on services across the entire marketplace.","So, I think, like any large market, there's going to be customers that want to purchase kind of in more the good, better, best categories. We believe that there are markets within each of those categories and we're seeing our dental customers invest in their practices to improve productivity, to bring new technology, to improve the clinical outcomes of their patients and so we expect continued growth in that area and we expect it across all categories in terms of the level of investment that our customers will make.","So, we're excited about that going forward. I think, certainly your second question as it relates to kind of morale within the organization, we're really pleased with the improvements in morale. We've got a fantastic culture here at Patterson, fantastic team of very dedicated, loyal, focused employees.","I think we're adding some good additions in leadership to the team and I think that are very complementary. So we're excited to have Eric on board. Thank you for your nice comments there. He is already in his, I think, the third or fourth week and diving in with \u2013 certainly with both feet and we're really excited about the continued improvement that we've seen.","I was just at the Chicago Mid-winter Show last week, engaging with our customers, manufacturers and notably our field sales teams that were in attendance as well, and I feel really good about where things are in terms of the morale within the organization and certainly looking forward to continuing to enhance that overtime and continuing to build on the great culture that we have here at Patterson.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So just wanted to, Mark, wondering if you could expand maybe upon what inorganic and inorganic opportunities you're seeing and I guess vetting in the market right now to drive additional growth over time, especially in dental. Is there anything specifically like which markets or categories you're most interested in?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thanks Kevin. I mean, I think as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, really kind of focused on really three core, I guess, strategic pillars and certainly continuing to stabilize our core business is job one. And I think we're making good progress. I think our results would suggest that, but certainly we still have runway in the areas that we've been focused on like sales execution, sourcing and private label, working capital, et cetera and that will certainly continue to be front and center, as we move into FY20.","Secondly, as we look to accelerate performance in FY20 and beyond, we're really thinking about how we invest and continue to focus on some of the higher margin products and services, things like software, technology, service and support, private label, these are elements within our value proposition today that are actually performing well, but that we can continue to invest in to improve our performance and I think they will help drive growth and also represent accretive margin opportunities.","And also very importantly help build out our value proposition and help support our customers focus on success. Things like business services, consulting, training and education, et cetera. And then really third area to get specifically to your question is how we think about expanding into new growth areas, market adjacencies both from an organic and inorganic standpoint.","And while I'm not going to get into specifics necessarily, certainly, there is good opportunities for Patterson to pursue that are really right in line with both our dental and Animal Health platforms, allow for some expansion into frankly broader areas of the value chain, looking at areas that will drive growth that represent accretive margin opportunities, expansion into market adjacencies within the dental and Animal Health space, building scale within our existing platform, again building out additional products and services to support our value proposition, so those would be some of the areas that we're very focused on as we think about inorganic opportunities going forward.","Kevin Ellich","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just wanted to go back to, maybe Don can talk a little bit more about some of the moving parts that we're seeing on the cash flow statement in working capital and I guess where do you expect to end the year in terms of free cash flow?","Donald Zurbay","Well, I think that if you look at our \u2013 the cash flow we've generated during the year, kind of walk through the quarters, it was $221 million in the first quarter, $145 million in the second and $19 million in the third, which really mostly in the third quarter had to do with inventory being up $53 million, which is a \u2013 that has a lot to do with the seasonality of our business and was kind of an expected ramp on the inventory.","That's a piece of this equation that you can expect to come down in the fourth quarter. So I think that there's going to be some opportunity to continue to improve that free cash flow or the cash flow from operations, as we get through the fourth quarter. So I probably won't give you exact guidance. I think we had mentioned that on the last call, but you could consider the Q3 number plus some benefit, as we get that inventory balance back down as maybe a bit of a proxy for what might happen.","Kevin Ellich","Sounds good. Thanks guys.","Donald Zurbay","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan Block","Thanks and good morning. Don, first one might be for you. It seems that the guidance implies that your year-over-year op margins are up in fiscal 4Q 2019 for the first time in, I think, years quite honestly by a decent amount, maybe around 40 or 50 bps year-over-year. I'm guessing you don't want to give specific fiscal 2020 guidance, but at a high level, can we assume that that trend of year-over-year op margin expansion, again, which should start again in 4Q 2019 continues for fiscal 2020..","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I don't want to get really into the fiscal 2020 guidance yet. And I'm not trying to be not helpful, but I don't want to do that. I think what I can tell you is, yes, you're right. So we've had good progress in our operating margins, 3.2% in Q1, 3.6%, 3.9% and we expect some of the dynamics as I mentioned in Q3 really to continue into Q4 with potentially some improvement there on some things. So that does end up pushing us to a position where the Q4 op profit is \u2013 year-over-year actually does go positive. I think we like our trends during the year. I think we like our trends as we move into \u2013 into fiscal 2020. But beyond that, I'm probably not going to quantify too much.","Jonathan Block","Okay, got it. And Mark, just to shift gears and over to you for a moment, you talked about maybe the dental end market is getting more choppy in the past couple of months, notably on the consumable side, do you want to go ahead and pontificate for us what might be causing that. Do you think that's \u2013 you sort of chalked it up to just normal volatility of the end markets or is there anything specific that you can point to on what may have led to some of those weakening trends that you alluded to over the past couple of months. Thanks for your time guys.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thanks, Jon. I certainly won't attempt to pontificate. But I don't know that there's any specific kind of underlying dynamic that I would point to. As I said, I think we saw some end market softness on the consumables. I think hard to put a specific pinpoint on one or two things.","I think the thing that the area that frankly gives us some positive perspective with regard to the underlying trends, however, is the investment that we're seeing our practice is making in equipment and that to me represents their view that their practices are going to continue to grow over time.","So I think that's an important indicator at least from our perspective of the confidence that the market has and that the practices are investing in growth and investing in the practices.","Also still as we think about our position in the market and the things that we've been focused on over the last year really is to continue to focus on execution and to continue to get back to consistent growth in our dental business and just to again highlight, we delivered nearly 1% growth, which is the first time in over two years that our dental business grew on a year-over-year basis, also within the situation where there is one less selling day.","So we still have a lot of work to do to continue to stabilize and get back to consistent growth in dental, but we're pleased with the progress we're making, we're pleased with the execution the team is delivering on, we're pleased with the continued positive trends we're seeing in consumables and obviously the positive trends we're seeing on the equipment side.","So to answer your question directly, I wouldn't pinpoint anything in particular. But we're very focused on execution and we're very focused on continuing to grow our dental business going forward.","Jonathan Block","Okay, great. Thanks Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the questions. Mark, maybe starting with you. Just wanted to go back to a comment you made in the prepared remarks against the progress you've made kind of going after some of the strategic initiatives you've identified this year.","It sounds like you're planning to invest on the software and support side to drive growth. So I just wondered if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on what those investments look like and how that will kind of come together and hopefully drive the top line kind of as we look forward.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thank you, Nathan. So, I mean, as I think about our kind of technology and software and support infrastructure, this is a really key part of our value proposition. Certainly, we have a very strong installed base of customers, of practices using our software and e-services, we continue to actually grow that installed base. We continue to invest in the future software products and services for the marketplace.","We continue to focus on how we can bring value, not in the private practice space, but also the DSO space in terms of these \u2013 the infrastructure that we have. Two areas in particular that we continue to believe strongly in and we'll continue to invest in are tech service, which really is our team across North America that goes out and provides equipment and maintenance support for our customers.","This is a great part of our operation and something that we think again distinguishes us in the marketplace. Also our comprehensive technology and software support infrastructure at our Patterson Technology Center, where we literally have hundreds of people who are \u2013 their full time job every day is to support our customers and to help them ensure the productivity and efficiency of their practices and the effective use of the software tools that we provide as well as the technology of products that we sell.","So this is an important part of our value proposition. There are certainly investments that we're making and continuing to build out that infrastructure and continuing to bring that value to our customers. So we think there's some good runway, some good runway there.","Nathan Rich","Great. That makes sense. And Don, maybe a follow-up for you. I think you had mentioned dental EBIT margins were up about 100 basis points sequentially. Any more detail you can provide on kind of what drove the sequential step-up and do you think you can kind of continue to build on that as we look at performance in the Dental segment in 4Q?","Donald Zurbay","Yes. I think, there's been a couple of things really. We had good \u2013 we're kind of managing our operating expenses in an effective manner. We had good consistency on our margin sequentially. And I think that we like the dynamics. I think as moving forward, that was a big step-up, you may not see that exact kind of move sequentially each quarter, but we think we're moving in the right direction on a lot of different things that are helping that margin improve.","Nathan Rich","Okay. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Allen Lutz","Hi. This is Allen Lutz in for Mike. Does the end market softness in dental consumables need to change at all for you to meet the 4Q guide? Or is that fully embedded in the numbers?","Mark Walchirk","No, it doesn't need to change, that's fully embedded in our numbers. I mean, again, we can't understand what's happening in the market, but we're focused on our own program and even with some softness this quarter, we really liked the \u2013 our execution and the trends here in our consumable business and the continued improvement, we expect that to continue.","Allen Lutz","Great. And you talked about double-digit growth in CAD\/CAM in the quarter. So now that Primescanner has launched, do you expect any contribution in the fourth quarter and then how do you expect that to ramp over time.","Mark Walchirk","Well, Allen, this is Mark. I am certainly not going to comment on specific contribution from a specific product, but we're certainly excited about the Primescan launch, we certainly have been working closely with our partners at den supplies around that, good response from our customers and we expect good growth in that product category as well as many of the product categories across the dental technology space.","And so, as I mentioned earlier, we believe that this is an area that really differentiates Patterson and the market. We broadened our portfolio over the last 12 months. I think our teams are really excited about being able to offer a broad portfolio of products to our customers and really make sure that we can match up the customers' need for equipment and technology with our ability to provide that solution to them.","So we're excited about launches like Primescan, we're excited about additional technology launches and innovation that we expect and we certainly believe that as new innovation gets introduced in the Dental segment, we're very well positioned to take advantage of that.","Allen Lutz","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Larson from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Westley Dupray","Hi, good morning. This is Westley on for Dave. I just had one quick question regarding the corporate line item for revenues, up to $9.5 million this quarter, it's about 40% up from last quarter and just under 300% up year-over-year. I guess, what's driving that growth both sequentially and year-over-year and how \u2013 is that something that we can expect to move going forward. Thanks. ","Mark Walchirk","Yes. That does move around a little bit. I think that the main thing was really just strong equipment sales in the financing that went along with those. There is an impact on the, as we look at the yield curve, that did also have a positive impact in the quarter. So it's really both things going in the right direction.","Westley Dupray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Minchak from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Minchak","Thanks and good morning. So first on dental equipment. You saw a nice rebound in growth this quarter. Was there anything that was unique that drove that growth or anything that was maybe pulled ahead. Obviously, you've cycled the change in the manufacturer relationship.","I guess, can you talk about traction you're seeing under relationships and then I guess, historically, we've typically seen some positive impact from tax incentives on equipment purchases at the end of the calendar year. Is that something that you saw as a tailwind this past quarter?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Michael. Thanks. I mean, I think we've spoken a fair amount about equipment and I think it's really a comprehensive variety of things that are helping drive the performance there. We certainly don't believe that we hold sales in. There is some nice promotional activity in the marketplace that was positive.","We continue to drive our unit sales, we continue to sell products that we haven't historically sold, we continue to sell these new products to new customers, we have a much broader portfolio of products. It's been over a year now since we changed the relationship with \u2013 from an exclusivity standpoint. And so our teams are just better prepared to execute and our team are doing a great job in the field.","And I think not only like I've been saying are we really strong at selling the dental core and high-tech equipment, but I think our customers recognize the after-sales support that we provide from a maintenance standpoint, from a tech service standpoint, from a technical support standpoint and I think these are all things that are contributing to some positive results that we saw in our equipment business. And as I mentioned earlier, we're excited about continued innovation in this space and we think that positions us well.","Michael Minchak","Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up question on the margins. So fiscal 2018 notwithstanding, if I look historically, you've typically seen some sequential operating margin expansion from 2Q to 3Q. So, I guess I'm trying to understand how much of the sequential improvement you saw this quarter is related to that typical seasonal improvement versus sort of the specific initiatives you're taking to drive improved financial performance. Is there any way to sort of parse that out.","Mark Walchirk","There's probably elements of both, I don't have a breakdown that I can parse that out anymore in any more detail. I think the thing to understand is that \u2013 a lot of that has to do with our internal programs. There was margin improvement, even though in the Animal Health space, it was again some margin degradation just due to seasonality. So we're kind of overcoming that and again, good trend, we like the trend and expect some of the dynamics here that are in place with that to continue as we move into the fourth quarter and next year.","Donald Zurbay","And just to add quickly, I mean certainly this is a really important focus for us and for our teams as we think about our \u2013 the key initiatives that we've been focused on, sourcing, private label, our cost structure, et cetera, all obviously designed to continue to stabilize our margins. I also think we continue to see further stabilization from our ERP implementation and we still have work to do to continue to drive that, but I think that's helped from a stabilization standpoint as well.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, I mean, I guess I might add, a lot of the initiatives are in the cost area. We've been, we haven't done anything large enough to make a big announcement, but there's been a lot of analysis of the cost structure and decisions made on the investments that we need going forward to drive the business versus where we think we can opportunistically reduce costs as we move into the fourth quarter.","Michael Minchak","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. One of your peers had a successful Animal Health spin out recently and acknowledged that with a little bit different of a mix in your Animal Health business. But how do you think about getting credit for or unlocking the value for investors via your Animal Health assets?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Sarah, thanks. Well, as I mentioned, certainly, we're pleased with our Animal Health performance. We believe we have strong positions across both companion and production and believe that we continue to improve our position in those markets, and it's a market with good underlying fundamentals.","As we mentioned, we continue to believe \u2013 we continue to gain share in the quarter and certainly remain very focused on driving value of this business. That said, our Board \u2013 we regularly evaluate options and alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees and we'll certainly continue to do that going forward.","Sarah James","Got it. And can you talk a little bit about the robustness of the technology and value-added M&A pipeline. Are you finding the type of assets that you strategically want to add being available in the market or is this more of a situation where they're not available and you need to build out these capabilities yourself?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. I think it's a combination. I think, as we kind of canvas the market and as we think about centering in on some of our key strategic initiatives, we would look at ways to support those initiatives, both organically and inorganically. And so I think there are assets in the marketplace that could potentially be attractive to us. I think we're, as mentioned earlier, continuing to focus on our execution and continue to stabilize the business, continue to stabilize our balance sheet.","So to put us in a position where we can take advantage of some M&A opportunities that would support those strategies. So we're looking across many of the things that I mentioned earlier and really ensuring that they drive focus on growth, margin accretion, get us into some different market adjacencies, perhaps build scale, but certainly all supportive and well within kind of the parameters of our dental and Animal Health platforms.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your last question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays Bank. Your line is open. ","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Mark Walchirk","Good morning.","Steven Valiquette","So just a quick question here around the operating margins on the Animal Health side, you didn't mention that you sort of \u2013 they were seeing the normal seasonality on\u2026","Mark Walchirk","Steven, I think we lost you. Can you hear us?","Steven Valiquette","Okay. Yes, sorry. Not sure what happened. I'm on a landline, but just following up on the operating margin on the Animal Health, seems like the year-over-year trends are getting a little bit worse as the year goes on. I know previously you've talked about may be missing some manufacturing rebates from time to time in that business, I'm not sure if that maybe happened in the fiscal third quarter, maybe that gives you confidence on the rebound in the fiscal fourth quarter, but just looking for more color around the operating margin trends in Animal Health. Thanks.","Donald Zurbay","Yes, we did not have any dynamics like that. I would characterize the Animal Health operating margin decline as really again normal seasonality with revenue coming down and kind of the deleveraging impact to that. And then there were a few smaller one-time items in the quarter that were negative, that weighed on it a bit. We do expect, as we get into Q4, that there'll be some improvement and that'll bounce back.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, got it. Thanks.","Operator","There are no further questions at the time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thanks so much and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to providing another update on our fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call in late June. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

","This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Walchirk.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, John. And welcome, everyone, to Patterson's fiscal 2020 second quarter conference call. Our second quarter results reflect the focus of our teams and the continued traction we are gaining from our ongoing initiatives to drive performance improvement. ","Before we dive into the details, let me summarize a few key highlights from the quarter. First, we grew internal sales approximately 2% in the quarter, notably growing our Dental segment internal sales by 4.2%. We expanded our operating margins by 40 basis points year-over-year, bringing our consolidated adjusted operating margin to 4% for the first time in over a year, reflecting our efforts to drive operational improvements, manage expenses, and focus on improved mix. ","In our Dental segment, our performance was driven by strong equipment sales where we delivered 12.3% growth. Our dental consumables trend continued to improve and our US consumables business posted year-over-year growth for the quarter. In addition, we generated strong revenue and profit growth from our value-added services. ","In our Animal Health segment, we delivered solid growth in our companion animal business as we continue to enhance our value proposition for our customers. ","Animal Health segment profitability and overall performance was consistent with the first quarter, reflecting our ongoing focus on mix and expense management, which offset certain expected macroeconomic headwinds in the beef and dairy categories of our production animal business.","We also made significant progress towards the resolution of important legal matters facing the company and recorded a reserve related to our agreement in principle with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia.","Overall, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.39 in the quarter. And as a result of the progress we've made in the first half of the year, we are raising our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.36 to $1.46 for fiscal 2020. ","With that broader context, I'll now walk through some more specifics of our quarter, starting with our progress on the topline. Patterson's internal sales growth of approximately 2% underscores the impact of our enhanced sales execution, continued improvement in core operations, and the value of our investment in our ERP system, all of which have improved our overall customer experience. ","Our topline was driven by growth in both of our segments and benefited from a particularly strong quarter in our Dental segment, which I will touch on more in a moment. ","Driving earnings growth also depends on our ability to expand our margins, which remains an important focus and ongoing initiative. As I noted a moment ago, the 40 basis points of year-over-year operating margin improvement is due to our continued focus on improving our operations and effective mix management. ","For example, our operation teams have driven continuous improvements in our supply chain using our ERP system, leveraging better visibility and more accurate system reporting to reduce the expense of customer returns and lower the frequency and impact of inventory adjustments. ","From a mix perspective, our margin benefited from strong performance in our higher-margin Dental segment as well as total company private label growth that continued to outpace our overall internal consumables sales growth.","We will continue to invest in expanding our private label offering to provide high-quality products to our Dental and Animal Health customers at more attractive margins.","Overall, our continued focus on growing the business on the top and bottom line resulted in adjusted earnings per share performance of $0.39. It's also worth noting that our adjusted EPS performance in the second quarter of last year included a one-time investment gain of $0.04. Excluding this one-time gain, we increased adjusted EPS by 11% year-over-year. ","Now, I'll turn to each of our business segments, starting with Dental. Dental segment internal sales increased 4.2% and we delivered Dental segment adjusted operating margins of 9.8%. ","Our performance was fueled by strong growth in equipment sales, continued improving trends in consumables, and solid demand for our value-added services. ","Let me now touch briefly on each of these areas. Our team in the field delivered 12% growth in overall equipment sales, primarily from sales in the CAD\/CAM category. Our performance in CAD\/CAM was due in part to our ability to take strategic advantage of continued manufacturer innovation, which Patterson promoted and executed effectively. ","We also saw strong performance in core equipment sales, which grew over 8% year-over-year in the second quarter and indicates that dentists are continuing to invest in their practices. ","As we've said before, when you look at our equipment category overall, the timing of promotional activity and other factors will impact our equipment business quarter-to-quarter, and that's exactly what we experienced in the second quarter as the strong equipment results we previously anticipated in the second half of the fiscal year shifted in part to be earlier in the fiscal year.","While there may be changes from quarter-to-quarter, we continue to expect equipment to grow over the long term. And if you look over the past four quarters overall, our equipment sales grew 4.8% compared to the prior four-quarter period. ","Our equipment performance this quarter speaks not only to our strong execution, but also to the added value Patterson provides to dental practices when they purchase advanced technology.","Our value-added services business continued to grow in the second quarter, highlighting the unique benefit we bring to our customers, from financing to training to service and repairs throughout the lifecycle of the equipment purchase. In addition to providing value to our customers, these services improve our mix and help drive improved profitability. ","Through Patterson's ability to provide responsive local service with our team of highly experienced service technicians as well as our comprehensive national support through our Patterson Technology Center, we are able to deliver a truly differentiated value proposition for our customers. ","On the consumables side, our trend continues to show improvement. We came in essentially flat for the quarter, but notably the consumables business in our U.S. Dental segment grew on a year-over-year basis. This progress in our consumables business gives us confidence that our strategy of rebuilding the size of our sales force and investing in sales productivity tools has delivered steady and measured improvement.","We believe the positive impact these tools have had on our entire sales force has increased their ability to win new business in their respective territories and is reflected in our positive consumables trends.","Finally, we're pleased with the progress and performance of our teams' focus to pursue relationships with our DSO customers that will allow us to capitalize on our full value proposition. ","Overall, we remain confident that Patterson serves a strong and stable dental end market. We're very pleased with our performance in all three categories of our Dental business \u2013 equipment, consumables, and value-added services. Our effective mix management in our Dental segment and continued focus on sales execution and the customer experience helped drive Patterson's strong performance in the quarter. ","Turning now to Animal Health. In the second quarter, our Animal Health business generated internal sales growth of approximately 1%, driven by global companion animal internal sales growth of 3.5%. ","We also maintained our profitability in the segment on a year-over-year basis as the Animal Health team continued to manage through the expected macro challenges in the production animal beef, and dairy markets to deliver adjusted operating margins of 3.5% for the segment overall. ","Our ability to deliver consistent margins despite a softer topline shows the impact of our ongoing focus on margin enhancing initiatives and cost management. ","As I mentioned earlier, our private label business has been and remains a strong part of our margin story. In the second quarter, Patterson Animal Health drove strong internal sales growth in our Animal Health private label business, and we are continuing to invest to expand that offering and enhance our ability to deliver a strong array of products to our customers. ","On the companion animal side, our solid top line performance in the second quarter was a function of our continued ability to deliver a compelling value proposition to our customers. We are pleased with the top line growth in both our U.S. and international companion animal businesses. ","Speaking of our value proposition, we are seeing continued progress on our mission to provide a comprehensive software solution that meets the evolving demands of our veterinary customers.","Our NaVetor practice management software is an innovative technology solution that is easy to implement and helps veterinarians manage their practice. In the second quarter, we continued to enhance the platform with new features and improvements, including integrating a tool called Reputation Builder, which is designed to help veterinarians manage their online reputation and ratings and automate the distribution of customer surveys to deepen their relationships and act quickly on feedback to improve their practices. This is just one example of our continued focus on driving innovation in the software and technology space.","In addition, we continued to benefit from our strategic relationship with Vetsource, a suite of software tools designed to improve compliance, enhance client relationships and increased revenue to thousands of veterinary practices across the country. ","The Vetsource platform offers an integrated ecommerce and delivery solution that provides a tremendous benefit to veterinary customers. As a result of our relationships with NaVetor and Vetsource, Patterson is able to effectively compete in both traditional distribution and home delivery and tailor a solution that best fits the needs of specific veterinarians and their customers. ","On the production animal side, we saw the anticipated impact of continued softness in the beef and dairy markets. Notably, however, the swine business remains strong. ","Importantly, Patterson's production animal teams successfully managed through the more challenging macro market dynamics and delivered results that indicate we continue to gain market share. ","We are well-positioned to capture enhanced incremental value as the macro level conditions in our production animal business become more favorable over time. ","Looking ahead, Patterson Animal Health is continuing to focus on meeting the product and service needs of our customers and driving sales execution. Consistent with our updated guidance we remain confident that this business is tracking in line with our internal forecasts and puts us in position to deliver the topline and margin growth we expect in fiscal 2020.","Across both of our segments, Patterson is a trusted business partner for our customers. We are delivering more than products, by providing services, technology and solutions to help our customers run their practices and businesses more efficiently with greater confidence to invest in their practice and the tools to help them meet their goals. ","As we continue our focus on enhancing our value proposition for our customers, we will continue investing in our business to expand our portfolio of products, services and solutions to capitalize on opportunities in both the animal health and dental markets. ","Now, before I turn it over to Don, I'd like to provide an update on the significant progress we have made towards resolving two important legal matters over the past several months. ","As a reminder, these matters relate in part to legacy issues. However, reaching resolution has taken considerable time and effort from our current team. With these legal matters now largely behind us, Patterson is in even stronger position to execute on our strategic goals. ","First, Patterson announced this morning that we have reached an agreement in principle which we expect will resolve the previously disclosed investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia into certain non-compliant Animal Health international sales of prescription animal health products as well as other non-compliant processes the company disclosed during the investigation.","The agreement in principle remains subject to further negotiation and final approvals, but under the terms, our subsidiary, Animal Health International, Inc., will pay a total fine and forfeiture of $52.8 million and plead guilty to a strict liability misdemeanor offense under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in connection with its failure to comply with federal law relating to the sales of prescription animal health products.","In addition, Patterson and Animal Health International will enter into a non-prosecution agreement. Once the agreement is final, Patterson intends to finance the settlement expense through existing liquidity without impact to our capital allocation strategy, including plans to continue to return capital to shareholders. ","The agreement in principle is part of ongoing close cooperation on our part with the U.S. Attorney's Office in connection with its investigation. In the course of that cooperation, we voluntarily shared with the government the findings of Patterson's own internal investigation across the enterprise into our licensing, dispensing, distribution and related sales practices. ","Importantly, as a result of our own investigation, we have already made modifications to our licensing, dispensing, distribution and related sales processes that are designed to drive compliance with relevant regulations. ","Secondly, in early November, Patterson announced that we were approached by the FTC and accepted its offer to settle a separate matter regarding an administrative complaint filed by the FTC concerning alleged conduct in 2013 related to the company's willingness to negotiate with buying groups.","While we categorically deny any wrongdoing, we determined that, for business reasons, a settlement was in our best interest. The agreement does not impose any monetary fine or require an outside monitor.","As a part of the settlement, Patterson agreed to continue to maintain our ongoing personnel training on anti-trust laws and to continue making independent decisions with regard to buying groups. ","The significant progress toward the resolution of these legal matters builds upon the substantial enhancements we have made to our compliance program. I personally, and our entire management team, believe our compliance obligations are fundamental to our culture and operations. Patterson is committed to continuing to enhance all of our compliance and regulatory programs.","During this fiscal year alone, we have taken a number of important steps to put these words into actions, including creating a standalone compliance department which reports directly to me; investing in external subject matter expertise; hiring executives with extensive experience in the areas of compliance and regulatory affairs, including specifically both a Chief Compliance Officer and Vice President of Regulatory Operations; formalized our compliance program with substantive internal policies and procedures; and included compliance and regulatory as a key performance objective as part of our internal business scorecard.","All of these actions, among others, are focused on ensuring compliance across the entire organization. We are pleased with our progress toward resolving these legal matters along with the strengthened infrastructure in place to continually reinforce our commitment to compliance. ","As I mentioned, although these matters relate in part to legacy issues, reaching resolution has taken considerable time and effort from our current team. As a result of the steps we have taken, these legal matters are largely behind us and Patterson is well-positioned to execute on our strategic priorities and focus on driving performance improvements and delivering value for our customers and shareholders. ","Taking a step back, we are now in the second year of our three-year plan to drive improved performance. I'm pleased with our team's focus on execution and our progress in the first two quarters of fiscal 2020 puts us in position to accomplish our year-two goal to grow our business on the top and bottom line and deliver enhanced value for our customers and shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call now over to Don for a deeper dive into our financial results.","Don Zurbay ","Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal 2020 second quarter were $1.42 billion, an increase of 1% versus the second quarter a year ago.","Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships, increased 1.9% versus the second quarter a year ago. ","We're pleased to have continued our trend of positive year-over-year internal sales growth, which we believe reflects the positive impact of our initiatives to stabilize and grow the business. ","Our second quarter adjusted gross margin was 21.5%, an improvement of 50 basis points from what we achieved in Q2 of fiscal 2019.","Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter were up 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis, primarily related to timing of certain expenses. ","We continue to carefully manage our operating expenses within each of our business segments and at the corporate level, while also balancing the need for investments to sustain and grow the business for the long term. ","In the second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4%, which represents a 40 basis point improvement over the same period in the prior year. Our consolidated adjusted operating margin has continued to improve, and in this continued momentum is the result of Patterson's efforts to drive operational improvements, effective mix management and expense discipline. Our ongoing execution on these priorities are contributing in tangible ways to our fiscal 2020 results.","On the bottom line, we experienced a GAAP loss attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the second quarter of $33.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share. This loss on a reported basis is primarily attributable to the fact that, during the quarter, we recorded a reserve of $58.3 million related to the anticipated settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia investigation into the sales of prescription animal health products. ","While the agreement remains subject to further negotiation and final approvals, we expect, based on ongoing discussions with the government, that the recorded reserve will cover the total cost to resolve this matter.","As Mark mentioned, Patterson intends to finance the legal expense from existing liquidity. We do not expect legal expenses to result in any change to our capital allocation strategy, including plans to return capital to shareholders.","Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserve expenses and accelerated debt issuance costs, totaled $36.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.","Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.39 in the quarter. This represents a $0.04 or 11% operational improvement over the second quarter of 2019 when excluding the investment gain that we recorded in 2Q of last year. ","Now, let's turn to our business segments. In our Dental business, internal sales increased 4.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. On that same basis, Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies were essentially flat during the second quarter compared to a year-ago. ","Consumable sales continued to improve sequentially as the customer experience and productivity of our most recent sales team hires improve and our talented sales force uses their new CRM tools and promotional programs to drive sales. ","Internal sales of equipment in the quarter increased 12.3% versus the same period a year ago. As we have previously stated, the equipment market can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of manufacturer-run promotions, the release schedules for new products and technology and other factors. Our job is to capitalize on these events as our sales team did in Q2, resulting in strong growth, aided by new innovation and promotional programs in the CAD\/CAM and core equipment categories. ","Adjusted operating margins in Dental were 9.8% in the quarter and reflect an approximately 140 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. This operating margin improvement was the result of continued sales execution on both consumables and equipment, an improved mix from increased sales of private label products and value-added services and disciplined expense management. ","Now, let's move on to the Animal Health business. Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.7% compared to the same period a year ago. This performance was driven by a nearly 4% sales increase in our companion animal business that was partially offset by slowing market growth and reduced producer profitability in the production animal business related to the dairy and beef cattle categories of the market and some improvement in the swine category. However, in both our companion animal and production animal businesses, we believe we're growing at or ahead of the overall market. ","Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.5% in Q2, an approximately 10 basis point decrease over the second quarter of the prior year. ","Now, let's look at several cash flow and balance sheet items. We have continued taking actions to improve our overall working capital, increase Patterson's cash flow and strengthen our balance sheet, and we're pleased to see the impact of our results.","During the first six months of fiscal 2020, we have used $14.7 million in cash from operating activities. We also collected deferred purchase price receivables of $212.3 million in the quarter, which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. ","To fully appreciate our improved cash flow, the combined total of these two line items from our cash flow statement totals $197.7 million for the quarter. ","When calculating adjusted free cash flow, which we have explained and calculated in our press release, cash has improved by $2.1 million during the first six months of fiscal 2020 compared to the first six months of the prior year.","We have also taken several actions to optimize our debt structure. During the second quarter, we paid off our term loan. Subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into agreements with various institutional purchasers of our privately placed debt to purchase and cancel $379 million of these notes on or about December 9. ","To fund this debt retirement, we intend to draw on our revolving line of credit and a new committed term loan under our existing credit agreement. ","Turning to capital allocation, we continued to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we returned $25 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and, on a year-to-date basis, we have returned $51 million back to our shareholders as dividend payments. ","Our board continues to view our dividend as an important component of returning value to our shareholders, and the current dividend yield provides a nice baseline return to shareholders as we continue focusing on our plans to drive improved performance in the business.","Let me conclude with some comments on our fiscal 2020 guidance. We now expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.52 per diluted share.","For our fiscal 2020 adjusted EPS, we're raising our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.36 to $1.46 per diluted share compared to the prior range of $1.33 to $1.43 per diluted share.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk ","Thank you, Don. The end of our FY 2020 second quarter marked the halfway point in Patterson's three-year plan to drive performance improvement. Year one fiscal 2019 was focused on stabilizing our core business and our results show that we have successfully accomplished that goal. ","In fiscal 2020, our focus is on continuing our momentum and driving top and bottom line growth. I'm pleased with our progress and believe we're right on track to continue to execute on our strategic priorities. ","Over the longer-term, our strategic plan will focus on investing to expand our products, capabilities and service offerings. ","Before we conclude, I want to thank our entire Patterson team for their passion, focus and dedication. The hard work of our strengthened Patterson team continues to show itself in our improving performance, and I have great confidence that we are aligned, energized and focused on bringing enhanced value to our customers, business partners and shareholders. ","And with that, we will now open the line, so Don and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair. Your line is open. ","John Kreger","Hi. Thanks very much. Mark, can you talk a little bit about how your corporate account business is doing across Dental and Animal Health? Curious if it's growing faster or slower than the rest of the business, and as we think about the coming calendar year, do you have any key renewals outstanding and also do you see other kind of jump all opportunities that you can go after? Thanks. ","Mark Walchirk","Yeah. John, thanks for the question. We're certainly pleased with the continued focus on our corporate account business, obviously referred to as the DSO space in the Dental segment. I think as I've indicated previously, we've invested in field resources to continue to capitalize on the opportunity there, and we're really pleased with our results. And while, obviously, we don't report specifically on a specific customer segment, we certainly see our DSO business growing faster than our overall business. And so, we're really pleased with that and we also are really focused on working with the DSOs that see the real value in what Patterson can provide across our entire portfolio of products and services. ","And the same would be the case in our Animal Health segment, continued investment that we're putting in field resources in this area, continued opportunities for us to grow in this area, and we view the corporate account space really across both Dental and Animal Health as a nice growth vehicle for us going forward.","Don Zurbay","John, this is Don. I would just add, we're also \u2013 with all that said, I think we're taking a pretty disciplined approach to the way we look at DSOs and make sure that they're a customer that fits our profitability profile and has the profit we need in order to take them on as a customer.","John Kreger","Great. Thanks. And maybe just one more question. It sounds like you're seeing some improved performance in the dental consumable business, particularly in the U.S. From your perspective, is that better market or just better productivity out of your sales force? Thanks. ","Mark Walchirk","Yeah, thanks. I think, specifically, really continued execution and continued improvement in the productivity from our entire team. We talked about really improvements that we've made to the customer experience. We've talked about improvements we've made in building out our value proposition. And certainly, as we've invested heavily over the past couple of years in rebuilding our sales organization in the Dental business, we're really pleased with the productivity of our team, not only our less tenured reps, but certainly our tenured reps as well, who I think have a renewed energy and focus and certainly driving continued improvements in the consumables category is a key focus for us, and we're really pleased with the fact that our U.S. consumables business grew during the quarter. ","John Kreger","Great. Thank you. ","Mark Walchirk","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Erin Wilson Wright","Great. Thanks so much. How should we be thinking about the quarterly progression of the dental equipment business with the timing of the DS World Show and some of the promotional activities? And can you speak to Dentsply Sirona's new promotional activity with the One-DS program and how the economics work for Patterson? Thanks. ","Don Zurbay","Hey, Erin. This is Don. Maybe I'll take the first one. I think that, when we look back over the trailing 12 months, we see a 5% growth in our equipment business. I think, obviously, there's timing involved. You're all well aware of those kinds of things, but we would look at that mid-single digits as kind of the longer-term view on what we can do with equipment. ","Mark Walchirk","Yeah. Just to add, Erin, I think, certainly, we really appreciate the great partnership we have with Dentsply Sirona and certainly as they're continuing to advance their business and introduce new and innovative products and continue to think about how they provide a total solution to our joint customer, that's good for Dentsply Sirona, that's good for Patterson. And we're really pleased with how our relationship there is continuing to evolve, and we're certainly pleased with the great performance our team delivered and working closely with them at the recent DS World, and we're just excited about the continued potential moving forward. ","Erin Wilson Wright","Okay, thanks. And then I guess, could you speak to on the Animal Health side, speak to the underlying trends across breaking down both companion animal and production animal species segments, at least directionally kind of how those are trending, how we should think about the quarterly progression there? And are you taking share across the companion animal side? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yeah, thanks. certainly, as we indicated, we do have some different dynamics in the two portions of our Animal Health business. I think we've spoken to some of the macro headwinds in the production animal space and we certainly have that built into our go-forward forecast. Certainly pleased with the continued growth in our companion animal business, up 3.5% in the quarter. We think that that's right in line with the market and probably at the higher end of the market that we believe is growing in the 2% to 4% range, and we continue to focus on really building out our value proposition in that area from a technology perspective, from an equipment perspective, from a value-added services perspective, and we believe really the vet continues to be at the center of the ecosystem. We believe we provide crucial value to the vet. ","I would also say certainly in light of obviously, some challenging macro headwinds in our production animal business, really pleased with the overall performance of our Animal Health segment during the quarter, and as I indicated earlier, certainly, I expect continued performance from that team through the remainder of the year.","Erin Wilson Wright","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. ","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Mark, I wanted to go back to the equipment business. You did talk about pulling forward some business there. And to Erin's question, what do you think the next couple of quarters look like? And is there any way to quantify or maybe qualify for us how much of that initial upgrade push you might be through? You have the advantage of having a big installed CEREC base of customers. I think we're all assuming there's going to be a good amount of upgrades to Primescan from Omni and Bluecam. So, are we halfway through that? Or are we a quarter way through that initial pop? And when do we go to needing to execute on just kind of growing that overall market outside of upgrades?","Mark Walchirk","Yeah. Jeff, thanks. Well, look, certainly, we're very pleased obviously with our results in the quarter around equipment overall and, certainly, in the CAD\/CAM category. But I would also just refer back to Don's comments and our comments during the prepared remarks. You look over the past 12 months, approximately 5% growth there. So, we believe we're gaining momentum in this area. We also are \u2013 believe we're a great partner for manufacturers that introduce innovation in the dental equipment category. We think we're the partner of choice. And frankly, we believe our team does a fantastic job of really the complete start-to-finish process around equipment and technology and can support our customers. And, frankly, we believe we get more than our fair share of that opportunity. ","We're also excited about the pipelines that we speak to our manufacturers about in terms of future innovation. And certainly, as relates specifically to Primescan, we saw certainly a combination of both new users and upgrades.","Getting more specifically to your question, Jeff, in terms of the exact timing quarter-to-quarter, obviously, I'm not going to get into that, but we're pleased with our results in the quarter. We're certainly pleased with the pipeline that we have in our overall equipment and technology space. And I would tell you also, we're very pleased with all of the wraparound services that we provide that we think really differentiates us in the market in this area.","Jeffrey Johnson","Got it. That's helpful. And on the consumables side, I think many of us are onboard with the move to private label as well, which has been a big area of opportunity for you guys over the years. How much, though? Is there any way to quantify or help us think how much that is creating a headwind on the topline, even though I know it's net neutral or maybe even beneficial to the flow-through to profitability? But just trying to understand kind of your core growth versus what might be some headwinds from that trade down to the private label products for some of your users. ","And then, outside of that, maybe core pricing on general consumables. Are we still positive, neutral, slightly negative on apples-to-apples, like-for-like products? Or just how to think about pricing in the industry as well? Thank you. ","Mark Walchirk","Yeah, thanks. I think, obviously, in consumables, you have a kind of a price volume mix scenario there. Obviously, different factors affecting the ultimate number. I would say the market is competitive. We're not seeing any undue pricing pressure. It's certainly a competitive market. Obviously, there is some reduction in the average sales price as we think about continuing to build out our private label portfolio. And we do see some unit growth. So, without getting into specifics, we certainly look at our consumables business in those three areas. And we're certainly pleased with the continued sequential trends on a quarterly basis that I think we've delivered here over the last number of quarters and also pleased with the fact that we did grow our consumables business in the U.S. in this quarter in light of the other factors with regard to private label, competitive pricing mix, et cetera.","Don Zurbay","Jeff, this is Don. Just on the question of the impact of private label on our sales growth, I would say, overall for Patterson, it's relatively modest, less than a percent impact. ","Jeffrey Johnson","Got it. Thank you, guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kedra from G.Research. Your line is open. ","Kevin Kedra","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, just a quick housekeeping question. On the gross margin, the GAAP number, about 21.3%. You guys at 21.5%. The delta there looks like about $3 million. So, was that just the litigation tied to \u2013 the $3 million tied to one of your vendors? I just want to clear that up. ","And then, secondly, I want to ask bit of a big picture question in the Animal Health landscape. We're seeing a lot of shift there between consolidation amongst some of the manufacturers, seeing them start to accept, if not outright embrace, alternate channels away from the vet. So, do you feel that the moves you're making in the technology aspect of that business are enough to evolve with the landscape as it appears to be shifting over the next several years? Or are there additional measures that you guys need to take to evolve that landscape?","Don Zurbay","Yeah, Kevin. This is Don. I'll take your first question. So, on the housekeeping item, you're exactly right. The difference there is the $3 million non-GAAP charge that we had. Without that, the gross margin was 21.5%, which was up 50 basis points year-over-year. ","Mark Walchirk","Kevin, with regard to the general landscape around Animal Health, and specifically the companion area, look, certainly, the market continues to evolve as all the markets that we play in continue to do and we continue to think about how those markets will evolve over time. We believe we're very well-positioned. We compete in all channels. And certainly, our solid 3.5% growth in the companion animal business, I think, is a good example of our ability to continue to deliver great value for our veterinary customers. And we're certainly pleased with our growth there and also really continuing to build out our value-added services there. ","And as I said earlier, look, I think the vet is still a crucial component to the ecosystem. We believe it will continue to be a crucial component. And certainly, as we think about continuing to expand our value proposition, working with our technology partners, building out our portfolio of value-added services and technology, certainly, we'd want to be very aware of how the market will continue to evolve, but we believe we're well-positioned. And our team is very focused on ensuring that we continue to stay ahead of some of the evolution that takes place. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open. ","Jonathon Block","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe first, just to start on the Dental side, the op margins were really solid and certainly big relative to our estimate. So, I know you alluded to the value-added services, the private label, but, Don, maybe anything more that you can share regarding the magnitude of these variables in terms of their respective contributions? And then, do we think about the sort of \u2013 I think it was 9.8% in the quarter as the new baseline as we think about further margin expansion going forward? ","Don Zurbay","Yeah. Thanks for the question. Not trying to not be helpful, but, yeah, we're not really going to break out the pieces. I would say it's really just a really nice mix of all of that. And on top of that, good operating and expense discipline. The Dental folks did a great job this quarter with all of that. And so, I think when you put it all together, it gets you to the 9.8%. Yeah, I would look at that as \u2013 we think that we're making good progress and that this is kind of a new baseline for us as we move forward. ","Mark Walchirk","Jon, it's Mark. I think I would just add, look, I think the results in the quarter and some of the improvements from a margin standpoint, it's just a reflection of the focus that our team is putting on really across the entire business and continued positive trends in consumables, obviously, strong growth in equipment, strong growth in our value-added services categories and really ensuring as we think about our overall Dental business, how can we drive topline growth, how can we continue to manage our mix more effectively, whether it's private label, whether it's value-added services and, frankly, pulling all those things together to drive continued top and bottom line growth. And I think that's been the focus and the team is executing well with that focus. ","Jonathon Block","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe to shift over to Animal Health, Mark, you've been calling out sort of the beef and dairy being weak for some time now. But just sort of that high level look at dairy pricing would seem to imply that it's been rebounding. So, just would love to get your thoughts. When you look out \u2013 I don't know \u2013 a quarter or two or more within the beef and dairy, do you see any stabilization or even strengthening of dairy in the horizon? Thanks, guys. ","Mark Walchirk","Yeah. John, thanks. As you indicated, maybe a little bit of an improvement from a dairy pricing standpoint. I think at this point, we certainly believe that some of the continued macro trends, we expect them to continue at this point. And we've certainly built that into our forecast going forward. I wouldn't say \u2013 there may be some small signs, but I wouldn't say we're at a point now where we would expect any material shift in that here over the next couple of quarters. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim. Your line is open. ","Glen Santangelo","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, just want to follow-up on some of the previous commentary around consumables. It kind of sounds like the investments you've made in the sales force are really starting to bear fruit, and that's kind of brought your consumables back into positive territory. But just sort of following up on that market growth question, do you feel like, one, your investments in the sales force are complete at this point? And if that's the case, and we look at kind of flattish performance in that segment, is the market actually contracting at this point or you're still ceding a little bit of share and there's a little bit of a gap you need to close? ","Mark Walchirk","Look, I certainly believe that the market is growing in the low-single-digits overall in the dental space. And we're going to continue to invest in our field sales organization and continue to bring top quality sales reps on to the team, continue to invest in productivity tools to help them be successful and continue to frankly to invest in our overall value proposition for our dental customers, of which consumables is certainly one portion. So, we're really pleased with the continued progress there. We're pleased with the investments we're making in the specific customer segments, not only private practice, but certainly the DSO space as well. And we, obviously, are pleased with the fact that we showed some growth in the U.S. consumables business this quarter, the first time in a number of quarters, and we believe we're continuing to build momentum there. ","Glen Santangelo","Maybe just two quick financial question for Don. Don, you were discussing the non-prosecution agreement. I just wanted to make sure I understand the significance of that. Does that mean this litigation is over for good? And I think you sort of flagged on the heels of that that there would be no change to your capital allocation strategy. I just want to make sure I understood the significance of that.","And then, secondly, on the cash flow side, could you maybe update us on the decision to maybe continue to sell the receivables? And do you think that will continue to be a part of the strategy going for the foreseeable future?","Mark Walchirk","Glen, it's Mark. I'll take the first part and then turn it over to Don for the second part. I think, obviously, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, you can certainly read through our press release. We'll be completing our 10-Q later this afternoon. I would just suggest to read through that really for any more specifics you have. But really not going to comment any further on that at this time. ","And then, with regard to your second question, I'll turn it over to Don. ","Don Zurbay","Yeah. We don't expect the payment of the penalty to impact our capital allocation strategy at all. So, we remain committed to our dividend. And really, we'll make the payment out of our existing liquidity and be in a position to move on from there.","On the receivables sales, yeah, we definitely will continue to do that program. That's been a really good program for us. And we feel like that's something we want to continue. ","Glen Santangelo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the question. Just looking at the dental consumables business, following up on Glen's question, Mark, could you maybe talk about where the incremental growth that you're seeing is coming from? Are these customers that are new to Patterson? Are you doing a better job kind of growing your share of wallet with the existing customers?","And as we look forward, do you feel like you're on a path to kind of maintain that positive consumables growth in the U.S.?","Mark Walchirk","Yeah. Nathan, thanks. I think, really, the improved trends in our consumables is really coming from across all elements. Certainly, we believe we're going and winning back some of the confidence in our customers after going through a difficult time several years ago with the ERP implementation. We've launched programs to bring on new customers. As I mentioned earlier, we've invested in field resources, specifically focused on the DSO space and we're seeing some real positive trends there. So, really, it's, I think, across the board. I wouldn't want to characterize it in one specific area. We believe that we're continuing to make progress in this area. And as I mentioned, we expect to continue to build on that momentum.","Nathan Rich","Great. And, Don, if I could just ask you a follow-up, you talked about the refinancing actions that you're taking. Can you talk about just what impact that's going to have on your interest expense going forward once those are completed?","Don Zurbay","So, we're moving essentially about $380 million from our private placement notes into a bank loan. And there's roughly about a 50 basis point interest expense savings on that move. So, a bit of a tailwind for us. ","Nathan Rich","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just in relation to dental buying groups, or GPOs, that might represent more of the individual or smaller group practitioners, separate from any legal discussion around alleged behaviors from 2013, et cetera, I'm just curious, are you able to talk about just the evolution and prevalence of dental buying groups overall in the marketplace over the past five years or so. Obviously, there has been some acceleration, but I guess I'm just curious at a high-level today, roughly, what percent of the individual dental practitioners do you think are part of a GPO? And also, you probably don't want to say what percent of your reps are tied to that. Just trying to get a sense for how much Patterson's embraced GPOs over the past five years, if it's become a bigger part of the market. Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Steven, thanks. Look, the dental market obviously has different segments. And we focus on customers across all segments. And we're certainly focused on identifying opportunities, whether it's in the private practice space, DSO space, the buying group space, the GPO space, where we can work with customers that fit well with our value proposition, that see the value that we bring across the entire portfolio of products and services and technology, equipment, et cetera. And so, we're not \u2013 we focus on the entire market. And again, we look for opportunities in the buying group space that are a good fit with our value proposition. And certainly, it's a competitive market and we're competing to win in the marketplace across all customer segments.","Steven Valiquette","Maybe just a quick follow-up would be, again, as far as just evolution of buying groups, do you think we're above the halfway point as far as just representation or are we still the lowest? So, there's just a little bit more evolution of that. Just trying to figure out what percent are \u2013 what inning we're in just from your own perspective as far as the evolution of that across your customer base?","Mark Walchirk","Yes. I think that's hard to really give you a specific inning that we're in. Look, I think the Dental \u2013 I would think about it not \u2013 just the context of buying groups, but in the overall evolution of the dental market and the continued segmentation. And as I said, we're focused on all customer segments, including buying groups. I really wouldn't have a comment with regard to where that part of the market is from an evolution standpoint. So, that would be our position there. ","Steven Valiquette","Okay, all right. Appreciate the color. Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you for the question. Where do you think we are in intra-oral scanner penetration? And sort of as a corollary, what are the factors that you would see that would drive the number potentially incrementally higher from here?","Mark Walchirk","Well, Elizabeth, thank you. We try not to get into specifics around some of the micro segments within each of the various equipment technology categories. Certainly, I would say the penetration is high in the intraoral area. And we also see continued innovation in this area. And as I mentioned earlier, we believe we provide a fantastic resource to manufacturers with innovation across the various elements of the technology category. So, I wouldn't want to comment specifically on that micro component of the marketplace. But, certainly, we believe we continue to be a great partner and a great choice for manufacturers with innovation across all of the categories to help deliver really great value to our customers","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, thanks. And then, just switching to Animal Health. Is there anything you think that would be good to call out in terms of any magnitude from any like agency sales shifts in the back half of the year?","Don Zurbay","No, we don't think so. ","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, perfect. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Allen Lutz","Hey. This is Allen in for Mike. Can you provide any commentary on how quickly private label for dental is growing? I know that it's a small number at this point, but is growth accelerating?","Mark Walchirk","Our private label business is certainly growing faster than our overall consumables business. So, we're pleased with that. And that's been a trend that we've seen now for quite a number of quarters. That growth is coming from both further penetration of our existing product categories as well as new launches that we're continuing to bring to the market to expand our portfolio. We're seeing growth across our Dental business as well as across both companion and our production business. And so, we're really pleased with the continued overall growth of private label and certainly believe that there's some runway going forward as well. ","Allen Lutz","Great. And then, regarding the prior headcount reductions and SG&A, is this an area of the business that you think you can grow more slowly than revenue into the back half of the year?","Don Zurbay","Sorry. Can you repeat the question?","Allen Lutz","Yeah. Basically, last quarter, you talked about some headcount reductions. And as that relates to SG&A, is it a part of the business you think can scale over the next two quarters?","Don Zurbay","Yeah. I think it will scale over time. There's, obviously, timing that can affect this on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I am not going to give that kind of specific guidance as we get into the second half, but I think we feel like that's an opportunity for us over time.","Mark Walchirk","I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open. ","Brett Gasaway","Hey, guys. This is Brett on for Kevin. I appreciate you squeezing me in. Going back to the production animal market dynamics, could you comment just a bit more specifically on some of the macro drivers that are driving the weakness? And then, with that, are you seeing any material impact from the growth of plant-based meat on beef market production?","Mark Walchirk","Yeah, thank you. I think as we mentioned, certainly, there's just been some general softness in the dairy market, I think, which has certainly been there over time. I think the beef market, just continuing dynamics with regard to the profitability structure of the different elements of the supply chain there. And we have not seen, to this point, any material, measurable impact with regard to other products. And we certainly believe the long-term fundamentals of the production animal business are strong and we're just seeing some existing macro headwinds in those two categories. I would say our swine category is growing. We believe we continue to do very well there and continue to grow our market share position in that category. ","Brett Gasaway","Great, thank you. ","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. ","Mark Walchirk","Yeah. Thank you so much. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. And we look forward to connecting with you again at the end of our third quarter. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference to your host, Mr. John Wright. Please go ahead, sir.","John M. Wright - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Augusta, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal 2017 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Ann Gugino, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

In addition to reporting our Dental segment, our Companion Animal distribution business and our Production Animal distribution businesses are reported as our Patterson Animal Health segment. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you, John, and welcome everyone to today's conference call. Today, I want to begin by outlining how Patterson continues to evolve both in relation to the needs of our customers and in our ability to strengthen our operating model. This is not only important to understanding key aspects of our third quarter performance but also establishing the context for where we are heading and our approach to get there. Patterson has a long history of leading change in our chosen markets, and this is at the center of our current strategy. Our markets today face a combination of shifting customer needs, opportunities, and challenges that demand we continually evolve and further enhance our ability to execute. I will break this down starting with our Dental segment.","As I discussed last quarter, we have had extensive conversations with customers over the past year representing all clinical environments about how their needs are evolving. We are speaking to you today from the Chicago Dental Society's midwinter meeting, where we continue to collect these observations and use them to inform our product and service strategy. These conversations help solidify our decisions to make some strategic changes in our Dental business over the past couple of quarters.","These changes have the potential to disrupt our business in the near term but are designed to enhance our long-term competitiveness and move Patterson even closer to enhance our long-term competitiveness and move Patterson even closer to being the partner of choice for the widest range of customers. We began with our sales force realignment last June. We undertook this initiative not just to enhance productivity, but to nurture those sales professionals who are better able to accommodate our dental customers' needs, whose needs are becoming more sophisticated. These changes continue with our decision to alter the nature of our relationship with our long-time and valued partner, Sirona.","As you know, we announced last quarter that Patterson has chosen not to extend the exclusive portion of its relationship with Sirona beyond its expiration in September of this year. We made these moves fully understanding their potential to impact our sales performance in the near term. However, we believe Patterson knows how to reengineer for growth and we have a history of making well-calculated yet disruptive changes in our business to create new opportunities. For example, just over two years ago, we announced our intent to broaden the range of products we sell on the core equipment side of our dental business. This meant expanding beyond our relationship with our long-time strategic partner, A-dec. While this move certainly created near-term disruption in the channel, we have since added several other manufacturer relationships and product lines to this offering while further deepening our relationship with our highly-valued partner, A-dec.","Our performance is the core equipment category during the third quarter was a bright spot. In fact, it was the strongest quarter we've had in this product category since calendar 2009. We believe our success with navigating these kinds of business model adjustments provides a preview for what we intend to accomplish on the technology side of the dental business. That decision two years ago to broaden our offering in core equipment led to our desire to expand into other categories while simultaneously enhancing our relationship with Dentsply Sirona.","When we announced our decision last quarter to transition to a new working relationship with them, we understood this had the potential to disrupt our technology portfolio in the near term.","We made significant progress in the last 90 days to secure our key assets and focus our sales team, but the possibility for disruption still exist. However, we remain committed to the CEREC platform for those practice environments where chairside restoration can be an important differentiator. We were pleased to achieve modest CEREC growth in the quarter. In line with our expectations for CEREC sales during the period, our performance supports our commitment to this important technology.","Looking at our Dental Equipment category more broadly, there were two aspects which were disappointing during the quarter. The first was our performance in the digital x-ray category. As we've stated before, our efforts over the years have led to a substantial market share penetration for Patterson in this category. At a certain point, incremental growth in this area becomes even harder to achieve.","The second relates to the effects of Section 179 which is now a permanent tax benefit for purchases of capital equipment by practitioners. While we typically see spikes in equipment purchases in late December, this did not materialize during the quarter as it has in previous years. We believe, however, that the permanence of this tax benefit will create a better capital planning structure for our customers and lead to an evening out of sales over the course of the year rather than concentrating them at calendar year-end.","Lastly, a word about dental consumable sales in the quarter. The consumable sales environment was mixed during the quarter and our sales in this category continued to reflect tempered but stable conditions compared to last year. We also believe that there remain certain softness in our performance that is unique to Patterson as a result of the disruption from our sales realignment initiative. That said we remain optimistic that this period of transition for our Dental business is a positive and necessary one to make us even more relevant and valuable partner to all our customers, from the small dental practitioner up to the dental service organizations. The new customer relationships we are creating through expanded equipment offerings we believe will lead to new consumable relationships.","Regarding dental service organizations, we are pleased with the progress we have made with our newest customer, Heartland Dental. We devoted the month of January to implementation and are now getting close to being fully operational with all of their offices. Based on the feedback from Heartland, this relationship is off to an outstanding start and we are excited about the potential it holds.","Moving on to our Animal Health segment. We are at roughly the halfway mark of our three-year integration timeframe in our Animal Health business. In only a relative short amount of time we have accomplished a tremendous amount. We've unified two cultures, consolidated the Animal Health business headquarters in Greeley, Colorado, integrated numerous locations, and we accomplished all of this while piloting and preparing to roll out a new enterprise resource planning system. However, along with these many critical successes, we have some challenges and new learnings on how we can better execute.","Last quarter, I mentioned that we experienced a softer pricing environment which was leading to margin compression in the Animal Health segment. Indeed, we have had more manufacturer contract changes during this period of integration than we previously ever experienced and this clearly was one factor affecting the margins. However, we are fully committed to thoroughly examining all factors and approaches to restore the margin profile of this business.","During the third quarter, we looked very closely at a wide range of potential factors and gained clarity and deeper understanding of areas of execution that we need to target for improvement. While some of manufacturer pricing pressures remain, we have identified several ways all within our control to improve margins. These include partnering more closely with our manufacturers, adjusting and aligning our marketing approaches, and better managing our product mix. We began to implement some of these initiatives late in the third quarter, and while we have more work to do on this front, we are already starting to see improvement.","It's certainly encouraging to see our team respond swiftly to these execution challenges. We have a long history of collaborating with our manufacturer partners to best serve our customers in a mutually productive way. I'll remind you that Patterson Animal Health is the distributor of choice in the animal health industry. And as consolidations take place at the manufacturer level, we believe our scale will become increasingly critical to the supply chain.","Looking at our performance in the segment during the quarter. In Production Animal, we continue to see general overall recovery in end markets with particular strength in swine where we continue to gain market share. In beef cattle, which is our largest production animal market, we did see some sale-softening in the quarter due to lower utilization among independent producers. We also experienced solid growth in the Companion Animal category during the period, a reminder that the fiscal third quarter is the seasonably lowest period in this segment.","Before I turn it over to Ann, it's worth reiterating that both of our businesses are tied to compelling long-term and market trends. In Dental, that includes a generally stable employment market and aging population that will drive demand for dental care and practice environments that are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and therefore, ever more reliant on us to support this dimension of change.","In Animal Health, it means the central role of the U.S. agriculture industry will play in satisfying the protein demands of a growing global middle class. It also means the persistent rise in both companion animal ownership and spending per pet. These are opportunities we are engineering for.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Scott, and thank you, all, for joining us today. As Scott touched on, we experienced a combination of some challenging conditions and self-imposed headwinds during the fiscal 2017 third quarter, and our performance reflected these factors. We are focusing on the factors we can control while adapting our approaches in both of our segments to improve growth and operating performance.","As I've done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations. While there are some minor final tax adjustments related to the sale of Patterson Medical reflected in our GAAP results, the results from these discontinued operations have essentially cycled.","Looking at our top-line performance, consolidated sales for the fiscal 2017 third quarter were virtually flat at $1.4 billion on a reported basis. When adjusting for foreign currency translations, sales grew 1.4%. On to margins. Our third quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin was 6.7%. This is down 100 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. The decline primarily stemmed from reduced gross margins across the business and a planned incremental cost from our ERP implementation.","On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $27.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to $57.2 million or $0.60 per diluted share a year ago. As we outlined last quarter, we elected not to extend sales exclusivity for the full portfolio of Sirona products beyond September 2017. This move, we recorded a noncash impairment charge in the current quarter of approximately $36 million pre-tax or $0.24 per diluted share and our GAAP results reflect the impact. This noncash charge is related to the distribution fee associated with the CEREC product component of this arrangement. It will not affect Patterson's liquidity, cash flows or compliance with debt covenants. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs, declined 14.9% to $55.4 million in the fiscal 2017 third quarter.","It is important to point out that, on a pre-tax basis, the step-up in ERP expenses represents approximately $11 million of the decrease in adjusted net income for the quarter, as anticipated. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased 14.7% to $0.58 per diluted share compared to the year-ago quarter.","Now, a look at our segments. In Dental, we saw market conditions in the quarter that were similar to the first half of the fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, sales were down 1.8%, and that decrease was essentially the same on a constant currency basis.","Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.8% in constant currency during the third quarter. The decline here reflects a combination of end market softness as well as disruption from our sales force realignment that we implemented in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We expect this effect to moderate over time.","While not a significant contributor to consumable sales in the third quarter, the kickoff to our relationship with Heartland Dental was another highlight. In January, we completed the rollout of our ordering system to Heartland Dental locations on schedule. This included getting Heartland's 750 office locations trained on the new web portal. This is an important accomplishment, and Heartland is very pleased with their sell rates thus far. We look forward to further growing our partnership with Heartland.","On to Dental equipment. Our results here were also mixed. The 1% constant currency decline in Dental equipment sales reflected a combination of factors: lower contributions from the digital X-ray category; modest growth in CEREC; and a double digit increase in core equipment. As Scott mentioned earlier, from a volume perspective, this was our strongest performance in core equipment in the better part of the last decade.","Looking at our Dental segment margins, adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points year-over-year. However, when you back out the step-up in ERP expense in the third quarter allocated to this segment, operating margins grew 20 basis points, reflecting good execution on our expense control effort.","Now, turning to our Animal Health segment. As in Dental, results in this segment were mixed. Overall, we saw increased sales across our Animal Health business in the 2017 third quarter. On a reported basis, consolidated Animal Health sales grew 1.7% year-over-year. After adjusting for the impact of currency, Animal Health segment sales rose 4.9%. Our Animal Health business continued to face a more challenging environment related to branded pharmaceutical trends. In response, we began adapting our go-to-market approaches to increase profitability and are pleased with the early progress.","It is worth noting excluding the expense step-up related to the enterprise resource planning systems implementation allocated to the Animal Health business, operating profit for this segment was up slightly year-over-year. We also maintained our focus on integration synergy capture, which remains on track.","Taking a look at our Companion Animal business, our third quarter reported companion animal sales rose 1.9%. Adjusting for currency, companion animal sales increased 8.5% over last year. Looking at our U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth is up 12.8% and 6.2% when adjusted for agency buy-sell. As a reminder, our fiscal third quarter is the seasonally lowest sales volume quarter for the Companion Animal segment. Growth in production animal sales in the 2017 third quarter improved 1.3% constant currency versus the year-ago period. Overall performance in the Production Animal segment reflects strong sales in the swine market offset by lower sales in beef and dairy.","A word about beef category sales, we continue to see some recovery in beef end markets during the quarter. However, sales were impacted during this period by lower utilization (18:38). Our ongoing animal health integration initiative and progress toward planned synergies remain on track.","This fiscal year, we are focused on more effectively leveraging logistics across both of our businesses, further consolidating our back-office functions. We still expect to deliver between $18 million and $20 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year, which will enable us to meet the $20 million to $30 million run rate of synergies in year three that we announced at the time of the acquisition.","Now, a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Our net cash generated from continuing operations improved in the quarter to $45.9 million compared to a use of $33.6 million in the prior year quarter. We believe that cash flow will continue to improve for the balance of the year as we continue to work on reducing our (19:32) inventory. I'll remind you that we are maintaining a higher inventory in our Animal Health business and to maintain service levels through our ERP implementation. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing (19:49) returns in our business and continue to expect to convert between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow fiscal 2017.","Over the next five years, we expect to generate more than $1.3 billion of free cash flow. CapEx totaled $8.1 million in the fiscal 2017 third quarter. As you are aware, the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning initiative has been an area of intense focus for our team for the past three years. This system will ultimately help drive new efficiencies across our enterprise and provide the foundation for a more ambitious and effective e-commerce platform.","These efforts are now moving much further into the rollout phase and we want to share some perspective on our progress. For many companies, the path to enhanced efficiencies and new capabilities these systems can provide is rarely straight or smooth. However, as we have moved through the piloting and rollout phases of this initiative, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the learnings we need at every step have been quickly leveraged and rolled forward into subsequent phases.","Our production animal colleagues who had recently completed such an implementation have been a tremendous asset in our recent progress. We continue to make progress rolling out this system and scaled up our deployment in our third quarter.","During the period, we brought another 17 locations on to the new platform and crossed the threshold in the broad implementation of the new system. It's impressive to see how this system is already starting to transform our business especially in the speed of order picking.","As previously disclosed, we expect a $25 million pre-tax step-up in the expense to the full year related to this system. In the third quarter, we began depreciating our investment with the new system which along with training contributed to the rise in related expense. As we noted below, these expense step-ups are largely loaded into the back half of the year as we scale up deployment and we expect this to continue into 2018.","Turning to our capital allocation strategy. We continue to execute on our strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. We returned approximately $60 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and nearly $160 million year-to-date. We remain fully committed to our dividend and we have increased it ever since it was instituted. We have approximately 14.5 million shares remaining under our current board authorization.","Our strong balance sheet along with our newly expanded debt capacity gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically. During the quarter, we extended and increased the company's revolving credit line from $500 million to $750 million and also amended Patterson's term loans. These new bank facilities give us greater financial flexibility at more favorable terms and enhance our ability to execute on all components of our capital allocation strategy.","Looking at tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.4%. Our third quarter tax rate is historically lower due to true-ups of estimated taxes as actual returns are being filed. By comparison, our tax rate for the quarter was in line with the same period last year. We still expect an adjusted annual tax rate in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. Now, I will review updated fiscal 2017 guidance. We have narrowed our adjusted earnings from continuing operations to the range of $2.27 to $2.33 per diluted share. Our adjustments exclude the impact of transaction-related costs, deal amortization, integration and business construction expenses, noncash impairment charges, and a benefit from cash repatriation totaling $0.56 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.71 to $1.77 per diluted share.","Our guidance range assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. I will also note that it does not include the impact of future share repurchases. Our guidance assumes we will continue to have EPS headwinds related to our ERP implementation, our Sirona relationship change, and margin pressures in animal health, much of which will extend into the next fiscal year.","We are committed to delivering on key elements within our control within these areas: realizing efficiencies as we implement our ERP system, focusing on procurement savings across all areas of our business, improving working capital particularly in the area of inventory and receivables, and closely managing expenses. In addition, we will work to capture even more synergies in our Animal Health segment.","With that, I will turn it back to Scott for further comment.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Ann. I'll wrap up with just a few additional comments. We have mentioned this before but it's worth repeating. We are guiding Patterson through an important period of change that we believe will lead to an even tighter alignment for our customers and partners in both segments and improve growth. As we've gone down this path, we have received positive feedback from many of you regarding our ability and willingness to make the difficult decision to move Patterson to a new plateau.","With our desire for portfolio expansion efforts in Dental, our margin improvement efforts and ongoing integration efforts in Animal Health and our enterprise resource planning initiative, we believe we'll combine to do just that. And I'm greatly encouraged by the confidence and enthusiasm of our teams whether it's our efforts to refocus in Dental, stepping up our execution in Animal Health or pushing through each stage of our enterprise resource planning initiative, I believe that our level of engagement and commitment has never been higher. This will drive our future success and so will the support of our customers and manufacturing partners.","We are encouraged by this engagement at dental and vet industry events thus far in 2017. We had substantial traffic at our booth at our North American Veterinary meeting earlier this month. We are again looking forward to a positive engagement here in Chicago at the mid-winter meeting, and we are certainly eager to again participate in the International Dental Show in Germany next month. This is the world's leading dental trade show and we are looking forward to the introduction of multiple new innovations at this event.","Finally, we are in the process of putting together our tactical business plan for fiscal 2018. We look forward to giving you insights into this when we report our fourth quarter and full fiscal year earnings in May.","Now, I'd like to take any questions you may have, and I'll turn the call back over to Augusta.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. Good morning. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. How are you thinking about the dental consumable trends coming out of the quarter given the industry trends we've been seeing over the last six months or so?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Elizabeth. With regards to North American consumables, while we're seeing some encouraging signs around the consumable market, we do think it's too early to call any short-term trends permanent. I think it's safe to say we're taking a prudent approach to the remainder of our fiscal year with regards to consumables, but we are still quite confident in the long-term fundamentals for the market in North America. And just a reminder, we look at stable to improving consumer confidence, unemployment levels that are below 5%. I think a key thing is continued customer interest in investing in equipment and technology, which we believe enhances their clinical outcomes and productivity. And then sort of the big macro factor that is the favorable demographics that are going to drive demand. So, we still look at a stable market, some encouraging signs but want to be cautious not to call a breakout just yet.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Thanks. Can you also talk about any early feedback you've received from the sales force and customers regarding the Sirona transition and perhaps anything you've heard from Sirona competitors as well?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I would say on the Sirona front, when you look at the quarter I think from an operational perspective, it was very successful as we worked through a number of tactical issues. I feel very good about the messaging that's been communicated throughout our organization and throughout Dentsply Sirona with regards to the decision being in the best interest of our customers and our partnership. And also, I think the traction we're getting from our prior strategy about expanding the portfolio I think gives our people and our customers great confidence in the future.","I think it's important to state, once again, as I did last quarter, that Dentsply Sirona is and always will be a great and strategic partner. Currently, we're working very close with them on managing through the next phase of the partnership and are absolutely committed to each other's mutual long-term success. I would say the initial noise of the announcement, and I don't want to underestimate that, is mostly behind us and we're focused on sales execution through the balance of our exclusive relationship with Sirona.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Scott, can you expand a bit more on your comments around the profitability for Animal Health? Some of the contract issues that you talked about last quarter, how has that played out as just one manufacturer or is it sort of a broader trend? It seemed like margins had a nice little rebound at least sequentially. Can you just kind of talk about where you see that going on a normalized basis. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thanks, John. I'll have Ann sort of cover the shorter-term tactics that we've tackled and then let me talk a little bit about the longer-term strategy around margins in the segment.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. So, over the last 90 days, we've done a deep dive on the margin compression and the contract terms, and we have confirmed that our contract terms across specific pharma companies did deteriorate relative to prior year and at a little bit higher clip than the compression that we've seen in the past. We do believe our contract terms are similar to others in the industry. With that said, clearly, it appears we experienced more short-term negative impact than others in the industry. However, if you look at the current quarter, our actions have resulted in some nice margin improvement. Our consolidated growth margins in the segment were actually up 10 basis points in the current quarter and if you compare this for the first half of the year where we saw margin compression that is a nice improvement. You asked kind of long term where we think margins would go. I would expect that we can get back to that 5% operating margin rate in the next two years.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Great. And let me hit a couple of items to give some context to where we're at, and more importantly, where we're driving the business. It is a fact that we had more changes, and I mentioned that in my script, to our vendor contracts with our largest partners in probably any other time in our 15 years in the companion space. And at the very same time, we were integrating two businesses and combining our corporate and marketing functions in one location in Greeley. I would say the integration timing magnified some of these short-term issues with regards to the contract changes.","That being said, we have identified our issues and really spent the last 90 days implementing our go-forward strategy which includes strengthening our marketing and promotional strategy, as well as better management of our product mix. We've had substantial communication with our top partners, which we really appreciate, and are working on driving mutual success. Because we see Patterson as a partner that future suppliers are going to want to leverage in terms of our sales coverage scale and logistic expertise.","So, we feel like we're tackling the issue and making progress.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, Scott, that's helpful. Maybe just to go back to I think the very last thing you said in the prepared remarks about still working on the plan for 2018. Broadly speaking, should we be able to view 2018 as a return to more normalized earnings growth for Patterson or should we be thinking about it still as a transitional phase for the company? Thanks.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","So, John, I would say it's still going to be a transitional year. Clearly if you look at the current year, there's a lot of moving pieces here. And some of those factors will take time to work through and carry into fiscal 2018. So, mainly working through the profitability challenge that we just talked about in Animal Health associated with the branded pharmaceuticals. We've got the changes within the dental technology products. In addition to Sirona, we'll plan to add new technology products to the portfolio next year. We have new customers that we're on-boarding. But of course, we'll continue the ERP rollout.","So, as you look at the puts and takes heading into fiscal 2018, we do expect our ability to grow EPS will be a bit constrained and below our stated five-year average target of at least 10%. So, we're continuing to refine our outlook as we continue to work through the challenges we're facing, and we'll continue to do that over the next 90 days and provide a more definitive outlook on 2018 next quarter. I would emphasize though that longer term, past 2018, when we get through the ERP implementation and some of these transitions, we do believe the underlying businesses organically will grow in that 8% to 10% range or better, and we'll be able to continue generating significant amounts of cash.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Scott and Ann. Can you evaluate the sales force realignment? Is it safe to say sales trended below where you thought they'd be net of this effort? But what can you say about profitability? Did that meet your expectations \u2013 what the remaining sales force was able to accomplish?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Great. Thanks, Bob. Good question. I'll have Ann start with some breakdown and growth by customer segment and then I would like to come back and sort of revisit the strategy which I think is important.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. I'll start with the profitability. So, I would say, yes. If you look at the Dental business while we saw an 80 basis point margin decline, when you back out the impact of the ERP implementation we were actually up and improved by 20 basis points. So, we're definitely getting the profitability that we expected.","If you look at the top line and you look at the accounts that were not impacted by the sales force changes, we're definitely growing at market or better in those accounts. And then, if you look at the accounts that were impacted by the changes, I would characterize it as stable and similar to what we saw in Q2 as it relates to consumables. But definitely equipment sales are up nicely in these accounts which was part of the strategy.","And then, just as a reminder before I return it back to Scott, the upside opportunity from these actions is much greater than the current business lost. There's between $200 million and $300 million of market potential tied up in these underperforming accounts.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And just going back to the strategy and as many people who've followed our story know, we have a history of evaluating our go-to-market strategy. We took similar action about eight years ago when we really retooled the way we went to market around technology and that really led to a big acceleration for EagleSoft and our digital products. So the move strategically was about putting our best people in front of more opportunity as well as knowing that we're going to leverage more and more technology to make our sales force more productive.","So, it really does tie in strategically to this foundation we're building through ERP in terms of really being able to drive data and then the digital strategy we're building out. So, I would say we anticipated there would be some short-term share loss but are incredibly committed not only to the strategy but I think it's very important committed to the sort of market-leading strategy that the Patterson sales force is the best sales force in the dental industry. And we are now just giving our sales force even more opportunity going forward to interact with customers.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And maybe a follow-up. While you're below your 8% to 10% EPS growth guidance for this year, next year, are there no opportunities to accelerate your ERP implementation and why not step up the share repurchase at this point. It doesn't make as much sense if you're growing north of 8% to 10% in 2019 and beyond?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","So, I think as it relates to the ERP, I would agree it's kind of the common theme amongst the team where we're saying, okay, let's pull it forward, let's go faster. So, this was the first quarter where we're really in that broad implementation phase and we brought up 17 sites, and so we just need to watch that closely. But certainly, if there's an opportunity to accelerate that and go faster, we're in 100% alignment that we want to make that happen.","As it relates to the share repurchases, clearly it's a balance. We are carrying higher than normal investments in working capital as it relates to the ERP. So we have to balance the share repurchases against the cash needed to operate the business and then, of course, the debt leverage. So, we'll take a very disciplined approach, but I do agree there's more opportunity to invest in the future there, Bob.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Scott, back on the core equipment experience in Dental, can you parse out how much of the improvement is the new portfolio and some of the internal things you're doing versus the market? And is it fair to look at that growth experience as a positive leading indicator potentially for consumables?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah, Brandon. I think you're on to something here. I think where we're very encouraged is the strength of the sales in traditional equipment is broad across our partners and leading the way with our largest partner. I think there is some benefit, as I mentioned, from Section 179 being permanent and dentists being able to plan their capital spend more strategically. So with volume numbers like we had here in the quarter, and I would say we feel very confident as well in our backlog.","We're starting to see new office build and remodel projects begin again, and that absolutely is a very positive indicator for the future. So, when I look at what's going on in the marketplace, I am a believer that the consumable market has very strong long-term fundamentals in it. We're still going through I think a bit of a patchy period in the industry where any green shoots people are saying that's a trend, but longer term, I think the market's in a very solid place. And our customers are small business people. With the right tax incentives and economic environment, our ability to get back to normal market rates for the whole industry I think is very realistic going forward.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, and then one for Ann. On the inventory line stepped up quite a bit sequentially. Can you talk about where you see that level of safety stock plateauing given the ERP rollout will continue over the next few quarters? And free cash flow for the year, I know that you're back-end loaded. Is this sort of the new normal in terms of the seasonality for free cash flow generation?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","It's definitely always been a bit seasonal but I would agree it's been a little bit more volatile over the last couple of years, and I think part of that is just the integration with the Animal Health business and just learning how their inventories flow, and then of course, as you mentioned, we're working through the ERP implementation. We did have improved cash flow from operations in the quarter. We actually generated $45.9 million this year versus a year ago in the quarter we used $33.6 million, so we are getting better each quarter. And we believe the cash flow will continue to improve in the balance of the year.","We estimated about $200 million, and to your point, this will be driven by a strong finish in working capital, but it's also historically strong just due to the sales volumes and operating profitability that happens just naturally in our business in Q4. We're probably somewhere between $100 million and $150 million, higher than we'd like to be. A year ago between Q3 and Q4, we were able to take out about $140 million. We'll probably take out $100 million. But to your point, the real value is reducing it over the longer term, and that's something that we're really working on with the ERP team to balance, is you want to make sure you hit those still rates and take care of the customer. So, we're really just refining that. It's something we talk about every day. But I would expect us to get to more normal working capital levels next year in 2018.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel.","Ethan Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, this is Ethan on for Jon Block. A couple of questions here. Maybe if you could just circle back on the North American dental market. You indicated that consumables conditions in fiscal \u2013 the third quarter were similar to what you experienced in the first half of the year. Two of the other larger dental players, specifically called out improved market conditions in January and also December. I just want to be clear, are you not seeing that same level of improvement that the other players alluded to? Or is that just you're choosing to take a more conservative view at this point?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Good question. I think we're just taking a more conservative view. If you look at the raw numbers that people are reporting, they're very similar to the prior quarter on absolute terms. So, we're in no way seeing the markets degrading at all. It's stable. There are signs of improvement. But I just think as the entire industry struggled for explanation as to the slowness over the last six months, I think you've to be careful as well to bullishly call a rebound.","Ethan Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then just shifting to Animal Health. You provided a decent amount of commentary on the beef cattle market, I was just hoping you could just discuss how dairy performed in the quarter. I believe last quarter you called out a more protracted recovery than expected but prices have seemed to rebound over the past couple of months. Any thoughts on how dairy performed in 3Q? Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Dairy was similar to prior quarter but I would say we're encouraged by a few things on the dairy front when we think longer term particularly the largest dairy market is California. And obviously, the impact that the drought has had on input costs for our producer customers has been a strain and obviously, I think everyone knows, it looks like the drought has been broken and longer term that will benefit our customers and the health of that sector. So, our team, one of the things we really love about our Animal Health team is the deep experience they have managing through cycles. And I would say the leader of that business feels good about the longer-term prospects around dairy and the strategies we'll implement to gain share there.","Ethan Roth - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird has our next question. Mr. Johnson, your line is open.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sorry. Can you guys hear me okay now?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yes.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good. Good morning. So, Scott, I guess, one question just on the sales force realignment I want to come back to is just at one point last June when you talked about these cuts you talked about backfilling with some of your higher performing reps and all that. Is it still the plan of attack so with current reps? Are you hiring new reps for those territories? And if you're backfilling, are you starting to see some, I don't know, pick up of business, I guess, would be the word I'm looking for or something there in those territories or is it going a little slower than you thought?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Great question, Jeff. It's a mix of putting the right talent. Sometimes it's a two-year or three-year rep who's really hitting their stride and giving them more opportunities. Other times, it's our more established reps who have more capacity, I would say. Some early positive signs, as Ann mentioned, is the equipment sales we had into that segment. And as we said, there was a lot of white space, almost $200 million to $300 million of what we felt was trapped opportunity. That being said, when you do something like this, it's never a straight line but we're very committed to it. I would say we continue to add high-level sales talent, but it's not like we're filling back the same number of sales reps as we go forward.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","And I think the interesting part to note when you look at just the overall strategy and the number of accounts impacted, if you look at about 85% of the accounts, we're actually retaining the majority of the business and growing very nicely at market or better. There's about 15% of the accounts where we're just struggling a little bit more, where maybe the rep was a little bit stickier, and we're starting to see that stabilize. But that will take some time, but it's in a very small group of accounts.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, Ann, just my other question would be on the gating of ERP and I ask this quite a bit, but I just want to make sure again this quarter. I think you said $11 million in incremental ERP this quarter. So, it feels like we're kind of at now the peak level we should be expecting in the near-term. Is that fair? Or are we up here now at $10 million, $11 million a quarter we see that for another, what, three quarters and then maybe we start to see some leverage off that in the back half of 2018 or how should we think about the gating of those ERP expenses from here?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","So, that's correct. So, it's $25 million for the year, so we had $1 million in Q1, about $3 million in Q2, $11 million in Q3, so we're expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 million in Q4 and then that step up in expense will continue to annualize in. So, it's not that it will be increasing beyond the $25 million necessarily but it will continue to annualize in for the first half of 2018. And then, to your point, it will start reducing the expenses as we get the rollout completed in the back half of the year.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And any early views on how quickly that maybe $25 million run rate could come down? Is it a third of that comes out over a year or just how to conceptually think about that?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well \u2013 so, if we go back to the $25 million step-up, 20% to 25% is depreciation and doesn't go away, right?","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","And then 25% is roughly implementation cost, so that's goes away right away. So, as soon as we're done implementing and we're not doing anymore, so, I would say 25% comes out right away. And then the remaining 50% is really the infrastructure required to support the ongoing system. And as Scott alluded to, the next step is to continue to improve our Web platform.","So, I would say about 25% comes out right away. And then the real magic is now how do you get the return on investment in terms of efficiencies across the portfolio. Once you're up and running, now you're able to truly shut down legacy systems. So, there'll be some other expenses that come out now as well that we're working right now on plans to implement.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. This is Jason Jakoby in for Bob. Can you talk about your CEREC inventory levels as we get closer to the end of your exclusivity agreement with Sirona? I guess what are you seeing in terms of sell-through in dental equipment? Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. This is Scott. I'll take that and actually why don't I have Ann talk about working capital strategy? She talked a little bit about it previously, but I think that's important, and then let me get into the specificity around Sirona.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Right. So, we're still carrying, as we talked about, a higher level of investment in working capital. It's in accounts receivable but, as Scott mentioned, it's in inventory as well. And it is primarily related to the ERP implementation. We expect to reduce our investment in working capital by about $100 million over the next 90 days, as I talked about before. And this is very similar to prior year, so we tend to run inventories down at the end of the year to minimize the impact to LIFO.","And then, Q4, and this ties in a bit here to your Sirona question is usually a big equipment quarter which helps working capital utilization because we don't generally carry receivables on equipment sales. So, there's still an opportunity to improve and we fully expect to do that through the balance of the year.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I would say with regards to Sirona, obviously, as we move from an exclusive to a non-exclusive relationship, we are working with them on working our inventory levels down in certain product lines, CEREC in particular. We have had a 20-year relationship with Sirona and have worked through many supply chain ebbs and flows with them, so this is not new to either company. But we are committed as partners and I think you saw that already in some public messaging from our great partner, Dentsply Sirona. So, in the quarter we did make some progress on the CEREC front and on some digital intraoral products.","I would say we were a little bit heavier on the extraoral X-ray front, particularly because that is an area that traditionally in the late half of December those are the fastest moving products because a customer can make a late tax-based decision. And in the last two or three years, we got into situations where we were actually short on inventory towards the end of the year. So, we always want to be very cognizant of not being able to fill all orders.","So, net-net we ended the calendar year with a little bit more extraoral inventory than we had hoped. But we're starting to make progress on the other side and sort of moving our CEREC and some other inventories down. And we'll continue to work on that over the next six months.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks. And then on the DSO segment, thanks for the update on Heartland. Good to hear that that's almost fully operational. Could you just provide us any more detail there? And then just broadly speaking about the DSO segment, how focused are you on this market and is further DSO penetration embedded in your long-term growth outlook?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Obviously we're very excited about this new partnership with Heartland. As I said, we're off to a really good start and I think both our management team and Heartland's are very encouraged by how our teams are working so closely together. They are pleased with the transition and when the customer is happy those are good things. I would say it was \u2013 I had the honor to speak to over 1,000 of Heartland's dentists at their winter conference in December and that was an incredibly impressive event. And it was also exciting. I spoke to a lot of customers who are former Patterson customers are excited about the new relationship.","I would say we've seen this space as a strategic imperative and one that will drive future growth. I would couch it right now as very active and dynamic. And we're excited about the number of conversations we've been brought into. And also, I think it's a proof point our ability to serve this space and also be a partner of choice with more customers.","So, as we work through our strategic plan and tactical plan for FY 2018, obviously this will be a part of our growth story that we talk about 90 days from now.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Jacob.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Kedra with Gabelli.","Kevin Kedra - Gabelli & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First on the dental market, I know it's been tough to pinpoint what's been driving the softness there, but just any additional intelligence on that and maybe anything that might be driving the easing of that softness that we seem to be seeing? And then secondly, just on the UK vet business, the old NVS. Any update on how that business is doing in the quarter and any opportunities to maybe improve the cost structure there?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","So, I think in terms of...","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Let's go back to the first question.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","So, the first question was the U.S. market. I'll knock the UK one out and...","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yes.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Hi, Kevin. So, the update on the UK business is, it was a pretty average quarter, growing at market. So, they were up about 4% in local currencies. They've been trending around that 4% to 5% all year long. They are having some good customer wins. We just won a large corporate account over there. So, clearly, when you look at leveraging your fixed and semi-variable costs, that definitely helps. We're always looking at ways to become more efficient and more profitable. One of the other things that we're working on there is bringing some of our value-added equipment offerings and service offerings to that market. And so, we've been at that for about 12 months or so. We're starting to get some traction there. So, we do believe we can bring those markets up over time. And I would say the business is stable and performing well.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. And Kevin, I'm sorry about that. Back to the U.S. market, I think it's just a case of mixed signals in terms of where the market was headed over the summer. But I think we're in complete agreement with many of our industry partners in the long-term prospects as well as the stability of the market. And as I said before, our dental footprint is North America. And as we look to improving North American economic conditions and also potentially U.S. pro-business friendly-tax policies, we think that can drive the business to more historical market trends. So, in no way do I want to be pessimistic because I'm not, but I think just given the fact set of the last six months, you need to be careful about calling the breakout just yet.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Cherny with UBS.","Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. This is Allen in for Mike. On Animal Health, you spoke about the contract changes upstream. So, looking downstream, are there any opportunities to partner with other pharmaceutical purchasers or other things to improve your leverage for procurement?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, that's definitely part of the strategy. So, one piece of it is the big pharma companies and the contract terms there. But then to your point, there is always a private label strategy. About 60% of the total revenues are pharmaceuticals, but there's another 40% where getting after a private label strategy, potentially doing some bundling is an opportunity. I will say on the pharmaceuticals and this is a point that I think is important as it relates to the big pharma-branded products. The manufacturers actually set the price with the customer.","So, that one's a little bit more to manage \u2013 or a little bit more difficult to manage with the customers. You really have to manage that more back with the manufacturer. But certainly, there are other areas \u2013 private label, certainly the value-added services as we continue to build out the equipment platform. Equipment has margins in the 30 percentile. So there are a number of things that we can do to improve margins in that segment. And of course there's cost reductions, how do you become more efficient? The ERP implementation's a piece of that and so are the synergy captures. So we're looking at, where are more creative ways that we can get after the expenses.","Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. Maybe just a step back on the dental equipment side. You obviously have some near-term headwinds related to the decision around the Sirona portfolio and you've talked about the slowing growth in digital x-ray. Can you maybe talk about what you see as sort of the longer-term top line growth in sort of the broader dental equipment category on a more normalized basis and do you think that growth opportunity has slowed relative to prior years?","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah, Mike. I would say absolutely not. I think when we look at the future and you look at the best-in-class infrastructure we've built in terms of technology support and probably the most highly-trained sales force that we see we will be the most relevant player in the digital transformation of dentistry. And I think you'll see a lot of investment in this space going forward. So, I think we're working through just some short-term issue.","As I said, very, very encouraged by the volume levels we saw in the traditional chair unit, light, cabinetry business back to really prerecession levels which we haven't seen for eight years. So, when I look at growth rates, I see technology and equipment being a big part of the future growth story for the entire industry. And it's going to lead to productivity gains and better clinical outcomes which is good for everyone.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And you talked about increasing the capacity on the revolver. I'm just wondering if you could talk about longer-term target for leverage and can you remind us how you sort of rank your priorities for capital deployment?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. So, if we look at our leverage, we're currently at 2.5 times EBITDA and we can comfortably take that up to 3.5 times for a short period of time, but we would target somewhere between 2.5 times to 3 times as kind of an optimal leverage scenario. Our capital allocation priorities really haven't changed. Our first is reinvest in the business for strategic growth. We remain committed to the dividend which is at $0.96 per share that uses about $100 million annually and then the third lever is the share repurchases. We tend to allocate between $100 million to $150 million there, but we can get more aggressive if we choose to depending on market conditions and working capital levels, et cetera.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","We have no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Augusta. I'd like to close by sharing some sad news from the Patterson family. Yesterday, we learned that our long-time former Chairman and CEO, Pete Frechette, passed away unexpectedly. We trace our roots of our company back to 1877. But as many of you know, Pete was our modern founder. He shaped the industry in the 1980s and early 1990s and built the company with an amazing customer first and employee culture. Please keep Pete's family in your thoughts and prayers. And we thank you all.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"16930":["Patterson Companies, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. John Wright, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","John Wright","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies\u2019 fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Patterson\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Walchirk and Chief Financial Officer, Don Zurbay.

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark Walchirk.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, John and welcome everyone to Patterson\u2019s first quarter Conference Call. Our results in the first quarter reflect the impact of our focus over the past year to drive improved profitability and performance. The continued stabilization of our core business and execution of our key initiatives has enabled our team to effectively manage through an evolving end market environment. Now, before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to summarize a few key points.","First, we grew adjusted earnings per share nearly 4% in the quarter and delivered the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. Second, we enhanced profitability in both our Animal Health and Dental segments and expanded our overall adjusted operating margins by more than 20 basis points year-over-year. Next, we generated $51.6 million in adjusted free cash flow for the quarter and increased adjusted free cash flow by 30% year-over-year. We continued to return cash to shareholders and paid $25.5 million in cash dividends during the quarter. And finally, we reaffirmed our adjusted annual earnings guidance range of $1.33 to $1.43 per share. While we still have work to do I am very pleased with our progress and the focus of our team and we are right on track to deliver on our expectations for the year. Despite lower revenue growth, one of the highlights of our first quarter was our ability to drive enhanced profitability through our focus on three key areas, operational improvements, mix management and expense discipline.","Now before we dive into the specific results in each of our business segments, I\u2019d like to take a minute to discuss how these initiatives helped shape our quarter and position us well for the balance of the year. One example of operational improvement is the focus we\u2019ve made in the tools that enhance the productivity of our technical service team. These tools have enabled us to more profitably deliver valuable expertise to customers who rely on Patterson\u2019s local on-site support infrastructure and national support center.","Here, our team is focused on analytics and operational excellence. The increased productivity of our technical service team resulted in double-digit growth in our value-added services business within our Dental segment. Two examples of our initiatives to improve our mix include our growth in software and e-services as well as our continued focus on private label. Importantly, these improvements came across both our Dental and Animal Health segments. With respect specifically to software and e-services we succeeded in leveraging our strong installed base and relationships with third-party software vendors to provide these higher margin services to our customers, which help them more effectively manage their practice with data and important insights. In addition to providing value to our customers, these services are also highly accretive to our margin profile.","Finally, while we remain focused on making investments in areas that benefit the customer and allow us to drive growth and profitability, we have continued to carefully analyze our cost structure and make appropriate adjustments to ensure our expenses are aligned with the needs of the business. As a specific example of these cost discipline initiatives, we reduced approximately 100 existing and planned positions during the first quarter. Importantly, these changes were primarily focused on administrative roles across the company and not customer facing positions. I\u2019m pleased with our team\u2019s focus on these three key areas, which helped drive our performance in the quarter.","Now I will turn to each of our business segments starting with Animal Health. Our Animal Health segment achieved its operating profit goals during the first quarter, despite overall top line softness. Animal Health internal sales increased 0.5% in the quarter, driven primarily by nearly 4% internal sales growth in our U.S. companion animal business. Adjusted operating margins for the Animal Health segment increased by 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis for the quarter, and importantly, we saw gross margin and operating margin expansion in both the companion animal and production animal businesses. As I mentioned previously, our improved profitability is the result of our focus on driving operational improvements and effective mix management.","Let me give two specific examples within our Animal Health segment of our efforts to increase profitability by focusing on margin accretive initiatives that also provide value to the customer. First, our ongoing commitment to expand our private label business generated double-digit growth in sales of our companion animal private label products during the quarter. We also launched a new private label brand called Pivotal and continued to add SKUs to our broader private label portfolio. Our private label brands allow Patterson to serve our customers with exceptional product at an affordable price and at a more attractive margin profile for Patterson. Secondly is our progress to provide a comprehensive technology solution that meets the evolving demands of our veterinary customers. Our NaVetor Practice Management software is gaining additional traction in the market as veterinarians seek innovative technology solutions that are easy to implement and help them manage their practices.","In addition, we continue to benefit from our strategic relationship with VetSource. For more than a decade, VetSource has provided a powerful suite of tools, designed to improve compliance, enhance client relationships and increase revenue to thousands of veterinary practices across the country. Importantly, the VetSource ScriptRight platform has now been installed in over 21,000 veterinary clinics and hospitals across the country, which continues to position us well to offer an integrated e-commerce and delivery solution. Through this strategic relationship, Patterson is able to effectively compete in both traditional distribution and home delivery and tailor a solution that best fits the needs of specific veterinarians and their customers. On the Production Animal side, our top line performance was primarily impacted by challenging end market dynamics in the beef and dairy markets. On a more macro level, the production market was also affected by uncertainty related to tariffs and trade policy. That said, our Production Animal team successfully managed through a difficult end market environment in the quarter and we\u2019re still able to meet their bottom line goals.","Looking ahead, we expect the swine market to stay positive for the rest of the calendar year however, the beef and dairy markets are projected to remain challenging during this timeframe. Despite these anticipated headwinds, our continued focus on meeting the products and service needs of our customers and the continued great sales execution of our Production Animal team leave us confident we will continue to grow at or slightly above the market during this fiscal year.","Turning now to our Dental segment, we continue to be confident that the overall end market demand is stable and growing slightly. Despite a modest decline of 0.8% in dental sales in the first quarter, our adjusted operating margin grew 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis through operational improvements and effective mix management. We are pleased that our Dental team was able to achieve its operating profit goals for the quarter. On the consumable side, we continued to see our trend of sequential improvement. And while we still have work to do to achieve positive year-over-year growth, our consumables sales trend gives us confidence that our strategy to return the consumables category to positive growth is working. We expect our ongoing actions to improve field execution and invest in productivity tools for our sales organization will continue to drive our improving trend in this category. As I\u2019ve said before, the equipment markets can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Equipment sales growth slowed in the first quarter except in the CAD\/CAM category, which grew 3%.","As a reminder, the slower equipment growth was anticipated following our strong 13% increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the lower levels of manufacturer promotional activity compared to the prior year period. Similar to last year, we expect to see our equipment sales build in the second half of the year when new technologies continue to gain additional traction in the market. Slower growth in equipment was partially offset by strong revenues from our higher margin value-added services business, including equipment services, which was up 10% in the quarter. This strong performance reflects the value our customers see and Patterson\u2019s ability to provide responsive local service and comprehensive national support as well as the return on our investment in an enhanced digital equipment offering and the recurring revenue those additional product sales generate.","Our highly experienced technology support staff at the Patterson Technology Center and our team of local service technicians stands ready to seamlessly support our customers and service their equipment throughout its life cycle and that\u2019s clearly reflected in our results. Equipment in dental technology is a key area where Patterson continues to maintain an advantage. We are excited to sell current and future innovation into the marketplace as we are uniquely positioned to provide customers with exceptional support and service long after their purchase is complete. As we continue to drive effective mix management across our Dental business, equipment services as well as software and e-services are important margin accretive focus areas.","Looking across both of our segments, I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s ability to operate in the evolving environment. We are confident in the strength of our value proposition and our capabilities and we fundamentally believe that continuing to invest in our business for the benefit of our customers is critical to our ongoing and long-term success. As I personally meet with our customers, it\u2019s clear they are looking for a trusted partner to help them run efficient practices and business operations and to help advance their goals. Patterson is evolving along with the needs of our customers to provide a comprehensive portfolio of products, services and technology solutions. Our commitment to being a trusted business partner for our customers will enable us to continue to operate effectively in the evolving environment and deliver enhanced value for our customers and shareholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Don for a deeper dive into our financial results and then I will make a few closing remarks before we take your questions.","Don Zurbay","Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. My initial comments will highlight our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as I walk through the financial highlights for the entire company and each of our two business segments, and then I will cover a few of the balance sheet and cash flow items.","Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in fiscal 2020 first quarter were $1.3 billion, a slight decrease of 0.6% versus the first quarter a year ago. Internal sales which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships increased 0.4%. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year internal sales growth. We believe this trend reflects the continued positive impact of our initiatives to stabilize and grow the business.","Our first quarter consolidated gross margin was 21.8%, an improvement of 60 basis points from what we achieved in Q1 of fiscal 2019. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter were up 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis, primarily related to timing of certain expenses. As Mark mentioned, during the quarter, we completed a modest headcount adjustment as part of our cost discipline to properly align our cost structure with the business and to invest in higher growth and customer-facing initiatives. We continue to carefully manage our operating expenses within our business segments and at the corporate level, while also balancing the need for investments to sustain and grow the business for the long term.","In the first quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 3.4%, which represented a 23 basis point improvement over the prior year. It\u2019s important to note here that while the top line grew only modestly, we effectively managed the P&L to deliver on our plan for the bottom line. We are pleased with how the operational discipline and practices established in fiscal 2019 have gain momentum and have contributed to our fiscal 2020 results in tangible ways. On the bottom line, GAAP net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc. for the first quarter was $30 million or $0.32 per diluted share. This included an investment gain on an equity investment of $0.28 per diluted share and a charge related to a legal settlement of $0.14 per diluted share that were both recorded in the first quarter. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc., which excludes deal amortization costs, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserve costs and investment gains, totaled $25.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, a 5.8% increase in adjusted net income over Q1 of fiscal 2019. Adjusted earnings per diluted share, was $0.27 in the quarter, a 3.8% increase over the prior year period.","Now let\u2019s turn to our business segments. Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.5% compared to the same period a year ago. This performance was driven by a nearly 4% sales increase in our U.S. companion animal business and partially offset by slowing market growth and reduced producer profitability in our production animal business, primarily related to the beef cattle category of the market. In both our companion animal and production animal businesses, we believe we are growing at or ahead of the overall market. Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.5% in Q1, an approximately 10 basis point improvement over Q1 of the prior year. This operating margin expansion took place in both the companion animal and production animal categories of our business. While the top line in our Animal Health segment was impacted by some market softness in production animal, our team delivered on their profit commitments for the quarter.","Now let\u2019s move on to the dental business. In our dental business, internal sales decreased 0.8% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. On that same basis, Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 0.4% during the first quarter compared to a year ago. Consumable sales, however, continued to improve sequentially as the experience and productivity of our most recent sales team hires steadily improves. Internal sales of equipment in the quarter decreased 6.6% versus the same period a year ago.","As we have often stated, the equipment market can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and in Q1 that dynamic was accentuated by the strong finish to our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter when we grew the equipment category by 13%. It\u2019s also worth noting that less manufacturer promotional activity in Q1 compared to the prior year also negatively impacted our equipment sales this quarter. Adjusted operating margins in Dental were 7.4% in the quarter and reflected an approximately 10 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. This operating margin improvement was the result of continued sales execution, improved mix from increased private label sales and value-added services and disciplined expense management. ","Now let\u2019s look at several cash flow and balance sheet items. During Q1 of fiscal 2020, we used $43.2 million in cash operating activities. We also collected deferred purchase price receivables of $105.7 million in the quarter, which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. To fully appreciate our improved cash flow, the combined total of these two line items from our cash flow statement totaled $62.5 million for the quarter. This amount is $12.5 million greater than Q1 of fiscal 2019, when excluding the one-time benefit of initiating the trade AR facility we established last year. When calculating adjusted free cash flow, which we have defined in our press release, cash improved by $11.8 million compared to the prior year. We continue to make progress in the area of managing our accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.","During the first quarter, these items are favorable by $8 million, and compared to one year ago, these same categories in the balance sheet are favorable by $91 million. We believe there is more potential for improvement here and we will remain diligent in our focus and efforts to extend this improvement and free up additional cash to put to work in the business or return to shareholders. Turning to capital allocation, we continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we returned $25.5 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. Our Board continues to view our dividend as an important component of returning value to our shareholders and the current dividend yield provides a nice baseline return to shareholders as we continue focusing on our plans to drive improved performance in the business.","Let me conclude with some comments on our fiscal 2020 guidance. For our fiscal year 20 adjusted EPS, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings guidance range for fiscal 2020 of $1.33 to $1.43 per diluted share. For modeling purposes, as you think about our second quarter, I would remind you that our adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 included a gain of $0.04 related to equity accounting.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, Don. Now before we wrap up and take your questions. I would like to, again, recap some of the highlights from the quarter. We grew adjusted EPS nearly 4%. We enhanced profitability in both our Animal Health and Dental segments. We generated over $50 million in adjusted free cash flow. We continued to return cash to our shareholders in the form of our attractive dividend. And finally, we reaffirmed our adjusted earnings guidance for the year. I want to reiterate that our improved profitability in the first quarter underscores the traction we are gaining from the actions to drive performance improvement that began in fiscal 2019, the first full year of our three-year plan. We continue to make great progress against the three strategic priorities we are focusing on in fiscal 2020 to leverage this momentum and grow our business on the top and bottom line and that will enable us to invest for the future and deliver enhanced value for our customers and shareholders.","First, we are continuing to enhance our value proposition through the ongoing investments in our field sales and service organizations. This involves improving sales execution, measuring and upgrading the customer experience, investing in our digital capabilities, and broadening our value proposition to our customers through our value-added services offerings. Second, we are continuing to focus on strategic margin and mix management through ongoing improvements in sourcing, the expansion of our private label portfolio, disciplined cost management and our focus on improving our product and service mix. And finally, we are generating stronger cash flow by driving operational excellence and disciplined working capital management. These foundational disciplines are gaining traction and positively impacting our performance. Our team is energized and focused on driving stronger performance across our businesses, while also investing in and growing our value proposition, which continues to differentiate us in the market and positively impact our results. Finally, we are squarely focused on continuing to improve our performance and driving greater return for our shareholders.","And with that we\u2019ll open up the line so Don and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. I had a couple of Animal Health questions for you. How would you characterize kind of underlying demand trends across both the production and companion animal markets? Were there any meaningful shifts in veterinary office visits or herd dynamics across each of the species groups and if you can parse out a little bit more, how much of the recent performance in companion animal was market share gains versus underlying demand trends? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Erin. This is Mark, thanks for the question. So, I think certainly as you think about the Animal Health segment in general, you\u2019ve got two kinds of obviously key segments and then certainly within each of those segments, you know you have some different markets. So maybe we\u2019ll talk a bit about companion first. We certainly are really pleased with our results during the first quarter, growing our U.S. companion business nearly 4% from a top line standpoint. We think that\u2019s at the higher end of the kind of 2% to 4% market growth that we believe is taking place in the companion segment. Certainly, you continue to see some evolution in that segment. And we\u2019re certainly serving via the partnerships that we have, via relationships that we have both from an e-commerce and online platform standpoint. So we\u2019re pleased there, and certainly, we believe our value proposition for our companion animal customers is very comprehensive and that we\u2019re getting the benefit of that. If you look to the production business, you know really kind of three distinct markets there. We certainly look at the swine market as continuing to be positive. Obviously under some pressure just given kind of trade and tariff macro environment there, but certainly as that, perhaps resolve, that could lean further positive. Certainly, I think the key issue in this quarter for us is the tougher beef market. And I think as we indicated earlier, we do expect that to continue. Dairy, obviously, has been a challenge for some time and we expect that to continue to be somewhat challenging as well. And if you look at some of the top line in the quarter, certainly our production animal business was affected by some of these end market issues, but certainly we\u2019re really pleased with the fact that they continue to expand their margins and met their bottom line goals.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up to that, you specifically highlighted VetSource, how do you think about the potential impact of the recent developments in the alternative channel with some of the large Animal Health pharmaceutical manufacturers now opening or I guess working directly with alternative online pharmacies, but establishing price floors for prescription products. How does that even the playing field for you or how is VetSource position in light of some of those dynamics that have happened recently? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thanks. So we certainly believe that VetSource is positioned well. I mentioned some of that obviously during the discussion. I think in general, look, as we talked about our markets continuing to evolve though we\u2019re certainly not going to comment on specific pricing strategies of the manufacturers, although we\u2019re certainly working closely with them and really pleased with the continued relationships that we have with the manufacturers across the channel and our team continues to talk about the value that we provide as a channel partner and how we can continue to work together for the common goals of ourselves and manufacturers ultimately serving our customers. And so we think that VetSource is a great platform. As that market continues to evolve, as I mentioned, we also have our relationships with retailers, certainly our core focus is on the veterinary practice and really the comprehensive product and service offering that we have to support those customers. And I would also say, certainly we\u2019re excited about some of the non-pharmaceutical oriented parts of our business as well in the Animal Health space, equipment, value added services, technology, both were up double-digits in the quarter. So we believe that that comprehensive value prop really is important for us and all help contribute to our growth in the U.S. companion segment.","Don Zurbay","Yes. And Erin, this is Don. I mean, I think one of the things that we value here is just the optionality, I think, that we have as we see how things evolve in that segment of the business.","Erin Wright","Okay, excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, wanted to go back to, Mark, your comments about the higher margins coming from software and e-services. Is that going to be a focal point for you guys going forward and how much higher are those margins versus your traditional margins in Dental and Animal Health?","Mark Walchirk","Kevin thanks for the question. Well first of all, I think the software and e-services has been a focus for us and absolutely will continue to be a focus and we have a tremendous installed base within our Dental franchise. We\u2019re building our installed base within our Animal Health franchise and obviously this is a really important part of our value proposition as it really brings value to our customers to have a complete technology solution. We continue to invest in building out our capabilities in this area. We continue to develop relationships with third-party software vendors that provide some wraparound analytic services to our customers. And so, yes, this absolutely will continue to be a focus for us. I\u2019m not going to get into the exact margin, obviously, but it certainly is very accretive to our overall margin profile and definitely an area we will be continuing to focus on going forward.","Kevin Ellich","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then kind of just piggybacking off of Erin\u2019s previous question, with the manufacturers planning to go direct or talking about it, is there anything that you\u2019re doing to prepare or anything that you plan to change in your strategy to combat that and what impact do you think that might have on your business?","Mark Walchirk","Well, I would say that this is not necessarily something that\u2019s a change. I think there has been some evolution with the manufacturers. Are you specifically talking about the Animal Health segment or Dental or both?","Kevin Ellich","Animal Health, Animal Health.","Mark Walchirk","Okay. Yes, I mean, I think this has been something that we\u2019ve been working closely with the manufacturers on for some time and there have been some modest changes in the sales relationships. I think we\u2019ve highlighted those over the last number of quarters. We believe we provide tremendous value in the channel both to the end customer and certainly to the manufacturers as well. I think our companion animal growth again of nearly 4% is a good testament to that and the value that we provide. And certainly, we\u2019re continuing to have discussions with the manufacturers about what we can do to support their business, what we can do together to support our end customers. And again we \u2013 certainly the market continues to evolve, but we believe that we provide tremendous value across the channel and we believe that that will help continue to drive success for us going forward.","Kevin Ellich","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good morning guys. Mark wanted to maybe switch over and look at your Dental business for a second. On the CAD\/CAM the 3% growth you talked about in the quarter. I would assume that includes DI systems, but if you could confirm that, and then maybe tell us what you\u2019re seeing in demand trends for full systems versus DI? And even that 3% number may be a little bit below what we were expecting in the quarter with some of the new scanners that have launched here recently. So maybe what are you seeing demand trends for some of those newer scanners as kind of a category anyway would be helpful? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Jeff. Thanks for the question. And yes to the first part of your question, the 3% growth in the quarter does include DI products. Certainly as we\u2019ve said in the past, we don\u2019t get into specifics around all the different sub-segments of the dental technology. I think the overall quarter in terms of our revenues in that area, I think as we mentioned a couple of key factors. I mean we had a very strong Q4. In fact, I believe our CAD\/CAM revenues were up greater than our overall 13% equipment increase in Q4, which is a great testimony to the sales productivity and our reps obviously driving demand and sales in our fiscal Q4. So I think we anticipated some softness in Q1. As we mentioned also, there was less promotional activity this quarter. So I think from a demand standpoint, we kind of view this as one quarter. If you look out over the past five quarters, I believe our overall equipment growth is in the 3% to 4%, which we believe is very strong. And we certainly anticipate, as we mentioned earlier, ramp up over the coming quarters as we continue to work with our manufacturer partners. They \u2013 we continue to get traction on new products that are being introduced. We continue to see promotional activity in the marketplace and we expect the demand trends again, looking out over a longer period of time to continue at the rate that we\u2019ve seen.","Jeff Johnson","Alright, thank you. And Don, maybe two just modeling questions or finance questions for you, one, receivables now are down about 45% to 50% or so off their 2017 peak, so how much lower do you think, excluding the equipment financings that you\u2019ve obviously done on receivables for a number of years. How much further can those receivables come down, and then the corporate revenue line almost doubled year-over-year. I don\u2019t think I heard you talk about that. Just what flows into that and how does that flow through to EBIT from that corporate line item? Thank you.","Don Zurbay","Yes, the corporate revenue line is really largely driven by the equipment financing and we did have an uplift there in the quarter relative to the forward yield curve and how that plays into that dynamic. However, if you remember, we are hedging those instruments and so there is a hedging loss as well that comes in down below on the P&L. So the P&L geography there that you have to keep in mind that mitigates that fairly substantially when it relates to the yield curve. And sorry, what was your first question, Oh, AR yes...?","Jeff Johnson","Just receivables, yes receivables, yes.","Mark Walchirk","Yes receivables. I think we\u2019re really pleased with where we\u2019re at with the receivables at this point. Obviously we\u2019ll continue to work and we\u2019re doing a lot of different things to try to bring that down. But I think, for us, the opportunity continues to \u2013 the bigger opportunity on working capital really continues to be in inventory, where we\u2019re making great progress. But we\u2019re not satisfied with where we\u2019re at yet. We think we have more opportunity there.","Jeff Johnson","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Glen Santangelo from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, thanks. Mark, I just want to follow up on the revenue questions. You gave some color around animal health and you suggested that maybe more of the weakness was on the beef and dairy side. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color about specifically what the issues are and when they may ultimately abate. And then secondly, on the Dental side, I think you sort of commented that the company continues to make progress on the consumable side and hopefully with the path back into positive territory, do you feel like that could be a 2019 event and what\u2019s your sense with what\u2019s going on in overall market growth because a couple of your publicly traded peers on their 2Q call sort of reported that they may be sort of modest contraction in the market in the second quarter. So anything to help us better assess the top line trends would be helpful. Thank you.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Glen. Thanks for the question, maybe to cover the first part in the Animal health. Where we did specifically see the softness was in our production category and we talked a little bit about those three markets, three core markets; swine I think being slightly positive. I think the real change in the quarter was the beef market where there are a number of \u2013 kind of end market dynamics affecting the demand, the end market demand there in terms of the relationship with the producer, etc. with their \u2013 the timing of when the product goes to the producer, etcetera. So, I think there is a number of factors there. And certainly, I would say dairy has been more consistently soft, just in terms of general demand for dairy products. I think there has been certainly a lot discussed in the marketplace about that. So, again, probably kind of three different markets there, but I think the one that was more challenging for us in the quarter that we expect to continue is in the beef area. Turning to the Dental area from a consumable standpoint, we certainly, as I mentioned earlier, believe that the market is stable and slightly positive overall. We are pleased with the continued positive sequential trends we\u2019re seeing in our consumables business. Obviously we \u2013 it\u2019s important for us to move that into the plus category. One of the things that does give us some confidence as we continue throughout the year is our unit volume. It is actually up on a year-over-year basis. And so, from as we think about mix and focus on private label, the things that affect obviously the consumables market, we feel good about the continued trend there. I am not going to comment specifically on and be precise about the exact quarter where we expect it to turn positive. But we certainly believe that the trend that we\u2019ve seen will continue. So hopefully that helps answer your questions.","Glen Santangelo","No, it does. And maybe if I can just follow-up with one question for Don with respect to the cash flow. If you look at the cash flows in the quarter, obviously they were negative from an operating perspective. And when you take into consideration the sale of the receivables, it was positive. But I think what the markets really trying to assess is that, how much more can you go on in terms of factoring these receivables, and at the current growth level, do you feel sort of comfortable that if you look at your cash flows on sort of a pro forma or adjusted basis, do you feel comfortable that you can continue to meet the dividend at this level and continue to invest in the Company\u2019s growth initiatives. So, any sort of color around that dynamic?","Don Zurbay","Yes, so as you mentioned, we\u2019ve a really nice cash flow quarter. Obviously, you have to take the negative operating activity and add in the deferred purchase price receivable, but when you do that and look at it in that context, we had about 21% growth in our really our cash flow and that\u2019s not a sustainable number. I think that what you\u2019re going to see is, as we improve our net income growth, I expect the cash flow there is some ability to generate cash flow above the net income growth, but over time you\u2019ll see that moderate. We\u2019re not doing anymore factoring of receivables. But I do think on an ongoing basis, yes, we are comfortable that we can, that we can fund our dividend. We think that\u2019s a really nice sustainable piece of our cash allocation back to shareholders and our Board is extremely supportive of that as an ongoing initiative to continue to return cash to shareholders. So, but and then balancing that with M&A, I mean I think as we continue to improve the cash flow and continuing to improve the income growth for the Company, I think that we feel confident that we need to look for the right opportunities and we need to be prudent in terms of how we do that, but we think that there is opportunity there to invest in the business as well.","Glen Santangelo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi, good morning guys. I want to go ahead I just have a question on what\u2019s the corporate profitability line, obviously there was a pretty big step change that sequentially an improvement year-over-year. And so, could you just comment on that and sort of how you see perhaps maybe the pace of the rest of the year turning out or if there are any like one-time factors that were impacting?","Don Zurbay","Yes, this is Don. Thanks for the question. I assume you\u2019re looking at the table in the press release, which is prepared on a GAAP basis. And so that\u2019s showed about a $14 million improvement in the corporate line but $11 million of that was really driven by legal settlements. We had a legal settlement in both Q1 of last year and Q1 of this year; one for $28 million last year and one this year for $17 million and so there is an $11 million delta that\u2019s impacting that number. I think if you get into what are real adjusted earnings numbers, actually our corporate expenses were up slightly in the quarter due to some timing issues and then the remaining impact was some favorability on the equipment financing which I\u2019ve which I already discussed as primarily related to valuing the equipment receivables and how that the yield curve fits into that. So, really in terms of sustainability, I mean, expenses were up slightly. We like what we\u2019re doing there but from an adjusted earnings per share standpoint, it\u2019s very sustainable.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s super helpful. And do you have any change in expectations about your share count for the year?","Mark Walchirk","No, I think left alone without share repurchases, generally the share count will increase slightly, but I would really model it about where we\u2019re at right now as you go through the rest of the year.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay, perfect that\u2019s it.","Operator","Our next question is from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Mark, you spoke to the private label business on the Animal Health side, could you give us some color on just where you stand in terms of traction in terms of SKU builds or relative growth rates for that side in the Dental business?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, absolutely, Brandon, thanks for the question. I think as we\u2019ve indicated previously, the trend of our private label business within Dental in terms of growing faster than our overall consumables business, that actually continued in the quarter. We continue to focus strongly on that area. We continue to look at opportunities to introduce new products. We continue to incent our field sales organization. We continue to work closely with the manufacturers to drive great value there from a supply chain standpoint. And again, our private label business in Dental continues to grow faster on a year-over-year basis than our overall consumables segment and that\u2019s certainly something that we expect to continue and certainly help contribute to some of the improved mix and margin profile from our Dental business that we referenced earlier.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. And a two-part question for Don, you mentioned some headcount reductions in the quarter and mainly around back office, is there more room to go on in terms of those types of moves over the balance of the year. And then, on the gross margin line, would you still expect gross margins to be down year-over-year for the full year despite sort of the better first quarter start?","Don Zurbay","Is there more room? Yes, I mean we\u2019re really continually looking at our expense structure. I think we\u2019ll continue to manage that. We will continue to find areas that we think there is some potential opportunity. So, I think you probably, you may not see anything of that magnitude. But I think as we go through the year, there\u2019s just that continued kind of cadence of trying to find and realize more expense reduction. In terms of the margin, with the good start, I think I\u2019d probably, for the gross profit, I think I\u2019d probably really point you to potential flat to slightly up on the gross margin as you look at the full year fiscal \u201819 over the full year fiscal \u201820.","Brandon Couillard","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","Great, thanks for taking my call. Dentsply made some comments on their call around changing some of the marketing, especially around end of quarter talking and marketing more directly to dentists. Some of the survey data that we\u2019ve compiled recently also suggests more manufacturers are going directly to dentists and DSOs. Are you seeing anything like that? Can you talk a little bit about that both in the consumables and equipment market on the Dental side?","Mark Walchirk","Well, certainly, in terms of the relationships that we have with our DSO customers, we\u2019re obviously very pleased with that. That\u2019s been an area that we\u2019ve focused on, we\u2019ve invested in and we\u2019re seeing some good results from that part of our Dental business overall. I think in terms of similar answer to the question within the Animal Health space, we bring great value to our customers across a wide range of products, services and technology in the dental space and frankly great value to our manufacturer partners as well and we provide a wide range of services to both our customers and manufacturers that bring a lot of efficiency to the supply chain. Certainly, DSO customers have options and I believe they certainly see the value in their partnerships with full service providers like Patterson and certainly in terms of your question around kind of the general kind of marketing of some of the technology and equipment products, we\u2019re working very closely with our manufacture partners to help market those products and new innovation and technology in a market, jointly focused on creating demand in the market, jointly focused on bringing strong promotional activity in the market. And as I mentioned earlier, certainly, we believe that is a big advantage for Patterson and the history of our understanding of these high-technology products, our expanded portfolio of products, the technical service that we provide before and after the sale. So we\u2019re excited to see the manufacturers continue to do things that will generate demand and we think we certainly benefit from that.","Kevin Caliendo","Great, thanks. One follow-up on DSO space, are you seeing increased RFP activity? I know you guys have picked up some share and signed up some new DSOs. Are you seeing an increase in the RFP activity? Is there more opportunity? How would you sort of lay of the land in terms of DSO opportunity moving forward?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, I would say the lay of the land is consistent. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily any more RFP activity. I think certainly with the large national DSOs and the multi-year contracts that have, there is obviously contracts that come up on every several years, so nothing real change there. I think in the RDSO, the regional DSO space, obviously that\u2019s a growing area. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re investing in our field sales and support infrastructure to support that area, but I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s any more activity than there was thee, six, 12 months ago. Certainly, we look forward to continuing to work closely with both our national and regional DSO customers and pursue the opportunities that make good sense for Patterson and that really create those partnerships, where there is real value in the broad products and services and technology solutions that we can provide.","Kevin Caliendo","Alright, thanks guys.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","Great, guys, thanks and good morning. Just a couple from me. Don, I think first one just high-level. I believe most of us had about 2.5% give or take, internal growth dialed in this year with more difficult comps, so really implied a nice step-up in sort of that two-year stack. Should that line of thinking maybe be closer to call it 1% due to the production animal dynamics that you called out and maybe the softer dental equipment at least for the quarter, but hey that you are able to sort of offset that lower revs with some of the initiatives that you called out around OpEx, just trying to get sort of the moving parts around the fiscal \u201820 guidance? And then, I got a quicker follow up.","Don Zurbay","No, that\u2019s fair. I think that I think that it\u2019s probably prudent to look at it that way. I think if you were to dig into our most recent forecast, you\u2019d see some of those dynamics, particularly in the companion animal space. I think equipment again, we\u2019re trying to look at it here now over longer timeframes because of the because of the, you can run into a lot of different fluctuations on a three-month basis. But yes, I think we\u2019re looking at this as, we\u2019re taking into consideration the Production Animal dynamic and also looking at the rest of the P&L and continuing to look at how we\u2019re going to manage it to make sure that we hit the guidance and put ourselves in positioned to hopefully have some upper mobility there.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, and I would just add, I think, as we shared earlier, our performance this quarter is indicative of the work that the team has done over the past year, focusing on operational improvements, focusing on driving better mix, focusing on continuing to run an efficient cost efficient operation, continuing to drive sourcing benefits, private label, investing in our value-added services; all of those things that help contribute to our performance this quarter and I think work that\u2019s been done over the past number of quarters and I think that gives us confidence as we look through the remainder of the year, even in light of some softness, I would say, certainly, particularly in the production animal category and we\u2019re confident as we look forward that the work that we\u2019ve done in those areas and just running the operation in the business more effectively, more efficiently, more productively will yield good results going forward.","Don Zurbay","Yes, I mean, I think those are all sustainable. The things that drove the outperformance on the rest of the P&L are really sustainable type things. I mean, I would not characterize any of what\u2019s happening in below the sales line as kind of one time this quarter only, but most of it\u2019s all sustainable for the remainder of the year.","Jon Block","Okay, great. And then just on the follow-up, Mark, maybe for you I mean, we sort of look at dental equipment on the TTN basis because of the choppiness that you alluded to earlier, but I think you did call out increasing momentum over the next couple of quarters. I just want to make sure that is specific to the back part of fiscal \u201820 you feel comfortable dental equipment will strengthen despite what will be more difficult comps? And then, more high level, when we think about Dental consumables for you guys, you\u2019re obviously specific toward more the basic consumable relative to the specialty. So, I just want to get my arms around what is market for you guys. I mean you\u2019re scraping at flattish on your dental consumable now. Is market sort of 1% if we isolate that basic number? Thanks for your time guys.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thank you. Maybe the second part of your question first. I think that\u2019s probably reasonable if you look at the overall market, certainly we mentioned earlier, we believe it\u2019s stable and slightly positive. Obviously, you can slice and dice up the slice and dice the customers and the segments and all the different elements of the products that we provide or maybe not don\u2019t provide like, as you mentioned. But I do think, certainly as you would look at how we think about our market, certainly slightly positive, and as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re confident in the continued positive trending of our consumables and one of the things as I also mentioned is our units in our consumables are up on a year-over-year basis and so we believe that\u2019s a good indicator as well. I think with regard to kind of the equipment area. I think if you\u2019re looking at a dynamic of a Q4 FY\u201919 into Q1 FY\u201920 and I think we know, to your point, you look at the kind of the trailing 12-months, as we indicated earlier, we believe we\u2019ve grown overall in that category about 3% to 4% over the past four to five quarters and we certainly expect that to continue and we certainly expect to see continued innovation and the work that we\u2019re doing with our manufacturers, continued promotional activity, new product introductions, all of that, we believe gives us some confidence that we can continue to see positive, as you mentioned, kind of trailing 12-month trends in our Dental Equipment business.","Jon Block","Thanks guys.","Mark Walchirk","I think we have time for one question.","Operator","Okay, certainly, our last question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the question. Mark, you highlighted the progress you guys are making with your software and technology businesses across both segments. I was curious, can you just comment a little bit more on what\u2019s driving the acceleration in growth that you\u2019re seeing and how big are those businesses overall for you now and what type of growth should we kind of expect to see from them going forward?","Mark Walchirk","Nathan thanks for the question. I think really what\u2019s driving the growth is focus. These are areas that bring great value to our customers. These are areas that are certainly accretive to us from a margin profile standpoint. We believe we have opportunities to continue to grow in those areas. I mentioned technical service earlier. Great example where just a focus on operational excellence and analytics to help improve productivity, these are the kind of things that we\u2019re doing to run the company and as we continue to find opportunities where we can drive improved productivity, where we can focus on areas of our business that are support our customers, that are accretive to our margins. I mean that focus gets results. And so, we\u2019re certainly going to continue to invest in those areas. We\u2019re certainly going to continue to focus on those areas. I\u2019m not going to go specifically into the size of those compared to the other areas, but I can assure you that these are areas that our teams are very focused on that we expect to continue to invest in and we believe that they can yield continued good results. So, thank you Nathan for your question. I think that\u2019s all the time we have today. Thank you, everyone, very much for your time and interest this morning.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Patterson Companies Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Announcement Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Nagel (00:18). Please go ahead.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Gugino, our Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both fiscal 2014, which exclude the impact of a restructuring charge in the Medical business, and for fiscal 2015, which exclude one-time transaction costs, as well as constant currency results for fiscal 2015. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results and foreign currency impact can be found in this morning's press release.","Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Leslie (01:57). Welcome everyone to this morning's conference call. At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we set a goal to make the most of the opportunities before us, execute well on each of our businesses, and position the company for the future. We are pleased to report significant progress on those fronts.","We decisively moved forward on our stated strategy to drive shareholder value by broadening our view of our markets and building on our strengths. That commitment took on new meaning with the announcement after quarter-end of our definitive agreement to acquire Animal Health International. We also announced the potential sale of our Medical unit, which would allow us to deepen our commitment to our dental and veterinary businesses. Assuming we complete these two transactions, it will transform the strategic growth profile of the company.","In addition to these potentially transformative moves, we strove during the fourth quarter to deliver on the financial objectives we had established for the fiscal year. During the full year and quarter, we focused on execution and operating discipline across all of our businesses, and these efforts paid off. We are pleased that all three of our businesses posted healthy results during the period. Patterson Companies generated record fourth quarter results and we have a firm foundation in place for the transformation we are pursuing.","Consolidated revenues for the quarter rose 6.7% on a constant currency basis of $1.1 billion. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter totaled $0.68. During our third quarter conference call, we had forecasted a solid end to fiscal 2015. Our performance in the fourth quarter allowed Patterson to finish the year strong.","For the full 2015 fiscal year, consolidated revenues reached $4.4 billion, up 8.7% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose to $2.27, at the higher end of our guidance. As Ann will detail a bit later, our 2015 adjusted results exclude one-time transaction cost related to our proposed Animal Health International and Medical unit transaction.","We also stressed on our last call that we are encouraged by the stable to strengthening market conditions we are witnessing, supported by a gradually improving job market and consumer confidence. We see the same conditions today and are excited about the opportunities in front of us.","I'd like now to look at Patterson Dental. Today, Patterson Dental is our largest business with nearly 60% of total sales. Consolidated sales in Dental grew by double-digits in the quarter on a constant currency basis, with equipment and software sales leading the way. Sales in the equipment and software category rose more than 23% on a constant currency basis and we are pleased with the growth and share gains in technology-oriented sales.","CEREC CAD\/CAM and digital technology sales were strong during the quarter. This reflected outstanding execution on the part of Patterson Dental sales professionals and high customer interest. The pace of technology sales growth during the quarter further supports our belief that dentists are eager to invest in technology that improves patient experience and clinical outcomes. It also affirms the overall trend towards dental office modernization. Moreover, we believe that Sirona's innovation culture and Patterson Dental's industry-leading sales, technical service and after-sales support is a powerful combination.","During the fiscal year, we significantly increased the number of users of the CEREC CAD\/CAM platform, as we continued towards our goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020, doubling the CEREC user base in the next five years.","We believe that our offerings and market fundamentals set the stage for continued growth and market share gains. As we announced in January, we are in the process of expanding our partnerships in the traditional core equipment category. Our relationship with A-dec will remain very strategic to our future growth plans.","In the past weeks, we have formally announced new relationships with Pelton & Crane and the Belmont Company. Both of these partners bring unique opportunities to our sales force and customers. We are excited as well to launch the Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment later in the fall. Patterson has long been the partner of choice for dentists investing in their practices. We see our expanded relationships creating many new growth opportunities.","Looking at dental consumables, we experienced 3.3% growth in constant currency in this category. We are confident both that the trend towards higher number of office visits and overall demand for dental services will continue, and that we have the industry's best sales force to help our customers address this demand.","Moving now on to Patterson Veterinary, which today comprises just under a third of total sales, consolidated veterinary sales were up 2.7% on a constant currency basis. Equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator. During the quarter, sales in this category improved more than 31% in local currencies.","Patterson Veterinary continued to grow this quarter, while we progress with the transition to our new manufacturing relationship with Abaxis. Abaxis is a market leader in point-of-care blood instrumentation and consumables for the veterinary market and medical and research customers. We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to Abaxis, but we are off to a good start and are pleased with the Abaxis placements today.","Patterson is selling the full line of Abaxis' veterinary diagnostic products, including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. Like in Dental, we are well positioned today at Patterson Veterinary to take advantage of the stable to improving market conditions, both here and in the United Kingdom, through our market-leading technical service and support as well as the premier sales force. Of course, there are compelling growth trends in the companion animal market, with pet ownership and the amount spent for pet continuing to grow. The prospects for Patterson Veterinary now have the potential to get even more exciting. With the acquisition of Animal Health International, the size of Patterson Veterinary will double. We will significantly expand our presence in the production animal market, which has its own very promising long-term growth prospects, and it will create meaningful leverage across our animal health platform.","Turning now to Patterson Medical. This is our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit representing approximately 10% of our total sales. Medical's performance during the fourth quarter was again very solid and reflects the hard work our team has done to refine their market focus for this business and execute every day. This resulted in the fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth excluding currency and divestiture impacts.","Today, Patterson Medical has a strong platform, momentum in the business and position in the marketplace as the global leader in the physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. We finished the year strong and carry momentum into fiscal year 2016.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Thank you, Scott. Let me begin by reiterating that we are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the contribution from all three of our businesses. Note that to help clarify our underlying operating performance, I'll be discussing adjusted results for the fourth quarter of both fiscal 2015 and 2014. This excludes one-time costs related to both the pending Animal Health International acquisition and the potential Patterson Medical transaction in the 2015 period, and restructuring costs in last year's fourth quarter.","Starting with the top line, about 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. Therefore foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S. sales. On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by 2.5 percentage points. From an EPS perspective, that impact was about $0.01 per diluted share.","Now, turning to each of our segments, beginning with Dental, Dental sales improved 10.3% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. As Scott mentioned, consumables continued to grow, up 3.3% in constant currency. To put this quarter into context, year-over-year growth for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 was 2.5%, 3.1% and 4% respectively. So the fourth quarter growth in this category was in line with the momentum we saw during fiscal 2015.","We are excited about the expansion and technology sales during the quarter. Notably, new user demand for CEREC was strong, which helped drive up the equipment and software sales category by 23.3% on a constant currency basis.","Turning next to Veterinary, Veterinary sales were $356 million, up 2.7% in constant currency. Please keep in mind this is the first full quarter impacted by the transition from IDEXX to Abaxis. You'll recall that IDEXX shifted to a direct sales model on January 1. Fourth quarter results in Veterinary reflect the disruption created as we replaced those products with the Abaxis line. I also want to mention that due to seasonality, the current quarter and the first fiscal quarter of 2016 will show the most pronounced impact on revenues from this shift.","Excluding the contribution from the diagnostic sales,provides a more normalized picture of growth within the veterinary segment. Veterinary sales excluding the diagnostics change improved 8% in constant currency and more than 10% in the U.S. Looking at our UK operation, NVS. This division is performing well post integration on a local currency basis. Growth in NVS during the fourth quarter was 5%.","On to Medical, again, we had solid performance this quarter. The segment's fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth. Sales totaled $113.8 million in the quarter, up 3.7%, excluding currency and prior-year divestiture impacts.","Now, turning to margins. Consolidated gross margin was 29%, up 30 basis points from the adjusted fiscal 2014 fourth quarter. This is due to sales mix during the period. Growth in the higher margin Dental revenue outpaced revenue growth from lower margin veterinary by several percentage points during the quarter. From an operating leverage perspective, we are realizing the benefits of scale at higher sales volume. Adjusted operating margins rose 70 basis points, an 11.3% increase in operating profits.","Within Dental, our operating margins, excluding corporate expense rose 50 basis points. In Veterinary, operating margins held steady year-over-year. Operating margin in our Medical unit increased 3.5 percentage points excluding the divestitures. As expected, our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.1% versus 33.7% in the prior year. Our DSO remained unchanged year-over-year at 50 days and our inventory turns were at 6.8 compared to 7.1 a year ago.","Looking at the full fiscal year, our goal was to execute in all of our businesses and we delivered on several fronts. Patterson's organic growth was 4.3% excluding acquisition, IDEXX and currency impact. We expanded our operating margins excluding the impact of NVS by 10 basis points.","Operating cash flow improved by 34% to approximately $263 million, and Patterson returned $129.3 million to shareholders in dividend and share repurchases. Patterson had lower share repurchases in fiscal 2015. As is clear now, there were important strategic reasons that prevented us from being in the market later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, share repurchases remain an important component of our capital allocation strategy.","A few balance sheet items. During the fourth quarter, we favorably refinanced $250 million in private placement debt that came due in March. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. Fourth quarter CapEx totaled $18.4 million and included investments from normal replacements, as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the fiscal 2016 full-year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $50 million to $60 million and an annual tax rate of approximately 35%.","Finally, as you saw in our release, we are establishing our adjusted fiscal 2016 earnings guidance in the range of $2.40 per diluted share to $2.50 per diluted share. This guidance range includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016. I'll note that this guidance excludes approximately $0.05 of one-time training cost related to our enterprise resource planning implementation.","Regarding this initiative, we are currently in the testing phase and expect the pilot rollout of this new platform to begin in late fall or early winter. Our guidance range also excludes the potential impacts from the acquisition of Animal Health International and the impact of a potential sale of Patterson Medical. We intend to update our guidance ranges as these transactions unfold.","We are excited at the prospects for what these two potentialtransactions could mean for Patterson. While Medical is a solid margin contributor, Animal Health International would add a much larger, more synergistic growth opportunity and a more expansive platform for enhancing our financial profile over the long term. We expect this transaction to be accretive in the first year on an adjusted basis. Pro forma revenues for the Veterinary segment are approximated at $3 billion.","It would diversify the revenue mix between companion animal and production animal with production animal revenue increasing from 11% to 51% of the total for the segment. And lastly, we see significant opportunity to grow the bottom line between $20 million and $30 million in realizable synergies over a three-year period.","With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ann. Our transition from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 has special significance. We immediately faced a couple of important milestones. The first is working toward the close of our agreement to acquire Animal Health International. I want to remind you why we are so excited about this combination.","We believe that Animal Health International is the ideal partner to create a complete platform for Patterson Veterinary. They will immediately bring to Patterson extensive leadership in the production animal space, adding a new component to our revenue mix that is tied to its own unique compelling market opportunity. Today, Animal Health International is posting better than GDP growth and we will have the chance to build on that through cross-selling our clients \u2013 cross-serving our clients. Their experience in serving beef, dairy, cattle, and swine producers complements the strengths both companies share in the companion animal and equine markets. And for our customers in particular, this will mean new opportunities to better serve them. Both Patterson and Animal Health International place a premium on innovation, technology investment, and high-touch customer service.","Just after our recent acquisition announcement, we launched a microsite dedicated to this transaction, pattersonanimalhealthinternational.com. We will be using this site to provide information on the combination of Patterson Veterinary and Animal Health International as we work towards closing the transaction and move forward with the integration process.","The second milestone is potentially selling Patterson Medical. As we stated before, our goal is to find a buyer that values the performance-based culture our team has worked hard to create and one that intends to invest in the future to unlock its potential.","Moving ahead, we remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. Even with the proposed transactions ahead of us, we maintain a balance sheet that gives us a lot of flexibility. During the fourth quarter, our board of directors approved a 10% increase in our dividend. We remain committed to utilizing all the means we have at our disposal, including investments in our core business, dividends and share buybacks to create value for our shareholders.","Before we go to Q&A, I want to point to other initiatives launched this year and accolades awarded to Patterson, which we are particularly proud of, and that reflect our values and the unique culture we strive to maintain.","In January, we stepped forward to draw awareness to potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace, when we announced our efforts to promote integrity of dental supply chain. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring product safety in the supply chain for our dental customers, and represents a unique approach to industry leadership that's important to Patterson. Reflecting that commitment, Patterson was named to the Forbes List of 100 Most Trustworthy Companies in America for the fourth year in a row. Patterson is one of only two companies in 2015 that have appeared on the list four consecutive years. Every employee in our organization should be deeply proud of this honor.","Patterson was also added to the Honor Roll for the 2014 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership. This distinction given by the School of Business and Leadership at St. Catherine University in St. Paul Minnesota, recognizes Minnesota public companies with 20% or more gender diversity in their executive ranks and on their board of directors. We are grateful for this acknowledgement of our commitment to equal opportunity. I want to thank all of our employees, customers, and of course our shareholders for their support during the successful fiscal 2015.","With that, now we'd like to take questions. Kim, I'll turn the call back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today is from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And nice quarter, Scott and Ann.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I guess, starting with Dental, with dental consumables up 3.3%, we've seen some pretty good trends. Can you talk about what you're seeing now and I guess what type of consumable growth is basically your outlook for 2016?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. We see the market continuing to strengthen and we see probably market growth in the next year in the range of 2% to 3% and we would expect to grow faster than that. We're encouraged by how we started off our new fiscal year. And that will be a real focus for our team this next year's accelerating growth. We believe in the year, we absolutely took market share and grew faster than the market and it's, I think, really a case of the two larger players, both growing faster than the market.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. That's helpful, Scott. And then, just switching over to the vet business, Ann, you gave some good details on, I guess, excluding the diagnostic shift. Can you talk maybe about what type of traction your sales force is getting with the Abaxis product line? And then I've got a follow-up on the AHI deal as well. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Kevin, I'll take the Abaxis question. We're, I think, very pleased where we sit today with Abaxis and our sales force is fully trained and fully engaged, and Abaxis as a partner is putting the resources behind our organization to make it successful. For competitive reason, I don't think we'll give out a number on placements, but I could say, we are very pleased with where we sit today and the entire organization is excited about the opportunities in front of us in the new fiscal year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. And then, Scott, since I've got you, going into the Animal Health International business, good to see some more information and disclosure on that. Just wondering, how much exposure does AHI have in poultry and have they seen any impacts from avian flu?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, very little poultry exposure. The majority of that business is beef cattle, dairy cattle and swine. So, it's not a material impact from the avian flu.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. That's all I have for now. Thanks, guys.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And moving on, we'll hear from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Adam C. Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Adam Noble in for Bob. Thanks for the question. I'm wondering if you could talk about equipment sales, really nice accelerate \u2013 re-acceleration in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the growth rates of basic versus high-tech in the quarter. How CAD\/CAM specifically performed in the quarter?","And then to what extent did the 4Q number reflect the catch-up from some of the lost sales in 3Q or do you believe that most of the quarter was organic growth?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, Adam. I would start with 3Q, 4Q question. I don't believe there was any catch-up. When you look at how some of our competitors performed in the beginning half of the year, I don't believe there was a spillover effect from the Section 179 issue we had at the end of the year. I would attribute the quarter to just very strong execution at Patterson and high demand for the portfolio of products we sell, consistent execution.","Actually, when you look at the full year, we had a mid-single digits growth in traditional equipment, which I think is a great sign that the future is really, the first full year growth number we've seen in that category since 2010. Obviously, the digital products performed very well in the fourth quarter, really led by CEREC. And as we've said many times, we are great believers that the CEREC product is a transformational product for our customers and we were excited to see the \u2013 in the year, the new user growth was very good, and we continue to act on that momentum with CEREC.","Adam C. Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. That's really helpful. And to think about the FY 2016 guidance within the context of the long-term targets you provided at the Analyst Day, anything you could share around the expectations for margin expansion for FY 2016, obviously in context of some of the ERP investments? And any thoughts you could give on margin expansion from a segment standpoint would be very helpful.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. (25:45).","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Yeah. So, this is Ann. So, baked into our guidance is between a 20 basis point and 30 basis point operating margin expansion for the year, and that's mostly driven by revenue growth and leverage on fixed and semi-variable costs that results from sale (26:02). Typically, to your point, we would be able to get a little bit more than that based on where we're targeting the revenue growth. But as you pointed out, we do have some continued strategic investment in IT in fiscal 2017. And that will continue to be \u2013 FY 2016 and FY 2017 will continue to be heavy investment years.","We did pull out the one-time training cost for you, but I would point out that this \u2013 in the baseline guidance, there is some ramp-up in just ongoing IT expenses to support the future space as well. That climbed down that (26:38) 20 basis points to 30 basis points by, say, 10 basis points to 20 basis points.","Adam C. Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And on the segment specifically?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","I don't know that we typically give that information out by segment.","Adam C. Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Appreciate the questions.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Cherny from Evercore ISI.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. So...","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mike.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","So I wanted to \u2013 hey, so I want to talk a little bit about the Medical business. As you think about your decision to pursue a sale of the asset, how does that impact the way that you manage the business? Will it still be business as usual? Are there certain areas where you reallocate resources to some of your other growth businesses as you start to accelerate, the veterinary growth as part of AHI, just want to think about how that will now fit into the overall portfolio. And if anything, a question maybe for Ann, just a technical question, was there any thought of moving it directly into discontinued ops at this point?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Yeah (27:40).","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll start first, Mike and then turn it over to Ann. I would say if you look back at really how we've run this business over the last 24 months and since Mike Orscheln came in as its leader, we've really, from a strategy perspective, even though \u2013 even before we began the process to potentially sell the business, have focused on organic and the team has done a very good job at that. I was just with the sales force this week at the national sales meeting in Chicago on Tuesday, and I would say there is a lot of excitement and momentum and spirit in that business. So as we talked about, it is a potential sale. They have a very solid game plan in front of them, they're executing well, and I don't see that stopping.","In terms of investment in the business, we continue to invest in programs and IT, the thing we have not invested in over the last few years is on the M&A front for that business. So I think you would see the M&A dollars moving more towards Medical and Dental \u2013 I'm sorry, Dental and Veterinary, but very, I think, exciting story still to play out at Medical.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","And then I would just chime in, the discontinued ops, just piggybacking on something that Scott mentioned, this is not a distressed asset. It's a very well performing asset. And so while we're exploring a sale, we are not \u2013 we would just sell it for any price. And there's some very technical accounting rules on when something becomes a discontinued operation, and we have not met those requirements yet.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","No. That's helpful, Ann. I was just more thinking from an accounting perspective how you think about it, so that's great. And then just one other accounting question, specifically for you Ann. I know you don't guide specifically to buyback, but \u2013 because of the strategic transaction announcement, are you blacked out from doing buybacks? Are you able to execute at this point? Just from a pure accounting perspective.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Yeah. No. And not from accounting as much a business.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Yeah.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","...decision, but yeah, we are blacked out at the market until these transactions are complete. And what I would tell you is that once they are completed, it would be our intention to get back in the market. And I would expect our share repurchases once we're able to get back into the market on an annual basis to be between $100 million and $150 million of cash allocated to share repurchase, which would be in line with our overall capital allocation strategy.","Michael Aaron Cherny - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Very helpful for the model. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And we'll take a question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brandon.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Couple housekeeping items for Ann. Could you quantify for us, in terms of the guidance, what you've contemplated for the Medical unit operating income for the year or perhaps some directional indication whether it's flattish or up a little bit? And could you quantify the dollar amount for the divested products in the fourth quarter? And is there any carryover from those activities in 2016?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Okay. So, those are great housekeeping issues and you have me on my toes. So, let me just look for a second. So, let me answer the easy one first. The divesture is complete. And so, to answer your question, there's no hangover going into 2017. So, we'll have a clean comparison in 2017.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","2016.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","I'm sorry, in 2016. I'm getting my fiscal years mixed up in 2016 for the Medical business. As far as modeling purposes, I'm not really comfortable just giving you the exact operating income. I'm going to make you work for it a little bit. But what I would tell you is that we've got mid-single digit improvement there and operating leverage within that unit.","And then I think, your question on quantifying the exact impact of the revenue on the divested sales, I think you can back into it and I can get you the number offline. But the reported growth for the quarter excluding divested sales was 3.7%, but that also excluded currency. And I think our reported growth was \u2013 let me get it here \u2013 our reported growth was down 3%. So I think you can kind of back in to the dollar impact. I think it's \u2013 I think...","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Perfect.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","I think when you do the math, it's between $3 million and $4 million.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Yeah. All right. 3.7%. All right, we can do the math there. And then one more, are you able to quantify the impact of the extra week on EPS for the year? And then, any color you have around operating cash flow for the year would be helpful.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Sure, the impact of the extra week, it's very difficult to kind of say what the exact impact on EPS is. What I can tell you is that we estimate that it has about a 1.5 percentage point impact on the revenues. So you can kind of make some assumptions there and back in to a number. But I would tell you that that's not one that we typically disclose, just because there's a lot judgment in what that number is and it's difficult to quantify.","Thinking about cash flow, we would expect to convert 100% of net income into free cash flow next year. It could be a little bit better than that or a little bit less than that depending on working capital. But I think that's a good decline (33:20).","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thank you.","Operator","And Robert Willoughby from Bank of America has our next question.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch (U.S.)","Hey, Ann, on that \u2013 the cash flow question, you generally finish the year with a slightly better \u2013 things pick up or improve from a working capital management experience. It looked like it kind of deteriorated this year and the DSOs were what really stuck outin our model. Is there anything driving that? Is it just mix issues or is there a difference in philosophy on how you're managing those line items?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","No. Nothing different philosophically. And I think what it is is really just timing. We had an incredibly strong April. And so, then just depending on the collection cycle with receivables when you finance and sell all that equipment in the last five days of the fiscal year. So I think it's more timing.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch (U.S.)","Okay. And you're not restricted from selling anything on that front? There's no promotion or whatever by now, pay us in six months or 12 months?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","No. But to that point, when we sell, we sell a month in arrear \u2013 a month, so really selling through March. So, when April is really huge, right, that stuck onthe balance sheet.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch (U.S.)","Okay. And Scott, I think you've hinted at it, you started with the strong technology sales in dental equipment business. I'm not sure I got the flavor on the basic equipment side. Are we kind of hitting that upgrade cycle finally or what was the comment on basic equipment and the strength there or lack thereof?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say we're starting to see signs of life in terms of the new office construction. We've always been very consistent talking about, as the dentists gets busier and is more confident about their book of business and their practice, is when they're more likely to start making more major investments in physical plant in terms of new office builds or remodels. So, as we look out, I think over to the next one, two, three, four years, we would see that business beginning to accelerate, but at the same time, accelerating in a way that doesn't cannibalize the technology opportunity, which we feel still has a very long runway and greenfield in front of us, as we move the profession to more modern practices.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Securities - Merrill Lynch (U.S.)","Okay. Thank you.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to John Kreger from William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Scott, just a couple of CEREC-related questions. Did you roll out the Omnicam scanner into the ortho setting yet?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","John, we have. We just rolled it out at the AAO Meeting in San Francisco this week. And the early reports I've gotten back from our folks is a very high level of interest, our booth was \u2013 both our booth at Patterson Dental and our booth at Dolphin Imaging, they said is the busiest they've seen it in five years. So we're excited about that opportunity. I would say the integration with Invisalign as well just speaks to the story of the CEREC machine being a very versatile tool that is going to have multiple modalities for the clinician. So we look at the improvements that had happened with CEREC in the last six months is absolute validation of the story of why this is a \u2013 should be a centerpiece technology in every dental practice.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Great. Your early thoughts on ortho, do you think that can ramp quickly, given the volume that the typical ortho practice has or should we expect that to be more of a gradual ramp since it's a fairly new market for you guys?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it will be gradual. And I think you have to be careful just in terms of sizing up the opportunity. But it's a new market and an exciting market, and I think you'll see a gradual build and it's creating a lot of excitement in this space, which we're excited about.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then, how was your corporate practice in Dental this quarter? And did the ADP deal contribute anything in the April quarter?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It did in April. We're very excited that American Dental Partners made the decision to invest in the Omnicam. We have been a partner of American Dental Partners for many years and they're very discerning buyers and they go through a very detail evaluation and due diligence product when they pick a technology. And they don't necessarily pick a technology just because they're partnered with Patterson. And I think this is another great validation of the CEREC technology that ADP has decided to invest in their practices and really move to a digital platform.","I would say from a special market's perspective, our team is very active right now. We're in the midst of many, many discussions, and we look at that segment of our business being absolute growth opportunities for years to come.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then one last one, you mentioned the new goal to get 30,000 CEREC by 2020. How's that going? Are you seeing maybe better breadth out of your sales force? Are you seeing some traction in some of the new structures that you put in place?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say, our organization is absolutely aligned around this goal and our sales force and our managers and our folks that support the technology really are believers. We've been selling this technology now for well over a decade and we believe this will be the standard of care. I personally had a CEREC restoration done in the last month, and I would tell you from a patient perspective, it is a great experience when you go to the dentist and have a beautiful restoration done in one visit. So, the team Patterson is all in and we know it's a big goal, but I'm absolutely confident we're going to reach the goal.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks much.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Good morning.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Steve.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Congrats on these results. So...","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","And I guess just from me, just a couple of questions on the fiscal 2016 guidance of $2.40 to $2.50. First, I just want to confirm that this does not strip out any of the deal-related amortization out of the core Patterson operations, obviously, prior to the AHI deal.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","That is correct.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Just want to \u2013 I thought that was the case. So I want to make sure.","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","No, I appreciate (40:37).","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry. Okay. So two other quick ones here, I guess just while the dental equipment growth obviously is still pretty volatile on a quarterly basis throughout the fiscal 2015, when you take a step back through just a little over 3% constant currency for the full year. And just wondering if you would expect that to potentially accelerate in fiscal 2016, separate from the benefit of the extra week of course.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, absolutely. We would expect that to grow. CEREC, which is a large chunk of it, our CEREC growth was in that 4% range. But when you break it into trade-ups versus new users, the new users were up strong double-digits. So, we got past the \u2013 sort of we climbed the mountain of getting over the trade-ups. And I would say going into the new year from both an equipment and technology standpoint, we feel like there's a lot of sort of key opportunities in front of us. One is an improving market, improving confidence from the dentist. You look at the new technology rollouts that Sirona did at the IDS meeting in Germany in March, the additional modality improvements to CEREC. We have a CEREC 30 Anniversary event in Las Vegas, which I think will serve as a catalyst. And then I think the other opportunity \u2013 and you've got to remember that our third quarter was very weak due to the Section 179 tax changes. I believe if that gets in place at the right time, we're absolutely set up, I think, potentially to have a very strong equipment year.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And as far as the extra week, by the way, I just want to confirm, that'll be in the fiscal first quarter. Is that correct? That was the case historically when you had an extra week.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yeah, it will be in first quarter.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","(42:28). Okay. And a final quick one, just kind of more of a comment, but on that earlier topic, you are finally getting some pretty good EBIT growth in your Medical segment. So I guess \u2013 are you sure you want to sell it now? And also, should you have perhaps announced the planned divestiture of all your divisions, you'll definitely it still invigorates the results (42:45). So I just thought I'd mention it as well.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say about the Medical, Steve, is it's a great team. We think we're market leaders. And as Ann said, we think it's a great asset for the right buyer to buy and really unlock potential, and have us concentrate on Dental and Vet. But at the same time, obviously, the value for that business has to be realized, and we understand that \u2013 the one thing about \u2013 and we're \u2013 we've been an acquirer of distribution businesses for the 20-plus years we've been public and have growth from $300 million to now nearly $4.5 billion. With distribution companies, it's always about the people, and I would tell you we have fantastic people at Patterson Medical.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys and good morning. Just first on the guidance, looking back, I think the refi and the debt might give you an extra sort of $0.03 tailwind next year. And Ann, I ran some rough math on the extra week. I'm arriving at around $0.04 or so (44:00) make some of these adjustments, if you look at the fiscal year 2016 guidance, the growth seems pretty modest. It implies around 4% or about half the rate of growth that you achieved in fiscal 2015. So, is that the right way to look at it? And if so, with the end-markets improving, Scott, why would we see sort of the step-down in EPS growth in 2016 relative to 2015?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take the first stab at that. First, I think as you walk through with me with some of your assumptions on interest expense and the extra week, I think you're a bit heavy on both of those in terms of the rates that we were able to refinance the debt at as well as some of your assumptions around the extra week. So, maybe that's something we can kind of take offline.","So, what I would tell you is, I think you've got pretty rich estimates in there for those. I would say that similar to last year, we did build some conservatism into our guidance. So, I would say there is more upside potential than downside risk in the range that we put out today similar to last year. And we've tried to share with you the various items that can affect it one way or the other. But I would just close, I think, our expectation is to absolutely turn in a strong performance for next fiscal year.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Yeah, and I can certainly follow up with you offline. Just to shift gears, maybe one or two more, the restructured A-dec deal, I know you guys obviously called up Pelton & Crane (45:25) Sirona starting \u2013 I think, Scott, you mentioned in the fall, or call it, roughly halfway through your fiscal year. So how do we view it this year and then going forward? In other words, is it sort of a hit in fiscal 2016, as you break the exclusivity and you bring on the additional manufacturers. And then in fiscal 2017 and beyond, it's sort of \u2013 if you want to call it accretive as you gain momentum was some of these additional players.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we were never exclusive with A-dec. They sold through multiple distributors. We were obviously the largest channel and we absolutely intend to continue for years to come to be the largest channel of the market for A-dec. I look at the year full of opportunity in terms of maybe some slight disruption in changing partners, but as I travel the country and talk to our sales people, I think they're very excited and we'll continue to be great supporters of A-dec.But now I have many multiple options for customers and I think we're very excited in terms of sort of creating new markets potentially with the Sirona brand, once they get everything through \u2013 get all their approvals through and we think that will happen in the fall. So, I don't see it as being much of a speed bump at all; if anything, I think it's potentially could be a very strong year for the whole core equipment line.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And last one, Medical was huge in the op margin and I don't think and you broke out the one-time transaction cost, but depending on how much Medical got relative to Vet, the Medical op margins could have been either 18% or 19% in the quarter. I get it that you divested maybe some of the lower-end lines, but just any commentary on the momentum there and the big step-up in the margins, both in year-over-year and sequentially, et cetera?","Ann B. Gugino - CFO, Vice President & Treasurer","Yeah, sure. I mean, you hit on a piece of it, which is really we divested some unprofitable lines, so certainly that helped things. And then also as part of the restructuring effort or right-sizing the business effort, we did do some rightsizing on the OpEx line. And so in the prior-year fourth quarter, you had some severance costs that we didn't call out, if you will, as a non-recurring item. It's sitting in that op income last year, so that's providing a little bit of a favorable comp.","And then I would just tell you, when you look at it, the 50 basis points sounds like a lot, but I think it's like $3 million to $4 million on the operating line when you kind of look at it in total. So you just kind of look at the size of the numbers. So I would reiterate by saying, a lot of it's just due to the restructuring activities.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thanks for your time, guys.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today. Mr. Anderson, I'll turn the conference back over to you.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kim and thanks everyone for joining us today. Again, we're very pleased with the momentum we carry into fiscal 2016. Just to note, Ann and I will be attending three upcoming conferences; the Stifel Dental and Veterinary Conference, Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference, and the Goldman Sachs Annual Global Healthcare Conference. We look forward to seeing many of you at these events.","I also like to remind everyone that we plan to host an analyst day after we close the Animal Health International transaction, where we intend to update our guidance. We look forward to giving you a deeper look into the combination of these two great companies at this time. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference today.

Welcome to the Patterson Companies' Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Announcement Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, February 20, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ann Gugino. Please go ahead.","Ann B. Gugino","Thank you, Douglas. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies Fiscal Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Armstrong, our Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to review this material.","Also, please note that in this morning's conference call, we will be referencing our adjusted results for the quarter in Steve's detailed financial discussion. Adjusted results exclude the impact of the restructuring charge for the medical divestiture. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release.","Since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with earnings guidance, unless we release that information simultaneously, we've provided financial guidance for fiscal 2014 in our press release as well as in the financial slide presentation supplementing this conference call that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting at 11 a.m. Central Time for a period of 1 week.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thank you, Ann, and welcome, everyone, to this morning's conference call.","As you saw in today's earnings release, Patterson Companies reported a solid third quarter with double-digit sales growth and increased adjusted earnings compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to be pleased with the progress we made in many aspects of our business. Notably, on the revenue side, we exceeded $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time in the company's history. We achieved this sales growth despite being impacted in January by adverse weather conditions across all of our U.S.-based businesses. Bad weather is a short-term nuisance, but it doesn't reflect the health of the business.","Revenue grow -- grew in both our dental and veterinary business. And due to our strong cost controls, we were able to deliver increased adjusted earnings in the third quarter.","Let's take a deeper look at our operational performance in the third quarter, starting with dental. This business, which accounts for just under 60% of our total sales, reported fiscal 2014 third quarter sales of $642 million which, on a constant currency basis, was a 3.2% increase versus the prior year period. This was our third consecutive year of reporting growth in this quarterly period, which is generally the most important time for our dental customers when they are deciding on capital investments for their practices. Again, this year, our dental team executed well with equipment and software sales increasing 5.6% from the year-earlier level, and all major categories posting gains.","We are particularly encouraged by the sales level because our performance came on top of growth in the prior year period -- strong growth, making it a very tough comparison. In the 2014 third quarter, we saw good growth for CEREC equipment sales, generating double-digit growth in that category. We had a more balanced mix in the quarter between new unit sales and trade-ups for the CEREC Bluecam to Omnicam system, and we still have some upgrade opportunities remaining from the introductory promotion for the Omnicam. But we are selling more of the new CEREC systems. And we have worked through the customer training and installation issues on CEREC system upgrades that we encountered in the 2014 second quarter.","Patterson also experienced growth in basic equipment sales. As we have noted for some time, this category has been the most sluggish and slowest to recover from the recession. While it is definitely too early to declare a long-term recovery in the basic equipment category, it was nice to see stronger results in the quarter.","Another bright side in the quarter was our A-dec partnership. A-dec is the U.S. market leader for quality dental equipment such as chairs, units and cabinets. Also contributing to revenue in the dental segment was a nearly 1.5% increase, again on a constant currency basis, in sales of consumable dental supplies versus a year ago. While dental consumable sales were up year-over-year, we believe consumable growth was constrained by adverse weather impact in January, and we are seeing some weather issues in February as well.","Looking ahead, as the dental market returns to historic growth levels, we expect to benefit. We believe that there is considerable pent-up demand for dentists to invest in their practices. This fact, plus the growth opportunities from our technology offerings, position us well as dentistry migrates to a digital platform.","Patterson Dental is poised to capitalize on the growing digital trend as we continue to implement new radiography and CAD\/CAM technologies that we -- that enhances -- that are enhanced with Patterson's unmatched service and support offering.","Let's now turn to Patterson Veterinary, which is responsible for nearly 1\/3 of total sales. The veterinary unit increased sales more than 90% in the quarter, including $145.5 million contribution from our NVS acquisition, and a 7.1% increase in U.S. sales. As a reminder, the third quarter is the seasonally slow time of the year for our veterinary business. As you know, NVS is the largest veterinary distributor in the United Kingdom, and it offers us an exceptional platform to extend Patterson's strategy into new geographic markets. This acquisition has been a win-win for NVS and Patterson as we gained a talented team of associates in the U.K. which affords us the opportunity to move our strategies into new markets, and they have access to additional resources to solidify their market-leading position.","Looking at our U.S. veterinary business, third quarter sales gains stemmed chiefly from a 5.6% increase in consumable sales, such as medications and supplies, and a 26% increase in equipment. In the quarter, we continued to execute against our strategy to be a national provider of veterinary equipment and services. We see significant opportunities to grow Patterson Veterinary.","Our priority remains to increase both our equipment and technical service offerings so we can take advantage of the favorable marketplace dynamics as pet ownership grows and we see increases in the dollar amount people spend on veterinary care for their pets.","Turning now to Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit, which now represents approximately 10% of total company revenues. Sales declined to $107.3 million, but were essentially flat after adjusting for the previously announced decision to divest certain non-core assets. This was in line with our expectations for the period. The remainder of the steps necessary to complete our restructuring plan are expected to occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.","By existing -- by exiting non-core product lines, we can lower the operating expense levels of our European medical distribution operations and concentrate on more strategic businesses for Patterson. We believe that these actions will benefit our growth in those markets over the long term.","Although U.S. markets continue to stabilize, overall performance of our medical unit has been affected by the continued uncertainty surrounding the nation's health care system and in international markets from the ongoing austerity measures that have dampened demand for the past few years. While these factors are likely to persist in the short term, our new medical leadership team brings renewed focus and vision. We continue to be encouraged by this business' potential given our industry leading product and service offerings as well as the underlying favorable demographics and the rehabilitation market that indicate future growth. Patterson Medical is poised to capture additional market share as conditions improved.","Next, I'd like to update you on our information technology initiative which crosses all 3 businesses. As previously stated, we've undertaken this effort in order to support the company's future growth, further enhance the customer experience and secure future productivity gains. Patterson's incremental information technology investment is estimated at $55 million to $65 million. We are taking a phased approach to this initiative. We have completed the process analysis and vendor selection phases. We are now in the design and blueprinting stage, and we'll update you in the coming quarters as we begin testing and implementation.","Our customers will continue to see various improvements as we execute on this strategy. In addition to accommodating future growth, we believe our information technology investment is critical to providing Patterson with the flexibility to adjust our platform as opportunities warrant.","Patterson Companies continues to have strong cash generation capabilities and a flexible balance sheet so we can take advantage of opportunistic acquisitions to augment our organic growth initiatives. Going forward, we remain focused on pursuing our growth initiatives while maintaining strong cost controls to create long-term shareholder value.","Now I'll ask Steve to review the financials. Steve?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Thank you, Scott. As Ann mentioned earlier in the call, my comments will be based on our adjusted results, which exclude the impact of the restructuring charge for the medical divestiture. A reconciliation of the reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release as well as the slide presentation we have posted to our website in conjunction with this conference call.","During this year's fiscal third quarter, as noted, we saw strong equipment sales in both our dental and veterinary units, with all our major product categories posting year-over-year gains and double-digit growth in several categories. Earlier, Scott had provided certain growth amounts on a constant currency basis, as the impact from foreign exchange was higher this period than recent experience. This negatively impacted our consolidated sales growth by 50 basis points in the quarter, and operations absorbed an unfavorable $1.3 million swing in transactional currency expense, predominantly from our Canadian operations.","Consistent with prior quarters, fiscal third quarter 2014 operating expenses included approximately $3 million pretax, or $0.02 per diluted share, for our planned information technology investments. Our consolidated adjusted gross margins reflect both the impact from the acquisition of NVS and the change in mix within the historic businesses during the quarter. Excluding the results of NVS, adjusted gross margins were 32.4%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. This decrease is a result of the faster relative growth of the U.S. veterinary unit, the higher percentage of equipment sales in the dental segment, and pricing pressures in the international portion of the medical business.","On a comparative basis, our adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 10.4% when you exclude the operations of NVS and the impact of the planned information technology investment.","By segment, our third quarter adjusted operating margins were 11.5% for dental, 4.8% for veterinary, and 11.5% for medical. Note that operating margins for the dental business include the information technology investments. Excluding IT and NVS, we still expect to gain 20 basis points of consolidated operating margin for the fiscal year.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.2%, an 80 basis point increase from the prior year due primarily to the favorable tax items in the year ago period. Our anticipated annual tax rate of 35.5% excludes the medical divestitures.","Not including NVS, our DSOs increased 1 day to 43 days for the third quarter while the inventory turns were 6.3 compared to 7.1 last fiscal year.","The majority of our balance sheet changes result from the NVS acquisition. In addition, there are 2 other changes to point out. First, we extended the maturities on a portion of our invested cash balances in Canada from our traditional 90-day period to 1- and 2-year tenures. While the 1-year amounts are classified as part of cash and short-term investments, the $65 million that was invested for 2 years has been reclassified to noncurrent investment. Second, inventory has increased from the beginning of the fiscal year as well as compared to the prior year due to capitalizing on favorable buying opportunities from dental consumable vendors offered around the end of the calendar year. In addition, our equipment inventories reflect the backlog of customer orders and could not be installed by the end of the quarter, and the rebuilding of our CEREC inventory that we discussed previously. We would expect these inventory increases to be worked off by the end of the fiscal year.","In the fiscal 2014 third quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled $57 million compared to $46 million in the year ago period. During the quarter, we returned approximately $17 million to our shareholders in dividends. We also repurchased approximately 630,000 shares of our common stock with a value of $26 million, leaving approximately 23 million shares available under our current authorization.","Our CapEx in the third quarter included the payment for the new ERP software.","Before I turn the call back to Scott for some closing comments, I will review our guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2014. With the majority of the fiscal year completed and based on our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are tightening our EPS range from $2.13 to $2.20. As we announced earlier in the fiscal year, Patterson anticipates incurring a pretax restructuring charge in fiscal 2014 in the range of $15 million to $17 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for divesting non-core assets in our medical unit.","We recorded $0.01 per share of each cost in the third quarter and anticipate the rest to be taken by the end of the fiscal year. These charges will be primarily noncash in nature. Divesting these product lines is expected to generate annual savings of approximately $22 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, beginning in fiscal 2015.","Scott P. Anderson","$2 million.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Is it $22 million? I'm sorry, $2 million. Thank you.","Again, our fiscal 2014 guidance is predicated on several assumptions. That includes stable economic conditions in North America; modest operating margin expansion, excluding our planned investments; a $0.06 impact to deleted -- I'm sorry, to diluted EPS on the information technology investments, and no impact from the share repurchases that may occur during the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some closing comments. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thanks, Steve. As we complete this year and provide a springboard for fiscal 2015, we believe we will continue to capture market share as we exceed our customers' expectation. Our very strong strategic partnerships continue to grow and strengthen. Wrapped with Patterson's unparalleled service and support platform, we continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers.","We are speaking with you today from the 149th Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting, featuring 3 days of the best dental lectures, demonstrations and continuing education courses. We also enjoy this opportunity to interact with our customers as they look for ways to improve their practices. We are proud to have kicked off our visit here last night at the Oral Health America Gala, where Patterson was recognized for our significant contributions as a lifetime partner of this organization and for achieving the milestone of $1 million in cumulative donations.","Through Patterson's support, OHA gains a large audience for its key initiatives and campaigns, such as the annual Fall for Smiles program that educates communities about the importance of healthy food choices, regular dental visits, brushing, flossing and avoiding tobacco.","So let me reiterate what gives us confidence as we conclude the year and enter fiscal 2015. We continue to be encouraged as all of our markets will benefit from favorable demographics and the shift as our customers invest in increased productivity for their practices. Patterson is focused on efficiency, and we are executing focused strategies to position the company for future growth. We are committed to generating long-term shareholder value through targeted investments, diligent expense management, dividend growth and strategic share repurchases.","Now we'd like to take any questions, so I'll turn the call back to Douglas. And Douglas, you can start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Adam Noble, calling in for Bob. I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more color on dental consumables, definitely a little bit below our expectations. I know you mentioned the January weather and that's kind of continuing to February. Just wondering if you could let us know how consumables and patient traffic was in the November and December months relative to January?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, Adam. Our consumable growth was very consistent through December and we did see a slowdown in January. We hate to talk about weather, but there's no getting around the fact that many geographic parts of the United States were slowed down, and we could tie that when we looked at the nonaffected weather areas and how that grew. So I think it's more of a short-term issue and there's no fundamental change in the market. Patient flow continues to be steady and growing slightly in the dental offices. And we expect that to fully rebound once we get through these winter months.","Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That definitely makes a lot of sense. And just to go to NVS for a second. I know revenue was very strong in the quarter. I'm just wondering if the third quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year, and how we should think about revenue cadence for the business going forward. And I'm just wondering, you guys had mentioned $500 million as a revenue run rate on an annual basis for the business. Should we still think of it that way? Or has the business been outperforming your expectations?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Adam, this is Steve. The business has definitely been outperforming our expectations, but I wouldn't translate that into a significant change in the revenue forecast that we've given you. Like the United States, the United Kingdom is impacted by a bit of a slowdown. They see it less dramatically according to the management team over there, but they do see some slower activity in the winter months with increased activity as we get into the warmer months. So you should see some pickup. But by the time you annualized in the next couple of quarters and the second quarter when we purchased the business, revenue should accumulate to around that $500 million mark.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Just 2 quick questions, if I could. Steve, back in -- and Scott, when we talked about the original guidance a couple of quarters ago, you laid out a pretty wide range and now we've kind of tweaked that range down a little bit. I'm kind of curious, could you maybe give us a look back over the past kind of couple of quarters, maybe what played out a little bit differently than what you would have expected? Is there a certain area of your business that maybe didn't perform as well as you expected? Or was it more across the board?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. Good question, Glen. I think when we went into the fiscal year, we made some assumptions around growth particularly on the equipment and consumable side. As you know, our second quarter came in a little light to what we had expected. And then, I would say the impact and how we sort of looked at the January, February months on the consumable side gave us a little bit of caution. But at the same time, we had plans in place to leverage the expense structure of the business to deliver a solid year, which we are very confident we will at the end of the day. I'd say I'm really encouraged by how the dental equipment business came through and the equipment side in the quarter. We're coming off 2 really strong prior years, up 20% in 2012 and up 10% last year. And I think we have some decent momentum going into the fourth quarter. So obviously, some market dynamic changes. But all in all, not seismic material shifts, and we adjusted our business as we saw fit to be able to deliver a good year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate that detail because it kind of leads into my follow-up question on the gross margins. Steve, if I heard you correctly, I think you kind of suggested that maybe faster growth in the U.S. vet, maybe NVS and dental equipment, maybe all weighed on the mix and the gross margin. And so, as we kind of look out to the next fiscal year, and I know you don't want to give guidance on this, is it fair to say that there's something that you can do with respect to NVS pretty quickly that should start to impact the margin more positively? And then, as a secondary question, could you discuss the impact of maybe faster dental equipment sales on that gross margin? Because it kind of feels like you said that the high-tech dental equipment did really well, but it also sounds like basic equipment was in positive territory as well.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes. That's a lot of questions there, Glen. We'll try to attack it a little bit. Scott will jump in here as well. I'll give you some of the mechanics. As we pointed out when we bought NVS, that's a fairly low-margin business. We wouldn't expect that the gross margins are going to change a lot from what you've seen to date. Over time, we would expect those gross margins to come up as we strategically take some of the things we do here in the States and try to move those into the U.K. market. That will help build those margins. But that is much more of a logistics play over there compared to what it is here in the United States. So it's fairly low margin at the gross margin line, low expense structure and a fairly low relative margin. But the business will generate, for what we paid for, it will generate a very nice return for the shareholders over time. So with that, I'd turn it back to Scott and let him add any color that he may have.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. Our dental margins actually were pretty stable, and we would see a stable environment going forward and continued growth opportunities around our market-leading technology offering. And we saw some life in the basic equipment business, which was good to see and we still have a great conviction that, that's going to be a very good business going forward as dentists begin to refurbish their offices and expand their offices to meet, which we know is going to be strong demand over the next decade in the dental space. On the vet side, you've had some margin movement in the flea and tick category, a lot of things going on there as you know with Sentinel coming back in the market and NexGard being launched at the NAVC meeting. But all in all, I think we feel pretty confident about where margins are headed and how we can leverage the business to drive the bottom line in that type of environment.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Cherny with ISI Group.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to just ask a couple -- dig in a little bit on the OpEx line. You saw, obviously, a very nice improvement there. You attribute some of that to divestitures of non-core business in medical. As you think about the long-term run rate of that business and, obviously, you had mentioned, you talk about the IT investment as one, but other opportunities, how do you think about that true trade-off and what should be do you think the sustainable level of OpEx spend relative to the need to invest in the business?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Well, I think we've given you enough detail that I would tell you that, that OpEx probably should run in the low 20s on a fairly consistent basis. We obviously try to leverage that, Michael, every year for the next couple with some of the investments that we're making, plus the impact of NVS coming in and some of the early amortization comes out of that purchase accounting. There'd be some pressure on that operating line. But NVS, as I mentioned earlier, has a lower operating expense structure than the other businesses. So as it continues to grow and move into the numbers, it's going to be -- there'd be some downward pressure on that rate. So I would sort of target you at this point without giving any guidance for '15, is it's going to be somewhere in the low 20s. That's historically where we run.","Michael Cherny - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Directionally, that helps. And then, maybe another way to ask the NVS question, given that you have few months in, you had the first full quarter under your belt. As you think so far about this specific acquisition as part of a broader capital deployment strategy given the first -- it's the largest deal you've done in some time, how do you think this positions you in a go-forward basis for other M&A, looking for more large deals? Or is it going to be closer to some of the more smaller bolt-on stuff that you've done previous to this?","Scott P. Anderson","Great question, Michael. I think when we look at long-term opportunities, we still feel there potentially could be some larger geographic expansion opportunities with some great companies and great management teams are out there. But as historic Patterson fashion, we've been very patient but very opportunistic. And we've continue to move on to the bolt-on strategy, as well as looking at deals like NVS. And just to echo what Steve said, we couldn't be more pleased with that property and the great quality of the people over there and see that as an opportunity to not only grow that business, but make it a more valuable business over time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Scott, wondering if you could help us out a little bit more on the weather impact. Did you guys actually experience delays in shipping and products not getting to customers? And is there -- I assume you saw the impact across all business segments, not just dental, is that right?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. It was across all business segments. I would say we really didn't have any supply chain issues from vendors. Obviously, particularly in the southeast and northeast, there were days where UPS trucks literally could not get to customers. But probably the bigger impact is just the slowdown in patient traffic that the weather has created. We're experts on weather in Minnesota because we live through this every year. Our schools have been shut down 4 days in January due to how cold it is, and I can't remember the last time that's happened. So as I said in the opening remarks, we hate talking about weather, but there's no doubt that it has had an incremental impact. But I don't think it has any material long-term impact on the health of our businesses.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Well, it looks like they're shutting down school again, I think, at least in the southern part of the state. As for basic dental, good to see some growth there. Could you say how much basic dental is up this quarter?","Scott P. Anderson","Low single digits.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Low single digits? Okay, great. And then, again, going back to 2015, we know you're not going to give guidance. But just thinking about the organic growth in the business and what you guys have done, which is a nice job, do you think it's possible to see double-digit growth, and what would take to get us there?","Scott P. Anderson","On the equipment side?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Well, overall, just double-digit EPS growth?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. I think double-digit EPS growth is a combination of 3% to 5% revenue growth with solid margins and good expense control and capital allocation decisions. Absolutely, over time, that's the model we see for this company.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So a couple of questions here. I guess, first, as we listen to Sirona's earnings calls, there seems to be more and more attention in recent quarters potential competition to their -- what has been a virtual monopoly for CEREC chairside, CAD\/CAM crown restoration. So just curious if you want to share your own thoughts in that particular subject as it's become more topical recently. And then separately, any general observations that you want to share from Chicago Midwinter Dental Meeting so far besides the fact that the 51-degree high -- it appears, today, probably feels like Florida to you right about now.","R. Stephen Armstrong","We got our shorts on today.","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. On the Sirona question, I think that's a great one because the way I look at it, and I think we look at it at Patterson, is the competitive entrants truly have validated chairside CAD\/CAM with the profession. So I think it's a very exciting time as we look for that tipping point to increase adoption. And we feel very comfortable that we've got an amazing partner in Sirona to garner a large share of that future adoption. And I think that validation of chairside is a really big deal. So when I was at the Yankee Meeting in Boston and just walking the floor and seeing the other products were there and dentists looking at products and then coming to our booth to look at CEREC, competition, as we've always said, is a really good thing. And we still firmly believe that we're in the early innings of this digital revolution and this evolution of chairside CAD\/CAM. And I couldn't be more pleased with the portfolio of products we represent from Sirona. Second part of the question?","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's -- just any observation on Midwinter Dental so far, if anything.","Scott P. Anderson","Too early to tell. We've -- I spoke with a lot of customers last night at the Oral Health Gala. And I did -- do sense professionally, other than everyone wanted to talk about the weather, is there is a stability in the dental practices. There is sort of a, I think, quiet optimism about the future. And in general, I think the dental community truly understands that the next 10 to 15 years will create incredible opportunity for the dental profession. So I would say the mood so far, and we'll be down on the convention floor here in about an hour, the mood so far I think is very positive across the profession and the industry.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Scott, I was wondering if I could start on the vet business. That NVS number, I think, as a couple of people have asked, bigger than a lot of us were looking for in this quarter. Was there any pick up of new business in the U.K. vet market late last quarter or early this quarter, anything at all like that? And then to Steve, maybe you can help us on the infrastructure side there. If you're taking maybe some of the U.S. model there longer term, what does that mean maybe for margins in that business over the next year or 2, good, bad, indifferent? And what does that maybe mean for the top line in that business as well?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. I'll start -- we have gained some customers in the U.K. as the team really has hit the ground running since acquisition. So they're moving at a very quick pace and are performing ahead of plan out of the gate so we couldn't be more pleased with that. I would say, from -- I'll turn it over to Steve in a second on infrastructure. But I think it's also important that what is exciting is the team at NVS and our team at Patterson Vet in the U.S., led by our president, George Henriques, we see that there is opportunity to grow that business on the technology side over time and bring some of the customer attributes and value-added services we deliver on the States. Our NVS team is excited to bring some of those to their customers in the U.K. So we look for that to be margin-accretive over time. And I'll let Steve just give some color on infrastructure investments.","R. Stephen Armstrong","I think at this point, Jeff, I wouldn't anticipate too much in the way of impact from infrastructure investments on that business. And Scott said the new business opportunities will generate some revenue for us theoretically and, hopefully, at bigger -- or larger margins than the historic logistics business. But it is a good size business with over $500 million in annual revenue. And so your margin rate I guess -- the margin dollars will be accretive, obviously. But the margin rate is probably not going to be impacted very much. As far as what we can do from an infrastructure perspective, they will be pretty much stand-alone for the next 2 or 3 years as we go through the ERP implementation throughout the rest of the system, and then there'll be brought on board so there'd be some opportunities near the end of that time period. But the rest of it, combining with the medical operations and that sort of thing, I would not anticipate you're going to see much in the way of change there until at least deep into our fiscal 2016.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then last question for me, just I want to make sure maybe we're all on the same page on your dental business as to what you're saying. So if weather continued into February, it sounds to me like maybe you're saying fourth quarter similar to third quarter, and then see kind of that return to normalization beyond that. And also on the equipment side, I think -- I don't remember, Steve, if it was you or Scott who mentioned the backlog of equipment, I'm assuming that backlog hasn't been booked to revenue yet. So what kind of backlog are we talking about? And what could that may be support for fourth quarter equipment numbers?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. First of all, the backlog, the majority of that is in the basic equipment category so that's how we feel pretty good about what's going on, on basic. And we would anticipate the majority of that backlog turning into revenue in the fourth quarter. I would say on the consumable side, February is generally the lightest month of the quarter. So I don't feel like we're ready to make a call that it's going to have a material impact. Historically, when you've gone through big weather events, generally, the business just moves out. It doesn't incrementally come back. But because there has been such a large impact, I think we're a little bit in uncharted waters. And I wouldn't want to step away from the fact that we may see a nice spring back in March and April as people get back into the vet offices and the dental offices and the rehab clinics.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. That's helpful. I guess, just following up, Scott, on your equipment comments, is that basic -- I'm assuming the answer to this is yes, but that basic backlog bigger than it's been in the last few years, does that give you what kind of confidence I guess on that fourth quarter equipment number?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, it's bigger than in prior years. The fourth quarter, which is always another large quarter for us, is also a really strong technology quarter. And as we've talked about previously, a lot of those decisions are on shorter timetables. So I would say we have decent visibility into the pipeline on the core equipment business and feel good about that. And we're still confident on the technology business that we can deliver another really strong quarter here in the fourth quarter. Still, a lot of interest in our digital offering, Schick, GALILEOS, our Planmeca products and then Omnicam continues to generate a lot of interest and I think increased competition, as I said, and the question from Steve really has increased the visibility of chairside CAD\/CAM across the entire profession.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is that changing the selling cycle at all? Are you seeing any change lengthening of the selling cycle on the CAD\/CAM side?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes. I think sometimes it can extend the selling cycle, but I also think it brings more people into the funnel. So it's a net positive overall for the space.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question is a follow-up from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. I just forgot one question. Scott, you mentioned in the vet business, the new products that are coming out and came back like Sentinel. But with NexGard, do you think there's any chance Merial might consider moving that product to buy, sell from agency?","Scott P. Anderson","I think they'll consider it. I wouldn't want to publicly comment on their decision-making process. But it's something we watch. I think it's a very exciting product, chewable flea and tick. And we're really excited to partner with Merial on that product going forward.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. I mean, and given all the new products that have come out at NAVC and Webster [ph] in the last couple of months, do you think high single-digit growth is kind of where you see the vet business shaking out this year?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think the innovation is good for the market overall. So we're excited to see a new, I think, pace of innovation in the vet side. And we continue to prefer to take longer-term views of markets and see the companion animal space as having really solid fundamentals in terms of pet ownership and how pet owners take care of their pets for the next 5 to 10 years. So real expectations of nice growth in that space for some time to come. And as we said, one of our big initiatives have been the equipment service side of that business and we're continuing to see really strong double-digit gains. And as that business grows more substantial, that will help the overall look of our margin portfolio on the vet side.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, Kevin, this is Steve, just to clarify. When you have new products within a category, it doesn't have the same effect as new products or starting a new category. So you're going to have shift moving back and forth between the vendors. So I think you're going to see more of that going on with these new products and necessarily growth. Growth is going to be determined more by the seasonal aspects of summer as you go into flea, tick and heartworm and, as Scott said, by the number of pets. So not to get overly zealous or overly ambitious as far as these new products.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Ross Taylor with CL King & Associates.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just have 1 question. If I look at the vet consumable numbers just in the U.S., I mean, it looks like you had very good acceleration in the quarter despite the challenges of the weather. And I just wondered what might be driving some of that acceleration, and just how sustainable it might be over the next several quarters?","Scott P. Anderson","I think it's good execution on the side of our vet team. And I would say, back to my previous comments, we feel good about the underlying growth characteristics of that space going forward. So you'll always have some quarter-to-quarter variance, but the long-term trend will definitely be one, I think, of solid growth in the vet space.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'm assuming that none of the new products really any impact at all in the quarter given that they just launched.","R. Stephen Armstrong","At this point, not overly strong, Ross. We can't say that they didn't add something back, but nothing of any substance in the quarter.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson","Thanks, Douglas. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. In case you heard any sirens in the background, we are -- we're doing this call from our hotel room in Chicago, and are excited to be here at the Midwinter Meeting.","During the third quarter, we made progress on our strategic initiatives to offer best-in-class product innovation and services in order to fuel growth. As a result, we posted solid gains in equipment sales in both our dental and veterinary businesses. Further, our NVS acquisition performed well, helping us expand our veterinary footprint into the U.K. We're focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities that lie ahead as we continue to enhance our products and services. We look forward to updating you in May on our full-year results for fiscal 2014 and our expectations for fiscal 2015.

As we announced last week, we needed more time to work through a technical accounting treatment update related to the appreciation of shares associated with joint venture investments. And with that work now complete and our full second quarter results now reported, I want to provide you with a summary of our second quarter results and an update on the progress against our key initiatives.","But before we turn to the quarter, I'd like to take a brief look back at our progress over the past year. It has been just over one year since I officially joined Patterson as CEO. It has certainly been a dynamic year, and I can tell you I'm more energized and committed than ever to helping lead our company into the future. And while we certainly have much work ahead to deliver more consistent performance, I'm pleased with what our team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time.","We've installed new processes and procedures, including a specific focus on key performance metrics that are improving our core day-to-day business execution. We are stabilizing our field organizations, performing extensive work to enhance our customer value proposition, and align the organization around a focused set of initiatives. We have also continued to build upon our experience and tenured team with new talent and a fresh perspective and evolved our company culture with a focus on driving improved collaboration, accountability, and a focus on execution.","Taken together, we are building a strong foundation for future success and we are beginning to see the early impact of our actions in our results. We are encouraged by some early signs of improved performance, but we recognize that our transformation will take time and we continue to believe that fiscal 2019 is a transition year for our business. That said, our results during the quarter and through the first six months of the year give us confidence that we are taking the right steps to build a stronger Patterson that is well positioned to deliver long-term value.","Turning now to the second quarter, our results met our expectations and demonstrate the effect of beginning to execute against our key initiatives. Internal sales increased 1.8% in the quarter, which marked our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth as our top line is starting to benefit from the actions we're taking to improve the customer experience, stabilize our field sales organization, and enhance sales execution.","Our operating margins improved sequentially from the fiscal 2019 first quarter. We are pleased with these improved results and we are committed to continuing to take additional steps to stabilize our margins and improve our profitability in the face of what we expect will continue to be a competitive environment in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. Based on our performance to date and our outlook for the back half of the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 guidance.","Turning briefly now to our results across our two segments. Within our Animal Health segment, we delivered another solid quarter with internal sales increasing 4.5% compared to the same period a year ago. These growth rates are at or above what we believe to be the underlying market for both the Companion Animal and Production Animal segments. In the Dental segment, overall internal sales declined 1.8% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2018.","In our consumables business we continue to see improving revenue trends; and in our equipment business, while overall sales were essentially flat, we are pleased with the growth we generated in the digital and CAD\/CAM categories as our technology equipment grew approximately 15% in revenues on substantially higher unit volume in the second quarter.","As we have discussed over the past year, we are sharply focused on executing five broad initiatives. First, improving the customer experience; second, enhancing sales execution; third, stabilizing our margins; fourth, driving improved cash flow; and fifth, continuing to build the overall talent at Patterson.","Let me discuss the progress we are making with respect to each of these initiatives. Starting with our focus on improving the customer experience, as we said last quarter we believe the most significant customer issues we have faced have been addressed and are largely behind us. We continue to invest in our digital experience to make it easier and more effective for our customers to do business with Patterson. Overall, we continue to meet or exceed our key customer experience goals including fill rates, order quality, and customer satisfaction.","As part of our focus on the customer experience, we've been regularly measuring customer satisfaction and net promoter score, and we have seen steady improvement over the past year. With respect to improving sales execution, we continue to invest in building out our sales force across both our Dental and Animal Health segments.","During the second quarter, we met our goals for onboarding new sales representatives and have trained and equipped them with useful productivity tools including our powerful new CRM system. We believe the investments we are making in this area to add to our sales force and to use technology to help make our reps more productive will help enable our field organization to serve our customers more effectively.","Our third initiative is centered around stabilizing our margins, which is primarily focused on three core areas; an increased focus on higher margin private label products, strategic sourcing, and cost savings. Our focus on expanding and growing our private label portfolio is progressing well. As we have discussed previously, we have established specific private label growth goals for each of our businesses and aligned management and the sales team around increasing the penetration of our existing private label portfolio. ","As a result, our private label category grew more than 7% companywide in the second quarter compared to last year. This included strong year-over-year growth in our Animal Health private label products and also notably year-over-year revenue growth in our Dental private label products. During the first half of fiscal 2019 we added close to 100 new SKUs to our private label portfolio and we continue to see more opportunities for additional SKU introductions going forward.","Expanding our private label offering aligns with the needs of our customers and enables us to capture improved margins, which is a key element of our overall plan to stabilize our margins over time. In addition, we implemented a disciplined strategic sourcing program that we believe is scalable and will allow us to accelerate progress in this important area. This will be a multiyear initiative, but we are already seeing progress.","For example, we recently completed a comprehensive portfolio review of our Dental private label portfolio which included a formal RFP process. This strategic review resulted in vendor and SKU consolidation and improved acquisition costs. We will continue to pursue additional opportunities to drive our strategic sourcing initiatives across the company.","We also remain sharply focused on carefully analyzing our cost structure and making adjustments to balance our expenses with the needs and opportunities of the business and we are taking steps to help ensure the appropriate balance in this area.","With respect to our fourth initiative, improving working capital and cash flow, our efforts have driven meaningful improvements as our inventory, accounts payable, and accounts receivable balances were all favorable on a sequential basis compared to Q1 of fiscal 2019 and also improved on a year-over-year basis from 2Q of fiscal 2018. Our teams are squarely focused on improving working capital and we're holding our leaders accountable for these improvements. Don will provide some additional color on our performance in this area during his remarks.","Turning now to our final key initiative, continuing to build and enhance the overall talent at Patterson. Earlier this week we announced the appointment of Tony Pellegrin as Vice President of Business Development. This is a newly created role for Patterson which is designed to enable us to explore additional opportunities for strategic growth in an efficient and focused manner. Tony brings over 25 years of corporate development experience, and we are excited to have him on board.","In addition, we are making good progress on the search for a new President of our Dental business and we expect to complete this process in the coming weeks. While it is clear that we still have a lot of work ahead, we remain focused on these key initiatives to improve our core business execution. And as we discussed today, we are beginning to see our efforts pay off. Our team is aligned on our goals working collaboratively across functions and holding each other accountable, and we are encouraged by our progress.","Before I turn it over to Don, I also want to provide a brief update on the long-term strategy process we've been undertaking. We continue to believe that we are in strong and stable end markets and certainly we actively monitor these markets, the trends impacting them and the competitive environment and product and service lines in which we operate to identify continuous opportunities for improvement.","Across both our Animal Health and Dental businesses, we recognize that delivering a broad range of products, technologies and value-added services are the key factors for our customers of all sizes and types. Our customers value the variety of products and technologies we offer as well as our ability to tailor a set of solutions most relevant to their needs.","You should expect our go-forward strategy to build upon our strong value proposition which remains critical to our long-term success and is grounded in the wide range of products, technology, and services that our customers rely on and the exceptional relationships we have with them. At a high level, we will be focusing on several key areas.","First we will continue to strengthen our core and focus on delivering even better execution and a greater customer experience. Second, we will accelerate our investment in high-value areas of our current business, and finally we will continue to invest into other adjacencies that help create superior customer value and expand our growth opportunities. Overall, we have a great foundation in each of our businesses and we look forward to building on these strengths to become even more valuable to our customers and to deliver improved performance to our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Don for a deeper dive into the quarter's results.","Don Zurbay","Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone. First, I will walk through the financial highlights for the entire company. Next, I'll focus a bit on each of our two segments, and finally I will cover a few balance sheet and cash flow items.","Before I get into the results, I want to make a brief comment on the recent rescheduling of our earnings call. As we announced last week, we needed more time to evaluate the impact on non-operating income related to the appreciation of shares associated with investments in joint ventures in light of recent accounting pronouncements. This update in accounting treatment does not relate to our normal business operations or the accounting for those operations, nor does it have any impact on our historical results.","The second quarter results we are announcing today accurately account for our joint venture investments in compliance with the new accounting pronouncements. As you will see from my remarks, I will generally be focusing more on the sequential view of the business instead of the typical year-over-year comparisons. We believe it is helpful to highlight the progress we are making in the business as we continue to focus on the business improvement initiatives that Mark has already described in some detail.","Now let me walk through the financials for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in the fiscal 2019 second quarter were $1.4 billion, an increase of 1.4% versus the second quarter a year ago. Internal sales which are adjusted for the effect of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships increased 1.8%. This represents our second consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth. We believe this reflects the impact of our initiatives to bring growth back to the top line.","Our second quarter consolidated gross margin was 21.0%, down slightly by 20 basis points on a sequential basis from what we achieved in Q1 of fiscal 2019. Operating expenses for the second quarter were 60 basis points lower than they were in the first quarter reflecting initiatives to manage expenses in the quarter. We will continue to carefully manage our operating expenses for the remainder of the year while also balancing the need to invest in certain areas of our business to achieve our objectives to grow and improve the business.","Also included in our operating expenses in the second quarter were increased legal expenses related to our various outstanding legal matters. The timing of these expenses is difficult to forecast and we estimate that they impacted our earnings per share in the quarter by $0.03 in excess of what we originally forecast.","In the second quarter, our consolidated operating margin was 3.6%, reflecting a 40 basis point sequential improvement from the operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.9% for the quarter, down from a rate of 34.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and reflecting the impact of the new tax legislation.","On the bottom line, the GAAP net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc. for the second quarter was $28.9 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies Inc. which excludes deal amortization costs totaled $36.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.39 in the quarter.","Now, let's turn to our segments. Internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 4.5% compared to the same period a year ago. In both the companion animal and production animal businesses, our topline growth rate is at or above what we believe is the current rate of growth in the market. Both categories delivered improved operating margin from the first quarter and solid performance across all species in our portfolio. Operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.6% in Q2, a 40 basis point sequential improvement over the operating margins in Animal Health in the first quarter of 2019.","Now let's move on to the Dental business. In our Dental business, internal sales declined 1.8% versus the second quarter of fiscal 2018. On that same basis, Patterson's sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.2% during the 2019 second quarter compared to a year ago, and total equipment sales were essentially flat versus last year. Dental consumable sales, however, continued to improve sequentially as we experience improved stabilization and productivity in our field sales force.","And as Mark already highlighted, technology equipment grew 15% in dollars and we saw substantially higher unit volume as we continued the transition of selling a broader portfolio of equipment from a number of new vendors. Operating margins in Dental were 8.4% in the quarter and reflect a 110 basis point improvement from our operating margins in the first quarter.","Now let's look at several cash flow and balance sheet items. Through the first six months of fiscal 2019, we have generated approximately $200 million in cash from operating activities. We collected our deferred purchase price receivables of $166 million on a year-to-date basis, which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. To fully appreciate our improved cash flow, the combined total of these two items equals $366 million, which allowed us to reduce debt in the first six months of fiscal 2019 by $196 million and also have an additional $103 million of cash on our balance sheet.","As a reminder, we put our new trade AR facility in place during the first quarter as a way to efficiently access working capital and used the proceeds to pay down higher interest debt. In addition to the proceeds from our AR facility, our year-to-date improvement in cash flow is also the result of our continued focus to decrease our net working capital and I am pleased to report that our net working capital numbers are favorable sequentially compared to the first quarter of this fiscal year as well as compared to the same period one-year ago. We believe there is more potential here for improvement in working capital, and we will remain diligent in our focus and efforts to continue this trend and free up additional cash to put to work in the business or return to shareholders.","Turning to capital allocation, we continued to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. Through the first six months of fiscal 2019, we have returned $50 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends.","Let me conclude with some comments on our fiscal 2019 outlook and guidance. For fiscal 2019, we are reaffirming our guidance and expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94 per diluted share and our non-GAAP adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share. Our adjusted earnings guidance excludes the after-tax impact of deal amortization expenses and the legal settlement reserve which together totaled $51.8 million or approximately $0.56 per diluted share.","For modeling purposes, let me walk through a few items to help you model how we plan to finish the remainder of fiscal 2019 to land in a [indiscernible]. We have assumed a modest revenue growth rate improvement from our first half year-over-year revenue growth rate as we move through the remainder of the year. For gross margin, we expect some margin contribution from our strategic sourcing and private label initiatives in the second half of the year.","With regard to operating expenses, we have made certain adjustments to our original plan as we prepared our most recent forecast. We are currently modeling operating expenses as a percent of sales to moderate slightly for the remainder of the year from our first half level. While we plan to make the necessary investments to drive improved performance and still have conviction those investments are correct and showing some early progress, we know we need to balance these necessary investments with a cost structure that aligns with the profit contribution of the business.","As Mark outlined, we will continue to carefully analyze our cost structure and make additional adjustments to our expenses as needed to ensure they are aligned with the needs and opportunities in the business. Because this process is ongoing any further adjustments we make in our expenses are not reflected in our EPS guidance. For our tax rate we still expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 25% to 27%. Our share count is forecasted to be in the range of 93 million to 94 million shares.","And now, I will turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark Walchirk","Thanks Don. Before we wrap up and open it up for questions, I want to reiterate that while we are certainly encouraged with our progress, we have much work ahead and we remain focused on driving our core business execution and operating with a sense of urgency to deliver on our commitments to our customers, employees, and shareholders.","And with that, we'll open up the lines, so Don and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. Can you comment a little bit on your guidance and what it implies on operational basis particularly in the Dental segment in the coming quarters, I guess, was the latest quarterly experience below or ahead of your expectations and what are some of those factors that are contributing to the second half profit ramp? Thanks.","Don Zurbay","Hi Erin, this is Don. I think, I'm not sure I heard your entire question, but I would say that our Dental margins, which improved slightly operating margin sequentially which is really in our mind how we need to look at this as we're kind of moving through this process, we're really in line with our expectations.","And as we move through the remainder of the year here, I think that we think that there is some room for modest improvement in that operating margin in the back half of the year as some of the initiatives we have in place to help that strategic sourcing and our private label to name a few help us. So, I think we're looking for some modest improvement to continue as we get into Q3 and Q4, and again I'm not sure I fully heard your question if that responds to it, but that's some color for you.","Erin Wright","Okay, yes that\u2019s helpful. And I guess my second question is more so on the dynamics across dental equipment, breaking out high tech equipment as well as basic equipment. I think you said high tech was up 15%, but what was that basic equipment underlying growth trend and can you kind of comment on the underlying demand trends as well as the traction you're seeing from some of your new vendor relationships?","Mark Walchirk","Yes Erin, thanks, this is Mark. I mean, I think we're certainly pleased with the fact that I think we've transitioned through over the past 12 to 15 months, really the change in our relationship especially in the technology area where we're obviously offering a much broader portfolio of products I think some of that work and that execution was evidenced in our technology equipment results in the quarter.","Certainly, it's a competitive market as it has always been. We're pleased with our revenue growth as well as our unit volume growth on a wide range of technology products, and we're pleased with the transition that the organization has made to really offer a much broader range of products and frankly ensure that we're working closely with our customers to help them with the right technology and equipment that meets their needs in terms of how they choose to practice.","So, we're pleased with the continued progress that we've made there. We certainly continue to believe strongly in chairside dentistry, but obviously as a full service provider, we feel it is important to offer a broad portfolio of products, and I'm pleased with the execution of our field teams in this area.","Erin Wright","Hey great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thank you, good morning guys. Maybe a question starting with Mark and then Don a question for you as well. But Mark, just following up on your equipment comments there, I guess I'd be interested, you talked about unit growth in the technology side far outweighing or far outpacing the dollar growth. Are you seeing a transition to lower priced products from other vendors or lower prices within the same vendors, meaning are we seeing price points on like-for-like or apples-for-apples products coming down, or is it just a transition from more expensive products from one vendor to maybe less expensive products from other vendors?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Jeff, that's a good question. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s one specific factor, I think probably a combination of factors, certainly some promotional activity in the marketplace, certainly, you know, we obviously engage in a competitive market. I think as we\u2019re selling obviously a broader portfolio now, we\u2019re selling additional products, there\u2019s both dollar and unit volume growth there with those products.","So, I think there\u2019s a combination of things that are taking place in the technology and equipment sector right now, and we feel that we\u2019re competing well there, and we believe that we have a very strong value proposition for our customers there not only in helping them decide on which type of technology products that fit with how they want to practice, but frankly helping them with the support after the sale and our tech service organization, we provide a comprehensive solution there. So, we believe that we continue to be well positioned there and now having a broader portfolio of products, certainly that are at different price points is something that you\u2019re seeing play out in the numbers that we\u2019ve shared.","Jeffrey Johnson","Yes, would you provide any color at all on DI versus full-in-office systems or anything that helps us understand one or both sides of that business?","Mark Walchirk","No, I wouldn\u2019t want to get into anything more specific than I think we\u2019ve shared at this point.","Jeffrey Johnson","Fair enough. And then Don, just to followup on the accounting changes that you talked about. Was there any actual impact on the fiscal second quarter P&L, and was that a GAAP or a non-GAAP? I\u2019m just trying to see with the delay in the earnings call by the week, was there actually something in the P&L that was in there? And should we exclude that or include it from GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments? Thanks.","Don Zurbay","So, yes, there was an impact that was, I\u2019d call it around a $4 million gain in other income expense that you just can see that did impact the quarter. We\u2019ve not excluded that from a non-GAAP perspective as it relates really to kind of the ongoing underlying dynamics of the JV that we\u2019re invested in.","I would highlight just in the interest of puts and takes, I mean I think the way we\u2019re looking at this is, as you think about the quarter and guidance for the year and how does this all impact that? I mean that positive impact is there. We also, and I think we highlighted in our prepared remarks here, we did have a significantly higher interest expense quarter than we had forecast or anticipated that cost us about $0.03 that you\u2019d also have to think about, and those two really, I would say, largely offset.","So that\u2019s why as we look kind of forward we would say, the impact on guidance of what happened this quarter, there are few puts and takes, but it is really relatively in line with where we expected it to be and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re maintaining our guidance range.","Jeffrey Johnson","Thanks that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks, good morning. Mark, if -- a bit curious if you could just sort of elaborate a little bit on sort of where you think Tony can add the most value as the new Head of Business Development and perhaps what some of his qualities will be, whether he\u2019d be looking at perhaps some international opportunities or - other or building out your sort of specialty portfolio where he'll be concentrated?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thanks Brandon for the question. Certainly, it\u2019s an important investment we\u2019ve made as we\u2019ve talked about continuing to build our talent at Patterson, and certainly as we think about how we execute on our strategy, having more of a formal business development, corporate development function is an important part of that. And so, we\u2019re not centering in specifically in one specific area at this point, although obviously we\u2019ve got some early areas that we\u2019re going to ask Tony to focus on.","But I think they would certainly be in support of helping us execute on some of the strategic priorities that we have. So whether that\u2019s \u2013 as we shared, talked a little bit about investing in some of the high-value areas, technology to support our customers, technical support, business solutions. Certainly, as we think about how do we move into some adjacencies that are certainly within the purview of the businesses that we\u2019re in, how do we expand in some of the areas around private label for example, where there are some new product or service lines that we can begin to engage and invest in, and certainly how we think about build or buy types of decisions there.","So, I would say his early perspective will be pretty wide. We will obviously want him to narrow that sooner rather than later. But, certainly as we think about business development, corporate development opportunities, they would be directly in support of helping us drive some of the strategic direction and priorities that we have.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks and then one for Don. I appreciate your comments on the gross margin trend sequentially, but could you help us bridge the year-over-year change, and were there any dental equipment charges in the period or any other inventory charges that you've kind of absorbed in some of the previous quarters?","Don Zurbay","No, we really didn\u2019t have that dynamic in any material way this quarter I think. And I don\u2019t, we\u2019re \u2013 again as I mentioned, we\u2019re really trying to stay focused on our sequential view. I think the 180 basis point decline in our gross margin would be -- I don\u2019t have the precise basis point reconciliation in front of me, but I would say that it\u2019s really largely similar to last year absent the inventory charges. I mean we had a \u2013 there\u2019s a segment mix impact, there is an impact from less equipment financing, and there\u2019s an impact with both the Dental gross margin and a very much more minor impact on the Animal Health side that are all contributing to, you know that 180 basis point move.","Brandon Couillard","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair, your line is open.","John Kreger","Hey, thanks. Mark, just kind of referencing back to your early comments about, you made a lot of progress but still more to do. At this point are you comfortable that fiscal 2020 can be a growth year for Patterson or too soon to say that?","Mark Walchirk","Well, I think obviously we - short answer, I think too soon to say that. Certainly, we\u2019re not in a position where we are going to provide any guidance around fiscal 2020 at this point. But I would -- I would come back to kind of a key theme that I\u2019d like to certainly convey is, I feel we\u2019re certainly making progress.","I think we see some of that progress in our performance, but we certainly have much more progress that we need to continue to make, and we\u2019re really heads down focused on continuing to drive against this improved core business execution, continuing to drive against the five priorities, kind of operating priorities that we\u2019ve outlined are really starting to built out, kind of, where do we take our strategy as a company, and frankly trying to create and start to build upon some momentum. So, again to answer your question more directly, we\u2019re certainly not in a position to provide FY '20 guidance at this point, but we\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making and we have a lot of work to do.","John Kreger","Okay thanks. And a followup, can you give us an update on how the corporate account business is going across the Dental and Animal Health businesses, just curious if that\u2019s growing faster or slower than overall, and if that\u2019s proving to be a margin tailwind or headwind? Thanks. ","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thanks John, good question. Certainly, this is an area that I have had an opportunity to engage in somewhat in our team and certainly this is an area where we continue to build out our team and invest in resources to support kind of corporate accounts, if you will, national accounts, DSOs, obviously as they\u2019re referred to in the Dental space, and this is an area where we believe there\u2019s opportunity for us to grow. Certainly, we want to be very strategic in working with those types of corporate accounts that are a good match for us in terms of the types of value-add solutions that we bring to the table.","Certainly, those customers have high expectations, and I would say, I think as we\u2019ve shared previously, the margin profile of a large corporate account is lower than the margin profile of a smaller, a private practice customer. But it\u2019s also important that we think about our cost structure in working with those types of corporate accounts. So it\u2019s an important area of focus for us. We\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made there, but I would tell you consistent with kind of the earlier comments to what -- Brandon\u2019s question we still have a lot of work to do to strengthen ourselves in that area.","John Kreger","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Johnathon Block","Great, thanks guys and good morning. Two, I think one for Mark, one for Don. Mark, on the Dental consumables, the improvement in the rate of growth, maybe if you can touch on how much is market if any versus internal improvements with some of the initiatives that you guys have put in place recently, and do you expect that Dental consumable number, sort of the growth rate decline closer to whatever is considered market as we enter fiscal 2020? And then I\u2019ve got one for Don.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thanks John. So, I do - we have shown some consistent sequential improvement in that area. We\u2019re not growing at the market. We believe the market is at a low-single-digit growth rate, call it 1% to 2%. We believe the market is stable and still good, good end markets in this area. But we are making progress, and I think one specific example of that, we actually grew our private label consumables business in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So, it was a slight growth, but certainly we think that, that\u2019s a leading indicator of the fact that we\u2019re continuing to make some progress there.","I think another important indicator and a big driver in this area is just the continued efforts the team is driving to continue to stabilize our field sales organization. We're continuing to invest there, we\u2019re continuing to onboard new reps, we\u2019re continuing to provide them with useful productivity tools to help make them more productive and more efficient and help bring greater value to our customers. So again, I would say consistent with kind of the themes that we\u2019ve been conveying, making progress, pleased with the progress we're making a big focus there certainly, and a lot of work to do. In terms of when we would anticipate growing in the consumables business, you know, again I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get into specific FY 2020 guidance at this point, but we\u2019re pleased with some of the momentum that we\u2019re seeing in that area.","Johnathon Block","Got it, very helpful. Thank you for that. And then Don, let me maybe ask a two parter, just around guidance and clarity. So, the $4 million impact, the gain in other income I just want to be clear, was that or is that a one-time event specific to fiscal 2Q or is there any tail to that?","And then relative to the last guidance it seems and this is me speaking but it seems like gross margin might have a bit more pressure, the year-over-year internal revenue growth took a slight, slight step back in fiscal 2Q relative to 1Q. So, it sounded like to me that you\u2019re making up the difference in OpEx tightening the belt, but then I thought you also said that any reduction in OpEx is not in the guidance. So, sorry for the long winded one, but maybe if you could just help clarify that? Thanks for your time.","Don Zurbay","Yes, so relative to the $4 million gain, that\u2019s really, we\u2019re viewing that as a one-time event here in the quarter, and we don\u2019t expect there to be continued -- significant continuing impacts in Q3 and Q4. And then on the guidance, I guess the operating expenses, what I was referring to there is that we have made some -- we did make some changes. We're kind of in the early stages, we're still working through.","We did make some changes in our OpEx that impacted the quarter and will for the rest for the rest favorably, but this is an ongoing process, and so my point was that, as we move forward there may be and probably will be additional operating expense initiatives and things that we do in the back half that really aren\u2019t fully identified yet, and as a result we have not baked into the guidance, and we have not factored into the EPS guidance for the year.","Johnathon Block","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for your time guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the questions. Don, maybe just following up on that last one. Should we think of gross margins as improving off of the 21% level that we saw this quarter as we look forward over the balance of the year, and then could you remind us where private label penetration is today and what type of margin delta you see there as you convert more sales through private label? ","Don Zurbay","Well, so yes, we- I think our expectation would be some very modest gross margin improvement from the first half to the second half just given some of the initiatives we're involved in. On the private label side, we're probably not going to give you exact quantification. I would tell you that the gross margin profile on that is substantially higher than the rest of our business. Private label is still not a significant factor overall as we expect it to be, but it does have a much higher margin profile.","Nathan Rich","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then Mark, just going back to your comments about exploring new growth opportunities, could you talk about your view on M&A at this point, and would you consider doing an acquisition if it kind of help to execute on those strategies that you are going after?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, certainly. Short answers is yes. I think as I mentioned earlier, the way we think about M&A is, you know what, how can M&A help support driving the strategic priorities that we have. So, as we think about continuing to invest in high-value areas as we think about how do we continue to become more valuable to our customers, that would be an area that we would pursue some M&A potentially in as well of how we think about entering into some adjacencies or some new product or service lines that we\u2019re not currently in or that we have a you know a lower position in and how do we think about you know M&A opportunities, business development opportunities to do that, how we think about supporting technology and innovation.","So these are all elements that we would certainly would be part of the work that we'd be doing from a corporate development standpoint, and again I would say in support of driving our strategy we certainly believe as we continue to I think solidify and stabilize and strengthen our balance sheet that we have an opportunity to deploy capital to help drive some of the growth initiatives and certainly Don here, chime in here.","Don Zurbay","Yes, and I would just weigh in I think we tried to highlight some of the good aspects of our cash flow in the quarter and we expect to, there\u2019s still room for improvement there. There is still room for additional benefit as we look at our cash flow. And so, that to me is all a part of how do we set ourselves up to do exactly what you\u2019re describing.","Nathan Rich","Great thanks for the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi good morning and thanks for the time here. The first one is for Don. I wonder if you could help us get a sense for how cash flow trends from here. A couple of things that might be helpful would be, can you talk about how much more improvement you would anticipate in working capital particularly what you think might be a logical DSO target from here?","And could you give us any sense of the size of the impact of the factoring program so far? How much of a benefit that\u2019s been, appreciating that it\u2019s not exclusively here or maybe, it may be mainly not in operating cash flow?","Don Zurbay","Right, that impact is about $160 million, so that\u2019s maybe the first thing. On your second question, I think we mentioned this last quarter, we\u2019re really, I\u2019m really -- I don\u2019t mean to not be helpful, but I think we were really not in a position where we want to give cash flow guidance including DSO or DIOH type targets. I think what I can tell you is that, again there\u2019s opportunity here, particularly as it relates to our inventory to continue to improve that number. And so yes, I feel like this is an area that you might characterize as we\u2019re just getting started. So, but again, I don\u2019t want to really get into giving specific guidance on it.","Steve Beuchaw","And that $160 million, should we see more of that in the back half?","Don Zurbay","I think what, you should view that as, as we accelerated the receivable collection that was worth $160 million. So that was kind of the one-time impact of moving up the receivables into the program, and now from here, the receivables kind of behave as they always have. It\u2019s just that you're getting them sooner, if you will. So, I think the $160 million is more of a one-time thing here in the quarter.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, and then just a couple of real quick ones for Mark. One is, can you talked about or compare the growth rates in the quarter within Animal Health between companion animal and production animal? And then quickly, can you give us any sense for an expectation on timing for conclusion of the process, resolution of the process with the FTC? Thanks, so much.","Mark Walchirk","Yes thank you. So I think \u2013 we're not going to break out the specific growth rates of companion versus production. We're pleased with the performance in that business in the quarter, and we're pleased with the growth rates as we indicated. We believe we are at or above the market there, so we're pleased with the rates there, but we're not breaking them out specifically.","I think in terms of the FTC, as I think we've indicated in the past, the trial is ongoing. We expect it to wrap up in January with potentially a decision likely in the summer of 2019. We continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the case. And just as a reminder, the complaint only seeks injunctive relief and no monetary damages or fines are sought. So, we're continuing to be part of, obviously, the ongoing trial and that's really the status of it.","Don Zurbay","Yes, and this is Don. Let me just \u2013 the breakout of \u2013 I recognize that we have done that in the past, but the breakout of production and companion animal, we're really trying to get ourselves conformed to the way that we report Dental, which is just as a single segment. We have two Presidents of these divisions, and we want to really try to get ourselves back to here's how we do this on a consistent basis and we put that together the same way for both businesses.","Steve Beuchaw","Got it, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Maybe just sticking on the animal business, any impacts or implications from some of the manufacturer consolidation that's happened and some of the new sort of spin split off, so separated companies in terms of contracting and any change in sort of bias between agency and other in terms of those types of relationships?","Mark Walchirk","Thanks Ross. So, I don't think really any new news to report there. Certainly, our team within the Animal Health business and certainly myself as well, we engage with the executive teams at these manufacturers and we're working closely with them to continue to bring value to our joint customers and working together to define ways that we can bring value to each other. So, I guess, nothing really more specific to share other than that at this point.","Ross Muken","And maybe just quickly for Don, now that you've been in this sort of seat for a bit on - just on the balance sheet, you already obviously -- you have the AR factoring that gave you some relief and now you want to sort of ramp up M&A, I guess how should we think about where you'd be willing to take leverage given the dividend and just sort of thoughts on how we should think about sort of the evolution of that M&A effort given the individual you just sort of added?","Don Zurbay","Yes, well we \u2013 I think we've said before, we try to target 3.0 as appropriate debt to EBITDA ratio at least as the our banks measure it. I think for the right deal we're certainly willing to push the envelope somewhat aggressively and of course it all gets into \u2013 what kind of EBITDA the target is bringing back and ROIC, et cetera, but if it's the right deal and it advances the strategy, we're in a position I think where we can put some significant resources to bear and then we're willing to push the envelope for a period of time and then ramp it back down to those levels.","Ross Muken","Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","David Larsen","Hi, can you talk about the sales force on the Dental side like how many reps have you added, how many do you have now, how far along are you in that process? And then do you have any comments or thoughts around the productivity of those new hires? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes David, thanks for the question. We don\u2019t provide specifics in terms of the number of reps that we have or the number that we onboard during the course of a quarter. I think what we have indicated is that we're building our field sales force in our Dental segment. We are right on track with the on boarding of new reps during the quarter and through the year. We continue to see improved stabilization in terms of our Dental field sales organization.","I have had an opportunity during the quarter to travel with several of our folks and I'm really pleased with the progress we're making there and frankly the progress that we're making on helping to deliver some productivity tools and make some investments in helping improve the productivity of our reps and make them more efficient and ultimately more valuable to their customers. Those relationships our reps have with our customers are incredibly important.","They are a critical asset certainly that we have, and we're pleased with the progress that we've made over the past six to 12 months in terms of stabilizing the field sales organization, investing in the field sales organization, and certainly I think starting to see some early signs of the impacts there as we indicated in terms of some continued \u2013 improved trends in our consumables and certainly a focus on private label just as a couple of examples. So again, not to provide specific numbers, but we're right on track there and pleased with the progress we're making.","David Larsen","When do you think you'll be - like have the number of reps that you want, like will it be by the end of fiscal 2019 maybe mid fiscal 2020, I'm just trying to get a sense for how far along we are in the process without being too specific, are we like 80% there, 90% there, any high level thoughts?","Mark Walchirk","I'm not sure David, there is - I don\u2019t think there a magic number. I think the market will continue to evolve, our customers will continue to evolve, and I think we'll continue to evolve our sales organization to make sure that we're positioned well with our customers and with the marketplace and the evolution there. So, I don\u2019t think there's a magic number or a magic date that which we're where we want to be. I would expect we'll continue to invest in our field sales organization and make sure we've got the appropriate number to serve our customers.","David Larsen","Okay, and then just one more quick one. I think I heard that the benefit in \u2013 like there was a benefit to other income that was offset by higher interest expense, but according to my model it looks like on a sequential basis other income improved by about on $4.7 million and interest expense had a favorable trend of about $1.8 million sequentially. So I'm just \u2013 I am having a tough time seeing in my model how the one benefit from I guess the delay in the reporting offset the higher interest cost?","Don Zurbay","Yes, this is Don. The higher benefit from the JV accounting, what I mentioned was it actually offset higher legal costs, which would be up in our operating expenses. The interest expense was down slightly just because of our strong cash flow and paying down debt. But I was just pointing out that if you're highlighting a few items, the thing to think about is that the $4 million gain that's in other income expense is one item, but something to also consider as you're looking at the quarter and as you are thinking about maintaining our guidance for the year was higher legal expenses which were about $0.03 higher underneath on an EPS basis than what we had anticipated.","David Larsen","Okay, I appreciate it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Ryan Kimbrel","Hey guys, this is Ryan Kimbrel on for Kevin Ellich. Thanks for taking my questions. I know you guys said that your legal expense was affected by EPS $0.03 in excess of what you originally expected. Do you think or do you expect the outsized legal expense to persist or is it mostly contained in the second quarter? And then I've got one more.","Mark Walchirk","Well, we certainly have legal expenses that are persisting. We don\u2019t necessarily think they'll persist at the level they were at, and I would also add the point here really is as we look at the back half, we think we've forecasted them appropriately and so they are built in \u2013 anything like that would be built into the guidance that we've given.","Ryan Kimbrel","Okay great, and could you guys provide a little more color on what you continue to see in terms of competitive pricing pressure, Dental operating margin obviously declined year-over-year, but improved sequentially. I know you said in the press release that you continue to expect pricing pressure to persist for the time being, but did those competitive headwinds subside a little bit compared to the last quarter? Should we look at the last quarter as a bottom of sorts or was this quarter\u2019s sequential increase in operating margin more of a transitory event?","Mark Walchirk","Well, I think Ryan, certainly we are in a competitive environment as we always have been and certainly we shared last quarter some competitive pricing pressure which we expect to continue. But I would say we did see some stabilization I think in the quarter, and we're obviously very focused on ensuring our customers are thinking about Patterson in the context of our total value proposition. So that is kind of where we sit at this point. And I think we have time just for one more question.","Operator","Okay, and your last question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just about the discussion around the sequential improvement in the operating margins, just kind of curious looking back at the model, really over the past three or four years or so, there's always been a pretty notable improvement in operating margins from fiscal 1Q to fiscal 2Q. I was just wondering if there is anything mechanical about the business where the fiscal 2Q margins are always going to be higher than fiscal 1Q?","And then a followup just on the same thing, it's really that again as margins are improving in the fiscal second quarter, it always has not translated into better results at the back half of each fiscal year, so I'm just wondering is there any extra color on why that might be more sustainable for this fiscal year versus prior fiscal years? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Well, I think part of what you're seeing there probably also just relates simply to, there's an increase in sales so there's a little more leveraging that can take place from Q1 to Q2. But we're also encouraged by the trends in the business. I mean from our chair [ph], we\u2019re and just maybe, doesn\u2019t maybe jump out and certain numbers here, but we're feeling encouraged about the progress of the business and the improvement is in a variety of areas, and so as we look to the second half, we're really sort of anticipating that these kind of things continue as we get into Q3 and Q4 and those should translate to somewhat better operating profit margin in the back half.","Steven Valiquette","Okay got it. Okay I appreciate the extra color thanks.","Operator","Okay I'll turn the call back over to Mark, Walchirk for final comments.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thank you and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to providing another update for you on our third quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect."],"16827":["Patterson Cos., Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host for today's call, Mr. John Wright. Please go ahead.","John M. Wright - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies' fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Gugino, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors, which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements, are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2015 and 2016 third quarters, which exclude the impact of one-time transaction-related costs, deal amortization and foreign currency. Additionally, our discussion of results is adjusted to reflect the reclassification of Patterson Medical as a discontinued operation. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release.","Today's earnings announcement and our discussion also reflect the realignment of our reportable segments. In additional to our Dental segment, our companion Animal business and our new production animal distribution business are now reported as the Patterson Animal Health segment. Our other and more centralized shared functions that were previously embedded within the Dental segment are now being reported in a separate corporate segment. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. During the third quarter, we focused intently on making the most of the fundamental strengths in both of our businesses and capitalize on the generally favorable market conditions affecting our Dental and Animal Health segments. We are pleased with our third quarter results, with our broad sales momentum and our execution.","Since we closed the acquisition of Animal Health International last June, we have made it a high priority to preserve our focus on customer service and sales effectiveness as we've moved through this critical period of integration. Across our entire organization, I am pleased to say that we have done this and it is paying off. We achieved several additional integration milestones in the fiscal 2016 third quarter. We made additional progress on the headquarters relocations to our new Animal Health segment and consolidating functions to Greeley, Colorado.","We further strengthened what we believe to be the deepest leadership team in the animal health industry, and we unified our marketing and operations team. Today, we are truly operating as one business with our vendor partners, nearly all of whom have products across the entire Animal Health segment. Certainly, this is an important early integration win.","Also of note, at the end of the quarter, we moved forward with our first pilot implementations for our Next Generation Systems initiative. This multi-year initiative will, over time, significantly enhance our efficiency and help drive bottom line performance. To date, we have six branches, two fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involving more than 1,000 employees on the new system. Overall, these early pilots are going well and I want to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of all Patterson employees involved. I personally visited a branch office and fulfillment center as we went live and was very encouraged to see the commitment and determination of our employees first-hand.","Let me also thank our new colleagues from Animal Health International, who bring valuable experience, having made this system's journey. They have been incredibly helpful to our launch, and we believe their guidance and input will continue to be very valuable as we learn from these early pilots and ultimately extend the implementation across our entire organization.","Looking now at our markets. The stable to steadily improving conditions we have experienced in the past several quarters largely continued in quarter three. Both segments of our business saw sound, underlying dynamics, which served as tailwinds for our Dental and companion Animal businesses. Improving employment levels and consumer spending continue to benefit both dental service utilization and spending on pets.","On the production animal side, the end market conditions we witnessed in the second quarter largely continued in quarter three. By combining our new production animal strength with our companion animal leadership, we have clearly created the market's most formidable animal health platform. Moreover, we've positioned Patterson to benefit from a new growth catalyst, the ever-increasing global demand for animal protein.","Now looking at our results for the quarter, we turned in a strong performance. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose 48% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations rose 39% to $0.68 per diluted share.","Let's examine our two segments starting with Dental. U.S. Dental market fundamentals were healthy during the quarter and we executed well. Sales from consumables expanded significantly during the period, up more than 5% on a constant currency basis. This is also a nice sequential improvement to our increase in the first half of the year, and we remain encouraged by the momentum here. Sales in our dental equipment category, which can be more variable quarter to quarter, posted solid gains. Equipment sales rose 6.8% in constant currency.","Technology remains a high-priority area for investments of dentists. During the quarter, sales of digital radiography and traditional core equipment were particularly strong, although CEREC sales were below our internal expectations for the period. However, just this morning, Sirona announced their new CEREC Zirconia workflow, which combines CAD\/CAM technology support with full-contour zirconia material. This exciting new product offering will allow for single-visit restorations, using this high-strength material. And we are very enthusiastic about this enhancement to the CEREC platform. We feel confident in saying that the interest in CAD\/CAM offerings is building across dental offices of all sizes. Today's product announcement once again expands the potential for CEREC chairside single-visit dentistry.","Our leadership in digital dental technology as well as traditional equipment is driven by a particular philosophy: an approach to serving the customer that we believe has growing appeal. In addition to the many advantages this technology can provide dentists helping patients, dental offices of all sizes are increasingly seeking a worry-free approach to leveraging technology into their business.","We are speaking to you today from the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting, and this technology and equipment partnership is a common and compelling desire among our dental customers. The importance of superior technical support and service infrastructure needed to support this technology cannot be overestimated. Patterson has invested significantly in these resources over the past 15 years, but we believe our service and support infrastructure give us a distinct competitive advantage to serve an ever-evolving customer.","Looking now at traditional equipment, our quarter three performance was particularly strong. For several quarters, we have been describing our goal to build on the important strategic relationship we have with A-dec and improve our ability to address a wider range of customer needs with expanded offerings. Those offerings include new partnerships with Pelton & Crane and the Belmont Company as well as the new Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. Our results this quarter show that our execution in this area is clearly starting to pay off. Sales of core equipment on a constant currency basis improved double digits year-over-year.","We began training on the Sirona treatment centers last quarter. Customer reaction so far has been enthusiastic. We are confident that these lines will be welcomed additions to what we believe to be the most compelling portfolio of traditional equipment products in the dental community.","Now, let me provide some perspective on this year's extension of Section 179 tax benefits. Naturally, we're pleased to see the extension of these tax benefits for capital purchases made permanent, and we believe this certainly helps our customers with capital purchase planning in the years to come. The extension of Section 179 benefits this year came at roughly the same time as last year. So we view our growth in equipment sales in quarter three as largely a function of market demand and sales execution rather than tax-incentivized purchases.","Now, turning to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, our sales team in this segment has focused on a thorough and timely integration, and these critical efforts are paying off across the entire Animal Health platform.","Companion animal continues to benefit from stable-to-improving market conditions and favorable pet ownership trends. Sales in the legacy companion animal business, excluding revenue from the acquisition and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships, improved 6.2% in constant currency during the quarter. U.S. companion animal is particularly strong, expanding by more than 11%. I need to emphasize that this growth is the direct result of our efforts to rapidly integrate our companion animal management and sales teams and strong execution.","As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added nearly $407 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. Similar to last quarter, end market pricing and customer profitability across the beef, dairy and swine species remain somewhat soft. These factors are part of production animal market cyclicality, and they impacted growth in our production animal business. However, it's important to remember that regardless of market conditions, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals. And we play a critical role in helping them achieve this important objective.","And key to long-term growth, we now possess the foremost production animal business in North America. And we are especially pleased at how well we executed in the market while advancing all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we continue to make substantial progress in this all-important first year of integration in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead.","With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focus on the transformed Patterson Companies. Also, bear in mind that today's results reflect the second full quarter of contribution from Animal Health International. So where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales, which strip out the impact of the acquisition to provide a more normalized view of operations.","Looking at the top line, we reported consolidated sales of $1.4 billion, up 48% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis rose 6.2%, excluding the impact from the change in diagnostic manufacturers in our companion animal business. Also, this is up sequentially from 3.3% organic growth in Q2. The effects of foreign currency translation moderated slightly during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency translation sales reduced sales by approximately 1.7%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources.","Now, let's look at margins. As a reminder, when we announced the acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of Patterson Medical last year, the central rationale was to gain a broader platform for growth and improve our return on invested capital profile in exchange for some margin dilution.","Consolidated operating margins during the third quarter reflected that impact, declining 70 basis points. However, with the additional earnings power from Animal Health International, our operating income rose by $28 million (13:55) to $108 million, up 35% over third quarter last year.","Organic consolidated operating margin in the third quarter averaged 8.9%. We had another good quarter of operating margin expansion within both our Dental and Animal Health businesses. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.68.","Now, let's move on to our segments. In our Dental segment, sales rose 5.9% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew more than 5%, as we saw solid gains in utilization. Equipment sales were up 6.8% in constant currency, reflecting strength in both core equipment and technology sales.","While we certainly believe the appetite for technology among practitioners is healthy and expanding, CEREC sales fell short of our internal expectations, as Scott noted. However, with the new product innovation and focused promotional offerings, we anticipate a stronger CEREC performance in Q4.","Operating margins increased 15 basis points over the prior year in Dental, driven by gross margins; specifically, earning additional manufacturer rebates, which resulted from our effort to broaden our core equipment portfolio as well as mix. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion of between 20 and 30 basis points in Dental for the full year.","Now, turning to our Animal Health segment. In this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the change in veterinary diagnostic manufacturers. Note that this is the last time that we will adjust for this change, since it has now been annualized.","On a constant currency basis, organic sales in the segment rose more than 6% for the quarter, driven by strength in the U.S. Sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 11.3%. This was partially offset by growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the UK. The sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period totaled $407 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year.","As Scott mentioned, the production animal market is currently impacted by some softness across beef and dairy cattle as well as the swine species. Currently expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2017, with expected revenue growth rates in the 2% to 3% range for this business.","Operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased by 80 basis points, led by improvements in our legacy companion animal business and synergies capture. And we expect operating margins here to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment, as we've said previously.","We are pleased with our progress in capturing synergies during the quarter. Specifically, we have made strides in several areas, including the integration of our companion animal sales force, lowering facility expenses and reducing logistics costs, among others. Our efforts so far this year demonstrate that we on track to achieve our stated goal of realizing between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a three-year period.","Now, a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used $47.5 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter versus generating $119.4 million in the prior period. The increase in working capital is due to a few factors: investment in inventories at our pilot locations and preparation for the new ERP system; inventory build with CEREC units; and purchasing opportunities from our consumable vendors at their year end.","Working capital levels should come down over the next few quarters as we work through consolidation activities from the acquisition, stabilize business processes connected to our ERP initiative and work down the safety stock we used to ensure we would properly serve our customers during our pilot phase. As a result, we expect our net income to free cash flow conversion to still be positive for fiscal 2016 but lower than our historical performance.","We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. CapEx in the third quarter totaled $15 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx to be approximately $65 million to $75 million.","In terms of shareholder return, year-to-date we have returned a total of $267 million to our shareholders through a combination of $67 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. I'll wrap up this discussion with a few comments on fiscal 2016 guidance.","Based on our performance in the first nine months of fiscal 2016, we are narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.42 to $2.48 per diluted share. I'll remind you that this range assumes stable North American and international markets. It includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. Our guidance excludes one-time transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, nonrecurring IT training costs and tax costs related to cash repatriation.","Before I turn it back to Scott, a note about our Next Generation Systems initiative and expense levels going forward. Today, we are actively shipping product on the new system. We are using it across a representative section of Patterson; and ultimately, this will lead to new efficiencies and cost savings. However, this investment will begin depreciating in fiscal 2017, as we move further into implementation. We are currently in the stabilization phase with our pilot activity and are totally committed to ensuring a smooth transition to the new system. This pilot phase will continue through the end of the fiscal year; then move into broader implementation during the late summer or early fall.","We have significantly reduced our implementation risk by deploying the new technology gradually throughout our system rather than flipping the switch all at once. But this comes with a cost in FY 2017, as we are essentially running on two technology platforms. Additionally, some efficiencies cannot be fully realized until the ERP platform is totally implemented. As a result, we expect approximately a $25 million step-up in operating expense pre-tax associated with the ERP implementation in 2017.","Although we are not providing specific guidance for fiscal 2017 today, we expect that momentum in the underlying business combined with efficiency initiatives should enable us to partially offset this step-up in expense. We will provide additional detail around this when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance during our year-end conference call in May.","All in all, we are on track for a solid fiscal 2016. And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ann. We're proud of our many accomplishments thus far in 2016, especially when I consider the range of initiatives we have before us. Specifically: we are forging ahead with the integration of Animal Health International into Patterson Companies. We are moving forward with the pilot phase of our new ERP system. We are heavily concentrating on the sales front to make the most of the stable-to-strengthening market environment in front of us and doing all of this while maintaining the high levels of customer support and service we are known for.","Not only are we succeeding; we are accelerating through these challenges and opportunities and focusing on what we do best, which will be critical to achieving our growth goals. As we close out the year and look forward towards fiscal 2017, it's ultimately the people of Patterson that make us successful. And we continue to demonstrate the ability to attract top-tier talent.","Recently, we made some key additions to our already-strong management team. Doug Jones joined us as President of our Companion Animal Group. Doug comes to us from Merial North America, where he served as head of Merial's U.S. Pet Sales and National Accounts team and most recently as President of Merial North America. Doug's exceptional track record speaks for itself, and he will play a central role in enhancing our product and service offerings to our companion animal veterinarians. And Kelly Baker came on board as Chief Human Resources Officer. Kelly joined Patterson from General Mills, where she most recently served as Vice President of Human Resources for General Mills' U.S. Retail Operating Segment. Her depth of experience in talent acquisition and development and workforce planning will be invaluable as we continue to grow.","Looking at our markets. In Dental, we believe we are bringing to customers the right combination of product and technical support that will allow us to be the partner of choice for dental operations of all sizes. In Animal Health, I'm excited about the unity we have achieved within our team and at the synergies we are capturing and how we are positioned within both the companion animal and production animal markets. The diversity of end markets and combinations of long-term growth opportunities and catalysts will be critical to us in the years ahead.","Finally, we remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy and believe that our ability to propel the dividend and share repurchases while continuing to invest in the business reflects the strong financial platform we have built.","Now we'd like to take questions, so I'll turn the call back over to Jason.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Michael Cherny at Evercore ISI.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys, and thank you for the color so far.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","So I just want to dive in a little bit on the consumables growth. It seems to be from a reported basis that this is the strongest number you've put up in two years. You talked about improving macro trends. Can you just give a sense maybe of some of the buying habits you're seeing that are driving that better number? Is it more on a new customer basis? Is it more on a \u2013 increasing the basket size each customer's getting? I just wanted to get a little more color on how much \u2013 what the various different pieces are that are getting you to that better consumables number.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Michael. I think it was a combination of a few things. One is we saw a pretty even growth in terms of geographies. I feel the dental community in general benefited in the November, December time period, which generally is one of a larger number of dentistry is done for insurance purposes. So some of that pent-up demand we've talked about. Going back a few quarters, I think we began to see as we poll our customers, particular strength we're in, in sort of the chairside operatory products, which lends to the fact of more people are accepting open treatment plans. And then I think it was a strong execution. So we absolutely feel comfortable that we're growing faster than the market and are pleased with the performance of the Dental business.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And then just, Ann, one question on the ERP Next Gen roll-out. Can you just level set us again what the total incremental cost is throughout 2016? And then as you think about in 2017, I know you don't want to give specific guidance, so just maybe qualitatively, some of the actions you need to pursue to try and offset some of that cost headwind.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. The incremental cost in 2016 is very little, just because we have been heavily capitalizing the project up to this point. So the bulk of the incremental expense really hits in 2017, when we start the deployment across the system. And that's really two areas. It's depreciation and then the people cost that you've been capitalized now start to kind of flow through the expense.","So as I mentioned, it's about \u2013 for 2017, we're anticipating it's about a $25 million step-up in expense pre-tax. So I think that would be the color I'd be able to provide at this point. We can give you some more details as we get into giving guidance at the end of next quarter.","Michael Cherny - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich at Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, guys. My phone kind of cut out, but \u2013 so if I missed it, I can go back and listen to the transcript. Scott, I wondered if you could provide a little bit more color as to what's going on with the equipment sales. I heard the comment about CEREC came in below expectations; and of course Sirona launched the new Zirconia workflow. Wondering how you think that's going to play out throughout the year.","And then second question in the Animal Health business. Clearly, the dairy and the beef cattle markets have been a little soft. Wondering what your outlook for 2016 is and expectations on the production animal side, especially with the swine business as well. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Yeah. Without going back over the transcript in total, I'll sort of hit the high points. Strong performance in a number of areas in North American dental equipment; very strong performance across our whole digital portfolio in terms of cone beam panoramics and intra-oral digital products as well as really nice growth on the traditional chair unit, light, cabinet, core equipment growth with multiple partners. So a really nice quarter with A-dec as well as some of our new partners.","Did mention that we began training on the Sirona treatment centers. But I would say that, that didn't have a material impact in our results in this quarter, but we look at that as a real catalyst to growing that top end of the market going forward. On the CEREC front, I'd say sort of three things as we look at the Quarter. One, we did have a, I would say, maybe a small drag coming out of second quarter. Second quarter was our second largest CEREC quarter in the history of the company and very, very strong on the new user demand.","We felt Section 179 passing late, if it impacted any area of it, it may have had a small impact on the CEREC area. And then as we got into January and we began to send out notices to our CEREC sales force about coming to Minneapolis for some training, that may have slowed down the pipeline a little bit towards the end of January. So we have a challenge out to our CEREC salespeople and our salespeople in general because we know there's robust demand for CEREC and really feel like the Zirconia workflow is a game changer.","We've talked for years about the CEREC system just becomes easier and easier to use with the improvements in software. Great material partners have helped on the clinical side, but what Zirconia does is it really opens up a whole other customer base in terms of just really meat-and-potatoes dentistry. So it's very exciting. And I think this is just another part of this ongoing CEREC story that we've been such a big part of for 15 years. And we're excited to drive demand with even, as I've said many times, CEREC is sort of the Swiss Army Knife of dentistry, and now we just have one more tool in the kit.","Moving on to Animal Health, as I said, we experienced similar conditions on the production side. The one thing I would point out is we have a great management team in our Animal Health business in this team, and it was part of due diligence. They know how to manage cycles very well, so they're managing the business very well through the current cycle. We feel like we're taking share. We're all over the integration plan. We'll probably see the conditions \u2013 Ann mentioned in her comments \u2013 potentially 2% to 3% growth on the production side going into fiscal 2017.","But a common point that we've talked about in our Investor Day and many other times \u2013 and I apologize for the long answer \u2013 but we're a key part of keeping the animals healthy. And the producers are intent on keeping the animals healthy, regardless of their profitability swings. So our cyclicality is much less than what our end consumers, producers experience. And we're managing the business very well through this period.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. And then with the strong companion animal growth that you saw, the 11%, do you think much of that's \u2013 how much of that's due to the new products that came to market and then the very mild winter that we saw in Q4, or in the December quarter?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we'll see potentially more weather effect going into the fourth. But I think it was just strong execution. Just like the demo question I answered the last time, very even in terms of the geographic dispersion of where the growth was. One of the things we talked about is we very quickly integrated that companion animal team and the management team and got our people very focused on taking care of customers and helping customers win in the marketplace. So just strong execution by that group.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Last one for Ann. Capital allocation; you guys have done a lot of share repurchase this year so far. Wondering what your outlook is on the front between share buyback and acquisitions.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So I would say here in the shorter term, depending on the market conditions, we could choose to opportunistically get back into the market and continue to buy back our shares over the next few months. With that said, we are at the stated goal of $200 million for the quarter. And of course, we need to balance that with the increased working capital needs in the short term that I discussed resulting from the ERP implementation and the AHI integration activities.","But over the long term, we continue to believe that a capital allocation strategy that balances deployment of free cash flow back into the business could drive strategic growth either for M&A or just internal growth. And then returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases is the right strategy to drive increased shareholder value.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Sounds good. Thank you.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson at Robert Baird.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good afternoon or good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So couple questions here. Scott, I heard the 2% to 3% number on the Animal Health business on kind of a go-forward basis or the production animal side. You did 6% on the companion side this quarter. As we think forward over the next few quarters and investors are starting to turn towards the 2017 model is that what we should think about for the companion side?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd say the companion side is sort of a mix of our NVS business in the UK and the U.S. business. I think we would see the NVS business strengthening a tad, getting over some tougher comps they've run into. But really, the driver of the companion business is the U.S. And in the U.S., I think they're pretty healthy market dynamics across the board. So similar market conditions on the companion side, but most importantly in the U.S. companion side.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. That's helpful. And then, Ann, on the $25 million incremental next year on the IT side. How would you think about leveraging those costs then at you go into 2018? Is this just a step-up in the depreciation and the go-forward costs, and we kind of level set those into our 2018-and-beyond numbers?","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","So the step-up in 2017 is the incremental costs of the depreciation of people costs. But with that said, to your point, when we get out of \u2013 either to the tail end of 2017 or well into 2018, we would expect to be able to take costs out of the organization because what we have currently in our underlying numbers are the costs to run the existing system. So for 2017, we're actually going to be \u2013 we're going to be running two systems. So I would expect in 2018, there's two things: one, we're going to be able to shut down the legacy system; and, two, we'll begin harvesting the operating efficiencies because we'll have the entire company on the new platform.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Well, maybe we'll offline kind of talk about some of that could come down. But last question I had, just on the consumable side, the number was obviously strong on the Dental consumables number this quarter. I've heard very good things on January, not just November, December. And I think, Scott, you mentioned November, December for insurance purposes but I've heard good things on January as well, and even continuing into February. So any comments just on the general trend?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. And good question, Jeff. I can clarify a little bit what I said. In terms of \u2013 there's always a lag on when you're resupplying the dentist. So the fact that the dentists were very busy in November and December definitely helped in January. So obviously, our quarter is through January, so we saw that strength. The other thing I think we're all experiencing now as we get into February, March is it was a pretty rough winter last year, particularly in the Northeast and the Southeast. So you're getting \u2013 I think the whole industry's getting a little weather benefit right now. But overall, a pretty stable environment.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steven Valiquette at UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Scott and Ann. So I guess for dental equipment \u2013 and I guess it's encouraging that we're characterizing the just-reported quarter as driven by normal equipment demand and not driven by Section 179. I think I asked the same question on your dental distributor peer, on their call as well. If we fast-forward to about a year from now, should we assume maybe preliminarily that you'll have some easier comps year-over-year in your upcoming fiscal 2017 for dental equipment because of the fact that the Section 179 tax break is already locked in to the upcoming year and would hopefully drive some extra purchases in your fiscal 2017? Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Steve, this is Scott. And I would absolutely anticipate that we would be in a very healthy environment for dental equipment as we go into the second half of calendar 2016. I think the fact that this was a permanent extension really resonates not only with our dental customers, but I've spoken to a number of sort of leading accountants who deal with dental practices across the county. And just having the rules of the road in front of them, I think really opens up now discussions that have been tougher to have over the last 24 months to 36 months. Particularly around potential major expansion of dental offices, major remodels. And when you look at a product like CEREC in particular, the Section 179 benefits are a major economic driver that helps a dentist make that a great investment for their practice.","So not to get too far ahead of ourselves; if we have a good macroeconomic backdrop with these incentives, absolutely, we would look to get back to a more traditional type volume that we had in \u2013 two, three years ago. So we're pretty excited about it, but we're concentrating right now on the fourth quarter.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then one other quick one. I'm not sure if you hit on this or not, but did your employee medical expenses normalize this quarter? Just want to check the box on that as well.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes, they did. They came back to normal levels. So we're running about $15 million a quarter.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. All right. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Willoughby at Credit Suisse.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Scott, a question. You mentioned on the weaker CEREC placements a couple reasons. Do you think there was anything involving the new product line coming out? Or I think you mentioned a promotion there. Does that result in any softness in the CEREC or no effect?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to let our dental team off the hook, but obviously \u2013 and I mentioned it a little bit \u2013 when we told our CEREC specialists they were coming to Minneapolis for training, they definitely knew that something was coming, particularly how we invited them and the confidentiality around the meeting. So we may have had a delay there, but there'll be a full expectation that we get up and running real quickly here on the CEREC front. But the Zirconia workflow's a big deal, and we're really excited about the potential of it.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And what is the promo that you mentioned?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just, I would say nothing incremental in terms of promotions. Just \u2013 or I think a pretty solid promotional roadmap that we've laid out with Sirona not only for our fourth quarter but throughout the summer. So nothing incremental in expense.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Nothing like buy one, pay us in a year?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. No. No. I tried, but Gugino wouldn't let me do it.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Right. And Ann, do you have a balance sheet share base for the quarter? I have the income statement; I don't see the balance sheet one.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","The balance sheet what, share? I don't have that with me.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I will get that from you.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll follow up.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We will go next to Jon Block at Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe two or three quick ones. Ann, the first one, the free cash flow as a percent of net income, you said expected to be positive. But it is a big revision. I think previously, you talked about 100% conversion. So what's that mostly a function of? Is that just largely the inventory build ahead of the ERP transition?","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So you're right. We were coming into the year thinking it was going to be in line with historical levels, which is usually between 85% and 100% conversion. And you're right. It's inventory in a couple areas, so a portion of it is the ERP system and ramping up for that. And we think we'll be able to moderate those levels as we get nearer to year end. Part of it is the CEREC build. Just due to the sales performance in the current year, we had built higher inventory levels up at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter expecting a better performance.","And then the third area is just as we consolidate warehouses in the animal health space. We just had a little bit of a build in inventory there to maintain service levels as we're bringing one facility up and another down. You'll also see a little bit of a build in our long-term receivables, and that's really some unsold finance contracts. That's really a timing issue but does have to do with the business process transition to shared services for accounts receivable, collections and processing. And that is a part of the SAP implementation as well.","So we'll be able to bring those levels down over time, but it's going to take us a couple quarters. So I think we'll be positive in Q4 but not to the same extent as last year.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then shifting to the UK CAG business, the overall CAG growth was great; it was really robust. But the U.K. CAG was sort of flattish for that second or third straight quarter. I heard some of my other guys talking about some international weakness in prior quarters but seems to have gotten better. So Scott, do you think UK CAG is still market, or do you think there's any market share going on with your NVS business over there?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say, Jon, we're very confident it's a market issue and we're performing against the market. As we've stated before, we are a market leader with over 40% share. And we would look for those conditions to improve as we get into the springtime.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And last one. Scott, I hope this is a fair question, but you're tracking towards the midpoint of your original fiscal 2016 guidance. But arguably, that's with what I compute as roughly $0.05 aid from the share repo. And I believe the end markets have certainly strengthened throughout your fiscal year. So can you just talk to us on arguably, why you're tracking towards a little bit the lower end of your original guidance ex-share repo, despite end markets that have been strengthening over the past nine-plus months? Thanks, guys.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So I think you're right that the share repo is about $0.05. And I think there's a couple reasons that I would point to tracking more towards the midpoint of the range versus the upper. You might recall last quarter, we said we think we can get to the upper end of the range but that would be getting some tailwind from Section 179 which, as Scott noted, we really had no effect. It passed at about the same time this year versus last. And then part of the other thing is we had some one-time expenses in the first two quarters of the year. We had the health insurance expense with the higher claims experience in Q2 of about $5 million, and then you might recall we had a bad debt write-off in Q1. So I kind of look at the share repurchases kind of offsetting a couple of unusual items in Q1 and Q2.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say from underlying business performance outside of those items, the businesses are performing well and we will look to them to improve going forward.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lisa Gill at JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. Just a couple questions. So first, I think it was about a year ago that you'd discussed a five-year goal of doubling the CEREC installed base. Can you talk about maybe where you're tracking with respect to that goal? And has anything changed in terms of your confidence of being able to achieve that target or maybe the cadence around how you expect to build to that number?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'm absolutely confident in the target, and I think all who know me knows that I'm a real believer in the impact of what chairside CAD\/CAM dentistry can do for the dental profession and for dental patients. So obviously, I would say sitting here right now, we need more lift out of the sales force. We are spending a lot of time around training. We have the national sales meeting where we spent a lot of time talking about CEREC.","But also another piece of this is innovation, and that's where my confidence in Sirona could not be higher. And I also believe the combination of Sirona and DENTSPLY can be a catalyst towards driving our stated goals further. And something like the Zirconia workflow launch really opens up CEREC to pretty much every dentist in North America, regardless of their clinical preference, which is a big deal. So I would not couch that goal at all. But it is an aspirational goal, but we feel like this is a product on the verge of a major tipping point.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then with regards to the Next Gen System, can you remind us if you talked about in the past maybe when you initially announced the initiative, about what do you expect it to drive in terms of savings and efficiencies over the longer term and what that time horizon is? And going along with that, do you expect to be at that full run rate of savings in your fiscal 2018?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll start on just some operational strategy questions and then maybe have Ann finish off. One of the things we stated about is we feel this is a big investment to really create a modern digital platform for the company; to be able to take care of not only the customer of today but the customer of the future. But also make us a much more nimble, flexible company to be able to drive investment in the right place but also drive returns to owners, regardless of what end markets look like.","Could not be more pleased with the initial launch. We have, I would say, three things. One is we have a very stable system; two, the fact that we're fully operational in two fulfillment centers. And personally visiting our South Bend facility and seeing that work going on and picking some orders myself, I'm excited about the efficiencies there; and then the third good sign is all of our pilot sales branches are seeing sales growth. It's not without a lot of effort by our employees, anytime you make a major organizational change like this. But we are off to a good start. Maybe I'll have Ann put a little more color on the end of that.","Ann B. Gugino - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So the total investment in the technology is around $85 million. If we look out in terms of the return on that investment and what we talked about initially, I think Scott talked a lot about that already in his comments. What I would add to that is we do have a very detailed plan, specifically by business function, by person, in terms of what we're expecting in terms of efficiency gains or operating margin expansion opportunities or working capital improvements. We have not quantified those publicly.","What I would say in terms of can \u2013 will we be at a full run rate in 2018? I hate to say, it depends, but it depends. So it will depend on, as we get into full scale roll-out later this summer, how well that goes, right? So if it's going as well as the pilot, we think we could accelerate that and be in a really good position to begin harvesting at the very beginning of 2018. If we hit any bumps in the road, it might be a little later into 2018 until we start harvesting some of those synergies. And I think as we get closer, we can provide a little bit more color on how much of that $25 million we think we can mitigate through other operational efficiencies next year and then how much we think we can take out into 2018. But I think we need a little more time. We're just in our strategic planning cycle right now.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the comments.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys. I just had one question, actually, on the Animal Health side. If I heard you right, I think you were calling for 2% to 3% growth on the production side. So I guess, A), is that right? Did I hear you correctly? And then relative to the synergies that you guys have out around AHI, does that growth range affect or impact the synergies that you guys have targeted? Or do you need it to kind of return back to that 4% to 6% normalized range that I think you guys had shared back at Analyst Day?","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bob. I'll take that. I was specifically, and in Ann's script was, it was 2% to 3% in the production side only. And the synergy plan was not tied to revenue growth, so we are on track regardless of end market conditions in the coming year to continue to accelerate our synergy roadmap.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. That's all I had. Thanks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue, so I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Anderson for any additional or closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jason, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're encouraged by our progress and look forward to updating you soon on our fiscal 2016 conclusion as well as seeing many of you this afternoon at the Chicago Midwinter Dental Meeting.

After a review of the second quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors, which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Welcome to today\u2019s conference call everyone. We have several goals for our call with you today. First, we want to give you an update on our progress on several initiatives to position Patterson for improved growth. Second, we will review the financials and update our outlook as we head into the second half of FY 2018. And lastly, we will discuss our leadership transition. We are delighted to be joined today by our new President and CEO of Patterson, Mark Walchirk. I will conclude my remarks with a short introduction of Mark, following Ann\u2019s review the financials. Mark will make a few comments before we take your questions.","As we discussed last quarter, Patterson is in the middle of several initiatives that are creating near-term challenges as we move toward improved growth opportunities. In our dental segment, we are midstream in adjusting our talent, implementing new systems and adding marketing capabilities to better serve our customers now and in the future with technologically innovative products across a full range of clinical environments. In animal health, we are concentrating on sales execution and improving margins and we remain committed to realizing the strength and scale of our animal health platform.","I will start with dental. While we had initially factored in some disruptions that our initiatives and this new territory for this industry would create, the pace of navigating the product and distribution changes in our technology equipment category had been more difficult to predict than we anticipated. As you may recall, Patterson\u2019s decision to move beyond selling exclusively chair-side technology was a customer-focused strategy that allows us to serve a much wider range of customers and their respective needs. We remain confident in our decision to expand our technology portfolio and expect these sales to ramp as the market adjusts for the influx of new products. As a reminder, Patterson is pursuing the digitization of dentistry with the backbone of the industry\u2019s most experienced and advanced service and support structure. These capabilities are second to none and we believe they have been selling points of differentiation for both our customers and manufacturing partners. In other product categories, while we have made progress strengthening our sales force and marketing initiatives, overall consumable growth reflects the factors I have described as well as stable end market conditions and a negative impact of recent hurricanes. Sales of basic equipment posted solid gains in quarter two and we are seeing customer receptivity in our broad range of product offerings.","A final word on dental, we are pleased that the rollout of our ERP implementation is now complete. This is a significant achievement. However, the system is creating short-term challenges as we move from initial rollout to now working on enhancements to the new workflow in the business. As we refined our new ERP system, we are encouraged that the heavy lifting is behind us and that this dynamic will stabilize going forward.","Turning to animal health, our focus has been to successfully complete our integration and accelerate performance in this segment. I am pleased to report that we continued our momentum from the first quarter and made additional progress in quarter two. During the second quarter of FY 2018, we continued to experience positive end market fundamentals in this segment.","In terms of pharmacoeconomics, animal feed input prices continued to be favorable and farmers are benefiting from higher product pricing. Beef cattle herd numbers continue to grow and feed steer prices remain elevated. Finally, export [port pass] are up for both meat and dairy products. We must execute well to capitalize on these dynamics and I am pleased with the sales level this quarter in both production and companion animal.","We believe we outperformed the market as we achieved growth in all species, particularly in our swine business. We anticipated important share gains and margin expansion during the quarter. These have been important goals and the optimization of our sales mix and marketing initiatives have contributed greatly to our success in this area.","Patterson Companies have made important progress against many of our current initiatives and, clearly, our organization also has challenges and more work to do, challenges that we believe will lead to growth opportunities under new leadership. After Ann reviews the financials, we will ask Mark to introduce himself and share some of his early observations as he steps into his new role as President and CEO of Patterson Companies.","Mark joins Patterson after nearly 30 years of experience in health care services and distribution, including 16 successful years at McKesson Corporation where he most recently served as President of the U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Mark is an exceptional leader and on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express our support for Mark as he steps into his new leadership role to move our organization forward.","Now, I will ask Ann to review the financials.","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Jim, and thank you all for joining us today.","Our performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected many of the factors Jim has described. Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2018 second quarter were $1.4 billion on a reported basis, down 2.3% versus a year ago. When adjusted for currency translation, sales declined 2.8%, including an estimated negative impact for recent hurricanes of 60 basis points.","Turning to our margins. Our second quarter consolidated operating margin was 6%, a 47 basis point decline versus the prior year quarter. While we demonstrated another year-over-year operating margin improvement in our animal health segment for the quarter, this gain was more than offset by a decline in our dental segment and by the planned incremental costs from our ERP implementation, which accounted for 30 basis points of the consolidated operating margin decline.","On the bottom line, GAAP net income was $40.2 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $45.8 million or $0.48 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income, which excludes certain non-recurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $47.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, down $5.9 million from the same quarter last year. It is important to point out that on a pre-tax basis, the incremental step up in ERP expenses represented approximately $4 million. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.51 in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $0.56 in the second quarter of last year, a decline of 8.9% from a year ago.","Now, let\u2019s turn to our segments. In dental, the 2018 second quarter sales reflected the impact of our strategic initiatives. While we factored in a level of sales interruption related to our current business initiatives, sales were lower than anticipated in the 2018 second quarter in both dental consumables and the technology equipment. On a reported basis, dental sales were down 8% and in constant currency sales decreased 8.4% versus the prior year quarter. This also includes an estimated negative impact from recent hurricanes of 90 basis points. On that same basis, Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 4.4% during the 2018 second quarter.","Moving on to dental equipment sales, on a constant currency basis, equipment sales declined 17.7% in the 2018 second quarter. The decline in equipment sales is primarily due to the decrease in sales of CEREC products and other digital technology equipment. We are confident in our decision to expand our technology portfolio to sell exciting new products to more customer types. However, the transition will take longer than a quarter or two from the September date when the transition officially began. Given the performance of this category through the first half, we now anticipate that the effect of the transition in our technology equipment business will persist through fiscal 2018.","Turning to our animal health segment, we are encouraged by the sales performance and market share gains across our animal health business in the 2018 second quarter. On a reported basis, consolidated animal health sales grew 2% year-over-year. In constant currency, animal health sales rose 1.4% year-over-year. After normalizing for a change in product selling arrangements, total animal health segment sales rose 3.7%, including an estimated negative impact from recent hurricanes of 30 basis points for the segment.","Looking at our companion animal business, for the second quarter, global companion animal sales declined 1.4% in constant currency. When normalizing for a change in product selling arrangements, global companion animal sales grew approximately 3.2%. This includes an estimated negative impact from the recent hurricanes of 60 basis points. On that same basis, our companion animal business in the U.S. increased 3.9% with an estimated 90 basis point hurricane impact. Production animal sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 4.2% in constant currency versus the year ago period. Our overall performance in the production animal segment reflects strong top line sales and share gains across all species. End markets in the production animal space continued to be favorable, which drives additional profitability for our producer customers and motivates them to invest more in the health of their animals.","Gross margins are up in our animal health business and we continue to make progress on improvement at the operating margin level. This quarter, we achieved another sequential and year-over-year operating margin improvement in animal health. Operating margins in the quarter were 24 basis points over prior year period. Our margin challenges in animal health are largely a function of our integration efforts where operational priorities led to underinvestment in marketing support and less focus on product mix. We are driving operating margin improvement in animal health in three primary ways: first, through better marketing and focus on product sales mix; second, by more effectively partnering with our vendors and lastly, continued focus on cost controls and capturing the remaining integration synergies which will surely leverage the strength of our combined Animal Health platform.","We believe these actions are within our control to manage and correct. We are working our plan and seeing the results on the bottom line and we are determined to continue improving our operating margin within our Animal Health segment. As we near the end of the 3-year integration time frame, we are pleased that our synergy capture is on pace to deliver the targeted range we committed to when we announced the acquisition of Animal Health International.","Regarding the enterprise resource planning system rollout. The deployment of our ERP system rollout for the U.S. Dental and veterinary business is now complete. This is a significant milestone as we can now receive and ship orders using one system across the business instead of 2. Our continued experience with the system will provide the foundation for a more ambitious and customer-centric e-commerce platform.","Ultimately, the foundational data and the analytics from this new platform will help us run our entire business with greater speed and agility and with less working capital to free up cash for other strategic uses. However, the journey is not over and we do recognize the inconvenience and disruption we have caused with customers, suppliers and field offices through the implementation phase. We have shifted our focus and we are ramping resources to improve the systems experience for our customers as they do business with Patterson.","Now, I will conclude with a look at several key balance sheet and cash flow items. During the quarter, operating cash flow improved significantly as we generated $123 million of cash from operations compared to $17 million in the second quarter of last year. So at the halfway point of fiscal 2018, we have generated $132 million of additional cash compared to the first 6 months of last year.","This increase in cash flow is a result of our focus on improving working capital. Through the first 6 months, our working capital is down $144 million versus the same period last year. We achieved this improvement even though working capital has been impacted by ERP deployment. And now that these deployments are complete, we expect to stabilize and enhance our processes to further reduce our investments in working capital over time.","Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6% and slightly lower than last year because of a geographical shift in earnings. The small benefit here was offset by increased interest expense in the quarter. For the 2018 fiscal year, we still expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35.5%.","Turning to our capital allocation strategy. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to shareholders. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we returned nearly $62 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. That brings the total for the first half of fiscal 2018 to $124 million. We remain fully committed to our dividend and we have increased it every year since it was instituted. Our strong balance sheet, along with our newly expanded debt capacity, also gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically and we have approximately 12 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization.","Given our performance through the first half, we have revised our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018. We now expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.77 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings are now expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 per diluted share. Our adjusted earnings guidance excludes the after-tax impact of deal amortization expenses of $25.3 million or $0.27 per diluted share as well as integration and business restructuring expenses of approximately $5.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share.","Before turning the call over to Mark, I would like to conclude my remarks with a word of thanks to Jim Wiltz. On behalf of the executive leadership team and all employees here at Patterson, we want to personally thank Jim for serving as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. Jim has served as a steady hand and a leader familiar with our customers, industry relationships, employees and shareholders during the past 6 months as the board searched for the right next leader for Patterson. We are grateful, but we will continue to benefit from Jim\u2019s valuable experience as an ongoing member of the board.","And now, I will turn the call over to Mark Walchirk, our new President and Chief Executive Officer.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you, Ann. I appreciate the warm welcome to Patterson and certainly Jim\u2019s introduction as well. And I\u2019d also like to add my personal word of thanks to Jim Wiltz for his commitment to Patterson as he stepped in to serve as the Interim President and CEO for the past 6 months and, more importantly, for his over 40 plus years of service to Patterson Companies. I am also grateful for the foundation built by Jim and other senior leaders who have shaped the culture and capabilities of Patterson into the company it is today.","Now, as I considered accepting this great opportunity, there are a number of aspects that really attracted me to join Patterson. First, Patterson has a great tradition and legacy of success. The company also has leading positions in strong markets and certainly a strong commitment to serving our customers in a customer-first approach. All these create a solid platform for growth and long-term success and these are just a few of the key reasons I am excited to be onboard. It\u2019s certainly a privilege to be joining Patterson at this important inflection point for the company and I truly believe the company has the right people and commitment to create a great platform, again, for growth and long-term success.","However, I certainly understand the challenges we are facing and the need to revise our outlook for the rest of fiscal 2018. I have worked with our leadership team and established a formal and comprehensive 90-day transition plan and, over the next 90 days, I will get to work on doing a deep dive into the business to develop a thorough understanding of our customers and our business model to gain clarity and alignment for the action plan that will accelerate our path to improve growth. To accomplish this, I plan to engage with employees across the organization, our customers, our key manufacturers and business partners to gain and develop a deeper understanding of our business from the ground up and to complete a strategic assessment that includes the clear action steps needed to drive improvement.","At a high level, as part of this 90-day plan, I will be focusing on 3 key areas that I believe will set the foundation for long-term success. Operational excellence, growth and our people. First off, I am a big believer in operational excellence. In a business like ours, doing the day-to-day and the basics exceptionally well and delivering operational excellence across all parts of the company will be a critical foundation for success. Second, we obviously need to be focused on growth. There are a variety of ways to drive growth across the company, whether it\u2019s organic growth, the development of new products and services, new markets as well as M&A and business development opportunities. And I certainly expect to consider all of these alternatives as we build out our longer-term strategic focus and approach. And finally, I will focus on our people and our culture. I believe strongly in a focused and engaged team. And certainly, in a relationship-driven, customer-focused business like ours, our people play a crucial role in our success.","I am looking forward to getting to know our team and continuing to build on the engagement and culture that has been established at Patterson. I am very excited for this opportunity and certainly ready to dive in headfirst with the team in the weeks and months ahead.","And now, Jim, Ann and I will take any questions you may have. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert your line is open.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for the questions and welcome to Mark. I guess, just looking at the results in the quarter from an EPS perspective, they actually weren\u2019t that far off from where the street was modeling, yet, clearly, Ann, as you discussed, the back half guidance is being reduced quite a bit. If I am hearing you right, is the biggest delta from where you are today, looking out the back half versus the previous guidance, just a reduction in your expectations around the high-tech equipment? Is that where things have maybe changed the most? And if that\u2019s the case, maybe specifically could you talk a little bit about what hasn\u2019t gone necessarily according to plan?","Ann Gugino","Sure. So you hit it. I mean, I think there is two factors that are really playing into the reduction in guidance and it\u2019s really based on the performance we are seeing in the current quarter. One is around the high-tech equipment piece, but I would also note that the consumables were below our expectations in the quarter. So as you noted, we did expect the first half of the year to be challenging and then we are expecting earnings growth to anticipate \u2013 or to accelerate at the back half of the year as we work through some of these transitions. And what I would say is while we continue to make great progress on the strategic initiatives, the speed and pace has been difficult to predict and the process is taking just a bit longer than we expected. So as it relates to the high-tech equipment, customers are continuing to take time to evaluate and recalibrate both evaluating new product offerings as well as multiple distribution arrangements. And then there continues to be some sales rep productivity challenges relating to ramping on the new products and adjusting to the new competitive environment. So we just felt like based on the current performance in the current quarter and our revised outlook, it was prudent to take down guidance.","Robert Jones","It makes sense. One of the other big initiatives you guys have talked has obviously been penetrating deeper into the DSO space. Your largest competitor in this most recent quarter discussed re-pricing a number of their DSO clients. I was wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on the pricing front within the DSO segment and more importantly, how much of an opportunity is there still to win share in that space?","Ann Gugino","Sure. So I would start by saying that we are aware of all the bids and we are bidding and participating in the bids in the segment. And so as you alluded to, we know that some DSO business is won purely \u2013 won or lost purely on price, while other business can be more about supply chain partnerships. And so we\u2019re going to compete heavily in the space. We want to win business where relationships can be a win-win. And where we lose, we know whoever wins \u2013 win without fight and that\u2019s different that it was a couple of years ago. So I think I would conclude by saying we absolutely believe that there is opportunity to gain share in the space.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. I would just add. I think, certainly, as you think about these dental service organizations, we obviously see that as a continued growth opportunity for us. And certainly, these large customers have a different set of expectations oftentimes in terms of what their business models are or how they need to be supported by their business partners. So I think we need to continue to think about our value proposition and how we can best serve these \u2013 this part of the marketplace, and that will certainly be a focus for us going forward.","Robert Jones","Great. Thanks for all the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Kevin, your line is open.","Kevin Ellich","Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Mark, I want to welcome you and I look forward to hearing more about your strategic vision as that 90-day plan comes together. I guess, just continuing on with Dental, and in the press release you talked about expanding the sales force headcount. Just wondering what we should expect and how much is baked into the guidance, if you could help quantify that for us?","Ann Gugino","Yes. So we won\u2019t discreetly quantify exactly how much is baked into the guidance. What I would say is it\u2019s definitely included in the guidance range that we provided. So we have factored that in. And at the end of last quarter, we stated our intention to make targeted supplemental investments in the sales force, we made solid progress this quarter. We\u2019ve actually added 90 new reps in the last 90 days, but clearly there\u2019s more work to do around here in terms of adding additional headcount and then getting those new reps productive.","Kevin Ellich","And I guess before I move on to the Animal Health question I have, how long does, I think, we take \u2013 can you remind us how long it takes for them to become productive? What the ramp is?","Ann Gugino","About 6 to 9 months.","Kevin Ellich","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, on the Animal Health side, great to see the stable growth in all of the end markets, one that kind of surprised me was you guys called out swine with the veterinary feed directive this year. It seems like swine has kind of been more of a problematic area for some people. Wondering what you\u2019re doing differently and what\u2019s your expectation for swine going forward?","Ann Gugino","So as it relates to the veterinarian feed directive, what that does, at the end of the day, producers have to keep their animals healthy. So what the veterinary feed directive really does is it caused producers to switch from one product to another, so be it a move from a preventative to a more therapeutic product. And so where it\u2019s not impacting us as much and where we tend to be more resilient is we have that broad breadth of product line. So I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing it not impact our results as much. And then, as it relates to our strong performance in swine, we have some unique competitive advantage in this area around biosecurity. We have a deep expertise with the sales force. And so we have done a nice job, the team has done a nice job of winning new business. And we think that, that will continue.","Kevin Ellich","Excellent. Well, I guess, that\u2019s coming at the expense of one of the other big swine distributors. Anyway thanks again and congrats.","Mark Walchirk","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. John your line is open.","Jon Kaufman","Hi good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. Thank you for taking the questions and, Mark, congratulations on your new role. So first actually, first, Mark, a question for you, so you mentioned three areas of focus in the first 90 days, I guess, how do you define success in these areas? And then, thinking longer-term, how do you view your long-term mandate? I guess what are your medium to long-term goals for this business?","Mark Walchirk","Yes thanks Jon for the question. I mean, I think, certainly for me, coming into this business, I have a lot to learn. Obviously, I don\u2019t have a lot of background specifically in the Dental and Animal Health markets that we serve here at Patterson, although certainly a broad range of experience in health care services and distribution. So really, for me, a lot of the next 90 days is about really diving in and learning the business and really focusing on kind of three key areas. I think, first, just doing a complete operational assessment of the business, really understanding the business kind of from the ground up. I would like to say start with a customer and work back. So I will be spending a lot of time in the field, meeting with our customers, our team on the ground, in the branches, in the operational centers, our technology center, etcetera, and really getting their impressions around the business and what\u2019s working and what we need to focus and work on. Obviously, working closely and meeting with our key business partners across the channel from a manufacturer standpoint, etcetera. There\u2019s some key relationships there around business partnerships that we have and so it will be important for me to engage with that team. So really, the first challenge is again just to focus on the core business and really dive in and learn the business, again, kind of from the customer back. I think the second area is, as part of that, to really complete more a broader kind of strategic assessment of kind of where we are, what\u2019s going on in the marketplace, key trends, competitive assessment, our business model, again, what\u2019s what we are doing well, what do we need to focus on, looking at some of the external and internal trends certainly. And then, I think, ultimately, while I wouldn\u2019t expect to have all the answers after the first 90 days certainly, certainly start to have a point of view and really think and be very clear about where we plan to play and, frankly, how we plan to win. And so that will be the kind of the second piece is really to conduct kind of a strategic assessment. And then finally, this is a very people-focused, a very relationship-oriented business and I want to spend a lot of time engaging with our team, building relationships with our team and really continuing to build on the outstanding culture at Patterson and hopefully bring a little bit of my perspective and approach to that as well. So those will be kind of 3 key areas in the short-term.","And then I think the second part of your question, I guess, is kind of the long-term mandate. And I would tell you, as part of my near-term transition plan, I will have hopefully more or we will have more to say on that certainly in the months ahead, but I would say, at a high level, Jon, the long-term mandate, frankly, is for us to improve our performance and drive results. And that\u2019s really what I, along with our team across the entire organization, that\u2019s going to be our core focus is to improve our performance and drive results.","Jon Kaufman","Okay, that\u2019s great. Kind of switching gears here, I would like to dive a little bit into dental consumables. And I think you mentioned consumables, in the current quarter is a little weaker than expected. So, I guess, how should we think about what the end market looks like versus loss of consumable sales perhaps related to CEREC versus additional contributions from new salespeople?","Ann Gugino","Sure. So we clearly have a number of factors negatively impacting this category in the quarter. You have got the hurricane, which certainly we didn\u2019t anticipate. You have the added risk, as you noted, to the block business given open distribution. We just completed the largest wave of deployment with respect to our ERP implementation. We actually bought 50% of the company up in the last 120 days. And then, as we talked about earlier, we continue to add headcount back into the system. So we are not going to get specific in terms of quantifying those various drivers discreetly, but I would say probably the largest impact continues to be around headcount. And so when we are softer than we expected, it\u2019s just progress on adding headcount and then just some of these interruptions I was referring to. So we continue to make solid progress this quarter and, as I mentioned, we added 90 new reps, but there\u2019s more work to do here. As it relates to the broader market, it\u2019s hard to give you a precise answer. There\u2019s not great data available on consumables and then, of course, we just have a lot of noise in our numbers, but the impression from our team is that the market is stable and we\u2019d say flattish.","Jon Kaufman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Jeff, your line is open.","Jeff Johnson","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Ann, I guess, a couple questions in there I\u2019d like to follow-up on. I know you say you don\u2019t want to break out the specifics on the CEREC Block business, but maybe just talk about we\u2019re 2.5 months into the transition with the open relationship, just stability of your client base, your customer base, either on the consumables side or on just the block business side of the CEREC business, stability you\u2019re seeing there over the first 2.5 months of this change?","Ann Gugino","I would say, as you noted, we\u2019re not going to discreetly talk about it, but I would describe it as stable. Certainly, we anticipated some level of interruption and we have marketing programs in place to compete for that business just like any other highly competitive category, but in general, I would describe it as stable.","Jeff Johnson","Alright. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, as I look at the guidance, takedown rough and tumble numbers, maybe $25 million to $30 million coming out of the operating income assumptions in the second half. The sales rep adds, I could convince myself are $3 million to $5 million, somewhere in there, of added costs. And even if I assume Dental is 10 points worse than I was thinking in the second half, that\u2019s another $10 million or so of EBIT that comes out of my model. I\u2019m trying to bridge the rest of that. It might be another $10 million or so on the takedown. Just wondering, has anything changed in the ERP gating of expenses? You talked about ramping resources there. Wondering if that\u2019s the other part of the bridge that I\u2019m missing or if there\u2019s some other expenses in there that\u2019s outside of just the lower revenue expectations?","Ann Gugino","No, I would say we reached a exciting milestone this quarter with the rollout phase of the next-gen system being complete. So I would \u2013 as we expected, that expense is actually slightly favorable in the quarter and we would still expect that ramp down in the back half of the year, about $3 million to $5 million a quarter. It really is just confined to the Dental business and our outlook on revenue.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. There may be one follow up afterwards. So I can understand that better. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Kedra from Gabelli & Company. Kevin, your line is open.","Kevin Kedra","Great. Thanks for taking questions. Mark, I know you haven\u2019t had a great deal of time to really look into Patterson\u2019s businesses, but you have a lot of experience in health care distribution. One of the issues overhanging not just Patterson, but your former employer and many in the space has been competition from online distributors, most notably Amazon. So maybe curious to get your thoughts on how you see them as a competitor and what a company like Patterson can do to protect your business on the Dental and bedside?","Mark Walchirk","Yes, Kevin, thanks for the question. Look, it\u2019s obviously in the news on a daily basis and certainly would not underestimate Amazon and their capabilities and certainly their interest and likelihood of getting into the health care space in some fashion. It\u2019s still a little bit unclear, I think, where their time and focus is going to be, but obviously they\u2019re in health care. I think the key for us at Patterson is really to think about how we focus on driving and bringing the greatest value for our customers. I think, ultimately, our customers choose their business partners based on a variety of factors and ultimately where they believe they\u2019re generating the greatest value or getting the greatest value, and that value can come in many forms. Certainly, supply chain and economics is one form, but certainly, in the case of our dental and animal health businesses, there is a wide range of programs and services that are offered. Certainly, the technology, equipment, the technical support, practice management software, just to name a few of kind of the value-add services that are provided by Patterson to our customers, I think, play a huge role in helping our customers run their businesses and ultimately, hopefully, help their business to be successful. So I think while we are certainly very aware of how others could enter the space and thinking through our \u2013 the moves that we will make, really our focus is going to be and has been and will continue to be on how we can continue to bring value to our customers so that we have the most compelling value proposition, the most compelling customer experience and can win in the marketplace with that approach.","Kevin Kedra","Great. And if I could just throw one more in to Ann, Animal Health margins, we saw some pressure there a few quarters ago. It seems like there\u2019s a bouncing back. I mean, have we gotten all the way back? And how should we be thinking about the opportunities on those margins going forward?","Ann Gugino","So we are not all the way back, but as you pointed out, we continue to make measurable progress quarter-by-quarter and it\u2019s in a variety of ways. One is improved product mix, which is what you are seeing this quarter. It\u2019s just continuing to drive product mix to our preferred vendor partners. There\u2019s some new products on the marketplace that are helping out. We are performing well on rebates. And then, I think as we think longer term, it\u2019s really reframing those relationships with our vendor partners as the single largest Animal Health platform in the space to really leverage that to improve margin profile over time. So I continue to think and believe that we should get that margin back to 5% the next couple of years.","Kevin Kedra","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi and good morning and thanks for the time here. I had one on CAD\/CAM and one on margins. The first on CAD\/CAM, it\u2019s more of a 10,000 foot view question. If we think about the evolution of that market in the U.S. over the last 2 years, there have been a lot of puts and takes and I think we kind of all understand what those are at high level, but there is this hypothesis, at least I have a hypothesis, that over the last few quarters, there was a market freeze of sorts as there was a lot of confusion in the market. And then, as we got toward the latter stages of 2017 and into 2018, that freeze would lift as some amount of confusion that the customers had given all the transition going on has lifted. Can you give us a sense for how you think about that hypothesis within the context of guidance and maybe even beyond this fiscal year?","Ann Gugino","Yes. So I think you are exactly right in your hypothesis and I think what we are saying with the revised guidance is it\u2019s difficult just to predict the pace and timing when you are going through such a significant change, again, not just with distributors, but with new products coming on the market. And so it\u2019s our belief that all the causes that you just listed are still true. It\u2019s just predicting the curve of how long it will take and so that\u2019s why we felt it was prudent to bring down the back half of the year. And what I would say is we still we feel and I will let Mark comment on this, but deeply convicted that the digital revolution of the dental office will continue and that offering choice as this evolves is important and that we are absolutely making the right decisions for the long-term.","Mark Walchirk","Not a lot to add really other than, Ann, just to reinforce, I think, this is a key part of our value proposition for our customers and will be something that we spend a lot of time and focus on and obviously that I will be diving into to learn as well.","Steve Beuchaw","Right. I appreciate that. But, I mean, given the change to the guidance, it sounds like you probably haven\u2019t seen the change to trajectory on CEREC order flow subsequent to September 1. Is that right?","Ann Gugino","Yes. I mean, I think the big unknown when we are in the quarter last call was what happens when we are actually able to compete for the product? What happens at SIROWORLD? So certainly, as we are looking at and gather additional information post-SIROWORLD and post-open distribution, we thought that those two events would help lift some of the confusion and accelerate some of the customer decision-making. And we are just not seeing that.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And then, my question on the financial side relates actually to working capital. Ann, I wonder, now that you have seen a nice quarter here on free cash flow, if you could just give us an update to your thinking about improvements in working capital over the next year or so as you have gotten a little bit of clarity of what the world looks like as we wrap up ERP? Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Yes. So certainly, to your point, we had some nice cash flow generation this quarter. We are done with the ERP implementation. So we are moving into that enhance and refinement. So we would expect working capital to continue to decline. The biggest improvement you are seeing this year is in the accounts receivable. And while we\u2019ve seen some improvement, I think there\u2019s still more opportunity there. There continues to be an opportunity in inventory. So I look at the numbers and I think there\u2019s still another $100 million that we can get out of working capital over time, but I think that will take us another 12 to 18 months to get fully back to normal.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Erin, your line is open.","Erin Wright","Great. Thanks. I understand its early days, Mark and welcome, but curious how involved, I guess, you were in setting the guidance range for the year? And more broadly, I guess as you step into the role, how should we be thinking about your general thoughts and strategy on capital deployment and what your priorities are there? And Ann, how should we be thinking about share repurchase activity for the balance of the year? Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes, thank you Erin for the question. I think, certainly, I was involved in, obviously, reviewing the results through the first half of the year and involved in thinking through the forecast and the guidance. Obviously, working with the team over the past several weeks as I prepared to come onboard officially starting yesterday, so to answer the first part of your question there. I think, second, with regard to capital allocation, I\u2019ll probably let Ann chime in more specifically. I think certainly that\u2019s something that would be a little premature for me to comment on. I would say that, in general, we want to make sure we have a very aligned approach with our board obviously and with our team to think about capital allocation and, frankly, use that as a means to help drive some of the strategic initiatives and some of the growth initiatives that, ultimately, we believe are going to be key to our success long-term.","Ann Gugino","Sure. And then, Erin, specific to your question on share repurchase, our guidance range implies share repurchases of between $100 million and $200 million and we continue to be on pace to do that. Clearly in the shorter-term, given market conditions and where our overall cash and leverage, that we could choose to opportunistically increase the buyback. We just need to make sure we balance that with the underlying performance of the business and then the working capital needs we have in the near-term. And I think as Mark mentioned, going forward, as he develops his strategic direction for the company, capital allocation will certainly be an important part of that conversation, so more to come on that piece.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. Excellent. And in Animal Health, you typically go through your annual contract renewals around this time and how are you positioning yourself this year with these sort of conversations as you approach a more consolidated vendor base. And do you anticipate there will be any major shift in either agency versus buy\/sell or access to do products next year that would meaningfully move things on the Animal Health side? Thanks.","Ann Gugino","It\u2019s a little early in the process and a little premature for me to comment and then, obviously for competitive reasons, we\u2019re going to keep that a little closer to the vest, but I would say we are, longer-term, working to reframe the relationships with manufacturers. And certainly, this year, part of the contract negotiation would be to take the first step in that direction, so more to come on that.","Erin Wright","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Hagan from RBC Capital Markets. Steve, your line is open.","Steve Hagan","Hi, good morning. Could we go back to the dental consumables sales? When we look at those sales who is currently supplying these products to your customers? And what will be required from Patterson to win that volume back? Do you think there will be a need to get prices to win some of that volume back?","Ann Gugino","So when you\u2019re looking at the market share, are you asking where it\u2019s leaking? I think that would be to a variety of competitors. And then, I think in terms of winning that back, certainly price is one area, right, to get your foot in the door, but I think there are multiple avenues to win that business back. And we have a very value-added business model approach. So I think a piece of it, frankly, is just getting the reps back in the system and darkening the doorway. As I mentioned, we had about 50% of the company go live on ERP this quarter and that means, in addition to doing their day job, they\u2019re also doing a night job, too. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 what are the things that we can do and the tools that we can put in the hands of the sales force to get them back out competing for business as well as adding more headcount into the system, but I don\u2019t know Mark if...","Mark Walchirk","No. It\u2019s good.","Steve Hagan","And then, just on the dental equipment sales, kind of what are your expectations for the growth of those sales once we get through kind of the near-term impacts of both inventory and the new competitors in the market?","Ann Gugino","It would be our expectation when we get through the transition that just based on the digitization of the dental office and that trend, that this should be a double-digit growing category over time.","Steve Hagan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Sarah, your line is open.","Sarah James","Thank you. I wanted to talk big picture about dental consumables. So across the market, we have seen some pressure, but we have also seen a divergence from the historical correlation to the Consumer Confidence Index. And I am wondering why do you think that is? Is it the influence of insurance benefit design? Or is there some other factor that is going from the divergence from the Consumer Confidence Index?","Ann Gugino","It\u2019s a great question and I think it\u2019s one that we as an industry are wrestling with and contemplating. And there\u2019s quite a few theories out there so it\u2019s hard to give you a precise answer. And then, of course, we have the luxury we have just a lot of additional noise in our numbers. One theory is when you look at the correlation with consumer confidence over that same time, you had real wage growth. And while we have seen unemployment and underemployment come down, we haven\u2019t necessarily seen real wage growth. We are bound at the same level and you have to remember dental care is a discretionary spend. That is a theory to your point there. Other theories in terms of millennials and how often they go see the dentist then but longer term, with the aging population, we think this is a strong and stable market.","Sarah James","That\u2019s helpful. And can you talk a little bit about pricing discipline? So as the online sales market for consumables becomes more competitive, how should we think about Patterson prioritizing margin versus volume when looking at the specific product categories that are more commoditized?","Ann Gugino","Our goal is profitable growth and so I think that is a mix. And it\u2019s hard to make a blanket statement because it depends on the customer segments and the situation. So as we talked about, if we are going in to win back market share, you might become more competitive on price, but as you work people up the value proposition and people really do stick with us because of the value-added services, whether that\u2019s practice management software or technical service, how do you garner enough value to grow your margins over time with the rest of the basket. So certainly, we will need to be competitive on price, but we are going to have to manage that with the cost structure and with the other value-added services to drive profitable growth.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Jon your line is open.","Jon Block","Great, thanks guys for [indiscernible] me and I appreciate it. A couple of questions. First, on consumables, down 4.4%, that\u2019s with an incremental contribution from Heartland. Making that adjustment, I have consumables down around 6% or 7%. And I know you are adding back sales reps when they get up and fully productive, but can you guys just talk about your long-term positioning in the dental consumable market? In other words, we have seen from, I believe, multiple players that specialty consumable growth is well outstripping that of basic consumables. And even when you are new reps are up and fully productive, can you guys grow at market? Or will that be difficult because I do believe you are underrepresented in that specialty subset? And then, I have got a follow-on. Thanks.","Ann Gugino","Sure. So I will see if Mark wants to comment on this, but my initial reaction is it\u2019s how low you define the market. So you are correct that we are underweighted in some of these specialty areas and so I think that will be part of the strategic conversation as Mark evaluates avenues for growth because, clearly, those areas are growing faster. So I think that, that will be something that Mark undertakes as part of his strategic view. As it relates to the markets that we currently play in today and how fast those are growing, when we get back to hold, do I expect that we will win our share and grow market? I do.","Mark Walchirk","I will just add. Certainly, that will certainly be an area that we will take a look at here in the weeks and months ahead. And I would just say, in general, long-term, we obviously want to be have a leading position and be a leading player in the markets and certainly the product categories that are growing and there\u2019s an opportunity for growth. So if there\u2019s opportunities for us to enhance our position in certain segments of the market, that\u2019s certainly something that we will consider.","Jon Block","Great, Mark. That was very helpful. I appreciate that color. And then, just a follow-up just from a sort of a modeling perspective, the operating expense experienced deleverage in fiscal 2Q after what I thought was very good expense control in fiscal 1Q. Was that predominantly driven by these additional 90 dental reps, Ann that you called out? Or is there anything else there? And then, just maybe from a guidance perspective, did that OpEx deleverage sort of persist or last for another 2 to 3 quarters until you lap the rep expense and arguably they get closer to full productivity? Thanks guys.","Ann Gugino","Yes. So it really is deleveraging on the semi-variable and fixed costs with sales. So we get leverage and are able to expand margins very nicely when we have 3 to 4 percentage points of sales growth and then unfortunately, it hits us on the backside when we don\u2019t. So what you\u2019re seeing in the current quarter is we still have great expense control. We\u2019re still driving favorable mix, but it\u2019s really the softer than anticipated sales in Dental that\u2019s really causing that 50 basis point contraction along with the step-up in the ERP expense. So when I look at modeling for the back half of the year, what we would say right now is that we\u2019re looking for margins \u2013 operating margins for the year to be down around 50 to 70 basis points. And so that implies that we\u2019d have a 70 to 80 basis point drop in the back half of the year.","Jon Block","Got it. Thanks.","Mark Walchirk","Well, I think we are going to \u2013 I am sorry go ahead, please.","Operator","Sorry, I\u2019d like now to turn the call over to Mark Walchirk for closing remarks.","Mark Walchirk","Yes. Thank you very much. Sorry to interrupt. Well, thanks everyone for joining us today. I know we are at top of the hour so we will conclude here. As I indicated in the opening, I\u2019m really excited to be onboard and looking forward to hopefully meeting many of you next week out of the Greater New York Dental Meeting and certainly in the interim, wishing all of you and your families a fantastic and happy Thanksgiving. And again, look forward to updating you next quarter. Thanks very much.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16924":["Patterson Cos., Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Patterson Companies' 3Q 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Wright, VP of Investor Relations of Patterson Companies. Please go ahead.","John M. Wright - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies' fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today are Mark Walchirk, Ann Gugino, and Dennis Goedken. After a review of the third quarter by management, we will open up the call to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during this conference call are forward looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors which could cause actual results to materially differ from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material.","In addition, comments about the markets we serve, including growth rates and market shares are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, March 1, 2018. Patterson undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com.","Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for both the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 third quarters. The reconciliation table in our press release, adjusted reported GAAP measures, namely earnings, net income, and earnings per diluted share or the impact of transaction-related costs, deal amortization expenses and integration and business restructuring expenses.","We will also discuss free cash flow which is a non-GAAP measure and the impact of foreign currency. The reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results can be found in this morning's press release. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon Central Time for a period of one week.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Mark Walchirk.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you, John, and welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. The results we reported today clearly did not meet our expectations and fell far short of what we know the business is capable of achieving.","On today's call, I will explain our third quarter results, the outlook for the remainder of the year and the specific actions we're taking to address our current challenges and improve our performance. I'll get into details about the near-term actions we are taking focused on our performance in a moment and Ann will provide details on the quarter later in the call. But first let me start with a few remarks about the key drivers that impacted our Q3 results.","Overall, the main issue facing our business today is execution. In the Dental segment, our results reflect the various transitions we have underway in the business, namely changes in our sales organization, disruptions related to our ERP implementation and the transition to selling an expanded digital equipment portfolio. These factors all contributed to lower revenues and margin compression during the quarter. While we continue to grow in the companion animal segment, our margins were impacted by shifts in product mix and lower year-end rebates for manufacturers.","As a result of these current trends, we are revising our full-year FY 2018 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.65 to $1.70 per diluted share. Clearly, our results fell short of our expectations and we can and must do better. While we are hard at work to improve our performance, we know it will take some time for our actions to take hold. We are focused on addressing these near-term challenges while building a solid foundation for future growth.","As you know, I officially joined Patterson just over 90 days ago and began a deep dive into the business to develop a thorough understanding of our customers and our business model and develop a near-term action plan to accelerate our path to improve growth and profitability. My initial focus over the past 90 days has been to engage with and listen to our customers, employees, manufacturers and other business partners. This time has reinforced my belief in the strength of our market fundamentals, deep customer relationships, broad value proposition and our tremendous potential here at Patterson. But clearly, we must execute more effectively to capitalize on our full potential.","Improving our overall performance starts with understanding the needs of our customers and how we can best support those needs. As I have engaged with our customers over the last 90 days, a few key points are clear. First, our customers choose to work with us because we offer more than just good products at a competitive price. Our comprehensive offering of products, services, systems, technology, equipment and technical support positions us as a valued business partner that can help our customers succeed as they navigate the challenges and changes they face in their own businesses.","Second, our team has a relentless commitment to supporting our customers and continuing to earn our role as a valued business partner. Our teams approach to helping enable our customers' success is resonating and provide a strong platform from which to improve. Finally, despite the strength of our value proposition and our strong customer focus, our core business execution is not meeting our high standards. We need to make it easier to do business with Patterson and improving our execution and the customer experience is our top priority.","During my first 90 days, my review of the business has been focused on execution, strategy and people. I'll come back to strategy and people in a moment, but wanted to spend a few minutes talking about the steps we have underway to improve execution. With a heightened sense of urgency and accountability to drive operational excellence across the company, we are focusing our efforts on three key areas to improve our execution and improve our results. First, improving the customer experience to stabilize and grow the top line. Second, enhancing our operating margins through strategic sourcing, improve mix management and a more efficient cost structure. And third, leveraging our improved profitability, financial discipline and working capital management to drive cash flow.","Let me comment on each of these areas and the actions we are taking to improve. To start, we have built a formal operating model to support needed customer experience improvements. This includes measuring our progress against defined metrics and scorecards to track performance and setting clear expectations for our team. I personally review these metrics with the leadership team on a weekly basis to ensure we hold ourselves accountable for our performance and have the right resources in place to support better outcomes. The goal is simple. We need to make it easier to do business with Patterson and our entire team is focused on serving our customers and meeting the high standards that our customers expect. We have an outstanding team and the most comprehensive solutions in the market, and by focusing on the customer experience and providing the support our teams need, we are confident in our ability to improve expectation and improve our results.","Next, as we work to stabilize and grow the top line, we are also taking steps to improve our margins. Our initiatives are focused on expanding our sourcing capabilities, improving our product mix including private label and ensuring we have the right cost structure in place to support the business. We have organized and aligned our teams around these initiatives and are building detailed work plans to ensure we execute effectively. We're also making sure we leverage the benefits of our common platform to drive effective and efficient execution across the business. While the ERP implementation and transition period are presenting challenges, we are confident that being on a common platform will be a key component of our ability to better execute going forward.","Finally, in addition to the strides we are making to improve the customer experience and enhance our profitability, we are also taking actions around inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. And we are confident this greater financial discipline will help drive improved cash flow. The bottom line is that we are disappointed with our results, but we understand the drivers of our performance and we are taking urgent actions to enhance our execution. I'm confident this set of actions will improve our results and strengthen our foundation for the long-term.","In addition to our pursuit of operational excellence and improved execution, we are also focusing on how we need to position the company for long-term profitable growth and success. We've kicked off our annual strategic planning process including a thorough review of how we plan to position and grow the company. We expect this process to evolve in the coming months and look forward to updating you on our strategic approach at the appropriate time.","And finally, I believe sincerely in the power of our people and our culture. In our customer first service-focused business, a deeply engaged, aligned and committed team is critical to success. We have a tremendous 7,000 member team across the organization and I am proud to be a part of it. I'm pleased with how our team is responding to the challenges we face and the changes we are implementing to meet those challenges head on. We are committed to moving forward with greater urgency and increased emphasis on accountability as we work to improve execution and drive improved performance.","While we clearly have a lot of work to do, I'm very encouraged by the many positive elements I have learned about Patterson and our business and I firmly believe in our ability to leverage these as we move forward. First, there is strength and opportunity within the markets we serve. The Dental market is poised to benefit from positive trends including an aging population and technology innovation and we believe these trends play to our strengths as a full service provider to our Dental customers.","While the results of our Dental segment continue to be impacted by the decision to broaden our portfolio of technology offerings, I want to be clear that I believe the decision to expand our portfolio was the right one. In fact, technology equipment unit trends strengthened during the quarter and for the first time since we decided to broaden our portfolio, the volume of new CAD\/CAM placements surpassed prior year. This upward trend in unit placements reinforces that we made the right strategic decision to adapt to market changes.","In the Animal Health segment, we see continued growth in pet ownership which benefits our companion business and increasing worldwide demand for protein, which will drive long-term demand in our production business. In fact, within our Animal Health segment, our production animal business generated solid growth across species and channels and we continue to benefit from positive and market fundamentals.","Customers are affirming our value proposition and the team is executing their plan. I want to recognize and thank our production Animal Health team for their solid performance so far this year. Based on what I have learned over the past several months, I'm very confident in the long-term potential of the organization. We have a lot of work ahead to realize that potential with the strength of our end-markets, the compelling nature of our value proposition and the commitment of our talented team to supporting our customers provide a strong platform from which we can grow and I am personally excited to be a part of it.","Before I turn the call over to Ann for some more specific details on the quarter, I want to say a few words about the CFO transition plans we announced earlier today. First, I want to sincerely thank Ann for her 18 years of contributions to Patterson and for her financial leadership during a time of significant change and growth for the company. I also want to thank her for her support during my transition and I'm also very appreciative of Ann's willingness to serve as a Special Advisor to the company over the next several months to help support the smooth transition with Dennis Goedken, who will serve as our interim CFO.","We are pleased Dennis has agreed to step into this role while we conduct a search for a permanent successor. Dennis has spent more than 12 years with Patterson including six as Corporate Controller. Earlier in his career, he served as Patterson's Assistant Controller and has been directly involved in internal audit, taking the company public and various divestitures and acquisitions. Dennis currently leads the accounting team and oversees preparation for all SEC filings and certainly is well qualified to be our interim CFO while we search for a permanent replacement. We have retained a leading search firm and the process is underway.","With that, I'd like to again thank Ann and turn it over to her.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. Before I review the financials on the quarter, I want to say that it has been a pleasure to be part of Patterson for the last 18 years and to have had the opportunity to work with all of you. I am committed to work with Mark, Dennis and the rest of the team to ensure a smooth transition.","Our performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflected the factors Mark has described. Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2018 third quarter were $1.4 billion on a reported basis, down 1.6% versus a year ago. When adjusting for currency translation, sales declined 2.7%.","Turning to our margins. Our third quarter consolidated operating margin was 4.3%, a 236 basis point decline versus the prior year quarter. Our margin compression was driven by decreased sales, lower rebates for manufacturers at the calendar year-end as well as shifts in mix compared to the same period last year. We did have an ERP expense benefit in the quarter as well as continued cost control initiatives. However, these savings were not enough to offset the lower sale volume and gross margin compression.","On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $109 million or $1.18 per diluted share compared to $27.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share a year ago. On a reported basis, we reported a net one-time tax benefit of $77.3 million or $0.83 per diluted share related to the recent U.S. tax reform legislation which includes the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities for the new lower federal corporate tax rate. This one-time GAAP benefit also includes the impact of the transition tax and unremitted foreign earnings. Since the company has an April fiscal year-end, the lower corporate rate from the 2017 Tax Act will be phased-in, resulting in an adjusted tax rate of approximately 31% for fiscal 2018. Keep in mind that for the first half of the year, we were recurring at a tax rate of approximately 35%. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 21% reflects the true-up of our year-to-date income before taxes to the new blended effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018.","Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain non-recurring and deal amortization costs and the one-time tax revaluation totaled $39.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, down $15.9 million from the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.43 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $0.58 in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share in the quarter included a $6.3 million or $0.07 per share benefit related to the new U.S. tax legislation.","Now let's turn to our segments. In Dental, the 2018 third quarter sales reflected the continued disruption of our sales force changes, the workflow impact from the implementation of our new ERP system and our transition to selling an expanded digital equipment portfolio. On a reported basis, Dental sales were down 7.7%, and in constant currency, sales decreased 8.1% versus the prior year quarter. On that same basis, Patterson's sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 7.4% during the 2018 third quarter.","Moving on to our dental equipment sales. On a constant currency basis, equipment sales declined 10.6% in the 2018 third quarter. In the CAD\/CAM category, while total sales dollars are down compared to last year given the lower average selling price of the mix, we did experience a meaningful increase in unit placement of CAD\/CAM products year-over-year as we gain traction selling these new digital products in our portfolio. Margins in the Dental segment were impacted by lower rebates for manufacturers at calendar year-end, lost expense leverage and a negative product mix.","Now, turning to our Animal Health segment. On a reported basis, consolidated Animal Health sales grew 4.2% year-over-year. After normalizing for currency and changes in product selling arrangements, total Animal Health segment sales rose 4.6%. Looking at our companion animal business for the third quarter, global companion animal sales were essentially flat after normalizing for the impact of currency and changes in product selling arrangements. On that same basis, our U.S. companion animal sales were also flat for the quarter.","Rest of companion animal sales slowed in the period primarily due to promotional timing compared to a year ago. Production animal sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 grew 8.8% in constant currency versus the year ago period. Our overall performance in the production animal segment reflects strong top line sales and share gains within the swine and beef cattle species of our business. End-markets in the production animal space continued to be favorable for swine and beef cattle with some continued pressure in the dairy part of the business from milk pricing. While the Animal Health business posted gross margin improvement during the first half of the year, gross margins in the third quarter faced near-term pressure from a less profitable sales mix and fewer rebates compared to a year ago. Operating expenses reflected some spending discipline and yielded a 30-basis point year-over-year improvement. However, operating margins in the quarter were down 114 basis points over the prior year period.","Now, I will conclude with a look at several key balance sheet and cash flow items. On a year-to-date basis through the first nine months of fiscal 2018, we've generated $40 million of operating cash flow compared to the use of $13 million through the first nine months of last year, yielding a net improvement of $53 million over last year. As Mark mentioned, working capital continues to be impacted by the implementation of our ERP system. Our goal is to stabilize and enhance our processes to further reduce our investments in working capital and this will certainly be a key component of the fiscal 2019 operating plan. Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 21%, reflecting the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation. For the 2018 fiscal year, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 31%.","Moving to our capital allocation strategy. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we returned nearly $38 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. That brings the total for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 to $162 million. Given our performance through the first nine months, we have revised our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018.","We now expect GAAP earnings to be in the range of $2.13 to $2.18 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70 per diluted share. Our adjusted earnings guidance excludes the after-tax impact of deal amortization expenses of $26.9 million or $0.29 per diluted share; integration and business restructuring expenses of approximately $5.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share as well as a provisional net tax benefit related to the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $77.3 million or $0.83 per diluted share.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Ann. I expect you may have some questions regarding the FTC's administrative complaints. Let me briefly comment on that before I conclude, and Ann and I will open the call up to take your questions. As we announced, Patterson believes the allegations are meritless and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves. There are a few items we'd like to highlight regarding this matter. First, we operate in a market with an extremely competitive dynamic among peers and competitive prices. Second, Patterson always has and always will act unilaterally and independently on all competitive matters. And finally, we do not anticipate this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It's also important to note that the complaint seeks injunctive relief and does not seek monetary damages.","While we take this matter seriously, we will not allow this complaint to take any attention away from our business. The entire Patterson team remains squarely focused on improving our execution and improving our performance. While we have a lot of work ahead, there is tremendous opportunity at Patterson and my early days with the company have reinforced my confidence in our strong position for the future. We are implementing the necessary changes across the organization to drive better execution which will improve our results and strengthen our foundation for the long-term.","With that, we'd like to open the line so that Ann and I can take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Your line is open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, thank you very much. Mark, I think one of the things you mentioned in your remarks was sourcing initiatives and private label, can you just talk a little bit more about that? My perception is that was really not part of Patterson's strategy historically that would certainly make sense. What sort of investment and infrastructure changes is it going to take for you to implement that change?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah, John, thank you. I think first of all, the first step we took is that that part of the organization is now reporting directly to me. And certainly, I believe there's an opportunity to really build out a strategic sourcing team. We'll certainly invest in that team and also the technology tools to help advance our initiatives there. We have certainly a broad private label offering today but we have an opportunity to improve our penetration of private label products in our existing accounts and also to expand our portfolio of private label products, and so we're aggressively pursuing that initiative as well. And certainly as we continue to build out those initiatives, ensuring that we have good alignment around our incentive structure with our field teams and sales organizations will be an important element to executing against that. So I believe that we have a real opportunity to build out a top-flight sourcing team and this will need to be a key part of our ability to improve execution in our results over time.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. And then one other thing, can you just talk about the corporate account initiatives that Patterson has had over the last couple of years, how is that doing and are you satisfied with the profits that that's yielding?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well, I think it's certainly an area that we've put more focus in. I've had an opportunity to meet with several of our larger DSO customers and also both on the Dental side and certainly some of the corporate accounts, national accounts on the vet side, and I think this is an opportunity for growth for us as well. Certainly, the expectations that those large national accounts have are very high and we need to ensure that our customer experience is meeting those high standards and we also believe that we can bring some valuable business support to those types of customers as well. So that certainly is an opportunity for us to continue to grow, the expectations of that marketplace are very high. But clearly, there's continued shift in the markets we serve to more national accounts and we need to make sure that we have a strong position there.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe two questions, the first one, is the magnitude of the margin compression was certainly surprising, the top line was largely in line so maybe a two-fold, one, Ann, is there a new Animal Health margin to think of? Previously you used to allude to sort of that 5% bogey a couple of years out, but we obviously took a step back in the current quarter. And then if we shift over to Dental, can we see Dental op margins rebound in fiscal 2019. I'm really not asking for guidance per se, but when I think about Dental op margins, the ERP expense should begin to incrementally subside next year, and then Mark, I'm guessing a lot of the reps that you're onboarding should also start to turn, I don't know, profitable, but at least contributing to the top line and then I got a quicker follow-up. Thanks guys.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. So, yeah, clearly the surprise in the quarter, and to your point, we were largely in line with the top line but it was really the margin compression, particularly in gross margins and as you look at the Animal Health business, that really was more tied up in some product mix challenges in the current quarter that then impacted our ability to hit certain year-end rebates, so we really feel like that's more of a temporary issue and when you look to the Q4 and FY 2019, we expect the margins to rebound to what we've seen earlier in the year, to say, that 3.5% to 4%, that's kind of the story with Animal Health.","I think the other thing that you'll notice is we did have an increase in the corporate loss, which is really tied to our equipment financing portfolio and that's really attributed to an increase in interest rates. We saw about a 10% increase in the forward rate curve in the last 90 days and then that, coupled with the lower equipment sales, definitely had an impact at our gross margin and while that's tied with Dental, I think the additional challenges that we had in Dental in the quarter are similar to Animal Health that was really more around product mix and year-end rebate. So I think as we think about long-term, I'll turn that over to Mark to talk more about the long-term margin profile.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think it comes back a little bit Jon to the first question, which is we need to improve our capabilities and our execution on the buy side and that can certainly help stabilize and enhance the margins over time. I think product mix is a big component of that as well and also making sure that the incentives are aligned with our field sales organization to really focus on those products that drive improved profitability for us and to making sure that the organization is very aligned around selling the products that again are important for us to sell that obviously meet our customers' needs but that also improve our overall mix and certainly continuing to ensure we have a cost structure that fits appropriately within the sales, and profitability of the businesses is crucial and while that obviously doesn't affect gross margins directly, it certainly would have an effect on our operating margins over time as well.","So those are the things that we're focused on and again while obviously the ERP transition has been very disruptive and has presented a variety of challenges for us, certainly being on a common platform going forward and \u2013 once we really stabilize the situation there and then be able to use the common platform to help execute against these initiatives around customer segmentation, mix management, field sales execution, again, I think there is a variety of initiatives that we're focused on to help drive the margins over time.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, maybe just a quicker, tighter follow-up question just on the consumable trends specific to Dental, continues to struggle a little bit and there are some moving parts where arguably now you've lapped the Heartland contribution, can you maybe comment to the moving parts of bringing sales reps on, lapping Heartland and of course the block business from CEREC is clearly more competitive today versus what was the case 12 months ago? Thanks, guys.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I'll touch on that, Ann certainly can join me. I think the results in our consumables product segment and the trends there I think are primarily a result of the various disruptions that we've obviously seen over the course of the transitions that the company is going through that we've referenced. We are continuing to invest in our sales organization, we continue to add new sales reps, we continue to add new equipment specialists and we're also putting in place a very formal methodology to kind of assess the productivity of new sales reps and make sure that they have the tools and training necessary to get up to speed quickly and to begin to be productive. And so I think those are going to be key elements executing well there to really stabilizing and ultimately obviously growing our consumables business. I'm not sure if you have anything specific to add around that or CEREC in particular?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","No, I think you touched on, I mean, there is clearly a number of factors negatively impacting the category. So you touched on the added risk to the block business given open distribution, we've got the disruption from ERP and then Mark touched on the head count. I would say, while we're not going to quantify those items discreetly, clearly the head count is having a large impact on that number.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first off, Ann, it's been great working with you. I'm sure our paths will cross again. Talking about Animal Health (33:12), you guys have seen some really good growth in the production animal business, wondering if you're seeing any turn in the dairy market yet? And then on top of that, Ann, you made a comment about missing some year-end targets for rebates, wondering if you could give a little bit more color behind that? Is that really demand for certain products subsiding or is it a certain product category, any color would be helpful. Thanks.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Kevin. So, when you look at the production animal sales up 9%, clearly optimum growth for that segment and it really came more out of that where we saw a small rebound in dairy, it really did come more out of the wine and beef market. So I would say that we still kind of continue to have a flattish to down dairy market. But where we're seeing a brighter spot in terms of the outlook in the trend is really in the beef and pork market.","As it relates to the rebates, I think the additional color that I would give you is it's more about mix and shifts in mix and aligning that, as Mark alluded, with compensation plans that we're hitting the rebate target. So we just \u2013 it's more about mix than it is particular vendors or product category.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Great. And then going back to dental consumable weakness that you've seen, you've given a lot of good color. Just wondering if you're seeing any additional pressure from the online sellers like Amazon and if that's having any impact on your consumable growth? Thanks.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","No. Yeah, thank you. I think, generally, it's a very competitive market for sure. I don't think we're seeing necessarily added pressure there. I think certainly there's pressure and there's the dynamics going on in the segment. Certainly, I think our ability to improve the customer experience and really improve our core data. Business execution is going to be the key driver of stabilizing and growing our consumables business over time. And certainly, we'll need to continue to compete in a competitive environment. Our focus is really on providing a complete value proposition for our customers and this idea we certainly want to be more than a supply partner, we want to be a business partner. And so we believe that our broad value propositions, services, technical support, broad equipment portfolio, software technology, et cetera, is really key to having a competitive value proposition that can win in the market. And certainly as we can improve our execution on the core, a day-to-day business, we believe that, that will stabilize the consumables business for us.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ann, I wish you all the best luck in the future. And Mark, maybe starting with you, just \u2013 if I look at kind of the last few quarters, your dental consumables growth had been trending kind of down 3% to 4% or maybe closer to 4%, the 300 basis points kind of sequential fall off to 7% \u2013 a little north of 7% this quarter, that represents about $10 million in absolute dollars.","Ann, I respect that you said you don't want to be specific on certain things, but maybe just that incremental $10 million fall off, can you help us understand how much of that might have been a downshift in the market, if at all, how much might be loss of the CEREC consumables versus how much might be just kind of your continued internal issues? If you could help us bucket in that way or any other way that I think would be helpful.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah, sure. So I would say it's really more of our internal issues than it is. We haven't seen much of a change in the end-market. As Jonathan alluded, we did have the Heartland contract annualizing which was adding some growth, but I would say again it's more around head count and adding those reps back into the system and more of kind of the internal headwinds we have with ERP than it is anything we're seeing in the market or in the block category in particular.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you. And then two clarifying questions, I guess, one you talk about CAD\/CAM being up for the first time in a while. It sounds like you're now including DI in there and we've heard some good initial feedback on some 3Shape sales and all that, but can you talk at all about kind of the core CAD\/CAM, the CEREC or at least high-end premium CAD\/CAM versus the DI business, how those two trended in the quarter, if at all?","And then secondly on the interest rate move and the $10 million incremental loss on the corporate costs are on the corporate profit side that you tied together, I just want to make sure I understand is that going to continue going forward then because your fourth quarter implied guidance would seem to imply another margin down in the 3% to 4% all-in range, so it doesn't sound like necessarily that equipment change on the profitability of the contracts is going to abate after this quarter?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I'll take that one first and then I think Mark can address the other question. But, yeah, that's right, Jeff. When you look at the increase in the interest rates and the challenge that we had in the equipment portfolio, we are expecting that to continue into this quarter.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I'll just jump back to the first part of your question and certainly wouldn't comment specifically on specific product lines or specific manufacturers, but I do think we believe that the market continues to evolve. There's technology innovation obviously broadening our equipment technology portfolio. I think it was an important decision for the company and I think we're seeing some early favorability just in terms of our overall unit placements. At the same time, we still remain very focused on the CEREC product as well. I've had an opportunity to connect several times with Don Casey, the new CEO, and our teams have been meeting to build action plans to continue to focus on that product. So what I would tell you is we broadened our portfolio across digital technology and equipment and we're focusing actively with all of the products in that portfolio and continue to work closely with the manufacturers to develop our funnels, build action plans, put promotional activities in place in the field. This obviously is a big focus for us to drive that portfolio of products.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to unpack the sales force turnover. Was this a loss of a few key sales people or was it more broad-based than we should think about it more as the scale of sales exit?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well, I'll maybe comment and then Ann can provide perhaps a little bit of context. I mean, I think the original kind of reorganization of the sales force took place quite some time ago. I think since then we've had a fair amount of disruption as a result and while we continue to reinvest in the sales organization both with new territory reps, new equipment specialists, we do see some continued turnover amongst our reps which is normal in the business that we're in. So I wouldn't say that there was a specific event that occurred during the quarter, but certainly an issue that has been a disruption for some time and our focus now is to, first of all, make sure we have the right people and the right number of people in front of our customers, both from a Territory standpoint as well as from an Equipment Specialist standpoint to make sure that that team has the right tools to help them be productive and also to ensure that we're delivering an outstanding customer experience to help them be successful in the day-to-day operational elements of working with our customers. And we believe that improving in those areas can help drive improved performance. I'm not sure if you want to provide any additional color to it?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","No. I would just add to what Mark said, it wasn't an event in the current quarter. It's more, as Mark said, it's kind of the disruption that's been in the past and that our ability to get the new folks that are on board productive and up to speed.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And can you talk about the recruiting environment, are you finding the type of experienced talent with existing client relationships that you need or is this more about training up new sales people sort of starting early on in their career?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","No, I think it's a combination. I've had an opportunity to engage with, I think, three of our new sales rep training classes over the past 90 days and I think it's a really good mix of folks that have existing sales experience; some in the markets that we're in, some in other markets that are really fired up to be part of the Patterson team. And we're obviously investing heavily in the tools to help make them productive, the training to get them up to speed quickly and we're certainly very focused on a methodology to kind of measure that productivity and make sure that our sales team are meeting the expectations that we have of them and that we're obviously delivering on the expectations they have of training and tools and education. So I'm very pleased with the profile of the types of individuals that we're bringing on. It's been exciting to engage with them directly and proud of our team and the experiences that they bring.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. What's embedded in guidance at this point as it relates to the new initiatives, I guess following your 90-day review or will those cost, I guess, associated with those initiatives start more in fiscal 2019 and anything you can quantify at this early juncture? Thanks.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Erin. Obviously, given our guidance for the rest of the year and really for Q4, I mean certainly we're seeing and we expect some of the challenges and the negative trends to continue, and that's obviously reflected in our expectations. We are taking urgent action, many of which have been taken, others of which are in the process of being taken and we expect that to really be our sole focus here in the coming months. And we're not in a position today to provide guidance around FY 2019; certainly we'll do that on our Q4 call in June. And certainly would be in a position to lay out more specifically the additional actions that we're taking and to the extent appropriate quantify what we expect to deliver from those actions.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And then I think there may have been some churn amongst GPO relationship on the Animal Health side, does that have a material impact on your business near-term and can you speak to the nature of the types of relationships you do have in Animal Health on the GPO side, and I guess, are many of them exclusive relationships? Thanks.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well, without commenting specifically on our exact customer relationships and the nature, I think there was one group in that part of the business that we, I think, communicated previously. We've actually been really pleased with our ability to hold on to the business there. We're obviously engaging directly with those customers. And so we don't anticipate that that's having or will have a material effect on our business there.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Kedra from Gabelli. Your line is open.","Kevin Kedra - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Ann, I want to extend my best wishes to you. I had a couple of questions for you and then maybe a follow-up. First on tax rate, how should we be thinking about that going forward? It sounds like based on the blended rate for this fiscal year, you're guiding \u2013 not guiding, but certainly puts you at a go-forward rate in kind of the low 20% rate and so how should we think about that? And then can you give any clarity between \u2013 the breakdown between performance of basic equipment versus tech?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. So if you think about the blended tax rates of 31% for the current year, that's basically three quarters of the year at the higher 35% rate and then our go-forward rate will actually be closer to the 24% to 27%, so that's what we're looking for, for FY 2019 and beyond. At this point, obviously, many of the rules are still provisional but we're thinking in that range of 24% to 27%. As it relates to the equipment, we mentioned that we were down around 10% to 11% and I would say it was down that similar range across all product categories, both basic and technology.","Kevin Kedra - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Great. And then Mark maybe kind of more broad question, I know you've only been at the helm for about 90 days or so, but clearly the stocks rained down about 8-plus year lows. You've got two businesses, Dental and Animal Health. One perform \u2013 Dental clearly had some struggles that you're working on; Animal Health seems to be more stable and performing well and some of the issues there are more short-term. At what point do you consider potential strategic alternatives giving that you have two separate businesses that seem to be going in different directions?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well, certainly we're focused on improving execution across the company and certainly across both those businesses and we do believe that there's an opportunity to support both of those businesses with improved execution. Obviously, we're committed to delivering long-term shareholder value and we think about those businesses, both in terms of the unique markets that they're in and the unique strategies they need to employ and the unique value propositions that they need to deliver. But also how they do tie together and we believe many of the steps that we're taking here to improve execution around our core business processes, around strategic sourcing to private label, around our cost structure and around the financial discipline metrics, that those initiatives can support and improve the performance in both businesses. So certainly we're pleased with the markets that we're in and the end-market fundamentals that are taking place in those segments and we're continuing to focus on driving results for both our segments.","Kevin Kedra - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Just a clarification on the new guidance range. I understand that the moving pieces that you guys laid out, but just based on what the guidance implies for 4Q, it seems like the margin pressures that you guys saw in the third quarter are expected to accelerate a little bit end of the fourth quarter. So, could you just help us better understand kind of what specific areas you think could get a little bit worse in 4Q and maybe some of the steps you're taking to address those in the quarter? Thank you.","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Sure. I'll start and then Mark can chime in. I think we talked about \u2013 the first thing I would point out is Q4 is our largest volume quarter and its year-end. So, just part of the year-end process, we're doing physical inventories and true-up. And so there's just inherently more risk in the quarter given the volume and the fact that it's year-end. And then you kind of couple that with the trends that we're seeing. Certainly, as Mark mentioned, we're urgently putting action plans in place, but it will take some time to speed those in the results. And so that would be how I would kind of start out.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think just to reinforce that, I mean certainly we're seeing some challenging trends in the business obviously and that's reflected in our results. We're taking actions to address those, but those actions aren't going to take hold overnight. And so, we expect to see some of the continued trends that we're facing and the challenges in our business that we've outlined here today continue on in Q4.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And Mark, just a quick follow-up if I could. Just on your comments on the sales force. I mean, this obviously is a core competency for the company and it seems like an area where you're going to be investing. I guess my question is do you need to maybe do a broader sales force reorg, to bring on either more head count or more specialists to better service customers. I'm just a bit curious to get your thoughts on how you think the sales force should look like going forward?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Nathan I think we are investing in more Territory reps, more Equipment Specialists, and I don't think we have a magic number necessarily but we're going to continue to invest and make sure that we have the right folks on the ground and as the markets continue to evolve, we'll continue to evolve our sales force to best support our customers. Certainly, we're not considering any type of sales force reorganization. Our focus is on investing in our sales team, giving them the tools to help improve their productivity, making sure their incentive structure is aligned with the key focus areas of the company and frankly ensuring that we improve our execution around the customer experience so that they can be focused on and working with our customers and talking about our value proposition.","So that is a core competency here at Patterson \u2013 the sales reps and our field teams play a crucial role in our success and we're going to continue to invest there and make sure that they continue to help drive performance.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","And your next question comes from Stephen Hagan from RBC. Your line is open.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, good morning. I just want to follow up on the question we just had about the expectations for Q4. Some of your comments before communicated Animal Health had some one-time items in this quarter, so what really gets worse in Q4 and offsets? What we should be a bit of a benefit there?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So I think it's just more on the Dental side, and some of the items that we talked about, so certainly, yes, we think that the Animal Health Q3 is more of an anomaly. We expect Q4 to sequentially improve and be more in line. So the two things that I would point to is kind of the continued uncertainty with interest rates and the impacts on the equipment financing portfolio at corporate as well as some of the headwinds. I mean, the Dental business clearly, just inherently based on the results from the current quarter, there's more risk in that business than there was 90 days ago, and so I think we've put guidance together that we think it's prudent based on that information.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, just on the dental equipment, the comps seemed to get easier in Q4. You're probably getting closer to the end of the disruption related to the digital equipment, should we see a better year-over-year trend for that line in Q4 or does the kind of interest rate environment still make it challenging?","Ann B. Gugino - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We don't necessarily give revenue guidance or guidance by specific categories. But I would say if you look at the current quarter, you're definitely seeing we're still down in the current quarter, but we're definitely seeing an improvement in the trends. And I would just keep in mind as we're making progress in the digital product categories they do have a lower average selling price, so it's just going to take some time to annualize that in.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","And I would also just add, I do think with just the changes in the portfolio, I think some new product development and introductions that are taking place, I do think our customers are still thinking through what their options are in terms of these products. And so, I do think that that also has contributed to some of the softness in this area.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your final question for today will come from Michael Minchak from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So you mentioned private label is an opportunity to drive margin expansion. I was just wondering if you could talk about so where you currently stand with respect to private label penetration in the Dental business and where you think that could potentially go over time, whether there's any issues with the your larger-branded suppliers as you look to grow that private label category? And then, maybe if you could just give us a sense for how the margins on those products compare to branded products?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well, without getting into specifics, we're not where we need to be from a penetration standpoint. We have, certainly, I think a fair amount of opportunity and upside to get to penetration rates that we believe would be appropriate for these types of products. We also have an opportunity to expand our portfolio, so obviously multiple ways to grow private label and we're focused on both. Obviously, expanding the portfolio takes more time than improving penetration with the existing portfolio that we have.","I think in terms of implications with our supplier partners, obviously private label is an important part of our portfolio. We work with many of our suppliers actually on private label and we look forward to continuing to work closely with our suppliers to ensure that we have a very competitive cost position, both across our private label products as well as our branded products. And we think about the portfolio comprehensively and we need to ensure that we have the market-leading cost position going forward.","And certainly a good mix of both private brand and brand products will be important to that. So that will be a big focus for us and I would just again reiterate critical to success for that type of initiative is to make sure that your incentive structure is aligned, because all of these sales \u2013 the sales reps and the relationships that they have and the importance of that that I just referred to, is a critical element to executing against that initiative as well.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then maybe just to go back to the dental consumable side. Obviously, a couple of company-specific factors are sort of driving the recent trend there. I'm sorry if I missed this early in the call, but can you give us any color in terms of your thoughts on the underlying market growth, are we still seeing sort of flattish but stable trends there? Any updated thoughts on sort of what might be driving the sustained weakness that we've been seeing there?","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Well, I think our view of the market, I think, is reasonably stable. I think probably flat to very slight low single-digit growth. I think that kind of continues to evolve but I think we certainly believe that it's reasonably stable.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate the comments.","Mark S. Walchirk - Patterson Cos., Inc.","Thank you. Well, thank you again for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again in June as we close out our fiscal year with our Q4 results and provide our guidance for FY 2019.

While total Patterson Companies sales in fiscal 2014 first quarter declined 1% on a year-over-year basis, we remain confident in our full year outlook for reasons that Steve and I will discuss in a moment.","First, let me recap our operational performance in the first quarter. Patterson Dental, which accounts for about 2\/3 of our total business, reported fiscal 2014 first quarter sales of $554.2 million, down approximately","2% from prior year period. Contributing to revenues in this segment was a more than 3% rise in sales of consumable of dental supplies versus a year ago. This is encouraging, as increased consumables sales typically signal that underlying market conditions are strengthening.","As we anticipated, however, versus a year ago, we had a tough first quarter comparison in dental equipment. The shortfall was primarily due to last year's exceptionally strong customer trade-up program from the CEREC Redcam to the Bluecam technology platform, which helped lift total equipment sales in the prior year by nearly 20%.","Sales of the new CEREC Omnicam, which was introduced in fiscal 2013, continue to meet expectations. Overall, the CEREC pipeline is strong, and we are off to a good start for the year. We remain confident in the growth prospects for our dental equipment sales this fiscal year.","Since the economic downturn, dentists have remained cautious about expanding and upgrading their basic practice infrastructure, which includes chairs, units and cabinetry. We believe that there is a considerable pent-up demand for these investments in their businesses. Patterson is the proven leader in the dental equipment market. We offer the best-in-class technology and basic equipment, coupled with unrivaled after-sales support. The growth opportunities from our technology offerings position us well as dentistry migrates to a digital platform. And as the dental market continues to gain momentum to historical growth levels, we expect to benefit from strong equipment sales for the remainder of this year and into the next decade.","Against this backdrop, I wanted to mention Patterson Dental's acquisition of Mercer Mastery. This transition -- transaction closed just after the first quarter end on July 31. Although the acquisition is not financially material to Patterson, it is strategically important in that we gained Mercer's proprietary OnTrack dental practice performance software system.","OnTrack is a business intelligence system that allows dentists to choose growth targets for their practices and then create a business plan to achieve those goals. The OnTrack system can easily be integrated into multiple practice management software platforms, and it expands our industry-leading software offerings for dental practices and generate additional revenue opportunities in the longer term.","Other developments during the quarter in dental included the creation of a Special Markets Division that is dedicated to growth by focusing solely on our large practice and institutional customers, delivering world-class logistics as well as equipment technology and service.","We also are excited about the CAD\/CAM for Everyone program, where, in conjunction with our partner, Sirona, we are making this technology available to meet a full range of dental practice needs and help improve patient care. The program provides dentists with multiple entry points with products that are best in class in every category of CAD\/CAM technology.","Let's now turn to Patterson Veterinary, which is responsible for approximately 1\/4 of total sales. First quarter fiscal 2014 sales for this unit increased by nearly 5% to $200 million. Contributing to the gain was a nearly 4% increase in consumables sales, such as medications and supplies. We also had double-digit growth in the equipment and software categories, which included the sales of our first 3D imaging device for animals. We are excited to offer this technology, which provides faster results than MRI or CAT scans, and can help improve veterinary diagnosis. We believe that the strong performance across all of our veterinary equipment lines is an early indicator that our strategy to enhance our infrastructure and become a national technical service provider is working. Patterson Veterinary continues to build their business platform in North America and internationally.","To this end, during the fiscal 2014 first quarter, we announced an important acquisition, National Veterinary Services Limited, NVS, which was part of Dechra Pharmaceuticals. NVS is the largest veterinary distributor in the United Kingdom. The transaction closed earlier this month, and with NVS, pro forma consolidated sales for Patterson Veterinary would have surpassed $1 billion in fiscal 2013. This acquisition is expected to enhance shareholder value and be accretive to earnings by $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. NVS offers an exceptional platform to extend Patterson's strategies into new geographic markets. We remain focused on building our value-added model in the veterinary market by increasing both our equipment and technical service offerings and by taking advantage of the favorable marketplace dynamics as consumers continue to increase the amount they spend on veterinary care for their pets. To that end, Patterson Veterinary has increased its sales rep count from 234 to 255 over the past year and its technical service staff from 14 to 32.","Looking now at our Medical business. Sales for Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation, supply and equipment unit, were down approximately 4% from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting ongoing weak international conditions. As anticipated, sales in North America continued to stabilize and showed modest growth. Patterson Medical represents approximately 14% of total company sales.","As you saw earlier this month, we announced the hiring of Michael Orscheln as President of Patterson Medical. Mike brings 32 years of leadership experience in health care and medical distribution companies and a proven record of success. Mike will focus his talents on leading Patterson Medical and building our value-added platform.","While we expect the current market conditions to persist for the short term, we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business. Patterson Medical has attractive operating margins, a talented team and our industry-leading product and service offerings.","Also, as announced in our press release this morning, Patterson will take a restructuring charge related to the divestiture of certain assets in our European medical business. Steve will review this in more detail in a few minutes, but let me make it clear that this is part of our strategy, and we believe that it will benefit our growth in those markets over the long term. By divesting these noncore product lines, we can lower the operating expense levels of our European medical distribution operations and enhance our strategic focus in Europe.","Next, as we previously discussed, we began expanding our investment in information technology in order to support the company's strategic growth initiatives, further enhance the customer experience and secure future productivity gains. As we outlined last quarter, Patterson's total information technology investment over the next 5 years is estimated at $55 million to $65 million. While approximately half of this amount will be capitalized and amortized, we anticipate spending an incremental $10 million on this key effort in fiscal 2014. The financial impact in this year's first quarter from the information technology investments was approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Already, we are beginning to achieve greater efficiency, and we anticipate further productivity gains. Our progress to date includes making substantial enhancements to our dental and veterinary websites to provide best-in-class search capabilities on our product portfolio that make it easier for customers to research and order for their practice needs.","Also, company wide, we are rolling out a new sales tool called PattEdge that quickly and concisely puts more market and customer information into the hands of our sales reps to continue to enhance our already strong customer service offering. We believe our information technology investment is critical to providing Patterson with the flexibility to adjust our platforms as opportunities warrant and create long-term shareholder value. Going forward, Patterson Companies has strong cash generation capabilities and a flexible balance sheet so we can take advantage of opportunistic acquisitions to augment our organic growth initiatives. Acquisitions remain a key component of our comprehensive capital allocation strategy, which also includes internal investments, dividend growth and share repurchases.","Before I ask Steve to cover the financials, let me reiterate what I noted at the outset of this call. We remain confident about our growth prospects for the remainder of Patterson's fiscal year and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Thanks, Scott. During this year's first quarter, as noted, we saw increased dental consumables sales up more than 3%. However, that growth was not sufficient to overcome the impact of the highly successful prior year CEREC trade-up program. Importantly, we believe that strengthening results in the consumables category are a leading indicator to improving market conditions, and we believe that growth in equipment sales will follow.","During the quarter, we saw minimal impact from foreign exchange fluctuations on sales growth. We experienced a 10-basis-point year-over-year decline in our consolidated gross margin to 32%. As we expected, the reduced promotional activity in the CEREC category compared to last year increased dental margins 100 basis points. Offsetting this improvement was the mix impact between the 3 segments and a reduction in the contribution from equipment financing. The financing decline was due to the quantity of contract sales and an increase on the long end of the yield curve this quarter.","Quarter-over-quarter, operating expenses declined approximately $3 million on an absolute basis and were flat with the prior year as a percentage of net sales. Fiscal first quarter 2014 operating expenses did include approximately $700,000 for acquisition-related expenses and approximately $2.2 million pretax for the previously mentioned planned information technology investments.","By segment, our first quarter operating margins were 10% for dental, 4.5% for veterinary and 13.3% for medical. Please note that the information technology investments were accounted for in the dental segment. Net of these expenses, dental operating margin would have been 10.4%.","Incrementally, the veterinary segment expense structure includes the cost from the increase in sales and technical service personnel that Scott mentioned earlier.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 36.4%, a 90-basis-point increase from the prior year due to the previously discussed onetime tax benefit that we had in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Our DSO stands at 42 days for the first quarter, down from 43 days in the prior year period, while inventory turns are 6.8 compared to 6.9 1 year ago.","Our cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $21 million compared to $60 million in the year-ago period. Impacting the year-over-year working capital levels was an unusually low level of CEREC units during the majority of fiscal 2013, which we have been rebuilding. The timing and magnitude of income tax and accounts payable disbursements also negatively impacted operating cash flow in the quarter, but we anticipate this will dissipate as we move through the fiscal year.","During the quarter, we returned more than $50 million to our shareholders. And a quick note of clarification on that: our March and June dividend declarations were both paid in the first quarter since the March dividends payment date was set for April 30, which was after the fourth quarter closed.","We drew $135 million on our revolving credit line for the NVS acquisition to take advantage of short-term interest rates, and we will arrange permanent financing for the acquisition during the next year.","Our CapEx in the first quarter was -- mainly consisted of regular ongoing expenditures in addition to planned investments in information technology. During the first fiscal quarter under our share buyback authorization, Patterson repurchased approximately 500,000 shares. Approximately 2.3 -- I'm sorry, 23.9 million shares remain available for repurchase under our current authorization. We will continue to make open market purchases as part of our capital allocation strategy that we have outlined.","Before I turn the call back to Scott for some closing comments, let me detail our guidance for fiscal 2014 and the restructuring charge for our medical business that we anticipate taking starting in the second quarter.","In this morning's release, we announced that Patterson plans to divest of several noncore product lines in our medical segment. As a result, Patterson anticipates incurring a pretax charge in the range of $15 million to $17 million, or approximately $0.12 per diluted share, the majority of which will be taken in the fiscal second quarter. Of the $15 million to $17 million, approximately $14 million to $15 million will be noncash losses on the disposal of assets. Divesting these product lines will generate annual savings of approximately $2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, beginning in fiscal 2015.","Based on our general confidence in the strength in the underlying markets of our business, we are essentially reaffirming our EPS outlook for 2014. However, we expect the NVS acquisition in our veterinary business to add approximately $0.03 to $0.04 to diluted earnings per share for the remainder of the year. With the recent closing of that acquisition, we are adjusting our fiscal 2014 diluted EPS guidance from recurring operations to $2.13 to $2.24 to reflect the NVS operations for the remainder of the year. The new guidance range of $2.13 to $2.24 per diluted share excludes the $0.12 per diluted share nonrecurring charge for Patterson Medical.","Again, our guidance is predicated on several assumptions that include stable economic conditions; modest operating margin expansion in our ongoing operations, excluding our planned investments; a $0.06 impact to diluted EPS from the information technology investments; and no impact from share repurchases that may occur during the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some closing comments. Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Thanks, Steve. Entering our fiscal 2014 second quarter, Patterson is well positioned for growth as market conditions continue to improve. As we progress through fiscal year 2014, we are confident in our ability to capture market share as we help our customers grow their business. We are committed to generating long-term shareholder value through targeted investments, dividend growth and strategic share repurchases.","Now we'd like to take any questions. Katia, please open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wanted to start off with dental equipment. Obviously, you had the tough comp from the CEREC trade-up program, but just wondering what else did you guys see, and what was impacting it? And how did basic dental perform -- basic dental equipment perform this quarter?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure, Kevin. First of all, I'll talk about CEREC, because that had the biggest impact in the quarter. And really, it came in right on our internal plan. And there are really 4 things that went on in the quarter around CEREC. Number one is we placed all new Omnicams in our training centers, as well as established new demonstration units with all of our sales people in our branches. Two is we began to deliver Omnicams to customers trading up from Bluecam. We have a substantial backlog of customers to get to in the coming quarters, which we are very excited about. Three is we also sold and installed new Omnicam units to new customers. And four, I think, is one of the really important points, is we really worked, over this first quarter, to normalize our inventory level of CEREC products to position ourselves to meet the ongoing demand throughout our entire fiscal year. So we feel very good about our CEREC pipeline, and we expect double-digit growth in our fiscal year. I'd also note that Sirona has been stellar in our agreed-upon delivery schedule, and we remain on track with that. On the core equipment business, it was down slightly in the quarter coming off, really, a 6-month run of strong business. But it still sort of bumps along the same level that it's been at for really the last 3 years. I would say we're cautiously optimistic, though, in what we see in the pipeline already out of the gate in our second quarter and feel good about just market conditions going into the end of the calendar year.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, Scott, your comment about expecting double-digit growth for the year, is that just on the CEREC sales? Or is that for all of equipment?","Scott P. Anderson","I think when you put all of our equipment together, we expect to get there by the end of the fiscal year. Obviously, strong double-digit sales in CEREC and our digital products and mid-single-digit sales for our core equipment piece.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then consumables, they're showing nice recovery. Just wondering if there's anything you can call out that's driving that, or is it just more macro recovery? And then also, were there any pockets of the country that was -- that performed better than the others?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, good question. We feel real good about the consumable story. This is now 6 months of solid growth, and it feels like it's strengthening across all product lines. There are certain pockets of the country that are stronger than others. If there were 100 million people lived in North Dakota, things would be really good. But it's -- I would say we really take sort of a macro look at it, and we feel like the underlying market is starting to grow. And I think that just lends to the thesis of stability in the dental market and, really, positive things in the space over the next 10 to 15 years.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Do you think we'll see continuation of this kind of 3% head growth for the year?","Scott P. Anderson","I would anticipate that.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick one for Steve. NVS, obviously you guys completed that deal. I think annual revenues were kind of in that 270 million range, Steve, if I'm correct. Is that kind of what you're expecting on a pro forma basis for the year?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Actually, NVS generates revenue nearly $500 million historically, about GBP 300 million. We're expecting about roughly 75%, 80% of that for the year.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I actually just had 2 questions. My first would just be around the medical side. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the sales trends? And obviously, bringing in a new head of that sales, what are your expectations for this year and the guidance around the turnaround, Steve or Scott?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. We're excited to have Mike join the team, and I've been very impressed by all of the folks in the Medical division over the last 5 months as I've been sort of the interim leader. I think we've got a very solid plan for this year, and I'm confident in the ability of the management team to deliver on it. We're taking some action in the European business that we've worked on during our strategic review over the last year. We like this business a lot because we feel, number one, we have such a strong competitive position, but we also really like the long-term trends in terms of the aging population. So I feel like Mike's sort of marching orders are to move quickly with the team in place, and he doesn't need a whole lot of time to evaluate where the business is at because we've been working on that for the last 6 months. And he's absolutely in agreement with the direction we're going to take.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And would you say, Scott, that what's been happening with the Medical side of the business, is it -- what's been the key drivers? Are these things that you think you can turn around at Patterson, not the right product to the right participant? Or is it more of, overall, the economic recovery? Just help me to understand what are going to be the key drivers to turning this around. I know you talked about the divestitures and getting rid of some of the new sales and being more focused in Europe, but what are some of the other key variables as you really try to turn the business around?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. I'll start with the external factors. The external factors are -- again, this has been a tough market and tough industry for the last 24 to 36 months as the Affordable Health Care has been enacted and austerity measures, particularly in the U.K., have been enacted. So we know there's been an adjustment in the health care system, but that doesn't change the fact that there's going to be very strong underlying demand for physical and occupational therapy modalities and the products that go with that. So we're comfortable that we can weather that external pressure. From an internal standpoint, our medical business is a bit of a complex business. We have a lot of things going on in terms of both distribution and some light manufacturing. And one of the things we've worked on over the last 6 to 12 months is really to start to just tighten the focus of who we are and what we do in that business, and this will be a year where the team executes on that.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question would just be around your comment around capturing market share on the dental side of the business. If we look at your consumables sales, they've been, this quarter, roughly about the same as your largest competitor. So is it -- are you capturing market share from the smaller guys? How should we think about the market right now?","Scott P. Anderson","I think we're growing a little faster than the market right now, Lisa, and we look at that as an ongoing trend. We're excited about the story we have to tell to our customers in terms of what Patterson can do to really help dentists grow their practice and take advantage of what is going to be an environment of very strong demand for dental care going forward. We are absolutely around the equipment side of the business with over 50% market share of capital goods. And as that market rebounds, we're excited to really be a leader in that recovery. And then you couple that with our position on technology with CEREC and CAD\/CAM and digital x-ray, we think all those things put together puts us in a strong position to grow faster than the market for many years to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Scott, I actually just wanted to follow-up on the comment you made earlier around dental equipment growth for the year and the expectation for double digits despite what we saw this quarter, which clearly was a decline in the double digits. I guess, could you just maybe give a little bit more insight into what the drivers are of the accelerated growth in your expectations for equipment on the balance of the year? Is it specifically related to the current trade-up program?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, I think we've got a lot of positive factors going for us. One is we -- as I said, we have a very strong backlog of customers who are trading up from Bluecam to Omnicam, and we will -- you'll start to see that fairly substantially here in the second quarter. So it's almost a flip-flop of what happened last year, where we had a very strong first quarter and then a weaker second quarter. I think you'll see a reversal of that. If you look at our last 3 years, we've sequentially grown the equipment business. And last year, towards the last end of the year, particularly the last 6 months, we ended up with a near a double-digit year. And we see that as a continuing trend as, number one, our customers' practices continue to stabilize and grow and we take advantage of quite a bit of pent-up demand in terms of practice investment.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just switching over to Vet, I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit more clarity on the competitive landscape and the competitive positioning of NVS. I know it's not an exact comp, but your largest vet competitor has been seeing some slowing internal growth in the international vet side. I was just wondering if maybe you could discuss the competitive positioning and then maybe what you guys are seeing in that marketplace.","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. What really excited us about NVS was, number one, they were a market leader. Two is that they had a great management team. And it was a very clean transition from Dechra. So we have a group at NVS that are really excited to be a part of the Patterson team and really start to take advantage of their strong competitive advantage, but also get a lot of additive benefits from being part of Patterson. When looking at this, obviously, we take a very long view, and we see the underlying market characteristics for the companion animal market in the U.K. and Western Europe to be similar to that of North America. So while you're going to go through some slow patches from time to time, we absolutely see it as a growing market over the next decade and an exciting opportunity for us to grow our business geographically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Scott, I just wanted to kind of follow up. I hate to beat the drum on this equipment question, but I just want to ask one more time here. Based on the way your comps look for the remainder of the year, it seems like you have an easy comp in the second quarter, but your comps in the third quarter and fourth quarter seem pretty difficult. So to get to double-digit growth kind of seems difficult. And I'm kind of curious about the comments you made about your substantial backlog. What's preventing you, I guess, from capitalizing on that backlog? Are there any capacity constraints coming from Sirona, or is it more of a function that your salespeople just can't get the equipment installed as fast as you'd like? Or is there anything that we should think about from a timing perspective as the next couple of quarters play out?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, a good question, Glen, and I think that's where it's important -- and I'll go back to what I said about CEREC. We really planned out, internally and with our partner Sirona, to have the first quarter be a -- get back to normalized business in terms of demonstration units, training centers, inventory levels. For 9 months, we were living hand to mouth because of the excitement around Omnicam. And at a certain, point, you got to get back into a normalized business flow, both from our ability to both take care of customers who want to upgrade to Omnicam, of which we have a substantial backlog, but also have our salespeople continue to drive new product sales. So it's a good problem to have, but it was critical, I thought, that we -- and the dental team thought that we use the first quarter to really stabilize the supply chain and get back to a more normalized type of selling environment out there. So with that, we're off to a very good start in the second quarter and anticipate that to continue. The comments about equipment in general, you have to remember that the core equipment, the basic equipment business still is down 15-plus percent from its high-water mark in 2008, 2009. So our ability to continue to grow that business is absolutely out in front of us, and to expect mid-single-digits growth out of core equipment is not a stretch to look at over the balance of the year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Scott -- and maybe Steve, you can chime in here -- as you think about the sort of the puts and takes on your guidance for the balance of the year, is really sort of the equipment line and in particular maybe some of the ebb and flow of CAD\/CAM here, is that really going to be the big driver in terms of where you shake out, ultimately, relative to your guidance? Because it kind of seems like the consumable number has been pretty stable, the vet number has been pretty stable, and you put in some corrective actions within the medical segment. So I'm trying to figure out where the potential upside surprises and risks may ultimately lie.","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. I'll start off, and then I'll turn it over to Steve. I think one of the important things is the way we modeled is we modeled our consumable growth fairly conservatively. So I would say, we're actually off to a better start than we anticipated. So that would be something, if that continues to hold at this level or grows, it would be an opportunity. We've always talked about there being some volatility in the equipment business, but that's part of what goes along with what a large market share we have on that side of the business. I'll let Steve sort of finish off the...","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I think I would just echo what Scott talked about before on the equipment side of the dental business. First quarter is never a particularly litmus test for the remainder of the year. And when you look at what's out in front of us with CEREC and the basic opportunities plus the other technologies, we're very comfortable with where we think our forecast is putting us for the year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But Steve, you're going to require an improvement in the core equipment back into mid-single digits to kind of make those numbers?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Sure, absolutely. But you've got to remember that 50% of the volume comes in the last half of the year, Glen.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Maybe if I can just ask one last one, then I'll jump off.","Scott P. Anderson","Sure.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With respect to the changes you're making in the medical segment, Steve, could you maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of how much revenues may be going away within that segment? And if I heard you correctly, you said an annual savings of $2 million. Were these basically unprofitable product lines that you're divesting? And the word divestiture sounds like you're selling them to someone, or -- are you getting any money for these product lines? Will there be any proceeds?","R. Stephen Armstrong","You got a lot of questions in there, Glen. As far as the impact on the P&L, sales wise, we're maybe looking at 2 to 3 percentage points of the medical business itself as far as the impact on revenue. I wouldn't say these were unprofitable businesses, but they were not highly profitable businesses. So the impact on the operating line from the sale of these product lines is not going to be material. As far as the -- what it allows the European operation to do is sort of clean up its operating structure a little bit. We picked up some pieces in acquisitions over the last 3 years, Mobilis days, that we took a look at, strategically evaluated and really decided that they just don't fit with the business. So where the charges are going to come from is selling these assets where we can, closing operations that don't make sense to operate in the long term, consolidating into existing facilities and so forth. So that's really the essence of what's going on. It's a lot of individual pieces, Glen. There's really no one big piece that I can point to that would account for most of the activity, but we will try to sell most of this stuff. It's good product. We'll probably end up selling some of it going forward. It just doesn't belong in Patterson's bailiwick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies & Company.","Sachin Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Sachin in for Brandon. Steve, so on the balance sheet, inventory took a chunk up sequentially and inventory days have ticked up for the past several quarters. How much of that is attributable to Omnicam, and how should we expect organic inventory level to trend over the coming periods?","R. Stephen Armstrong","There has been a build in CEREC as we reestablished our training centers, got our dental inventories out and, as Scott said, brought our unit level back to what we consider normal for that product category. So most of that build that you see in inventory is in the CEREC product line. I wouldn't anticipate seeing much more build for the remainder of the year. Most of it has occurred now.","Sachin Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. Also, just to quantify, could you define the impact of FX and M&A on the dental segment revenue specifically?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I can. Acquisitions was about 0.2% positive and FX was a negative 0.1%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions on the vet business. Steve, could you just expand a bit more on why EBIT margins declined in the vet business? And I'm guessing the NVS business is a bit less profitable. How big of a step down in margins would you expect in the rest of the year with that being consolidated?","R. Stephen Armstrong","You're probably going to see something around 2 percentage points of impact from NVS. You're correct. They do run at lower margins. What was the first part of your question, John?","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","What drove the lower margin in vet this quarter?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Oh. Primarily, just the headcount additions that they made, as Scott talked about, the number of people they added on the sales side of the organization, as well as the technical service year-over-year.","Scott P. Anderson","And the transaction costs from NVS.","R. Stephen Armstrong","And the transaction costs.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, okay. And another kind of follow-on, if you're willing to talk about your international M&A strategy at all. With NVS now in the portfolio, what's your interest in maybe thinking a little bit more about continental Europe for your vet business or perhaps moving dental into the U.K.?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, John, I think that the important thing is we've always taken a global perspective at Patterson and looked at global markets. We are excited that a property as high quality as NVS was available for us to make a transaction. So we'll continue to do that and -- but at the same time, I think we'll be very patient in terms of making sure it's the right fit, the right management team as we expand. But as opportunities come out and as we build relationships, which we've been doing for decades, we'll absolutely be there to move on them if it makes sense for Patterson and our shareholders.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And maybe just one more, Scott. Can you just talk a bit about the Special Markets Division within dental? What are you seeing in terms of the larger kind of corporate account growth in the dental market? And what's going to be your plan to go after that?","Scott P. Anderson","Well, we already have customers in that market, but we felt it was important to sort of formalize our approach because there are definitely different customer needs at the larger accounts versus our private practice accounts. So the first step was formalizing the division and naming a leader of that. We think we've got a great story to tell in terms of just next-day logistics on the consumables side, very easy to do business with. And then we have some very unique things to offer on the technology side that many of these larger practices are very interested in, in terms of how they differentiate their practices through CEREC and digital X-ray and high-quality equipment. So we think we've got a very compelling story to tell in this segment of the market. We feel it's 7% to 10% of the market today, and our market share in that market is smaller than our overall market share, and we think we have a great opportunity to grow share in that space as it grows within dentistry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Valiquette, just for the record. Just a couple of questions here just on the NVS acquisition, just some clarifying questions. I guess first, obviously, we've talked about the revenue run rate, but is there any feel for the breakdown between consumable and equipment? Is it pretty similar to what you currently have, or it's predominantly consumables, or is there different mix within that?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, good question. It's predominantly consumables. So we feel, over time, there potentially could be an equipment opportunity with NVS.","R. Stephen Armstrong","They do have some service.","Scott P. Anderson","They have some service, but predominantly consumables.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So the margins are a touch lower right now. It sounds like it's not really due to mix. But I guess the question, too, would be, then, if the margins are a touch lower right now, is it your business plan that you can improve and expand those margins such that they'll eventually get to where your overall vet segment is right now?","Scott P. Anderson","I think that's absolutely always our plan to work on our businesses to improve margins. It is a different market than North America. So I think what we're excited about is just the early interaction between the NVS management team, and George and his team are -- what are the things that we do in terms of value-added, because of our scope and size and some of the benefit that has trickled over from the dental business? What are those? Software platform, ePetHealth would be a great example of a product that we can bring over to the U.K. that would expand their offering and, over time, help drive profitability for them.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then final quick question on NVS. I know the deal had just closed about a week ago, but is there any preliminary read on the annual intangible asset amortization tied to the deal? I'm guessing maybe it's somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range, annually, but is there any feel for that yet?","R. Stephen Armstrong","We've made some estimates, Steve, on it. We've engaged an appraisal. But I think right now I'm reluctant to give you an exact number or even a range at this point because it could change dramatically, but we're looking at maybe a little less than 1%.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just in terms of at least the timing of the time period over which you would amortize that, is that set, or is that also still kind of subject to review?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Well, the numbers we gave you and what we expect it to contribute, we used about a 5-year amortization on average for it. There'd probably be some 10. There'd probably be some 7, some 5, but we used a fairly conservative 5.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Wait, 1% of the purchase price, is that what you said?","R. Stephen Armstrong","No, no. 1% of impact on operations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You mentioned you were moving to a fixed debt solution for what's due down on the credit facility. Is that correct, Steve? And maybe, what's a run rate you'd hope for the interest expense, then, over the course of the year or the timing on whatever solution you reach?","R. Stephen Armstrong","We may keep this with the short term, using the short-term markets for some time, Bob. I haven't really decided yet. I'm kind of watching what the interest rate markets do here over the next several months. If we took it overseas, which would be the natural place to place it, it's a bit higher interest rate in those markets than what we can get here in the States just because of size and so forth in that market. So I'm keeping my options open, I guess, is the best thing to tell you at this point.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the tax rate assumption for the year, does NVS have any influence on that?","R. Stephen Armstrong","It does not. The influence on the tax rate would come more from what we're doing with the medical. NVS will have some positive impact, obviously, because the British rate is lower than the U.S. rate, but the real impact on tax rate could come about with some of the activity on the medical side.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But maintaining the first quarter run rate, is that a good assumption?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes. For now, I'd keep you there.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And I think this was to John's question about the corporate dental contributions. Does the guidance assume any major inroads relative to where you currently stand on that front?","Scott P. Anderson","No, it does not.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It's Block, for the record. But anyway, just another follow-up question on the vet space. So are the hires done? I mean, you mentioned increasing the headcount, so are you done there? And then Steve, I think you alluded to 2%, a 2% step down in the margins. Just to be clear, is that from the 1Q number of 4.5% or is it from the full year '13, which I think was at least 100 basis points higher?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Got to back me up here. I lost you altogether, Jon, sorry.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So when you mentioned the margins stepping down, I believe you said by about 2% due to NVS, is that from the 1Q rate that you put up of 4.5% op margins or from the run rate where you were in 2013?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Relating to vet?","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, relating to vet.","R. Stephen Armstrong","It's off of last year.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Off of last year?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Right.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry, in terms of the vet hires, are you done there in terms of a headcount?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, I'll take that. We'll continue to have new sales rep classes, and we'll expand our technical service offering as demand warrants. But this was -- the last 18 months were really sort of a build here, and we'll -- the full expectation of the vet business is start to leverage that headcount here over the balance of this year and going forward.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the last 2 questions are a little bit big picture. And I guess the first one is, it just seems similar to where we were last year at this time. In other words, you came in a little bit shy of expectations, you're standing by the annual guidance, you seem to imply that it's more the Street's cadence than versus what you guys expected. So can you talk to us about what's changed from last year? In other words, as you sit here today, what different? Is the pipeline a lot better on the dental equipment side that makes you comfortable? Why are you so confident that you can go ahead and reiterate guidance today?","Scott P. Anderson","I'll start with that. I think the strength of the consumable business is a key factor. I think what we know about our pipeline on the CEREC side, as well as the fact -- you got to remember, a year ago, the Omnicam product was launched in August, and in essence, we really didn't have a product to sell until late November, December. And then we were playing catch-up in terms of inventory in and inventory out quickly. So I think we feel like on the dental side, we're in a strong position. The vet business continues to perform very well, and we see that continuing. And we had a tough year on the medical side last year, and we feel like we've righted the ship over there. The fact that our North American business is starting to grow, I think, gives us confidence. So I think I can point to many different aspects. And also the way we planned out the year, the fact that our quarter, in essence, is right on our internal plan gives us a high level of confidence going forward.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe last one, Scott, for you. Just the specialty market seems to be evolving -- in other words, your -- one of your competitors made a few purchases of orthodontic companies. They have an agreement with Align, recent commentary from Straumann and Nobel seems to imply that GPs are getting a lot more aggressive with dental implants. And can you speak to your plans to sort of align yourselves with the changing times? I mean, where are you today with more aggressively pursuing or getting a foothold in the specialty market versus where you were 12 to 24 months ago?","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes. We do great business across all the specialties in terms of the basic consumables and equipment as well as software. We own Dolphin, which is the leading orthodontic practice management and planning software system. So we feel like we've got a nice position in the specialty market, but we also have the discipline, I think, in -- there are certain markets that tend well towards a direct model. And historically, implants has been one of those, endodontics has been another. But you're right, you will see general dentists start to build out the modalities of things they can do in their practice, particularly due to cone beam technology and other things. And as that grows, I think Patterson becomes a great partner for many manufacturers as they look to grow their business. So I think we're excited about the position we have in the market and how we can partner with innovative manufacturers to help them grow their business over the next decade, which I think will have very strong demand across all the specialties.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Kedra with Gabelli & Company.","Kevin Kedra - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","A couple of quick questions. First, on the medical, in terms of sort of the strategic review that you guys have had ongoing, is that still ongoing, or is that mostly complete and now it's more a function of execution on that? And then secondly, just wanted to ask about share repurchases. We've seen them slow down a little bit the last few quarters. I'm just wondering, is that a function of maybe NVS acquisition, a function of where the stock price has been? Has there been a fundamental change in how you think about that? How should we think about share repurchase going forward?","Scott P. Anderson","Sure. I'll take the strategy question, and I'll have Steve talk about the share repurchase strategy. We are in a constant cadence in terms of strategy, and strategy, obviously, is always evolving at the company. Last year, we did take a very deep dive across all 3 businesses to take a look at where we can grow our markets, where we should be playing, where we shouldn't be playing, and that came out in some of our European operations in terms of helping them clean up their business so they can spend their time and effort on growing business profitably where they're the strongest. So I would say this becomes an execution year for medical. But the worst thing you can do is put -- do a strategic plan and let it just sit on the shelf for 3 years before you go back and look on it. So we'll always be evolving. I think that's one of the reasons I'm so excited about Mike joining the team because I think he gives us some fresh eyes and fresh perspective that, along with a management team that knows the business so well and so deeply, I think we can have some really good strategic discussions about where we take that business over the long term. But there are definitely very clear things that the medical business will execute on here over the next 12 months. I'll let Steve talk about sort of share repurchase trends over the last 6 months.","R. Stephen Armstrong","Yes, I think what I would tell you is that we're still on track strategically to move some of the cash back to the shareholder over the remainder of the year. We did slow down. Kevin, you hit it on the head as far as why we slowed down in the first quarter. It was predominantly due to the purchase of NVS and how we might fund that, so we were cautious about committing capital to share repurchases until we understood what we were going to do with NVS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Robert W. Baird.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to a quick one here on Omnicam. We appreciate the color on the backlog. But wonder if there's any other specifics you could provide with respect to the mix of upgrades versus new systems in your backlog. Is it still mostly trade-ups, or is the new system funnel actually strengthening?","Scott P. Anderson","Yes, the new system funnel is strong, and we saw nice incremental growth in new systems in the first quarter. And it's just that balance of how we get the backlog of customers who have been waiting to trade up their Bluecam and continuing to drive Omnicam sales. I said in the prepared comments, too, we're really excited about the story we can tell to customers in terms of the CAD\/CAM for Everyone strategy and how we really have a product -- not only a product but, I strongly believe, a best-in-class product at every entry point throughout CAD\/CAM. So we take a long view on this and have been disciples on CAD\/CAM for over a decade now. We see the CAD\/CAM story continuing to grow not only this year, but throughout the next decade.","Jason M. Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a bit of a follow-up to that, I know we've really hammered home kind of the whole Omnicam and dental equipment questions here. But Omnicam, obviously a very good camera, a lot of excitement and buzz in the industry about it. But we're wondering, with all the other new value-oriented entrants into the chairside CAD\/CAM market, are you seeing any pause from dentists you speak to with respect to them wanting to pull the trigger on a new system purchase? It seems like we went through maybe this type of dynamic several years ago with 3D imaging. Now we're wondering if there's a chance that maybe we'll go through similar period like that, even if it's a short-term period, but go through a period like that for CAD\/CAM. So again, just curious on your thoughts there.","Scott P. Anderson","I look at the competition and the increased number of products as a real positive because for many years, we were the only -- we were the missionaries talking about this. We were the only company out there talking about CAD\/CAM. And it's at such a high level of interest with the dentists right now, and the fact that competitor products are entering the space, I think, really sends the message that this is the future of dentistry. And just to reiterate where we think we have such a strong position, I talk to folks all across the world in terms of dental distribution. And it's very clear that when folks have a choice on which product they want to lead with, throughout the world, in all of the large markets, companies with a choice are leading with Sirona and CEREC. So I think the competition is good for the dentist. It's good for us. It pushes Sirona to innovate, and I don't see it as a negative that's delaying decisions from customers.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. First, have you given any consideration to other divestitures or areas that you're targeting for any strategic plans? And then second, in the vet business, obviously, some of the trends are going very nicely for you guys. And Scott, I think you even called out the equipment and technology strategies performing. Just wondering if you've given any thought to expanding some of the products that you guys offer in the diagnostic space.","Scott P. Anderson","Your first part of the question again?","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Divestitures.","Scott P. Anderson","I wouldn't see any other action on that. We've got enough to execute on right now, and it ties right to the strategic plan we were working on. In terms of our portfolio on the vet side, I think we're very comfortable with the products we're offering today and excited about those growth opportunities going forward over the next year.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Scott P. Anderson","Thanks, Katia. And I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Our first quarter results met our expectations, and we continue to anticipate improved performance for the fiscal year. We're encouraged by economic indicators in North America that generally bode well for our business. We're focused on capitalizing on growth opportunities that lie ahead as we continue to expand our footprint into new geographies and further enhance our product and service offerings. Between now and our November call, we have 2 other opportunities to update you on our progress: Patterson's annual meeting at our corporate headquarters will be on September 9, and our Investor Day in New York City will be on September 24. We look forward to hopefully seeing many of you in person. Thanks for your interest, and we'll update you at various events throughout the next quarter.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Nagel. Please go ahead.","Leslie Nagel","Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Ann Gugino, our Chief Financial Officer. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open up the call up to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We encourage you to review this material. Also, a financial slide presentation can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at pattersoncompanies.com. Please note that in this morning's conference call, we will reference our adjusted results for fiscal 2014, which excludes the impact of the restructuring charge for the medical divestiture, as well as constant currency results for fiscal 2015. A reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results and foreign currency impact can be found in this morning's press release. Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at noon, Central Time for a period of one week.","With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott Anderson ","Thank you, Leslie. Welcome, everyone, to this morning\u2019s conference call. During the third quarter, we continue to execute on our strategic growth plan by enriching product and service offerings, pursuing efficiencies, investing in our people and systems and making the most of our expanded geographic reach. I am pleased to say that we made significant progress on all of these fronts.","The first-half of fiscal 2015 was strong for Patterson and despite flat revenues in the third quarter on a constant currency basis; we are on track to meet our financial objectives as we move towards the end of our fiscal year. Most importantly, we are confident in the strength of our business and encouraged by the stable to strengthening market conditions we are witnessing. As detailed in today\u2019s earning release, Patterson Companies consolidated revenues totalled $1.1 billion, which is roughly flat, compared to the same period last year.","Of the year-to-date basis, our consolidated sales are 8.9% to $3.2 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $0.55 during the quarter compared to $0.57 in the prior year period excluding medical unit restructuring cost. These three quarters earnings per diluted share have risen to a $1.59 from a $1.50 a year ago. As Ann will note later in the call, EPS in last year\u2019s third quarter benefitted from a one-time non-cash stock compensation adjustment.","During the quarter, we saw several positive macro trends and made strides in all three of our business units, let's take a closer look at our operational performance starting with Patterson Dental. Dental which is our largest business represents about 58% of our total sales. On the consumable side of dental, we once again posted solid growth with sales rising 4% on a constant currency basis from the prior year. We believe this reflects the combination of higher office visits and overall demand for dental services and the ability of our industry leading sales force to meet the needs of our dental customer.","Consumable growth continues to be supported by a steadily improving job market and consumer confidence. On the equipment and software side of the business, we experienced the headwind driven by the uncertainty around the reinstatement of Section 179 tax benefits. This was a risk we foreshadowed in our second quarter conference call. Virtually the entire shortfall to our internal plan occurred from early November to the December 19th time period when Congress finally reinstated the tax benefits. From December 19th to the end of the quarter, our equipment business performed at plan levels, but it could not make up for the shortfall created by the delay. We feel this was an industry wide issue and do not see any change to our growth outlook for equipment and technology in our fourth quarter or in our new fiscal year beginning in May. Clearly our partnerships with equipment manufacturers are a key factor in our success at Patterson.","During the quarter, we announced our intent to broaden the range of products we sell in the basic dental equipment space. With the support of our long time strategic partner A\u2011dec we have built for reputation as the leader in selling dental equipment in North America. We look forward to continuing our strong partnership with A\u2011dec and see many years of growth opportunities ahead for both companies. In the coming months we will roll out new relationships that will expand the offering we bring to our dentist.","We have already noted the bonding of our relationship with Sirona to over time introduced their market leading treatment centers to the United States market. We are excited to work with our partners to bring innovative products that enhance the productivity gains that technology affords our customers.","Patterson Dental is on the leading edge of the technology trend to digitization of the dental office. We believe that fundamentals are in place for continued growth. Our exceptional sales, training and technical support infrastructure all position us well to capitalize on the digitations trend as it builds further momentum.","Technology investments continue be at the top of dentists' wish lists. Tax implications aside demand for CEREC CAD\/CAM units remains healthy. And we are helping dental offices adopt and deploy this technology. As I've stated many times before we believe that the CEREC CAD\/CAM platform truly has the potential to become the standard-of-care dentistry.","In early January we held a meeting in Minneapolis with roughly 400 Patterson branch managers, CEREC specialists, equipment specialists and territory representatives. The objective was to lay out our company goal of achieving 30,000 CEREC users by 2020. This would double the CEREC user base in North America in the next five years. We will continue to work closely with Sirona to develop strategies to accomplish this goal. We will do everything in our power in terms of sales, marketing and support infrastructure to accelerate this tremendous opportunity.","As we have highlighted on the past several calls we are committed to further expanding our product and service offerings for our dental customers. In December we acquired whole dental supply located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This acquisition will help accelerate Patterson Dental's reach and deepen our Midwest influence. We are delighted to welcome [indiscernible] the Patterson Companies as they bring a long-standing and stellar reputation in their markets and maintain the culture much like ours focus on accountability integrity and customers service. Moving on to Patterson veterinary which comprises just under a third of our total sales. We believe the underlying market in veterinary continues to perform well. We are well positioned in both the United States and the United Kingdom head ownership and the dollar amount people invest in vet care for their pets continues to grow.","You'll recall that our go forward strategy for Patterson veterinary is to further diversify our equipment in technical service offerings to capitalize on the favorable marketplace dynamics. Patterson bring market leading technical service and support capabilities as well as deepen premier sales force that consumable increase by 3.5% in the quarter and were impacted by sales mix shift in Pharmaceutical products sold under the by sell arrangements to those sold under agency arrangements.","We are confident in our manufacturing partner's commitment to invest in innovation and are optimistic that this along with a promising pet ownership trends will continue to benefit Patterson veterinary.","On the equipment side of that, sales increased 3.5% equipment and technology will continue to be a growth opportunity and differentiator as we further drive our strategy to provide unique services that support the success of our vet customers.","We are still early in our transition from IDEXX to our new strategic partnership with Abaxis. But we are off to a good start and are pleased with Abaxis placements today. Abaxis is a leading manufacturer of point of care blood instrumentation and consumables to the veterinary market as well as the medical research customer. We are selling Abaxis full line of veterinary diagnostic products including external reference lab services and in-clinic testing. We are excited about Abaxis products and people and are committed to securing success of this new partnership. Turning now to Patterson Medical, this is our rehabilitation supplying and clinic unit and we have made significant progress here this business represent approximately 10% of our total company revenues.","Our management team has worked hard to sharpen the focus of this business on select rehab markets and those efforts are paying off. We are pleased that medical delivered its third consecutive quarter of growth excluding currency and divesture impacts. We are confident that our restructuring has created a strong platform and momentum in the business.","We are the global market leader in physical therapy, occupational therapy and sports medicine markets. Our team is executing well against this strategic plan. We remain confident in our ability to capture additional market share as the underlying market conditions continues to stabilize. We're optimistic at Patterson that we will finish the year strong with momentum heading into fiscal year 2016.","With that I'll ask Ann to review the financials, Ann?","Ann Gugino","Thank you, Scott. I\u2019ll start with some context on the top line naturally foreign currency had a meaningful impact on our non-U.S sales, about 20% of our total revenue comes from international sources. On a consolidated basis sales were reduced by 1.2 percentage points for currency.","Turning to each of our segment beginning with dental sales were down 2.6% on a constant currency basis year over year. In dental as Scott mentioned we were pleased with our continued consumable growth. After strong second quarter and equipment sales were effected in the fiscal third quarter by the late reinstatement of tax incentives for equipment purchases.","Looking at veterinary as a reminder our NVS acquisition closed more than a year ago. So those results are now considered organic. Vet sales were 337.8 million up 3.5% on a constant currency basis. Breaking it down further U.S sales decline 1.9% and the UK sales grows 10.4% in local currency. Total vet revenues include several items. First, as you are aware IDEXX takes the product direct to the customer on January 1st. We are replacing those products with Abaxis line because this does cause some disruption in the channel. That said we are confident in the in the strength of our Abaxis partnership as Scott said.","Additionally vet sales in the quarter reflect the impact of changes in selling arrangements on certain products from buy\/sell agency on the pharmaceutical end of the business. Regarding medical this unit performed well as Scott noted, sales in the quarter were up 2.6% excluding currency ended up to impact. Looking at margins consolidated gross margin was 28.5%, down 40 basis points on the adjusted fiscal 2014 third quarter. This reflects the impact of revenue mix with lower margins veterinary revenues outpacing U.S. dental revenues.","We are pleased with our cost control efforts during the quarter, operating expenses on an absolute basis declined by 2.5 million. On a consolidated basis excluding the impact of the medical divestiture, the operating expense ratio in the fiscal third quarter was 19.9%, which is in line with last year\u2019s level.","To help understand margin performance, it is useful to adjust for last year\u2019s impact of the medical divestitures as well as the one-time non-cash stock-based compensation adjustment most of which was in the dental business. On this basis consolidated operating margins expanded 20 basis points, by segment they were improved in both dental and medical and were flat in veterinary. So typically, operating margins for the quarter were 10.7% in dental, 3.5% in veterinary and 11.6% for medical. As expected our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.8% versus 35.2% in the prior year. We continue to anticipate an annual tax rate of approximately 35% for fiscal 2015; this will be in line with our annual tax rate for fiscal 2014. Our DSO stands at 50 days, up 4 days from a year ago reflecting the lower mix of equipment sales which are typically not finance for our trade receivables.","Our inventory turns were 6.7, compared to 6.5 a year ago. Also, please keep in mind a few additional items on the balance sheet. A year ago we bought worth a one-year time deposit and a two-year guaranteed investment contract or GIC totaling approximately $100 million, both are similar to the deposit. When the one-year time deposit mature, the bank transfer the cash and at the same time the two-year GIC move from long-term to current asset. Cash flow for the fiscal 2015 third quarter was basically flat at 59.7%, on a year-to-date basis cash flow from operations totaled approximately 158 million, up from roughly 150 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2014.","We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned approximately 20.2 million to our shareholders in dividends. As you know, Patterson has 250 million of debt that is due in March. We are moving forward with a long-term extension of this debt facility. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investment and growth opportunities.","Our CapEx in the third quarter totalled 14.3 million and included payment for normal replacement as well as our corporate wise information technology initiative. For the fiscal 2015 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately 50 million to 55 million.","Finally, as you saw in our release we are reaffirming our fiscal 2015 earnings guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share, while we did not provide quarterly guidance, I\u2019d like to remind you a couple of items that affect our fiscal fourth quarter year-over-year comparison. Our performance in last year\u2019s fourth quarter was first by unusually adverse winter weather conditions and resulting impact on utilization rates for our customers.","Also please keep in mind that we took a non-cash -- we took a non-recurring severance charge in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we\u2019re confident in our ability to close the year strong.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Scott for some further comments. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Ann. As we move towards the end of our fiscal year we remain confident in our ability to generate value for our shareholders and financially achieve what we set out to do this fiscal year through an array of strategies we have underway, enriching our products and service offerings, striving to make Patterson more efficient, investing in our people and systems and making the most of our expanded geographic reach.","We have made significant strides with our corporate wide information technology initiative which is moving into the pilot race. Our information technology investments are critical to improving scale in our business platform. We have momentum with Patterson Medical, putting this business like our others on solid footing for future growth and market-share gains.","Lastly, we took a leadership position on an issue we care deeply about to protect against potentially unsafe dental products entering the marketplace, in January we announced that we are formalizing our efforts to promote supply chain integrity for our dental customers.","We will share more details in the next week's Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting. This initiative demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the integrity of our supply chain for our dental customers.","Now with that, we like to take questions. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Doug.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich","This is Nathan Rich on for Bob today. Scott you're talking about the goal of doubling the North America CEREC user base by 2020. Could you share your high level thoughts at least initially just on what's needed to achieve this I mean does this require you guys to invest in the salesforce at all? And are there maybe opportunities to expand the market I know that Sirona has talked about going well after or those are there any thoughts here would be helpful.","Scott Anderson","Sure thanks Nathan. We're very excited about the opportunity ahead with CEREC and believe we're at a very interesting time with the technology and with the marketplace and I really look at the opportunity around three areas and are able to touch on your question number one is the customer. We're really dealing with the next generation of dentists that are embracing digital dentistry. Each year those millennials become a bigger part of the decision making part of the customer base. So we look at that as a big factor in driving future utilization.","The second and it's a big one is product Sirona just continues to innovate, you talked about the ortho expansion and I think you'll see more things come out of Sirona that help expand all of the things that a CEREC machine can do for the customer and for the specialist going forward. Each improvement with CEREC it becomes easier, faster and it just produces better and better dentistry and I would also add you have the materials innovations as well.","And the last part in that\u2019s part of Patterson and that sales execution. So in terms of commitment, our salesforce is absolutely motivated engaged in their role and helping change dentistry and we also are willing to invest to make sure that we have the infrastructure that can support the after sales support for our customers. I would say that this role is very important to everyone in this organization because Patterson work committed to being one of the many catalyst that helps CEREC reach a tipping point in the market and become the long term standard of care in dentistry.","Nathan Rich","Thanks and then Ann if I could follow up with a quick question for you. I think back at the Analyst Day you talked about being able to deliver kind of 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion overtime. Margins were down this quarter and it's probably fair to say that sales are below your plan. So I kind of get the dynamics there, but when you look going forward now that we've kind of fully integrated the NVS acquisition. What should we think about in terms of the margin trajectory from here and as we look into fiscal '16 I mean do you think that we will see operating margins expand?","Ann Gugino","Sure Nathan so really you hit on it in a current quarter in addition to sales issue I would also highlight it's really comp issue with the prior year quarter where we had some onetime adjustments. And then I would also just point out that year to date excluding on the incremental impact from NVS our operating margins are flat. So we're pleased with the progress we're making this year we believe we're on target to achieve probably around 20 basis points of margin expansion this year. Because while we had a tough comp in operating margins year over year this quarter we actually have an easier comp coming up in fourth quarter because of A, the weather headwinds and then B, we picked that onetime severance charge last quarter. So current year we should end up with some modest margin expansion. Looking forward to FY '16 we continue to see opportunities improve even further moving forward as we continue to drive operating efficiencies within the organization and depending on the revenue levels and where the market is we would target 20 to 50 basis points higher than that if the revenues can accelerate.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich ","Just a couple of question I guess Scott starting off in dental, you talked about expanding some other relationships. Could you maybe expand upon that and kind of what areas you're looking at without giving away who the relationships are going to be with.","Scott Anderson","Yes we won't talk about specifics but we will broaden the offering that we have in the traditional equipment space. And we'll be announcing some new partnerships probably at the beginning of the fiscal year.","We also as we talked about over time probably in the fall of 2015 will be bringing some of the Sirona products to the U.S. So we're excited about having a really more options for our customers. That being said as I said in my prepared remarks we will continue to be a great partner of IDEXX and think that long term this is going to drive competition and drive really I think manufactures towards tighter integration of technology and that will benefit the dentist and put Patterson I think in the sweet spot of zone equipment.","Kevin Ellich ","And then I guess switching over the vet business, Ann you talked about the mix shift from buy\/sell agency. If you exclude that impact I guess what would consumable sales have been?","Ann Gugino","So, what I can tell you and I\u2019ll just remind you that in addition to the buy\/sell mix that you are asking about we did have one-month of impact of the IDEXX\/Abaxis change, but if we look specifically at the buy\/sell versus agency, I would quantify that and say that it depressed our growth rates by about 3 to 4 percentage points and then I would also just comment that our absolute dosages are up year-over-year even though the top-line is down.","Kevin Ellich ","And then Scott maybe could you talk about the strategic direction and I guess where you want to drive that business, I think you\u2019ve talked a little bit about expanding in that space and thoughts on previous expansion and livestock and production animal business in U.S. is this something you could do organically overtime or is it something you\u2019d have to go out and look for a big acquisition?","Scott Anderson","Number one is we love the animal health space and feel like we have got a great team at Patterson Vet and there is many different opportunities that we could act on, obviously last year we were very pleased to act on the NVS acquisition and expand our geographic reach to become number the one distributor in United Kingdom.","And I would just say that one of our strategic intents at Patterson is to take a broader view of markets, so as we look at the space, we will be the type of company that I think could act on many different opportunities that are in front of us here over the coming year and beyond. But long-term this is a great space to be in and it will be one that we would want to invest capital to grow and draw good returns for our shareholders.","Operator","And our next question is from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo","Scott just a couple of questions for you; first I want to talk about the equipment business maybe in a little bit more detail, on past calls you talked about the recent strength in basic equipment and teams like sort of given the continued improvement on the consumable number you probably feel pretty good about that. So maybe could you give us a more detailed assessment of what happened in this quarter between basic equipment in high tech and as you think about sort of bringing Sirona\u2019s treatment centers to the U.S. could that be a meaningful opportunity for you?","Scott Anderson","Glen, just looking at the quarter most of the shortfall is around technology it was really around the digital products and CEREC which are really the classic products that do well in that tax buying season. So our core equipment business was fairly stable throughout the quarter.","So, I really -- when you look at what happened in industry wide in November and December, I would say what we experienced was fairly consistent with the marketplace and as I said in my prepared comments really doesn\u2019t change our outlook going forward.","To the Sirona opportunity, we think there is a real nice opportunity at the higher end of the market when you look at many of our customers who currently own CEREC machines or [indiscernible] machines that are looking for tight integration of technology.","Those are our products that we feel the United States and Canadian markets are absolutely ready for and are excited about the opportunity ahead. I think it's a little too early to quantify the impact, but absolutely upside growth opportunity for Patterson.","Glen Santangelo ","Maybe I just follow-up with one other question on the medical [indiscernible] business, I mean it seems pretty clear that the restructuring efforts are starting to bear a little bit of fruit given it's the third consecutive quarter growth, but on past calls you sort of talked about maybe taking a longer-term strategic look at this business and I know you're in the process of spending some incremental CapEx on a new ERP system and as you think about making investments throughout calendar 2015, it feels like you'll ultimately come to a strategic goal, crossroads as far as that business is concerned. So I am just kind of curious has there been any update in your thinking or is it still to be determined or how should we think about -- how you think about things from a longer-term strategic perspective? Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Glen great question and we\u2019ve been I think very clear about the strategic options for the medical business and the fact that there potentially at the decision point around the implementation of our ERP. That being said, I could not be more pleased or proud of all the employees of Patterson Medical and the management team and really the focus of that business, and I am encouraged on sort of two front, one is just the pure execution against the strategic plan, but also the momentum in that businesses, we\u2019re starting to see signs of underlying market growth. And as we\u2019ve talked before there are really three big growth drivers for that business and ageing active population, increased utilization and access to physical therapy and physical therapies roll and managing healthcare cost to create a strong backdrop to the opportunity ahead in this space.","So that being said, we continue to evaluate the strategic fit of Patterson Medical inside our portfolio, but feel really good about where that business sits today in terms of the execution of the team's focus in Chicago and overseas.","Operator","And our next question is from Michael Cherny with Evecore ISI.","Michael Cherny","I wanted to expand on Glen's questions with regarding dental. As you think about your organization and think about the business I think about planning I know this is a business where we have whole bunch of cyclical factors particularly relatively to consumables. But as you think about planning out for coming years especially given that we're moving into fiscal '16. How do you plan about what should be the run rate typical growth for potential equipment business when you cut through all the moving pieces and one timers on a multi-year basis?","Scott Anderson","When we look at this year we saw the strengthening of the traditional equipment business, we have four consecutive quarters of growth up until this quarter which was flattish in equipment and then over time we see a CAGR of 10% plus on the technology side. And we also as we looked at the year in terms of planning guidance I think we did a very good job of creating a plan that could handle short term revenue short falls. And that\u2019s why we're absolutely on target to meet our plans, in fact I think you're colleague Elizabeth asked me the question last quarter about guidance. And I sort of talked about strength in consumables and if we had a strong third quarter and equipment that would push us to the upper end and we would be able to mitigate any softness. So that absolutely goes back to how we plan out the year, the reality is and we've been market leader in selling equipment for well over 20 years, is a bit of lumpiness in a roller coaster to dental equipment. Unlike consumables which are very pretty easy to predict and plan against.","Michael Cherny ","No I understand and then Ann a question for you and maybe a tough one to answer. But looking back at the model and this is the first time I can recall a long while you haven\u2019t bought back shares or really bought back any shares for two straight quarters. Is there any change that we should think about relative to your thought process behind simply repurchases given the large outstanding authorization you have.","Ann Gugino","No I would say there is no underlying change in the philosophy of capital allocation strategy. And I would just say that we can't really comment on why we're out of the market at this point. So we are even not in the market this quarter.","Operator","And we'll now go to our next question from Brandon Couillard with Jeffries.","Brandon Couillard ","Scott you mentioned that after the tax incentives were replaced in late December trends seem to normalized in the dental equipment business. How did they fair in January particularly and overall did basic equipment grow in the third quarter?","Scott Anderson","Yes first the basic equipment was flattish maybe down 100 basis points. The January business performed to our plan but we couldn\u2019t make up for that gap that was created between early November and mid-December which is sort of the classic time when dentists will sit down with our tax advisors and decide whether or not they are going to make equipment purchases. So it's not like those sales just moved into the January. I would say January is a good month and we're off to a nice start in February year over year.","If there could be a potential really nice tailwind, if the section 179 is reinstated at a time like we usually is which is usually early fall we could see a very active equipment market next year in the calendar fourth quarter then November, December time period. Particularly against the backdrop where our consumables are growing nicely our dentist are getting busier which means their practices are performing well. So everything would line up towards I think a very solid 2015, 2016 trend for equipment overall.","Brandon Couillard","And then Ann one for you just in terms of the guidance, it implies unusually wide range of outcomes for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us some color on just the rationale for sort of maintaining the ranges instead of narrowing it a bit with one quarter left?","Ann Gugino","Certainly we've adjusted our guidance range in the past. But at this time we think it makes most sense to keep our original guidance range for 2015. We had a really strong first half of the year and then primarily due to uncontrollable factors like [179] we came in lower than last year in the third quarter. So we believe it's prudent to just maintain the range that we've set. We've tried to share with you the various items that can affect our EPS one way or other. But I would just say our expectation is to turn in a strong performance for the fiscal year and we're confident we can deliver on the fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question is from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Robert Willoughby","Scott on the acquisition front is there any change to you view from a veterinary standpoint whether will capitalize player and the sector also looking to do deals through the MDWI merger. And how would you characterize some of the seller expectations overseas for some of the dental assets that you mentioned given divergent economies and currency issues?","Scott Anderson","Yes, I think we will absolutely be a player on the acquisition front in the animal health space and see multiple opportunities both in the North American market and abroad, I would say teller expectations for dental when you look at international global perspective are very rationale.","As I said on past calls and at Analyst Days, we have very good relationships with many of the large international distributors and would see Patterson as a strong strategic partner and exit partner for some of those businesses when it becomes the appropriate time for the family owner. So, when I look at the M&A pipeline and you never can predict exact timing, I think there is plenty of opportunity in front for Patterson and we\u2019re absolutely well capitalized to act on multiple opportunities that are going to be in front of us.","Robert Willoughby","And on the vet side with ABC in the fray all of our companies have cited opportunities to consolidate in the vet sector, I mean how are [the seller] expectations there?","Scott Anderson","I would say it's too early to say Bob, obviously that was an interesting evaluation and probably something we won\u2019t comment on here in the short-term. But the vet space is a great space and there is a scarcity of assets. So, I think it's a great space to be in and we\u2019ll just continue to build relationships. Our President of our vet business George is very well respected; George Henriques and we think we\u2019ll be at the table for multiple deals on the -- in the years ahead.","Robert Willoughby","And maybe just lastly on the dividend payout, I see it's kind of down year-over-year at absolute dollar terms as your fiscal year-end a time to revisit that a logical time for him to revisit the dividend?","Ann Gugino","Yes, you're right, we typically revisited at year-end here and we typically announced an increase in the next quarter, our plan is to generally grow that with spring overtime. So I think you can expect an increase. As it relates to the current quarter, it's really a timing issue, and you\u2019ll see a little bit bigger payment in the next quarter, but it's the timing issue in the current quarter.","Scott Anderson","Yes, as a reminder, we raised the dividend 25% last year, so just the timing issue.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Ann, I wanted to start with you a question on margin, just as I adjust for the stock option expense and I think these are the issues that I have from last year to create a tough comp this quarter, once I adjusted those it still looks like to me dental margins were kind of flat in the quarter where consumables were up nicely and equipment down -- I am just having trouble kind of reconciling that even if that having a little trouble understanding if the shift to agency should help margins but those margins even adjusting for the stock option issues, looked flat to down in the quarter. Can you help you out why the margin is down in periods where both those segments should have been held?","Ann Gugino","Yes, I think there are lot of moving pieces in the margin so let me just take your question one by one and as it relates to the vet segment, I think what you're seeing there is just a mix between NVS and U.S. but on the consolidated rates. So, we\u2019re up about 10 basis points over prior year consolidated. But if you look at the individual segments, but you can\u2019t see both are up, so it's really a mix issue because NVS growth outpaced the U.S. growth this quarter. As it relates to the U.S., we might need to take that offline and just take a look at your math because I show that we\u2019re actually up.","On an operating margin in the dental business, when I [indiscernible] up just slightly. I think in terms of the consumable mix you're right, you\u2019d expect that to drop through because of the equipment, what I would tell you is that as a result of the equipment being lower our financing income was also lower which is pretty profitable, so it's kind of a double whammy when we have a reduction in equipment, so my guess is that\u2019s where the [dealt] is.","Jeff Johnson","And Scott I guess I guess just one bigger picture question on the CEREC doubling that penetration here over the next five years which I think we\u2019d all like to see happen, but every survey we\u2019ve done, every survey we've have ever seen kind of points to pricing is the biggest hurdle on CEREC on a $100,000 box and to double that penetration at least by our math it looks like you\u2019d have to literally increase your annual penetration by three to four folds, that\u2019s a huge move. For that to happen, do you think you can do it selling the high end CEREC system north of a $100,000 or does that have to come down, just it's a big move and I guess I am struggling to see how you make that move at these pricing dynamics things like that?","Scott Anderson","Yes, Jeff, it's a big move and it's also an aspirational goal for the company and for our sales people and for our customers, but at the same time this is going to be an evolving market over the next five years, you're going to see a lot of innovation come out of Sirona. It is interesting because we do have products at multiple price points currently and still well over 95% of our sales are at the high-end because of the feature and benefits of the [omni-cam] and the full chair side compliment as well as the return on investment, as we now have almost 16,000 CEREC users and U.S. and Canada and have an incredibly lower return rate and consistently what you see is while it is a high ASP there probably is no piece of equipment a dentist can invest in that brings a higher return to the practice and more patient satisfaction in terms of the single visit. So yes, there are absolutely changes in and to only accelerating to that type of rate of getting 2000 to 3000 to 4000 CEREC sales a year. But at the same time if you look at tipping points and adoptions of technologies CEREC is right at that point where we believe this technology is absolutely the future and can take off and we're going to do everything on our end and to make that happen.","Operator","And our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger ","I had a question about the diagnostic component of your vet business. Obviously you only had a one month impact here. But can you talk a little bit more about how long you think it will take to really rev up your placements in Abaxis machines and ultimately how long you think it'll take to before that becomes a bottom line growth driver for you again I the vet business.","Scott Anderson","Yes John I'll take that and just to baseline everyone as a reminder, we launched our relationship with Abaxis on October 1st, we've gone through full training of our salesforce, we also entered in a relationship with [Antec] during the third quarter representing the external reference Lab at [Antec]. And I would say we're very pleased that our early success in December, January and I'll also note if you're at the NADC meeting in January in Orlando by far in my six years of attending that convention it was the busiest I've ever seen our booth and we have a lot of interest in the Abaxis product.","That being said this is going to take time, it's not going be a case of clear winner and losers in one quarter, I'd say we're very pleased with our placements in the third quarter and for competitive reasons we won't give that number. But I think you'll start seeing an impact in our fiscal '16 and beyond and we're excited about the relationship and I think our salesforce is absolutely excited and up to the challenge of helping make Abaxis a real big time player in the veterinary space.","John Kreger","And then one follow-up on the medical businesses. It sounds like that business is performing a lot better. Now that you\u2019ve sort of restructured the portfolio and you're seeing some underlying growth. Where do you think you can get the margin in that business back to, it's been a lot higher longer term, is this something you can get 15% of better EBITDA line.","Ann Gugino","Yes I think that\u2019s about right. So if you look at the current quarter, the margins are down sequentially, but that\u2019s a really seasonality issue. So if you probably looked at year over year and quarter over quarter I should say the margins are actually up slightly. So Q3 is our lowest sales volume quarter but if you look at it on an annual basis we'll be in a low to mid-teens this year and I think you're right targeting about 15% for FY '16 is reasonable.","Scott Anderson","I think there are other opportunities and Mike and his team are doing that in terms of how we structure the business. We made some investments in that business three four years ago to build out infrastructure to really serve with the centralized model with similar to dental invent and as that market evolved over the last three to four years driven by changes in the Affordable Healthcare Act we've also begun to adjust the business model. So there is multiple levers that the team can act on drive improved operating margin overtime and then with that business you get the tailwind and volume increases that will absolutely see benefit from scale as well.","John Kreger","And Scott do you think those businesses are actually growing now, not your business but those underlying markets at this point. I know you said they are improving some.","Scott Anderson","I think we're starting to see some growth, we're now the third consecutive quarter of growth, it's a medical business. And there is some segmentation inside that business, our acute care hospital business is growing very nicely and I think there are seeing definitely some underlying market growth and increased utilization.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette ","Couple of questions here I guess first when thinking about the tax incentive issue for dental I just want to confirm that it seems less likely there be an over achievement of equipment sales in the upcoming fiscal 4Q '15 because obviously the incentive went away on December 31. You'd probably have to wait until your next fiscal 3Q '16 to get some tax inside of upside again of course assuming that incentive put in place again and hopefully on a more timely basis at the end of calendar '15. Is that the right way to sort of think about this whole thing?","Scott Anderson","Absolutely yes Steve you\u2019ve got it perfectly Steve.","Steven Valiquette","Okay so quick follow up on that Ann is that Sirona on their earnings call they mentioned that they were hearing from distributors the 2015 is start about better with the section 179 incentive in place. I'm not sure why that would be the case given our chronology and the incentive expiring back on December 31. So this maybe a tough question but do you know what they might have been referring to when they made that comment about from the point of distributors, things getting better in early calendar \u201915.","Scott Anderson","So I think sales have gotten off to a nice start in 2015, but I don\u2019t think its tax related, it's just more the normal course of business. So as I said once we got into January it wasn\u2019t like there was a spill over effect, but our January sales were right on the internal plan, we\u2019re off to a nice start in February. But the tax related issue would really apply I think more to the latter half of the year.","Steven Valiquette","I may have missed this earlier, but the dental consumables growth in fiscal 3Q likely benefitted from EV comps due to weather given the problems last January, is there any way to quantify that benefit maybe one percentage point or so lift that you might have got due to easy weather comps in fiscal 3Q is that reasonable?","Scott Anderson","I would say that the tougher comps or the larger weather impact for us were really February and March last year and it was really driven around the severe weather in the southeast in the Ohio Valley, of course it is a bit ironic to talk about that today when most of the country is below zero and they are having a tough sled here for a few days. But we would see a potential tailwind, we didn\u2019t quantify last year but we talked about the number of days our distribution centers were closed which were a complete anomaly to prior year\u2019s. I will take you in the Midwest, we\u2019ve had a very mild winter, so there definitely is some weather tailwind potential, we probably thought the [indiscernible] of it in January and brought to a nice start in February in terms of our consumable growth as well.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.","Ethan Roth","This is Ethan Roth on for Jon. A couple of questions here, just the first a follow-up on the guidance being unchanged which implies a ever wide range for 4Q, if the underlying consumables markets are stable and maybe even improving slightly, can you just give us any direction on what could cause you to finish the year at the high end or the low end?","Scott Anderson","Yes, I\u2019ll start; I would say the high end would be driven by strong dental equipment performance and potentially some health performance on the consumable side particularly dental consumables. That being said, I think as we said last quarter, we are fairly comfortable that we can mitigate some underperformance to meet the midpoint of our range. Ann you want to add any additional color to that?","Ann Gugino","No, I think you nailed it.","Ethan Roth","And then just a question on vet equipment, the year-to-date it looks to be down modestly, the division put a pretty big growth numbers in the past and has been an area of focus for Patterson, give us any color of your expectations for that equipment to return to kind of that double-digit growth rate like when can we expect to see that occur? Thanks.","Scott Anderson","We anticipate a strong end to the year and feel good about our pipeline. We are going through the learning process too with our sales force on how to sell and prospect and build pipelines in capital equipment and also sell higher end equipment like the cone beam machine we sell which is well over $100,000. So, I would say our progress is very good and we would definitely see look for strong growth in the fourth quarter and have high expectations into our new fiscal year for vet equipment sales.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Scott Anderson for additional remarks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Doug. We\u2019re pleased with our progress that we made during the third quarter across our strategic initiatives which is meaningful steps for its further solidifying and broadening our partnerships in ways that allow us to deliver more value to our customers. We think we\u2019re well positioned as we enter our last quarter to deliver strong performance for fiscal year 2015. We continue to focus on capitalizing on the growth opportunities that lie ahead and enhancing our products and services. Thanks everyone for being on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you next week in Chicago.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference, Thank you for your participation."],"16822":["Patterson Companies, Inc.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ann Gugino. Please go ahead.","Ann Gugino","Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Patterson Companies\u2019 fiscal 2015 first quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Scott Anderson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Armstrong, our Executive Vice President and CFO. After a brief review of the quarter by management, we will open the call up to your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that certain comments made during the course of this conference call are forward-looking in nature and subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These factors are discussed in detail in our Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to review this material.","Also since Regulation FD prohibits us from providing investors with earnings guidance unless we release that information simultaneously, we have provided financial guidance for fiscal 2015 in our press release and financial slide presentation that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Be advised that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at 12 p.m. Central Time for a period of one week.","With that, I would like to hand the call over to Scott Anderson. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thank you, Ann and welcome everyone to this morning\u2019s conference call. As you saw in today\u2019s earnings release, Patterson Companies\u2019 consolidated revenues rose more than 20% in the fiscal 2015 first quarter. We are pleased with the trends we saw in the period and the business performed within our expectations. We are confident that we will continue to execute well and sustain solid gains through the remainder of the fiscal year. With the actions we took in fiscal 2014 to increase our efficiency coupled with the long-term investments we are making to build on our capabilities, we have positioned Patterson Companies for future success.","So, with that as a backdrop, let\u2019s take a look at our operational performance in the first quarter starting with dental. This business which accounts for a little more than half of our total sales experienced sales growth in both consumables and basic equipment. Sales for Patterson Dental improved slightly from a year ago on a constant currency basis to $556 million, while the negative impact of currency exchange reduced reported sales to $552.7 million. We were pleased to see positive trends in sales of dental consumables, which increased by 2.5% from the prior year on a constant currency basis.","Basic equipment growth, which includes chairs, units and cabinetry, was also strong posting double-digit gains in the fiscal first quarter. This marked our third consecutive quarter of solid basic equipment growth. New unit sales of the CEREC Omnicam also grew nicely and posted double-digit year-over-year gains. Patterson continues to win in competitive CAD\/CAM sales situations with Omnicam leading the way. However, this growth in new CEREC units and basic equipment did not offset the sales associated with the Omnicam trade-up program in the first quarter of the prior year that resulted from orders taken at the time of the introduction of the Omnicam in the fall of calendar 2012. As a reminder, we began delivering on this trade-up program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and since that time we have upgraded more than 2,000 customers from Bluecam to Omnicam. This first program was a tremendous success.","One of the great things about the CEREC family of products is the ability for the dentists to grow into new CEREC technologies over time. We will see this continue to play out with our large CEREC user base, but today our focus is primarily on new users. Sirona recently announced the release of its version 4.3 software for CEREC. This is another exciting leap forward for our CEREC users and takes the Omnicam to an even higher level of functionality and ease-of-use. In conjunction with Sirona, we held a technology summit in July for our CEREC sales force and equipment specialists. The feedback on the new software has been tremendous both internally and with our CEREC trainers who are power users of the product in their own dental practices. Our sales force is very committed to delivering the benefits of digital dentistry to the practitioner.","Our CEREC customers have a very high level of satisfaction across both the Omnicam and Bluecam user base. This gives us even more confidence as to the exciting future ahead for this aspect of digital dentistry. We are the proven leader in dental equipment in the dental equipment market offering best-in-class technology and basic equipment that we enhanced with Patterson\u2019s industry leading after sales support platform. The growth prospects from our technology offerings combined with the fact that there is considerable opportunity for dentists to invest in their practices position us well going forward.","Moving next to Patterson Veterinary, which compromises more than one-third of total sales. First sales for this unit increased nearly 94% from the prior year period to $386.3 million. Performance was solid in the U.S., where sales rose nearly 7% to $212.7 million. The U.S. experienced an increase in consumable veterinary sales of medications and supplies of more than 7% partially driven by the later arrival of the warmer spring weather. Sales of equipment were in line with the prior year levels as we continue to execute against our strategy to be a national provider of veterinary equipment and services.","We had another quarter of strong contributions from NVS, our UK-based veterinary business as the unit contributed $173.6 million to consolidated sales and $0.02 to earnings per diluted share. In addition to the contributions from new customers acquired since we made this acquisition just one year ago, this quarter\u2019s performance was boosted by the more intense flea and tick season that resulted from the warmer and drier weather in the United Kingdom. NVS continues to perform well. We are pleased with the integration process and execution from the talented group of personnel that we have in place there.","On a final note for Patterson Veterinary, I would like to review recent developments regarding IDEXX Laboratories. Late in July, IDEXX informed Patterson that as of January 1, 2015, it will move to a direct distribution model for all its veterinary products in the United States rather than selling through distributors. We estimate that this change unmitigated could impact earnings by $0.04 to $0.05 per share annually with the greatest impact occurring in Patterson\u2019s fiscal fourth and first quarters due to the seasonal usage of many of these products. However, we believe we are well-positioned for this transition due to the diversification of our business and the infrastructure investments that we have made. As a result, we do not believe these actions will have a material impact on fiscal 2015 earnings.","We are exploring various alternatives for replacing these important needs for our customers and expect to mitigate the impact of this change. While we are disappointed by IDEXX\u2019s distribution decision, we are very focused on devoting the necessary resources to manage this transition and we are excited by the opportunities we see to form new partnerships and help our customers. We look forward to updating you later in the fall on our efforts and providing you more visibility into our transition plan.","So, before I move to medical, let me reiterate our go-forward strategy for veterinary. We continue to execute against our strategy to enhance both our equipment and technical service offerings in order to take advantage of favorable marketplace dynamics as pet ownership and the dollar amount people invest in veterinary care for their pets continues to grow. Veterinarians will require sophisticated equipment and capabilities in their clinics and hospitals to meet this market need and Patterson will be there to support them.","Turning now to Patterson Medical, our rehabilitation supply and equipment unit, which now represents approximately 11% of total company revenues. The business performed in line with our expectations for the period. Sales in the fiscal first quarter were flat with prior year levels after accounting for the planned divestitures of non-core product lines that we began in the fiscal first quarter of 2014. With the divestitures now behind us, we have aligned our business around those areas that have the highest strategic value and where we can demonstrate a core competency.","We are also excited about the new leadership in this division and the approach they are taking to reposition the business in our selected markets. Notably, during the quarter, we are pleased to welcome Ian Thomas, a seasoned professional who has held international senior leadership positions with premier healthcare organizations to head up our international group. Given our substantial industry leadership as well as our extensive branded and proprietary product and service offerings, Patterson Medical is poised to capture additional share as market conditions stabilize.","Next, I would like to cover our corporate wide information technology initiative. As I have previously stated, we have undertaken this effort in order to support the company\u2019s future growth, further enhance the customer experience, and secure productivity gains going forward. We see this as a 5-year effort to overhaul our primary systems and strengthen our internal business processes. The project thus far is on schedule and in scope. We are taking a phased approach and have completed the blueprinting stage of our IT investments. Now, we are in the design and building phase of the projects. We will update you in the coming quarters as we begin piloting and implementation.","Our information technology investment is critical to improve scale in our business platform and provide Patterson with the flexibility to adjust as opportunities warrant, in order to accommodate growth. Our customers will continue to benefit from these improvements as we further execute on this strategy. We are reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30 per diluted share for fiscal 2015. The base assumption we used to build that range remain, stable North American and international markets with conditions similar to fiscal 2014, no impact from additional share repurchases that may occur during the year, the long-term extension of the $250 million of debt that is due in March and no material acquisitions during the year. We believe the recent distribution change announced by IDEXX Laboratories will not materially impact our fiscal 2015 outlook. We fully expect to mitigate the potential reduction from this move.","Before I turn the call over to Steve, I would like to take a moment to talk about an announcement we made in June. As we announced, Steve Armstrong will step down as CFO of Patterson at the end of October after more than 15 years with the company. At that time, Ann Gugino will become Patterson\u2019s CFO. Let me take a few moments to comment on this transition and thank Steve for his time at Patterson. Over the past 15 years, Steve has been instrumental in helping to manage the company during the period of substantial growth and transformation. He has provided Patterson with exceptional counsel during his tenure and is highly respected by his colleagues of Patterson, our Board of Directors, the financial community and our shareholders. Steve has helped build our strong financial platform as well as strategically position the company for the future. And I am personally grateful for his support throughout my career, particularly since I became CEO.","While we are sad to see an old friend leave, we are equally excited to have Ann assume the CFO role. She has been a key leader in both financial management and strategic planning for Patterson for more than a decade and we are excited to have Ann move into this position. Steve recognized her considerable talents and brought her into Patterson nearly 15 years ago. With her deep understanding of Patterson\u2019s operations, for business and financial acumen and her ability to interact with our shareholders and the financial community, we know that this will be a smooth transition and look forward to her immediate contributions.","With that, I will ask Steve to review the financials. Steve?","Steve Armstrong","Thank you, Scott. Before I begin the financial review and since this is my final earnings call as CFO, I guess I get to take a minute to extend my appreciation to you, Scott, and the Patterson organization for making the past decade and a half an extremely satisfying and professional personal experience. Patterson\u2019s focus on exceptional customer service, a spirit of innovation and a commitment to long-term value creation all within a culture grounded in integrity and fairness provided a terrific opportunity for me. Obviously, you and the investment community have been a big part of my last 15 years as well and believe it or not, I will actually miss working with you. I have enjoyed it immensely. Let me also say, I have the utmost confidence in Ann. Many of you already know her and will have a chance to work with her in the coming months. I look forward to continuing to work with Scott and Ann to complete the transition.","With that, let me review the financial results and please note this represents the last full quarter that National Veterinary Services, or NVS, acquisition will have \u2013 will impact the year-over-year comparison since the acquisition was completed just a year ago. For comparative purposes, my comments that follow will generally exclude the results of NVS unless otherwise noted. In this morning\u2019s earnings press release, we have provided our consolidated operating metrics based on our reported results as well as adjusted to exclude the impact of the NVS acquisition. In the press release, we also have provided operating profit by segment. So, you don\u2019t have to wait several weeks for our SEC filings to obtain the data.","And one final note, beginning this fiscal year, we have begun reclassifying or classifying dental hand pieces as a consumable sale consistent with the remainder of the market. We reclassified last year\u2019s amounts for comparability, but I would note that there is negligible impact on the growth percentages for the respective categories for the current period. During the quarter, the impact of foreign currency exchange on revenue growth was unfavorable in the dental segment by 60 basis points, by 140 basis points in the medical segment.","Our consolidated sales growth was negatively impacted by 20 basis points from currency. Fiscal first quarter consolidated gross margins improved 30 basis points from the prior year. Improvements in the dental and medical division gross margins were partially offset by decline in the veterinary margins. The changes in gross margins within the divisions were generally the result of mix changes, while we also experienced some reduction in rebates within the veterinary segment.","Looking at our consolidated operating expense ratio, we saw 40 basis points of increase resulting primarily from the timing of the recognition of performance-based compensation expense between periods. We believe our operating expense ratio will improve throughout the year with an overall improvement for the fiscal year after excluding the prior year restructuring charges in the medical division. By segment, our first quarter adjusted operating margins were 9.6% for dental, 4.6% for veterinary and 14.6% for medical. Note that the operating margin for the dental segment absorbed the majority of the compensation expense grants, I mentioned earlier.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fiscal first quarter was 35.6%, an 80 basis point decrease from the prior year. As our tax rate for the full fiscal year is expected to decline, we are anticipating an annual tax rate between 34.5% and 35% for fiscal 2015. This lower rate when compared to fiscal 2014 is due to the unfavorable impact of the restructuring costs on our prior year rate as well as the change in the mix of the international versus domestic taxable income, which will have a favorable impact on the tax rate. Again, not including NVS, our DSO were at 44 days, a slight increase from the prior year\u2019s 42 days for the first quarter, while inventory turns were at 6.5 compared to 6.8 one year ago.","Two items of note on our balance sheet, beginning with accounts receivable, the sales volume on our fourth quarter is generally higher than that of the subsequent first quarter. Our accounts receivable balance will generally decrease during the first quarter as the higher level of sales from the fourth quarter turn through the balance sheet. This is a historical trend that continues. Second, our inventories have increased compared to our year end balances. This increase is due to a combination of factors beginning with our historic factors building our consumable inventories during our operating year to improve service levels. We reduced our inventory level at year end to minimize the impact of our LIFO computations. Also, the veterinary segment is carrying additional product under buy\/sell arrangements this year that were previously sold under agency agreements, which do not require the distributor to carry inventory. Finally, our dental equipment inventories have increased as we manage the more complicated supply channel for several of the technology products that we sell. We would expect our inventory levels to moderate as we approach our fiscal year end.","In fiscal 2015 first quarter, our cash flow from operations totaled $69 million compared to $21 million in the year ago period. The prior year quarter was negatively impacted by the timing of payments of taxes and accounts payable. We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $20 million to our shareholders. Also, we repurchased approximately $1.1 million shares of our common stock with the value of $43.9 million leaving approximately 21 million shares available under our current authorization.","Our CapEx in the first quarter totaled $16.7 million and included payments for the normal replacements, as well as the ERP project. For fiscal 2015 full year, we are currently estimating CapEx of approximately $45 million. Over half of this amount is directly related to the ERP system.","With that, I will turn it back to Scott. Scott?","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Steve. As we have progressed through fiscal 2015, we believe we can continue to capture market share as we exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. Our very strong strategic partnerships continue to grow and strengthen across all of our businesses. And enhanced by Patterson\u2019s unparallel service and support platform, we continue to receive very positive feedback from our customers.","We entered the year with a conservative view of our markets due to the relatively soft performances in the global economies. We expect conditions in our markets to remain the same as they were in fiscal 2014. While we are starting to see stability in certain areas, we continue to take a guarded approach to the economic environment. That said, we are confident in our ability to execute in any economic environment. With a streamlined and more efficient organization, we believe we have positioned Patterson for the future. And we continue to be bullish on the long-term prospects for our company.","Now, we would like to take your questions. I will turn the call over to April.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will first hear from John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair","Hi, thanks very much. Scott, I just got follow-up maybe on your market environment question. If you think about your basic dental equipment trends in the past, dental office build-outs have been a big part of that. Well, how does your pipeline look, any signs of improving demand on that front?","Scott Anderson","Yes, John, great question. As I said, we are very encouraged to see three straight quarters of growth from basic equipment, but I would also sort of send out a reminder that the basic equipment category industry wide in North America has not yet recovered to pre-2008 levels, but we are encouraged, because we are starting to see an increase in our dental furniture and cabinetry lines, which typically are associated with office remodels and new office build-out. So, I would say, we are cautiously optimistic about our pipeline and our prospects going into the heavy selling season, which as you know is during the later fall winter times.","John Kreger - William Blair","Great, thank you. And then the strong growth you are seeing in your UK vet business, do you think that\u2019s sustainable? And if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what drove such a nice sequential uptick?","Scott Anderson","I think it was two things. One, the group really hit the ground one running post acquisition almost a year ago. They have had some nice customer wins. We also absolutely benefited in the quarter from a milder summer time in the UK. So, I would not say that the current growth rate is sustainable. But what I am excited about is we have a strong competitive position. And we think we have some strategic opportunities to expand the portfolio in terms of things we bring to our UK customers. So, we really one year and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the performance that\u2019s coming from our UK group.","John Kreger - William Blair","Great. And one last quick one, when do you expect medical to start growing again?","Scott Anderson","I would say fairly soon. The thing I would say about our medical business in the quarter and give our management team over there a pat on the back is they really have stabilized the business. They are implementing growth strategies. They have sort of retooled their United States management team. We have got a great leader now over in our international group. So, Mike Orscheln, our President and his team are absolutely focused on growth. I would say, from a market perspective and as I have said many times before, that\u2019s been the toughest underlying market of the three businesses we have. It seems like that the fog is starting to clear and the underlying markets are beginning to firm up. And we really like our competitive position and the competitive advantage we have in the physical therapy rehab business. So, that is absolutely the expectation for that team as to start showing revenue growth going forward. They did a great job managing the business and streamlining the business. So, from a bottom line perspective, it was a very nice quarter for our medical group.","John Kreger - William Blair","Great. Thanks much.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, John.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Robert Willoughby of Bank of America.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","Scott and who is the CFO again? Steve. In a prior dialogue, Scott, you had mentioned that there was some urgency around the whole kind of addressing the valuation discrepancy aspect from the other dental constituents, where do you stand on that front? This looks like a strong quarter here or just a shot straight down the fairway here, but what\u2019s different about the approach to the balance sheet or the business mix with these results?","Scott Anderson","Well, since this is last call, I\u2019ll let the CFO start and I will give color after that. His name is Steve by the way.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","Steve, Steve, yes.","Steve Armstrong","Yes, thank you, Bob. Not much change to the balance sheet other than the inventory build, which we had anticipated some of it because of changes in the underlying market themselves or the businesses, but other than that, not any changes here from my perspective.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","But you had referenced, Steve that you were looking to term out the debt $250 million debt that\u2019s coming due, prospects for raising more than that and buying some stock back, given the valuation here or looking at the strategic fit of all the businesses, thoughts to potentially monetize some assets?","Steve Armstrong","Bob, we historically run this balance sheet fairly lean or conservative I guess is how I would term it. We do intend to term out the $250 million that comes due in March of \u201815. Adding more debt will sort of depend upon what happens in the acquisition market as we get deeper into the year, what we see going into \u201816. And obviously that\u2019s an opportunity, that\u2019s a card we can play. We just don\u2019t intend to play it in the short-term to leverage up the balance sheet just to buyback shares.","Scott Anderson","And I would add to that, Bob, the maximization of the portfolio is our key driving strategic intent. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we felt the IT investments were so critical as to drive even more efficiency in the organization. And we have got three great franchises and it\u2019s our job to get full value out of all three. So, we continually evaluate the businesses and the fit and the strategic opportunities going forward for our shareholders.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","Scott, you made reference that of the medical business itself, can we expect that to continue to rebound sequentially from a revenue perspective and can we expect profitability for that business to move higher as well this year?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I think we will see revenue growth, I wouldn\u2019t predict a big snapback, but that\u2019s a business that I feel right now is very well run, has a good strategic plan and has a strong team in terms of execution. So, absolutely we would look that, look for the medical business to be more of a tailwind than a headwind like it has been the last 24 months.","Steve Armstrong","Yes, this is Steve, the CFO. Just to remind everyone that there is a \u2013 we have got a bit of a headwind on that division, growth maybe disguised a little bit. We are anticipating growth from the underlying business, but we have got some divestitures that we will have to overcome throughout the year. So, I think we alerted everybody it would be about a 4 point to 5 point drag going into the year. So, Scott\u2019s comments, I am just trying to qualify, so that everybody understand that there is that drag.","Scott Anderson","Yes, but the underlying business absolutely growing.","Robert Willoughby - Bank of America","Okay, thank you.","Scott Anderson","","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Next we will hear from Kevin Ellich, Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Steve, it\u2019s been great working with you. Everyone is going to miss you. Hope you have a fun time in retirement, living on the lake and hunting hopefully. Moving on to the dental segment, you guys reclassified some products from equipment into consumables. Just wondering why you did that now? And then you called out dental hand pieces, wondering what type of margins you guys see on those types of products and what other products were reclassified besides dental hand pieces?","Scott Anderson","Yes. It was predominantly dental hand pieces and that\u2019s pretty consistent to how the whole industry classifies hand pieces. We felt it was a more efficient way to go to market through our territory sales representatives. We also brought on the cable line of hand pieces from Danaher last year in the quarter. So, we feel like we are a little underrepresented on the hand piece side and we will put a big focus on that. It really had no material impact in the quarter and the sundries number has been restated. So, our 2.5% sundries growth, which we feel is definitely growing faster than the market is a real solid number and it was very consistent across geography and product. So, we are excited about our hand piece opportunities going forward.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Got it. So, just to be clear, Scott, if on an apples-to-apples, if you didn\u2019t make this reclassification, consumables would have been up 2.5% still?","Scott Anderson","Absolutely, yes.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Okay, got it.","Scott Anderson","Yes.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","And then you called out Sirona\u2019s new software that they rolled out the 4.3 version. Just wondering what does it do that the previous version didn\u2019t do and I guess why do the dentists like it so much?","Scott Anderson","Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into the weeds on this, but there are some features in terms of margination and digital capture that actually were a little more efficient with the Bluecam than the Omnicam and that \u2013 so the former Bluecam users missed that feature when they went to Omnicam, yet the new Omnicam users had never experienced that so they were fine with that. So, that really makes the leap from Blue to Omni even more intriguing for our Bluecam user base. It also is a much improved digital capture in terms of digital impressioning. So, it really was a homerun from the engineers at Sirona. And like I said, the sales rep feedback from our technology summit was great, but what I was very excited to see was really strong endorsement from the key opinion leaders in the CEREC community, so could not be more excited about the CEREC opportunities as we \u2013 for our customers as we head into the busier selling season here in the fall.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Okay. And then just lastly on the vet business, one, how are the conversations with the other diagnostic manufacturers going? And then two, Steve, I think you made a comment about vet margin was affected by some rebate changes, just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on that front? Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Yes. At this time, I wouldn\u2019t want to give any specific details on any discussions we have other than we feel Patterson brings really unique capabilities to the market, both in terms of our technical service and support and what we feel is just the premier sales force in the veterinary space. So, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about building new partnerships in that space and I will let Steve give a little color on rebates.","Steve Armstrong","Yes. Kevin, as you know from following this industry and market that there has been a lot of manufacturer shuffling going on, on some of the seasonal products and because of that we were not able to pick up a rebate that we had last year at this time. So, it was more due to the shuffling and new players coming into the marketplace than it was from any of our performance, per se.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Okay. Sounds good. Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Thanks Kevin.","Steve Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","Next we will hear from Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you hear me okay?","Scott Anderson","Yes, hi Jeff.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Hey. So, Steve, I will throw my congrats out there and good luck in retirement as well. It\u2019s been a great 10, 11, I guess, 11, 12 years working together, so good luck to you. Question on the margins if I could, rehab margin, the EBIT margin, up to levels we haven\u2019t seen really I guess since 2009, 2010 or so. Is that being driven by some of the divestitures, how sustainable should we think that is going forward? And then on the dental side, I know on the operating margins, Steve, I think it was you who called out some of the comp costs in there that makes sense. I would think with the mix on the lower upgrades, which I think the upgrades would carry lower margins, I would assume, was that not enough to offset the higher stock comp or the higher comp costs? I am just trying to figure out what drove that margin down maybe the 40 basis points or so it did at the EBIT line this quarter?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Jeff, I will start with medical. I think you are seeing some of the benefits from the actions we took in the fourth quarter to streamline parts of the business. And we have a team that\u2019s very focused, not only on growth, but more importantly profitable growth. So, I don\u2019t think you will see quite as much margin accretion, but you absolutely will see it throughout the year in the medical business and that\u2019s what their plan entails. And I will pop it over to Steve for a little color on the dental business.","Steve Armstrong","Thank you. The dental margins, Jeff, you are correct, they did see some improvement from a lesser amount of trade-up activity, but that came through on the gross margin line. The operating expense was primarily due to some of the changes. There is a number of factors going into it, but the big change year-over-year was just the timing of that performance expense recognition that we had. And that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see the margin improvement there. Strictly a first quarter phenomenon, you won\u2019t see that for the rest of the year.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the CEREC, you gave kind of the two parts, what was up, what was down? I think they were directionally almost exactly opposite last year in this quarter. So, can you help us on a net basis or in the quarter what CEREC did or I guess even more importantly just kind of how are you thinking about the CEREC business as you run through the next four to six quarters or so? Is it a mid single-digit growing business, an upper single-digit growing business or any kind of color you can put on that as we bring the upgrades and the new system component sales together?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Good question, Jeff. I would say from a comparability standpoint, I just want to remind everyone on two things. And that\u2019s a reminder that during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 which was the spring of 2012, we finished a very large trade-up program where we converted red customers, Redcam to the Bluecam. And just as a reminder, that was critical to accomplish before the launch of Omnicam, which happened in the fall of 2012, because the new 4.1 software works only on Blue and Omnicam machines. So, back to first quarter and the spring of 2012, just sort of a blowout CEREC quarter on trade-ups.","Then last year we followed that up with obviously another very strong trade-up performance, where we delivered Omnicams to the Bluecam users, but from a volume perspective, it wasn\u2019t as large as the prior year. So, I think bottom line, just to level sort of everyone, we feel like we are on a great position with our installed base at this point in terms of satisfaction and opportunities going forward. And I think Jeff, you had the good question in terms of there has to be some caution that we don\u2019t get wrapped around the axle on percentages when you talk about the timing of upgrades. So, our direction for our team is to really drive the new user base and we will be doing that this year up against some trade-up comparables, particularly in the second quarter. But at the same time, we still feel like and we know that there is a large opportunity out there to continue to move people from Bluecam to Omnicam. So, it\u2019s a little tough to pinpoint the timing of sales growth, but we will be very focused on new unit growth and winning competitive situations in the market and based off our first quarter results, which I would say were good, but we really could have done better. We really will look to grow that new user base over the year. I hope that helps.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Yes, that does. Thank you. And then last two just very quick ones. ESOP expense, Steve, could you give us that in the quarter? And then just Scott, any monthly trends, it seems like July we are hearing was a pretty decent month. Did that continue into August, but are we coming out of the quarter kind of on a little bit stronger footing than we might have gone into the quarter on?","Scott Anderson","Yes, I will start and then I will turn it over to Steve on ESOP. Yes, we saw sort of a gradual acceleration throughout the quarter, which was good to see and particularly from a consumable standpoint we have seen that continue into August. It\u2019s a little harder to predict obviously the equipment business, but like I said in my answer earlier on basic, we feel like the pipeline is strengthening, so once again, cautiously optimistic as we get August behind us here. And I will have Steve give you some information on ESOP.","Steve Armstrong","Jeff, I mean, we adjusted it last year. I think it was running about $24 million last year, $23 million, $24 million third quarter last year. We told you we are bringing it down as a contribution percentage. So, right now, we are targeting about $11 million to $12 million of annual expense for the ESOP. So, you spread that over the four quarters.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Great. Thanks, guys.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Next we will hear from Michael Cherny of ISI Group.","Elizabeth Anderson - ISI Group","This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Michael. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a\u2026.","Scott Anderson","Could you speak up a little bit? Hey, Elizabeth, can you speak up a little bit?","Elizabeth Anderson - ISI Group","Yes, sorry about that. Is that better?","Scott Anderson","Perfect, thank you.","Elizabeth Anderson - ISI Group","Okay, great. Sorry about that. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit further on the competitive landscape of the CAD\/CAM market. Any changes you guys have seen sequentially or year-over-year?","Scott Anderson","Yes. As I said, we continue to be very pleased with our success rate in head-to-head competitive situations. And I have said this many times that we are very excited about the number of competitor products in the market and feel it\u2019s a really good thing long-term for the CAD\/CAM space as customers have a lot of different options to look at. And also I think this is a very important point. You probably have tripled the number of industry sales people talking about the future of dentistry and how chairside CAD\/CAM is great for the patient and the dentists. So, the advent of multiple products in the marketplace I think has done a great job of really validating the technology. We have been selling chairside CAD\/CAM for over a decade now. And I have said it many times I still think we are probably in the early innings what will be a major transformation for how dentists delivered great dental care and patients benefit from great efficiency and productivity. So, an exciting time in the dental space.","Elizabeth Anderson - ISI Group","Great. And just as a quick follow-up, I was just wondering if you are seeing any pricing impact at all from that competition?","Scott Anderson","I would say minimal pricing impact. It\u2019s \u2013 these are relatively smaller markets. And one of the key things with any product is not only to sell it, but you have the wherewithal to support the customer after the fact. So the economics of being able to drive technology, drive innovation, but also be able to support the customers leads to a fairly balanced pricing environment out there. So, I think it would be very difficult for anyone to have a very aggressive pricing strategy in the space and actually stay in business for very long.","Elizabeth Anderson - ISI Group","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the questions. And Steve, just also want to extend my gratitude for working with us over the years. Looking at the performance in dental equipment in the quarter, quite a bit lower than what we were looking for. I know you guys called about $8 million due to the re-class of the hand pieces. And I know you mentioned also cycling out the CEREC trade-ups from last year. If I missed this, I apologize, but can you quantify what the impact was on the lower trade-ups on sales year-over-year? And then I guess more broadly, I know you are reiterating guidance overall today, but any comments you can share on how the equipment business has been tracking against the original expectations would be helpful?","Scott Anderson","Yes, Bob. We hate to breakout by specific product category, but because of the trade-up comp was so large, I think we will be a little more transparent this quarter, just to make sure there isn\u2019t any confusion or there isn\u2019t anyone who thinks that somehow we are losing market share. It\u2019s hard to lose market share against yourself when the only thing that was down was the trade-up business. So, the new unit business was up double-digits strong. Basic equipment was up double-digits strong. Our digital portfolio was flat, up against a tough comp. So, really the entire shortfall and we won\u2019t give you the exact specifics, but the entire shortfall and negative sales growth was tied to trade-ups versus a program that was wildly successful. So, I would say, all-in-all, we feel very good about the underlying trends of our equipment business. And if anything didn\u2019t track to our internal plan, I think we could have done even more on the new CEREC units, but coming off a very large fourth quarter. Sometimes you have the sales force take a bit of a breath before they move on.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then Scott, you mentioned the IDEXX move to direct distribution and how there is not expected to be a material impact to \u201815. Is there any sense you can give us as far as next year goes? I know it\u2019s a little bit down the road and there is some time to plan, but anything you could share with us as far as how you will offset those losses. I know you have been investing in the sales force there as part of the plan for them to maybe go out and try to start switching vets to competitor products, just trying to get a better sense of the strategy?","Scott Anderson","Yes. Bob, I think it\u2019s too early to talk about those plans. I would say, we will probably have more clarity at our Investor Day in October and on our November call, but it\u2019s a little too early to reach out into next fiscal year.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs","Totally fair. Thanks so much and Steve, enjoy retirement.","Steve Armstrong","Bob, thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next we will hear from Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Alright, thanks. Good morning, Scott and for Steve, let me also say congrats on a great career. Now, I don\u2019t want to beat this dental equipment topic to death here, but it does seem like there is always some volatility in dental equipment sales growth due to timing of CEREC promotions etcetera. And I guess as a sidebar comment, I am trying to figure out which dentists are buying this high-end equipment during the non-promotion periods? But I guess despite the quarterly volatility in your equipment sales, it\u2019s been pretty rare for Patterson to have two quarters in a row, where dental equipment sales are down year-over-year, which is what just happened. And it\u2019s maybe sort of a tough question to answer on the fly, but I guess my question is does it really make sense to continue to have these on\/off cycles for promotions on such a high-end extensive product, where the buyer is probably savvy enough to wait for a promotional deal before buying or upgrading? So I guess I am just trying to understand the promotional strategy here. Thanks.","Scott Anderson","Well, yes, part of the Omnicam demand really wasn\u2019t promotional, it was innovation. And you go back to our quarter, two years ago, our first quarter two years ago, we were up 20%. So, as a reminder, we sell over half the dental equipment in the North American market. And when customer demand is there like it was for Omnicam, we are going to meet that demand in a perfect world. I am sure we would love to just have smooth 7% to 8%, 9%, 10% growth every quarter, but this was really the launch of a new innovative product that we have thousands of orders for in the fall of 2012. And just from a supply chain perspective couldn\u2019t get those orders in until we had enough supply of product. So, you are right, our goal is to sell the product and help Sirona smooth out their supply chain as well. But when you have a product that was as hot as Omnicam was. And just as a reminder, that 20% quarter we had two years ago, that was moving people from Redcam to Bluecam, which was critical to the success of Omnicam that, that volatility just comes with the territory of being the distributor of the best CAD\/CAM product in the world.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Okay. How much of the promotional strategy is driven by Patterson versus Sirona? And then also are you maybe feeling more pressure to do promotions this year if the competitive landscape has become a bit more intense for chairside CAD\/CAM crown restoration systems?","Scott Anderson","Yes. We, for over a decade, we plan our marketing and sales strategy in conjunction with Sirona. So, we work as one team on that. Obviously, with more competitors, you will see different types of incentives and opportunities. At the end of the day, though the technology wins out and I think that\u2019s why CEREC continues to have a dominant market share, not only in the North America, but globally, it is the product of choice.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","Okay, got it. Okay, alright, thanks.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Next, we will hear from Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon Block - Stifel","Great. Thanks and good morning. The vast majority of my questions have been answered. I will sort of drill down on two or three within the vet space. The first one, Steve, you called out 7% growth in the U.S. ex-NVS on the consumable side, but you also called out some products moving from agency to buy\/sell. So, does that aid the reported revenue growth of 7%? And if so, does that exist for the next sort of three quarters until we lap it?","Steve Armstrong","The impact of the buy\/sell really had no impact on our overall growth rate. It was a movement between primarily buy\/sell vendors for us. So, we had new buy\/sell product coming in, but it was basically cannibalizing buy\/sell who was already there. So it really had no effect on our growth. Our 7% is based on dosages and we look at dosages and that\u2019s really what \u2013 where the growth comes from.","Jon Block - Stifel","Understood.","Steve Armstrong","It\u2019s revenue-based, but we confirm that with the dosages going out the door as well.","Jon Block - Stifel","Understood. So, it wasn\u2019t agency to buy\/sell within a manufacturer per se, it was buy\/sell to buy\/sell amongst different manufacturers?","Steve Armstrong","That\u2019s correct.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay, okay. And then I think Bob touched on this question earlier maybe I will try to ask it a different way, but you talked several times about mitigating the impact from losing the IDEXX line. Is mitigating specific to fiscal 2015, because you are really only exposed for a stub, call it several months, since IDEXX is terminating the deal Jan 1, 2015 or is it mitigating in the context of you guys feel very confident that you will be able to fill the void with the loss of the relationship?","Scott Anderson","Yes, good question. For clarification, we feel like we can mitigate the stub in terms of our fiscal year and then we are fully committed to being a great partner to different manufacturers going forward and that will play out over time. So, I think it\u2019s too early to say right now we will mitigate the entire impact in the next fiscal year, but that would be our intent and that would be our strategy.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay.","Steve Armstrong","Jon, our estimate for the entire year, Scott mentioned it earlier, is $0.04 to $0.05. There is a lot of ways to make up $0.04 to $0.05 when you put your mind to it and when you have got your organization focused on it.","Jon Block - Stifel","Understood, understood. And last one, Scott, you talked about strategy and different ways to fill it. I guess what\u2019s unique in the vet space and in clinic diagnostics, is there really only two possibly three manufacturers that have some mind share within the vet practices and one obviously is going direct and two already has, number two already has a pre-existing relationship with MWI. So, if we take a step back and for some reason, the number two player stuck exclusively with MWI, could you talk to maybe what plan B is for Patterson? In other words, would you go ahead and possibly source this product yourself or what is that other alternative? Thanks guys.","Scott Anderson","Well, I don\u2019t want to get into details right now other than the fact that we feel like we have multiple options, but at the same time, we feel like from a manufacturer perspective, Patterson is a very unique partner in terms of our sales force and our infrastructure and our commitment to not only selling technology, which is a core competency, but more importantly, supporting it after the fact. So, I would say, there will be a lot of potential manufacturers, if we did not have product that would definitely be at our front doorstep looking at how we could grow together in the North American market.","Jon Block - Stifel","Understood. Thanks for your time guys.","Scott Anderson","Thank you.","Steve Armstrong","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","And our final question for today will come from Ross Taylor of C.L. King.","Ross Taylor - C.L. King","Hi. I had a couple of questions related to the vet business as well. But first, do you think that change in IDEXX\u2019s distribution strategy will create any M&A opportunities with the smaller regional distributors in the vet sector?","Scott Anderson","Potentially. We feel like we are a great strategic fit for many business owners and we have a history of culturally really moving companies forward when they join the Patterson family. And you look at our history both in dental and vet, when the time is right for some of these companies we would love to be the place where owners would entrust their business long-term. But I would say, our absolute laser focus right now is not on that, it\u2019s on taking care of our customers and building new relationships going forward.","Ross Taylor - C.L. King","Okay. And just a second and final question related to vet, you all have probably had a little bit more experience with the new Merck product, BRAVECTO, maybe close to two months of experience with that. But how is that performing out in the marketplace now and is there any difference in how you go to market or sell that product compared to the other oral flea and tick product, NexGard?","Scott Anderson","I think it\u2019s been an exciting year for innovation. And one of the things you always want to see from a distribution standpoint is that manufacturers are investing in R&D and they are moving the profession forward with unique products that help both pet owner and pet and improve efficiency. So, I would say it\u2019s \u2013 ever since the NAVC, where a lot of these were launched, it\u2019s been a great year of innovation. And I think you will continue to see that in the vet space as you have more, I think industry focus by some of these pharmaceutical companies on animal health in general. So, it\u2019s been all positive to-date.","Ross Taylor - C.L. King","Okay, good. Thanks very much.","Steve Armstrong","Thanks Ross.","Operator","And there are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.","Scott Anderson","Thanks, April. During the fiscal first quarter, we made progress on our strategic initiatives to improve on our offerings, the best-in-class product innovation and services in order to fuel growth. We are focused on capitalizing on growth opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to updating you as we move forward into fiscal 2014. As a reminder, we are hosting our Annual Investor Day in New York on October 1. We will send out formal invitation soon, but hopefully you have received the save the date notification we sent at the beginning of the summer. We invite you to join us for a discussion of Patterson\u2019s growth strategies from our executive leadership team, including more in-depth information regarding NVS and our enterprise-wide IT initiatives. This will also be an opportunity to hear from Ann as our incoming CFO in addition to the leaders from our three business units. Once again, thanks for taking time to join us today and we will see you in October or on the call in November. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation."]}}
