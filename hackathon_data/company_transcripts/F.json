[Operator Instructions] We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Ted Cannis","Thank you, Chantelle and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today. On behalf of the entire Ford Management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us, so that we can provide you with additional details of our third quarter 2015 financial results.","Copies of this morning\u2019s press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today include references to non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix to the slides.","Today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect actual results are summarized at the end of this presentation and are detailed in our SEC filings.","And now presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.","Mark over to you.","Mark Fields","Great thanks, Ted. And good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. The overall headline is we had an outstanding third quarter and we remain on track to deliver breakthrough year. Looking at the numbers, we are in $2.7 billion and pre-tax profit which was more than double a year ago. We were at $1.9 million in net income also more than doubled.","Our automotive operating margin came in at 6.5%, which was up four points. Our automotive operating related cash flow was $2.8 billion and this resulted in a number of records for the quarter. We had a record third quarter pre-tax profit and a record third quarter automotive operating related cash flow.","As we look at the business units, we had our best quarter ever in North America, we are best third quarter at Ford Credit since 2011. And we have not had a better third quarter in Europe since 2009 and South America improved despite the tougher external conditions that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace.","Now along with those results we also delivered strong topline growth. Our wholesale volume was up 7%, our revenue was up 9% or 16% at constant exchange. And our global market share came in three-tenths of a point higher and that's the third quarter in a row of year-over-year global share growth.","Now along with this growth we also achieved sustained pricing power and that's really on the back of the strength of our new products. And if you take a step back and look at the first nine months of the year it\u2019s an equally strong headline. We earned $7 billion in pre-tax profit and $5.2 billion in automotive operating related cash flow and both are more than all of last year.","Looking at our launches 14 of our 16 new vehicle launches have been completed successfully and that's on top of the record 24 global launches, which we had last year. Importantly, our quality remains strong and it\u2019s also improving in every region around the world.","Turning to F-150, our F-150 is performing extremely well in the marketplace and we also just revealed our all-new Super Duty, which will be coming in 2016. And looking at our third quarter F-Series sales in the U.S., well it was our best sales in nine years. And we also continue to build on our strong truck franchise around the world.","If you look at Ranger, well that\u2019s the best-selling pickup in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and the Philippines. And the Ford brand is the commercial vehicle leader in Europe and we recorded our best sales in 12 years there lead by the Transit family. Now, even as we\u2019re delivering in these results with one foot in today, we also have one foot in tomorrow, delivering emerging opportunities through Ford\u2019s Smart Mobility.","And Smart Mobility is our plan to take Ford to the next level using innovation in connectivity, mobility [Audio Dip] and our year-to-date results our plan, our people and our process are delivering and importantly creating value for our stakeholders. And as we go into the fourth quarter and close the year and go into 2016 and beyond we\u2019re going to stay absolutely focused on our three priorities, which are accelerating the pace of progress on our One Ford plan delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of our business.","So at this point I\u2019ll let Bob take us through some slides.","Robert Shanks","Okay, Mark, thanks. And on behalf of the 195,000 men and women around the world of Ford, I'm very pleased to take you through the details of what they accomplished in the third quarter. Let's start on Slide 4, on the upper left and let's start with the topline. So we delivered a very, very strong performance on both wholesale volume and revenue as Mark mentioned, wholesale volume was up 7% and revenue was up 9%, 16% if you adjust for constant exchange.","Going down looking at the operating results both the automotive sector and financial services contributed strongly to the third quarter record profit of $2.7 million. And we had earnings per share of $0.45, which was up $0.21. Now after two quarters of no special items, we have a special item this quarter it\u2019s a positive item of a $166 million and that reflects an investment that we have in an aluminum casting supplier named Nemak. They had an IPO in the quarter, so we revalued that investment inline with the IPO that generated this non-cash improvement of $166 million.","Now just for information going forward, we will mark-to-market this investment each quarter and will reflect the gains or losses in other automotive. Now that combined with the strong pre-tax results generated the after-tax result to net income of $1.9 million which was up 129% from a year ago and earnings per share $0.48.","Going down to automotive cash flow $2.8 million very strong and again the third quarter record. We ended the period with $22.2 billion in cash, automotive debt of $12.8 and net cash of $9.4 billion. If you look at the year-to-date results just two things I want to highlight. Again on the pre-tax results $7 million that we have generated so far that is 10% higher than what we generated in all of last year on a pre-tax basis.","If you go down the slide further and let\u2019s go back to the operating related cash flow. Again compared with all of last year what we\u2019ve done through the first nine months is already 44% higher so very, very strong performance through the first nine months of the year.","Let me just close with a couple of comments on taxes, so let's talk about the quarter first. I have seen a lot of articles thus far that\u2019s highlighting the tax rate difference so versus first call estimate, we nailed the operating results, we came in a little bit different on the tax rate, we originally had guided to 34%, we actually came in at 33%, the first call estimate was 32%, so that entirely explain the $0.01 difference from the first call estimate.","For the full-year, we are revising our guidance for the tax rate; we have been at 26% which was about where we were last year. It looks like now we are going to come in at about 30%.","All right let's go on and we will look at the automotive sector on a more detail on Slide 5. Let\u2019s just go right through the bars going from left to right so the wholesales were up 103,000 units 7%, revenue was up $3 billion that\u2019s 9% again 16% after we adjust for exchange the operating margin up more than 2.5 times and 6.5% and we tripled our pre-tax results at $2.2 billion.","To go to the lower left, you can see the global industry SAAR was actually up 1 million units that was driven by North America and Europe and global market share was up three tens of a point to 7.6% again the third consecutive year-over-year improvement on a quarterly basis. And that was broad-based that was driven by North America, South America and Europe and again go back and look at the year-to-date results just below the bars and they are improved right across the board.","Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 6 and we will look at what drove the $1.5 billion improvement in our automotive sector results. The simple answer is very strong market factors, very strong volume and favorable mix and very strong net pricing and you can that that was far in excess of the investments that we continue to make in the business to support growth not only in this quarter, but in the quarters and years ahead.","Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 7, and here we will look at the absolutes by segment within the automotive sector. North America had that fantastic result that was mentioned $2.7 billion, that\u2019s the best quarter that North America has ever had. And if you look at the other business units while accumulatively in a loss, this is the fourth quarter in a row that they have improved on a year-over-year basis and in this quarter improved by $240 million. Looking at other automotive that is primarily net interest expense and we continue to expect our full year results in that space this year to be $650 million.","Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 8, and we will start going through the business units and I will start with North America as usual. And if you go left to right here tremendous results right across the Board, wholesales up 16% and within that 106,000 units you had 45,000 units coming from F-150 so we are back with the F-150 full availability, we ended the quarter with kind of inventories that we would like to see and we are ready to move forward now into the fourth and continue the strong performance that was already referenced.","If you look at revenue that was a very strongly at 19%, operating margin 11.3% this is even better than we did in the second quarter. And if you look at the pre-tax results again that\u2019s best ever result of $2.7 billion. If you look at the SAAR\u2019s both on a regional basis and in the U.S. we had strong improvement on a year-over-year basis and whichever way you look at it our share improved.","The North American share improved, the U.S. market share improved and our U.S. retail of retail which isn\u2019t shown also improved by 0.4 points so very strong performance and very strong industries resulting in extraordinarily strong financial results something we are very proud of and if you look at the year-to-date results again right across the board improved compared with the prior year.","Okay let\u2019s going to Slide 8 and we\u2019ll looking it was behind the $1.3 billion improvement in North America again very similar to what we saw in the automotive sector is market factors, very strong volume and mix, a strong net pricing and again in excess of the investments that we've made to grow the business in this quarter and in forward years. The other item I would callout is in other we saw strong performance also coming from our parts and services business.","Mark Fields","Just a couple comments on the F-150 because there is always lots of interest in F-150 and the bottom line is we are seeing very strong demand for the product .We\u2018re continuing to see a rich mix, we see fast turn rates much faster than the segment average. In the transaction prices are up $2800 year-over-year and higher than our two main competitors.","And if you think about retail market share, our retail market share in the quarter it actually climbed above the pre-change over levels and we believe there is more upside in our total share as we begin shipping more F-150's to our fleet customers during the fourth quarter and into next year.","Robert Shanks","And because of that we\u2019re expecting North America to have a very, very strong year with topline growth and also full-year process that will be higher than what we achieved last year and we are now revising our guidance on the margin to be at the upper end of our guidance at 8.5% to 9.5%, so really strong performance from North America driving the overall company.","Let\u2019s going and look at South America and actually some really great things happening year. Our team has done a wonderful job in a very tough environment of delivering a result it's actually a little bit better than what it was last year. If you look at the wholesale the wholesales are down 10% in industries that are down 20% for the region, 25% in Brazil, if you look at revenue, revenues down 32% almost all of that it is exchange related. Operating margin down of lower revenue, but you can see the pre-tax result actually come in and slightly better than what it was a year ago.","If you look at our share in the lower left very strong performance both in the region and in Brazil that was driven once again by the very strong market reaction to the Ford call, If you look the year-to-date performance were down on the topline between better in terms of the financial results again based on what the team is done and is very tough environment. So hats off to the team in South America.","Let\u2019s going to Slide 11 and look at the small change year-over-year and you can see that it was really driven by net pricing most of that is to recover the effects of the inflation and also the depreciating currencies, but if you look on the volume and mix callout box you can see the big impact of the industry decline which is partially offset by the strong share performance the team is delivered.","For the full-year we continue to expect to have pre-tax loss that will be reduced compared with 14, but we feel very good about what the team is done and clearly has positioned the business recover very quickly once the external environment starts to cooperate.","Okay let\u2019s go onto Europe on Slide 12. Again some good things to callout here very strong topline performance wholesales up 17%, the revenue was up modestly in dollars only 2%, but if you look at it again on exchange adjusted basis up 16%. The operating margin and the pre-tax results improved by nearly 60%.","If you go down to the third quarter SAARs and shares, you can see very strong growth both in the regional - at the regional level, but also in Europe 20. We did improved share across the region we had a small decline in Europe 20 which was driven by the launch ramp up of the S-Max and the Galaxy, along with the aging of the Fiesta. On a year-to-date basis were seen improvement in wholesales revenue is off again that's more than explained by exchange and strong improvement in terms of the financial results.","Okay let\u2019s going to the next Slide and we look at what was behind the $257 million improvement in Europe's results and again very similar to auto sector very similar to North America in the back of great products and good go-to-market strategies you can see the improvement in volume and mix and net pricing more than offset by or partially offset by very modest increases in cost.","If you'll at other that is largely explained by the consolidation of Russia. So overall again the teams doing a great job here having us moving forward in a positive direction that we feel that were very much on track to move towards a profitable position will be talking about that more early in 2016.","Mark Fields","In just a couple comments are as you look at our transformation plan which we had in place for a while it's gaining momentum and were confident that were on track for return to profitability in the region. If you look at the industry overall it\u2019s improving but it's still a bit of a two speed recovery with markets like U.K. and Germany doing better than some of the southern markets. But that being said, it's improving. ","The commercial vehicle segment industry itself is performing well and Ford's commercial vehicle performance is doing extremely well. We were the number one commercial vehicle brand in the region for the quarter and also for the full year. So really is an exceptional performance on our commercial vehicle side by our Transit.","We are still seeing some muted pricing across the industry. But Ford's mix and rates are strong. And I think all this combine has allowed us to not only grow our share but also improve the financial performance that Bob just brought you through.","Robert Shanks","Okay, thanks. Let\u2019s go on Slide 14, and we\u2019ll look briefly at Middle East and Africa. We want to highlight here is not so much the financials, the absolute to relatively small. The results are near breakeven. But the team in Dubai is doing a good job, they\u2019ve laid out an overall strategic framework for how we can participate and what's going to be a very important region in the next 5, 10, 10 years and starting to put the building blocks at actions in place in order for us to participate in that. ","In the quarter they did announce a partnership with a local company in Nigeria for us to start assembly of Ranger pickups, relatively soon. So again for the full year we expect to deliver about breakeven results.","Let\u2019s move on Asia Pacific on Slide 15, again looking at the key metrics here a little bit different than some of the other reasons, we\u2019ve look at the wholesales were down by 12% 40,000 units, 35,000 of that was in China, and I will come back to that in just a minute. The revenue was flat in dollar terms but again adjusted for inflation it was up 12% and just remind you that does exclude the China joint ventures because they\u2019re unconsolidated.","The operating margin was down and the pre-tax results were generally inline with where they were last year. If you look at the Asia-Pacific SAAR that declined and it was more than explained by a reduction in the China industry SAAR. In terms of our share our Asia-Pacific share was down a tenth at 3.5% that was driven by Australia.","And in China you can see that we held our share 4.7% that equaled the quarterly record that we set a year ago. If you look below the bars you see the year-to-date results basically downward across the board. Now let's look at I am sorry, I should also comment on the fact that if you go back within the bars on Slide 15. We do have the equity after-tax earnings and our China JVs, you can see they were down about 15%. ","Let\u2019s go the next side and I'll give you some of the insights in terms of what's happening. So a pretty modest decline but within the numbers, let\u2019s look at the volume in the next call off box, you can see the pretty sizable stock adjustment. We took stocks down in the quarter and that was something that we have talked about in the second quarter calls, we wanted to get our days supply inline with decline that we have seen in the overall industry.","We progressed on that in the first half we needed to go further in the third quarter and the team did a good job of that may also did call the overall run rate of sales properly. So we did end the quarter, right where we wanted to be in terms of stocks. But it did affect profits on a year-over-year basis by about $130 million.","The other thing you don't see on the slide is we had a supplier constraint that\u2019s in our result that constrained our production and affected profits to the tune of about $60 million. So overall we think the team is responded well to the slowdown that we seen in China and we are expecting to have a very strong fourth quarter in fact, we think it's likely to be a record quarter on the back of new products and in some cases built in new capacity that\u2019s come on stream this year.","We also expect to see a seasonal increase in China that we always see in the fourth quarter as the industry prepares for Chinese New Year early in the following year. And then of course the government has taken a number of simulative actions recently including the purchase tax reduction, which will favorably benefit about 70% of our portfolio and we\u2019ve already seen the benefits of that in our showroom, so we feel very strong and positive about the full year and looking forward to the fourth quarter.","Mark Fields","And just a couple comments on the China industry, we are seeing stabilization and as Bob mentioned we do expect to lift from the stimulus package. And as he mentioned we are seeing showroom traffic improve, we are seeing closing ratios improve and unquestionably we see this as a really good opportunity, because 70% of our sales have the engines that are eligible for the stimulus.","And just across Asia-Pacific as Bob mentioned we\u2019re confident in a strong fourth quarter. And as he mentioned likely up it\u2019s going to be a record and it\u2019s because of the industry lift, the new products which happen to be good margin products, we are after optimal stocking level so we won't experience the destocking we have in the third quarter. The supplier constraint is behind us and than the seasonal factor so we feel really good about where we are heading in the fourth quarter and into next year.","Robert Shanks","Okay, very good. Let\u2019s go on to Ford Credit on Slide 17. Ford Credit again I mentioned it earlier, but very, very strong performance. The best quarterly results since 2011 at $541 million and that was driven by growth. You can see the $115 million in volume and mix, most of that is volume and then we also benefited from favorable mix associated with leasing in North America.","In terms of our guidance for the full year, we continue to expect Ford Credit profit to be about equal to higher than what it was last year. We have narrowed the range of our call for managed receivables to $124 billion to $127 billion still looking for $250 million of distributions from Ford Credit in the fourth quarter and we expect to temporarily see our managed leveraged little bit higher than the 8 to 9 to 1 target due to the translation effect of the strong U.S dollar.","Okay, with that let\u2019s leave the business units and we will go on to cash and cash flow on Slide 18. Again I have touched on much of this so let me highlight once again the strong operating cash flow of $2.8 million, you can see that was driven by the automotive pre-tax profits, but we also saw some good performance in working capital and also other timing differences.","Going down further on a page, you can see we actually had no pension contributions in the quarter to our funded plans. I talked about this earlier in the year I said that they would be \u2013 the contributions would be largely biased towards the first part of the year. We still have a couple hundred million dollars ahead of us that will be done in the fourth quarter ending the year with about $1.1 billion of contributions.","We had $600 million in dividends in the quarter, $1.9 billion of shareholder distributions to date and since 2012 when we restored the dividend that we've had shareholder distributions of $8.5 billion dollars. Liquidity ended at $33.2 billion in the quarter very, very strong.","Okay, let\u2019s turn to Slide 19 and look at our planning assumptions and key metrics. So at the top you can see industry volume and if you look at the third column there you can see as we usually do at this point in time, we\u2019ve narrowed our call to around a single point estimates so in the U.S. we are looking at 17.7 million units that would be up 5% from last year and in line with the year-to-date results.","In Europe 20 about 16 million units that would be up 10% and again pretty much in line with the year-to-date results, and in the case of China, we were at 23 million to 24 million in the last call, we\u2019ve narrowed that now to 24 million based on the actions the government has taken which would be in line with where we were last year and a little bit higher than the year-to-date results.","In terms of the financial results on the rest of the page everything remains on track and certainly I don\u2019t want to not state the fact that we expect to see the company coming with the pre-tax profits within the range that we\u2019ve had all year long of $8.5 million to $9.5 million. So overall very strong results for the quarter, for the year-to-date expecting a strong fourth quarter and the breakthrough year that we've been talking about since January.","Mark Fields","And a couple of comments on the industry, the U.S. industry in particular before wrapping up. We would characterize the U.S. industry as healthy and borrowing any type of shock whether it would be economic or policy related. We do see industry sales staying well supported at the current levels through the next few years or in other words we expected to be stronger for longer.","Transaction prices are strong across the industry and for us replacement demand is back to its historical level of about 70% of industry sales and when you combine that with the vehicle park age, the oldest it\u2019s ever been in 11.5 years, we think that bodes well. The labor market is steadily improving or seeing better wage and income growth and then when you look at the Full-Size Pickup segment which is important to us here in our biggest and most profitable market. 50% of Full-Size Pickups on the road today are 10 years or older and actually 25% of them are actually 20 years or older.","So as we stand back across our lineup we think we are very well positioned overall and also with the F-150 and the 2016 launch of the new Super Duty coming down the pike. So let me just sum it all up. We had an outstanding third quarter and as we mentioned it was a record third quarter profit and with that higher wholesales revenue and market share and also better margin, and we are formally on track to deliver the breakthrough full-year. And for 2015, if you look at the regions we continue to expect North America to be very strong both in profit, but also substantial topline growth with margins in the upper end of 8.5% to 9.5% range that we\u2019ve guided to.","As we look at Europe, we expect improvement in Europe, as we continue moving towards profitability and will have more to say about that in January. Our Middle East and Africa business unit will deliver breakeven results. South America will deliver better results than last year despite the much tougher environment we\u2019re seeing.","And Asia-Pacific is going to have a strong year and in particularly strong fourth quarter and likely a record fourth quarter with the new capacity and the products that are coming online in combination with the government incentives promoting smaller vehicles in China and of course continued strong and steady returns from Ford Credit.","And as we look at 2016, we expect a strong year with the momentum that we built in 2015 and particularly in the second half of 2015 we expect that to carryover into 2016. A little bit longer-term we\u2019re on track to deliver our strategic objectives, which are around being the top five in global sales having a better balance of profit and sales around the world, 8% plus operating margins being in the top quartile of total shareholder returns and being highly regarded by our stakeholders.","So as you look at the third quarter we think there's more proof there that we have the right strategic framework, we have the right proven process and, of course, we have the right team and we\u2019re consistently delivering.","So with that why don\u2019t we go to the phone lines for your questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman","My question, maybe first on Europe, I'm curious what you think the trend is going to be there between diesel and gas given the events since your last call. Can you talk about your mix of diesel versus gas in the region? Then I think, too, you have a higher mix of light commercial vehicles, which are generally diesel and are going to remain diesel, so can you maybe break that out for us without the impact of LCVs? I'm trying to understand if there were a shift towards gas in the region, if you would benefit from that.","And then just on a similar note, I think there's an opportunity now for your prices in Europe to converge with Volkswagen's more quickly than maybe was earlier hoped for. That's a key long-term positive, but should we also worry that maybe their prices have to come down near-term pressure in the industry? Thanks.","Mark Fields","Okay thanks, Ryan. Let me take the first part of that question. First off as a company we\u2019re well-positioned to respond to wherever the marketplace goes. If you look at some of the statistics our total sales in Europe are about 55% diesel. So it\u2019s slightly less than the total industry, but when you break that out our cars are about 44%, which is below the industry. We do have the capability to actually go up to about 80% of gas engine.","So we have that flexibility and on the LCV side probably about 97% of our LCVs are diesel, but we see that continuing strong. It's really too early line Ryan, too early to tell what changes in the marketplace we will see. We have not seen any changes in terms of customer ordering, we've actually seen a little bit of uptick and interest on diesel on our build-and-price, Internet marketing tool that we have out there.","And in terms of the pricing, again we\u2019re going to continue to come out with best-in-class products, we\u2019re seeing the strong pricing particularly across our vehicle lineup. As you noted from where Bob took you through, our pricing was positive across Europe. In terms of what some of our competitors will do, we don't know, we are just going to stay focused on our plan and keep driving the business forward.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, thanks. Then just for my last question maybe on Asia-Pacific. I think the guidance earlier in the year was that the profits would inflect from the first half to the back half as you launch new product and lever new facility investments. And since then you surprised with a really very strong 2Q and in the process were softer in 3Q; 4Q is going to be strong you say.","I'm just curious what the biggest differences there have been, whether there was some sort of pull ahead maybe from 3Q to 2Q. And then just lastly, it looks like you actually increased here - am I right, you increased your market expectation for China? Now you're saying 24 million versus 23 million to 24 million?","Mark mentioned the government tax incentives on 1.6 liter and below engines. Can you talk about, specific to those incentives, what percentage of your vehicles qualify for them, whether you've seen an uptick in your own sales since they've been announced? And then just lastly maybe high level, do you think that China has found a bottom here?","Robert Shanks","I think I can remember maybe a third of that, so what it all cover just ask again Ryan. So, in terms of the counterization, I think you'll still see a stronger second half and then first half. And it\u2019s going to be driven by the fourth quarter, I think we probably would have expected third and fourth to be a little smoother than what it\u2019s going to be turn out.","But that\u2019s because of the de-stocking action that we had to take in the third. We did that actually through the first and particularly in the second but the industry continued to slow a bit ahead of us keeping up with that. So we caught up in the third quarter. But now looking forward to a very strong fourth.","We also were affected obviously in the third by the supplier constraint which isn\u2019t something that we had expected and some of that will get back in the fourth quarter as well. So that's really what's behind the counterization but generally if you talk at second half versus first half it will be consistent with what we said from the very being and one of the factors behind the companies that are second half and first half.","Mark Fields","And just your question around what percent of our vehicles are available for the incentives 70%. And when you look at the engines we have in the small EcoBoost engines that we do have. We think we an opportunity there, in terms of how we reached the bottom, while what we\u2019ve seen is I mentioned in my remarks, we seen a stabilization.","And I think the good news is we\u2019ve seen a bit of a stabilization on the passenger car market. And when you look at all the actions that the government has taken and the PBOC has taken over last number of months. We think that bodes well, so we think we found a bit of a bottom in passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles still a little bit of weakness there, that we\u2019re seeing persistent. And that will be a big determinant of where the economy is heading. But we\u2019re still seeing some weakness there.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, great. Very helpful, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","Mark Fields","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBCC. Please proceed.","Joseph Spak","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I first wanted to get a little bit of a better sense of the puts and takes for the fourth-quarter North America margins. You're showing production up 12%, but \u2013 and calling that the higher end of the range, but that would still be a step down from what you've done year-to-date, which I think was sort of 9.9%. So maybe you could give us first some of the offsets there.","Robert Shanks","Yes, we have all the numbers you cited Joe are correct, 99, year-to-date the 111, second quarter 113, and the third I think we were 67 in the first, when we\u2019re still launching and launch of the F-150. We do think we\u2019ll come in at the upper end of that range, which would obviously suggest the fourth quarter that\u2019s going to be lower than we saw in the second and third and that\u2019s driven by normal seasonal factors.","If you look at our business, year in and year out right across the board North America, other regions as well, we have cost increases on a sequential basis going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And we expect to see that happen again this year. We will still see positive on a year-over-year basis expect to see positive top line in terms of volume, in terms of still see good mix, we will still see positive pricing but we will see that seasonal cost increase.","The other thing I'll mention that's different this year than some other years is the fact that there are aspects of the UAW agreement once we conclude one that we will book in the fourth quarter. So for example if we were to have signing bonuses, which you know it looks like GM agreed to and FCA those would be booked in the quarter that the agreement is confirmed or ratified. So that would take place also in the fourth quarter.","Joseph Spak","And that considered, I am sorry go ahead.","Mark Fields","Joe just to put that in this perspective into the entire year, again in a year, in which we had a lot of launches and particular in the first half of the year launching the second plant for F-150, we are guiding to the upper half of 8.5% to 9%. So that gives you a little bit of perspective of the momentum as we get into 2016. ","Robert Shanks","Yes, on that point I mean if you look at North America from 2010 to 2014 it\u2019s averaged 9.1%. So I mean it looks like we have the chance of even doing better than that despite the launch is so effective as at the beginning of the year. Joe, you want to say something.","Joe Spak","Yes, I was just going to ask any potential UAW agreement is considered in that guidance for the year?","Mark Fields","Yes.","Joe Spak","Okay. And South America, I know you talked about some positive stuff for Ford there, but obviously the commentary on the environment is a difficult one. I guess what I'm wondering is over the past four or five years you've done a pretty good job of pricing for some of the currency moves. And I guess what I'm wondering is if you're beginning to hit the limits of what you can do there, how have some of your recent pricing actions been received in that region?","Mark Fields","Well, we would price more if the industry, but I mean that\u2019s really what needs to happen, there needs to be more aggressive pricing overall by everyone in the market because the impact of the depreciating currencies in the local inflation we just can't keep up with it. And we have been quite active on the pricing front, but it's just not been something that everyone. I think you\u2019ve got the number of players, particularly the larger players are trying to protect their market share positions and not responding to the forces that we are seeing. If you look at the rail for example over the last year it\u2019s depreciate by 63%.","If you look at inflation in Brazil it\u2019s running about 10%, and in Argentina 15% to 27% depending upon whether it\u2019s the official inflation rate or the one that people actually live with. So I mean that\u2019s really what's happening is it's just the environment is really, really eating away at the overall cost positions that everybody has there and then the revenue that we are generating.","Robert Shanks","Joe that being said when you look at our plan of introducing new product and the fact that we are able to gain 1.4 points of market share. When the economy does turn we think will be well-positioned on product standpoint from a cost standpoint and keep in mind before 2013 we had nine years of good profitability out of the region so we are taking a long view, but we also understand in the short to medium term it\u2019s going to be volatile and it\u2019s going to be challenging.","Mark Fields","Just to underscore that, if you go to Slide 11 and you look at the contribution costs and structural costs which are netting to basically about nothing there together. There is about $100 million of inflation effects in those numbers so the teams actually delivered cost reductions of about $100 million just in a quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we are swimming hard, it\u2019s just occurrence quite strong against us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan","Great, thanks for taking my question. On slide 9 you show net pricing and contribution costs. When I net them together it's fairly flat, slightly negative I guess. I'm a bit surprised given you talk about the F-150 had APPs up I think you said $2,800. You have the new Explorer, the Edge. Are you --? How should we think about net pricing going forward and sort of what is the drag in there that is preventing net pricing from being more positive?","Robert Shanks","Yes, I don\u2019t think there is drag at all Colin and don\u2019t say what I said I think for two quarter in a row. When you look at the business, you got to look at the whole business and if you look at the volume and mix let\u2019s start there first. I just mentioned we were up over 100,000 units year-over-year in volume, 45,000 of that is F series so clearly a significant factor behind what you see on industry share stocks. And on mix and most of them 547 that you're looking at there is actually favorable mix and much of that is F series.","So you have to look at the impact that the new product has on volume that it has on mix and that it got on net pricing and obviously it\u2019s a factor and net pricing is not the only factor. And on the contribution cost that\u2019s not all F series I mean you\u2019ve got Explorer, you have got Edge, you\u2019ve got a number of new products which also contributing to everything. So you really have to take all of that and you got to put it together and of course the result is a fantastic margin.","Colin Langan","And There has been a lot of questions on the F-150. Can you clarify whether the new F-150 is more profitable than the outgoing model, given the higher aluminum cost, now that it's been in the market for a while?","Robert Shanks","I would say what I said for like about a year and a half, the F-150 margins are very, very profitable and we are very satisfied with the contributions we are making to the overall business and the other thing I would remind everyone is that this is a positive contributor to are achieving a regulatory compliance on fuel economy which gives us options on other parts of our portfolios were developing those products. So the effects of the F-150 are very, very positive and\/in of itself but also in other ways across other aspect of your business.","Colin Langan","I know you're not going to talk about 2016, but your earlier comments talked about margins being at the high end of the range by H1's launch cost. How should we think about that, those costs into 2016, because you do have the Heavy Duty coming? Is that going to be flat year over year or is this still net down when we think about launching the next year?","Robert Shanks","We'll talk about margins as well as other aspect of our guidance in the call in January. As Mark mentioned we're looking forward to a very strong 2016 for the company coming off of everything that we build this year. North America will have strong results there is - Super Duty launch next year, but that will be a more normal launch because we've got separate body shop, we are going to take all the actions that we need to take in regularly scheduled downtime as opposed to what we did in Dearborn in Kansas City. So it\u2019s a very different type of the launch and clearly benefiting from everything that we learned on the first two. So this we will not be the effect to that you saw with the F-150 will be a normal launch.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","John Murphy","Just a first question, if we could maybe look on slide 9. One of the things that I think we were a little bit surprised at was the increase in structural costs and, to a lesser extent, contribution costs here. Can you just remind us how you are thinking about structural costs at this point and how you think about sort of your breakeven level relative to the US SAAR right now? Because it does seem like there's some costs that are creeping in here that we weren't really expecting.","Mark Fields","Yes, did not creeping on your planned and if you think about what where thinking about the business we\u2019ve been talking for quite sometime about profitably growing the business. And where we see opportunities to invest in the business to do so and get an appropriate return on our invested capital we will.","So hear what you see is investments that we\u2019re making and product, investments we\u2019re making in advertising sales promotion you have an increase in DNA as we ramped up our spending as the business is grown and we see opportunities to do so profitably going forward so all of that is necessary and supportive of the types of margins that were delivering.","If you think about the breakeven we are retargeting I think we talked about this back on our Investor Day we\u2019re targeting to get to breakeven that's equivalent to two-thirds of our wholesale volume and that is exactly were North America. So everything is where it should be for North America and when we look ahead if we help opportunities to invest in the business and grow it in a possible way, but the appropriate returns we will do so.","John Murphy","Okay, that's helpful. Then the second question: as you look at how the year has progressed here, Bob, it does sound like things have shifted a little bit and obviously you're still going to have second-half profits that are higher than first-half profits. But what do you think is sort of the major puts or headwinds that you are running into that are changing that a little bit? It just does seem like there's a little bit less optimism relative second half versus first half relative to where there was maybe at the beginning of the year?","Robert Shanks","Well, John I am not sure why would say that we the year is playing out very much like we had expected we feel exactly - that where exactly were we thought we would be at the beginning of the year. We see the second half still being stronger as we had expected than the first half we delivered you know outstanding results in the second here we are in the third to fourth sequentially will be lower as it normally yes but on a year-over-year basis can be spectacular. We think that you\u2019re playing out exactly as we had that it was going to play out.","John Murphy","But, Bob, you talked about sort of the seasonal pattern that was typical where the first half was stronger and the second half was weaker, and now it seems like you're pointing to seasonal factors in the fourth quarter putting pressure on North America, which is what you didn't say before. You actually said the second half would be -- was stronger and you wouldn't see the typical seasonal factors, so I think that's where things have changed a little bit relative to what we were expecting. It just seems like that's a change.","Robert Shanks","Okay I respect and this agree why don\u2019t you go back and look at the graphic that we provide you'll see the second half was stronger than the first half you will see that the first quarter was the weakest quarter of the year and you'll see that the fourth quarter was trailing off a bit from the third quarter. That's exactly what's going happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Please proceed.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, good morning everybody.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask you just a little more color on these, the comments that you made on the Super Duty launch being more of a regular launch versus the F-150. I guess as we're trying to -- from our seat trying to understand through the implications of a launch and obviously some downtime next year, but then also potentially offset by additional strength on the F-150. What does a regular launch mean compared to what we saw in the F-150?","Mark Fields","Well, Emmanuel what you saw on launch the F-150 is obviously we took significant downtime to completely rebuild the body shops. And what we\u2019ve been able to do with the spacing that we have in Kentucky or Kentucky truck operation, the body shop actually started being constructed in 2015 and it\u2019s going to be completed by the end of this year. So we won't have the extended downtime that we had in Dearborn Truck or in Kansas City.","So overall, what we'll see is the typical model year changeover what that happens during the shutdown period over the vacations. So we won't see, we will see that\u2019s what we mean by a more normal launch, we handle it during the shutdown period during the vacations and they are more up and running.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, that's helpful. Two quick questions on the North American volume in the quarter. On the production side, it looks like you produced maybe 5% fewer vehicles than you had guided just three months ago. I'm curious where that comes from. And then when I look at your earnings contribution from volume and mix in the quarter in North America, obviously very strong, $1.6 billion. Divided by the delta in wholesales looks like it's $16,000 contribution margin per vehicle or so when you said that only about half of the increase is the F-Series. So can you maybe explain the high contribution?","Mark Fields","Yes, the contribution margin that you are seeing is because we have a number of very high margin products that we have been launching and Explorer, which is very high margin edge, which was really coming out in the quarter very strongly because we had launched I think in the prior quarter, that\u2019s a very high margin product. And of course Mustang, Mustang is doing extremely well too. So you've got a lot of very high margin products that were driving that increase and generating type margins that you are seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache","I wanted to also ask you about that. On slide 9, the North American bridge, typically you provide the material ex commodities, the commodity, and the warranty items for the contribution costs. I didn't see that this time for the segment. You had it for the overall company. I was hoping you could get that and, more specifically, I believe that there was a $500 million warranty charge last year.","So is the \u2013 and I'm assuming that that's in the year-over-year comparison. So is the contribution cost actually more like $927 million ex that or is that $427 million really the contribution costs year over year? So is the and I'm assuming that said in the year-over-year comparison, so is the contribution cost actually more like 927 X that or is that 427 really the contribution cost year-over-year?","Mark Fields","Yes, Rod, if you were to look at the company, Slide which is back on Slide 6, those the callout explanation are very much the North American callout explanations, you know if you just factor them down very slightly, that\u2019s basically what you would see in the case of North America. So North America in terms of material excluding commodities would be the $1.1 billion, the commodity is about $325 million the structural related cost about $320 million. So you can see the North American results very, very much mapping to the total company and the case of warranty we saw good news of about $340 million year-over-year in North America.","So that's exactly what you're talking about, we did have some reserve adjustments that we normally make in the third quarter that\u2019s when we do our deep dives particularly on both coverages. I think and also field service actions that we also have the one time action last year, which obviously didn\u2019t have this year. So it\u2019s a good news and that\u2019s really what's behind that 418 that you see on Slide 6.","Rod Lache","Okay thanks, that's helpful. I was hoping you could just comment on going forward, one of your competitors recently suggested that they may be able to mitigate regulatory cost inflation through 2018. Just given that you already absorbed a lot with F-Series to help you guys achieve some of these targets longer-term, is that something that you think Ford can achieve?","Mark Fields","Well, we are not talking about forward years today I mean we did have our Investor Day some time ago, we talked about the fact that particularly towards the end of the decade, if you look 2019 and 2020 I mean I think there's a lot of work the whole industry is got to do at that point in time in response to your compliance particularly around the machines and fuel economy, but I think we feel good about where we are up until 2019, but then there is a sort of a step level increase and we are all going to have to continue to work on particularly with more electrification that\u2019s going to be required in that timeframe.","Rod Lache","Okay, just one last one if I can sneak it in. You provide all the buckets for the Asia bridge, and I was wondering if you might be able to just give us a sense of how -- if we were just to think about China specifically, how would the bridge be bucketed? What would the structural costs be doing? What is pricing doing on a year-to-year basis as we look at Q3?","Mark Fields","Yes, we are not going to breakout individual markets within a region, but I think it would be fair to say that in general because we do include on an equity after-tax basis the year-over-year variances from the China JVs within these data that you are seeing on Slide 16 and you could imagine that a lot of that is going to be driven by China just because of the size of that business within Asia Pacific. So I think you're probably looking at China, when you are looking at the slide here for the most part.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas","Hey Mark, hey Bob.","Mark Fields","Hey.","Adam Jonas","So Toyota recently made a statement in the media in Tokyo that it expects sales of gasoline and diesel engine cars will be, they said, near zero by the year 2050. Now I know 35 years is a long time, but is that crazy? What do you think of that forecast?","Mark Fields","Well, I can't speak to some of my competitors, in terms of our business plan that's a long business plan I mean we\u2019d have to look out, but our plan as you know Adam very simply is provide the power of choice to consumer so we have terrific internal combustion engines, electrification and we all the different variants are working on hydrogen fuel cells et cetera. We have great diesel engines and our approach going forward is fuel economy is important to customers and so machines and things of that nature and we are going to continue to provide that choice and products that will appeal to our customers that are interested in those things and those are the things that they are interested in and we are going to continue to work at it.","Adam Jonas","Great, Mark. Maybe nearer term, and this is something I think I asked you about at the Detroit show almost a year ago, the topic of active safety and tying in life-saving and accident-prevention technologies, software and sensors and things, that also happen to make cars more fuel efficient. Any update on your progress of how Ford and some of your competitors have been able to convince the regulators that, look, these things should actually start getting some credit on the fuel economy side?","Mark Fields","Well, from our standpoint we are actively engaged with the regulators and it\u2019s an active ongoing discussion. We share the same objectives. We want to reduce the number of accidents. We want to reduce the number of fatalities. We want to loss congestion and we want to improve just overall safety for our customers. So we are in active discussions right now I think the things that you mentioned are things that we are talking to them about, because we feel they do require consideration and we'll see when we come out on those discussions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover of FIG. Please proceed.","Matt Stover","Thank you very much. A question about Asia-Pacific. It's been some time here where one hand off or the other hand took China down, but it's doing pretty well. It's doing about $1.2 billion in profit, but the other APAC businesses are losing about $1.2 billion annualized. And I guess I kind of understand the story in China, but I'm wondering how we should think about those other losses outside of China that are dragging down the results within the region.","Robert Shanks","Well, let me first start with China you're only looking at the China joint ventures. We have three other areas of our business in China that would come to what we would call China as we\u2019re looking at it internally. So you\u2019ve got the built-up imports that we send them to China from on the Ford brand we've got the Lincoln products that were also exporting into China and as you might expect since we\u2019re in the process of just launching that brand and launching the network and the products that is not this year contributing positively to profits.","And then we've also got engineering costs that were incurring today inside Ford that we will only receive compensation for in future years once we start building the vehicles that were engineering. So that\u2019s a cost if you will that we incur until that point in time. So you have to look at all of that in order to have a complete view of what our profitability is inside China. So looking at the JVs is going to give you not a complete understanding of what that story is.","If you look at the rest of the region, the rest of the region for the last two quarters this quarter in the second quarter actually has improved on a year-over-year basis and was pretty flat in the first quarters. So the efforts that we have underway. In India, Australia and ASEAN are making great progress in terms of getting those businesses where they need to be.","In the case of Australia we would expect that inflection point if you will to occur when we close our manufacturing facility there in October of next year and teams doing a very, very good job of repositioning the brand and the product lineup to prepare for that.","In the case of India we just launched the brand-new Sanand facility and the new product that that we are building there, the Figo and that\u2019s off to a good start, but there will be a while before as we have add product and add volume there to get the plant up and running to the level that we expected to be.","And then in the case of ASEAN we actually made very good progress in ASEAN in terms of getting that region back to profitability and the sort of skirting around the level at the moment. So we feel really good about the progress you're making it more work to do and we expect about to contribute positively in the relatively near future.","So those are the three areas and again all progressing very nicely and all contributing positively on a year-over-year basis. China is the reason why the region declined year-over-year both in the third quarter and the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault","Great, thanks for squeezing me in here. A couple of clarifications, just one I think it might've been Emmanuel's question, and forgive me if that was answered. But I think there was a question about the shipments being different in 3Q for North America relative to what was originally guided for. What was the reason for that? Was that some of the ramp stuff that we have -- some of the ramp challenges with frames that we've been reading about or is there something else that led to that difference?","Mark Fields","Thanks its from a production standpoint what we ran into Patrick was a supplier related production disruption and we are now through that, but it did impact or production in North America and it did impact our production in China, but as I said were through that but is not related to F-150 as you see actually our production in F-150 came just about bang on what we expected. So it was some other vehicles some of our utilities that impacted a number of our clients.","Patrick Archambault","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Then just while we're on the same topic of North America, a lot of time is spent on slide 9, but the net pricing piece just taking that on its own. It is down -- the year-on-year increase is down from the second quarter, where I think it was around $700 million if I'm remembering correctly. Is this kind of for the fourth quarter the new run rate of pricing, or is this something that could pop up back towards that previous increase? Just the thing that comes to mind is there was at least one month in the quarter where incentives were pretty big on the F-150, and I feel like they moderated after that. So just wanted to try and put those things together.","Mark Fields","So Patrick just to be clear you're talking about sequentially second quarter to third quarter in North America. Yes, if your question was the second quarter to third quarter change we had lower volume was down about 45,000 units and again that's because of some plant shutdowns that we have in the summer.","Operator","We will now take questions from the media community and your next question comes from the line of David Shepardson of Detroit News. Please proceed.","David Shepardson","Thanks for having the call. Mark, I wonder if you would like to respond to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who over the last six months has been heavily critical of Ford's announced plans to expand its investments in Mexico that the $2.5 billion and could you just sort of address generally whether you think it\u2019s appropriate to be investing in Mexico in response to suggestions that Ford should be spending more resources here in the U.S.?","Mark Fields","Thanks Dave. Well, listen as we\u2019ve said we have not talked to Donald Trump and we have not made any changes to our manufacturing plants. And Dave as a company we deal with the facts and facts are stubborn things and Ford were proud of the facts and unfortunately we suspect the facts are getting lost in the politics. The reality and the facts are that we've invested more than $10 billion in the U.S. in our plants since 2011 and we've also added 25,000 U.S. employees. When you look at the way we spent our investments 80% of our North American investments are here in the U.S. and 97% of our engineering is done here in the U.S.","We are multinational company and we invest in all the markets we do business in and you just saw the numbers here in the U.S., we\u2019ve been in Mexico for 90 years. And this kerfuffle that we've seen yesterday around F-650 and our F-750 and what\u2019s going on, we did resource them from Mexico to Ohio. We made that decision back in 2011 and that was long before any candidates announced their intention to run for U.S. President. As a matter of fact that was made before the last Presidential Election.","So those are the facts we don't as we look at that we don't \u2013 facts don't cease to exist because they're ignored, but those are the facts at Ford and we are very proud of the fact of what we do in terms of driving, doing our part to drive the economic development in the U.S. and many other markets we do business around the world.","End of Q&A","Operator","At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ted Cannis.

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn? And ladies and gentlemen standby, I believe we have lost our audio, one moment for the - for the speaker.","Lynn Antipas Tyson","Thank you, operator. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Businesses, Technology & Strategy; and Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.","Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our results, progress against our strategic initiatives and guidance for 2020. Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and guidance, after which, we'll turn to Q&A. Following the Q&A, Jim Hackett will make closing remarks. Our comments today will include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.","Today's call will include forward-looking statements about our business. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors for - that are included on page 26 of our presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. References to company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted. As a reminder, starting in 2020, we changed our business units in our Auto segment to align with how we now manage our business.

We've also included 2018 and 2019 results by quarter that coincide with the new reporting structure. The minor IR housekeeping. Going forward, we will announce the date for our next earnings release in conjunction with results for the previous quarter. For example, we are announcing today that the date for our 2020 Q1 earnings will be April 28. Please disregard our previously announced dates for July and October 2020.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hackett","Thanks, Lynn. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Please turn to page 3. At the start of this new decade, we are also at a crossroads for our industry and for Ford Motor Company. I believe, as I've said before, there is an incredibly bright future for Ford within what has become a very disruptive environment. And to realize this future, we undertook a fundamental redesign of the company to compete and win in this new era of smart vehicles in a smart world.","On this call a year ago, I told you that 2019 would be a year of strategic action with potential for financial improvement. Now measured against the first part of that statement, 2019 was a year we took meaningful actions to improve our fitness and accelerate our transformation into a higher growth, higher margin business by leveraging smart connected vehicles and breakthrough customer experience. A powerful example of our company's move into the digital future was the November reveal of our Mustang Mach-E, an exciting zero emissions vehicle that will be fully connected and continually improved through over the year updates. We're encouraged by the interest and early orders around the world.","Moving forward, virtually all our new vehicles will be connected, enabling Ford to vastly enhance customer experience and our ability to leverage data and analytics to constantly raise quality and reduce costs. Additionally, this past year, we forged strategic agreements and partnerships around the world, with VW, Rivian and Mahindra. This is to help position Ford for leadership in autonomous and electric vehicles and create new business models for profitable growth in emerging and emerged markets.","We continued one of the most ambitious portfolio shifts in our history. Focusing our capital on growing profitable segments and playing to the strength of our brand. We are right on strategy to add compelling new products across segments, price points while phasing out unprofitable and commoditized vehicles in shrinking segments. And this will only accelerate moving forward, which benefits our share, bottom line, and most importantly customers. We also made significant progress on our global redesign in 2019. We took tough but important steps to strengthen our capabilities and create a more resilient Ford.","Those actions included restructuring our operations in Europe and South America, assembling a talented new leadership team in China with strong local market expertise, and reducing the size of our salaried workforce around the world, flattening the organization and cutting down bureaucracy in the process.","In the secondary, I talked about last year potential financial improvement, we fell short of our expectations and yours in 2019. What is particularly disappointing is that a primary reason for that shortfall was our operational execution and this is an area we are typically very effective in. Our execution was simply not nearly good enough. Clearly, we recognize this and of course we're accountable for it and we've taken steps to address these shortfalls. An example of this was the manufacturing launch of our all-new Explorer. The lost volumes in Chicago during ramp-up marred the year, and there were some important lessons that we learned.","The good news is the Explorer is a fantastic vehicle and we've entered the year with strong customer demand for it. Financial improvement was also held back by the emergence of warranty issues primarily for vehicles designed years ago. So before I get into the numbers, let me make this very clear. Our leadership team is determined to return to world-class levels of operational execution. We will do that without losing any momentum in creating a Ford Motor Company that will thrive and generate long-term value in these fast changing times.","To this end, we've made changes to our executive incentive plans, and we placed an even greater weight on free cash flow, which we think is the ultimate gauge of our success in driving growth and allocating capital to its best and highest uses. Please turn to page 4. Our full year revenue declined 3% and company adjusted EBIT of $6.4 billion was down 9%. This yielded an overall margin of 4.1%, and adjusted EPS for the year was $1.19. Importantly, we generated $2.8 billion in total company adjusted free cash flow. Our balance sheet, it remained strong with $22 billion in cash and $35 billion in liquidity, both of which are well above our target levels.","Please turn to Page 5. As I mentioned in 2019, we significantly strengthened our portfolio around the world. New launches included that all-new Explorer I mentioned, Escape and Super Duty and the Puma in Europe, in addition to the reveal of our Mustang Mach-E. On a volume basis, this product renaissance will gather even more momentum in 2020 especially in North America. Ford F-Series was America's truck leader for the 43rd consecutive year. In the fourth quarter, F-150 volumes closed strongly with the segment share up year-over-year and sequentially. The new Ranger in its first full year of production in the US earned a 21% share of the mid-size pickup segment in the fourth quarter. And this contributed to our best year of total pickup sales since 2005. So we're quite proud with the F-Series and Ranger as a one-two punch. Ford was not only the leader in US full-size pickups, but also the leader in total pickup sales in 2019.","In Europe, we started the rollout of 17 new hybrid and all-electric passenger and commercial vehicles, including the all-new Puma SUV. This broader electric portfolio shows how serious we are about meeting the region's new carbon footprint requirements. We launched our first ever fully electric vehicle in China with a version of Territory, and we announced we would introduce more than 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles, 10 of these will be electrified over the next three years. And as mentioned, our all-new Mustang Mach-E will reach customers late this year.","Now all of these product supports Ford's commitment to achieve the Paris Climate Accord Glide Path for lower CO2 emissions. And at the same time, we maintain leadership around the globe with our franchise vehicles. Mustang, America's and the world's number one sports coupe. F-Series, along with Ranger, which is the number two medium-sized pickup outside the US, and number one in Europe. Explorer, America's all-time best selling SUV, and Transit the top cargo van globally. And while some automakers are clearly pursuing full-blown mergers for scale and cost sharing, Ford's strategy is based on strategic partnerships and alliances that will deliver benefits in key segments and markets, while improving our cost and capital efficiency.","For example, our agreement with VW is structured to allow us to reap scale gains from our collective leadership position in light commercial vehicles and medium pickups, and in electrification and autonomous vehicles. Our joint venture with Mahindra will combine low-cost engineering and manufacturing optimized for India and export to other emerged and emerging markets, with more efficient levels of investment. With our equity position in Rivian and well matched strengths of the two companies, we can quickly bring to market an all-new BEV using Rivian's flexible platform.","In fact, last week we announced, we are working with Rivian on Lincoln's first all-electric vehicle, building on the introduction last year of the Lincoln Aviator and Corsair Grand Touring plug-in hybrids. In terms of global redesign, Ford took decisive actions in both Europe and South America to fortify and build on strengths while addressing underperforming parts of those regional businesses. In Europe, we announced the closure of six manufacturing facilities, which will reduce our footprint to 18 facilities from 24. We also refocused our European product portfolio atop three pillars.","One, strengthening our leadership in commercial vehicles. Two, delivering a targeted portfolio of passenger vehicles; and three importing iconic nameplates. Now in the process, we're reducing our workforce in Europe by 12,000 positions with more than half of that completed in 2019. In South America, we're moving to a lower cost asset-light business model. And last year, we exited production of heavy trucks. We closed our plant in San Bernardo and discontinued the Fiesta and Focus models. Over the past three years, we've reduced our total workforce in South America by more than 40%.","In China, we completed the build-out of an experienced local leadership team and localized the first of five products, our Lincoln Corsair. The heart of Ford's vision is preparing the company to compete and win in this emerging era, we describe as smart vehicles for a smart world. A practical effect is we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities in mobility, connected service and autonomous vehicles, areas that will provide meaningful opportunities for growth.","For example, Ford Commercial Solutions significantly grew its data and telematics subscriptions in 2019, building out the portfolio of services. We are leveraging those services in our large, profitable and expanding commercial truck franchises, which includes a sizable fleet market. In terms of autonomous vehicles, we continued our credible and holistic approach to building a successful, scalable and profitable AV business, focusing on the customer experience, the self-driving system, lead operations and designing our purpose-built self-driving vehicle.","Ford AV, LLC and Argo AI now have joined autonomous vehicle testing operations in Austin, Miami, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Detroit, in the South Bay Metro area and Silicon Valley. Now these six locations make up the largest urban AV testing footprint in the industry, providing us with a unique and invaluable diversity of real world miles driven. With that information, we are continuously optimizing Argo's self-driving system and positioning Ford exceptionally well for commercialization and subsequent scaling of this technology. Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me briefly touch on 2020.","As I said at the start, we begin this decade with optimism and the conviction that we're taking the right steps to redesign and restructure our business, improve our fitness and prepare the company to compete and win in the future. 2020 will be the year we re-introduce Bronco to the world, the year, we completely redesigned the F-150, the year we'll start seeing the Mustang Mach-E on roads around the world. All these vehicles will be smarter and more connected and ever improving. We're focused on solid execution of our product launches this year, especially where there will naturally be downtime during changeover like the F-150.","The cadence of these launches which are volume weighted towards the end of the year will drive headwinds for us in 2020, but they will strengthen our earnings and cash flow potential heading into 2021. Now, let me briefly talk about what we are seeing and doing relative to the Corona virus. As you would expect, our Ford team is proactively monitoring the situation on several fronts, including the safety of our employees and their families. This is paramount, business continuity including our JV partners in China as well as customers, supply chain management, logistics and of course where we can, we want to be part of the solution.","So we are donating money and equipment where we can be most effective. Thus my strong instinct is to want to tell you what the impact of this virus may be on our business and our guidance for this year. However, it's simply too early. China is only now starting to come back from an extended New Year holiday. And many companies including Ford are currently hoping to resume large parts of their industrial operations next week. And that is most experts are already saying and we agree that it will take weeks to begin to understand the implications of the outbreak.","In the meantime, we will describe our expectations for the business excluding the possible effects of the Corona virus. It is possible, though, that we could absorb a modest impact from the virus within our guidance range. For the year, we are driving for at least nominal growth in Auto as we continue our ambitious portfolio transformation. We expect this growth though to be offset by lower EBT from Ford Credit, and a modest investment increase in mobility. Tim Stone, our CFO will provide more color. In fact, now I will turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Stone","Thanks, Jim. While our 2019 results were not okay, I'm confident we have abundant opportunities to improve our operational execution, drive growth, strengthen our financial results, including cash flow and in the process, earn the confidence of our stakeholders. We will achieve our potential and optimize long-term value through timely decisive actions to strengthen our business and execute on our long-term vision. These include applying sharp rigor to the allocation of capital to higher return investments, including our franchise products. As you heard me say in the past, we're focused on consistently improving customer experience and operational execution across our business. We're achieving important progress on our global redesign making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital.","We're driving fitness, for example scaling or improving the operating leverage of our structural costs and capital efficiency and forming alliances and joint ventures that will enable us to drive durable scale benefits. We're prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable, long-term growth in mobility and we will continue to employ disciplined execution to drive strong results from Ford Credit.","Turning to our full year operating performance in 2019. Full year adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion was flat year-over-year as continued improvement in working capital in our Auto business, lower capital spending and higher distributions from Ford Credit were largely offset by the UAW contract related bonuses of about $600 million. Free cash flow is our most important financial measure and we're committed to generating sustainable growth over time. Our cash and liquidity are $22 billion and $35 billion respectively, above our target levels. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings.","Revenue declined 3% for the year, or 1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And adjusted company EBIT of $6.4 billion was down 9%. While full-year Auto EBIT declined, the benefits of our redesign, fitness initiatives and stronger product portfolio driven by our decision to reallocate capital to higher return products were evident in our underlying results. Led by North America, Auto delivered $2.4 billion in favorable market factors, another strong year for us. This is supported by improved mix and pricing across most regions.","Auto structural costs, excluding pension and OPEB were down for the year, primarily as a result of improved fitness and global redesign actions. The decline in structural cost was a sharp contrast to before we embarked on fitness when those costs were increasing an average of nearly $2 billion a year. Within Auto these favorable trends were more than offset by lower volumes, including the temporary effects of new product launches and the discontinuation of sedans in North America and low-margin products in other regions. Higher net product costs as we continue to invest in the transformation of our product portfolio, unfavorable currency effects, UAW contract ratification costs, and higher warranty expenses.","Regionally, we cut our loss in China by one-half year-over-year, and Europe is just shy of breakeven. Together these regions accounted for $1.1 billion in EBIT improvement. Outside of Auto, we increased our investment in mobility by more than 75% or $0.5 billion as we continued to expand our capabilities, and prepare for the launch of our AV business. Ford Credit had exceptional results, its best in nine years, delivering $3 billion in EBT. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow, down year-over-year primarily due to UAW contract related bonuses.","Wholesales, which were off 8% in the quarter contributed to a 5% decline in revenue. These drops were driven by lower volumes in all regions, including the temporary effects of product launches and the discontinuation of sedans in North America and low-margin products in other regions. Auto EBIT of $0.2 billion was down $0.9 billion as higher net pricing and mix, led by North America were more than offset by lower volumes, UAW contract related costs, higher net product costs related to new products and adverse currency exchange.","Our strategic investments in mobility increased more than 75% or $0.1 billion, largely driven by higher investments in autonomous vehicles. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with $0.6 billion in earnings before taxes, down 5%. The decline was driven by lower receivables, partially offset by favorable residual and credit loss performance. Loss metrics continue to reflect healthy and stable consumer credit and auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 4% for the quarter and 2% for the year. For 2020, we expect auction values to be down about 5%.","Company adjusted EBIT declined by $1 billion to $0.5 billion and our adjusted EBIT margin was down 227 basis points to 1.2% as improvement in China and Europe was more than offset by decline in North America. Looking at our largest regions in more detail. North America wholesale units were down 8% in the quarter. This is driven by a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 when we were at peak volumes with no major product launches, as well as by the launches of Super Duty and Escape and the planned discontinuation of sedans. The 2% decline in revenue was less than the decline in wholesales as improved mix and higher net pricing partially offset the decline in volume.","EBIT was down 64%, and margin declined 480 basis points, largely as a result of UAW contract related bonuses and lower volumes. In Europe, where we are carrying out a dramatic redesign of our business, wholesale declined 4% due to the planned discontinuation of low-margin products. Revenue in Europe was down 4% or 1% excluding the impact of exchange. The decline in revenue, excluding exchange was less than the decline in wholesales as improved product mix driven by our portfolio actions largely offset volume effects.","Decline in Europe's top line metrics is an outcome of our redesign and portfolio shift as we exit low-margin businesses and refocus our portfolio on higher growth and higher return opportunities. The benefit of this refocus is evident in a few areas, for example, profitability. In the fourth quarter, EBIT in Europe improved from a loss of $199 million to a profit of $21 million. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profitability improvement in the region. This progress includes stronger product mix and lower structural costs.","Our redesign and portfolio shift in Europe also make us better prepared to deliver on the region's new CO2 requirements. Compliance with these new regulations has been built into our product cycle and business plans for several years, and we expect to achieve the new CO2 requirements without incurring fines or purchasing credits. In China, wholesales which include JV volumes were down 7%. This is the third consecutive quarter of moderating declines in volume. Consolidated revenue in China was down 38%, mainly because of lower volumes and component sales to joint ventures in the country.","Our EBIT loss in China narrowed $200 million, an improvement of $300 million year-over-year, driven by decline in structural costs and improved joint venture results. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in results in China. For all of 2019, we were able to cut our losses by one-half as new products supported improved market factors including mix and net pricing. Lower tariffs and favorable exchange improved contribution margin, and our focus on overhead drove a significant decline in structural costs. We continue to emphasize dealer engagement and profitability along with inventory discipline, but keeping production aligned to demand.","We've also made progress shifting our portfolio from imports to locally manufactured. In 2019, we launched Lincoln Corsair and expect to localize four additional vehicles in the future. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $2.7 billion in special item charges with cash effects of about $200 million. Actions related to our global redesign accounted for $0.4 billion in special item charges and all the negative cash effects. The balance of special item charges included $2.2 billion for a previously announced remeasurement loss related to our global pension and OPEB plans.","In July, 2018, we announced plans for a global redesign, which included a potential $11 billion of EBIT charges and $7 billion of related cash effects to fund the rationalization of our cost structure, portfolio and footprint. Those changes were to ensure that Ford in each of our regional auto businesses drive sustainable, profitable growth. Since announcing that plan, we've incurred $3.7 billion of EBIT charges, and $1.1 billion of related cash effects with the majority of them in 2019.","Now I'll expand on our perspective on 2020. At a macro level, our guidance reflects our expectation for continued GDP growth globally and across our major markets. We also anticipate healthy industry volumes on an absolute basis, but down modestly from 2019, including declines in the US, Europe and China. This outlook does not factor in any assumptions for impacts from the Corona virus to our global business, as it is still a very fluid situation, and we're still assessing the magnitude and duration of potential impacts.","For Ford, 2020 will be another heavy product launch year, as we continue to shift investments to our franchise strengths. For example, in 2020, 75% of North America's volume will be all-new or refreshed versus 2017. This is up from 40% in 2019, an increase of 35 points. Another way to slice this is by looking at the average ages of our vehicles in our portfolio.","In the US, the average age will drop from 5.3 years in 2017 to 3.3 years in 2020, on our way to 2.9 years by 2023. After that, we plan to keep a stable and competitive product plan with fresh products every year. So looking at 2020 more closely, our launches include our new F-150, a new-to-the-lineup small off-road utility vehicle and Mustang Mach-E. We'll also launch our strongest lineup yet of electrified vehicles including HEV and PHEV versions of popular nameplates like Corsair, Kuga and F-150.","At the same time, we'll ramp products introduced in 2019 like Explorer, Aviator, Kuga Escape, Puma Transit 2-Ton and Super Duty. In addition, late in the year, we will start production of our highly anticipated all new Bronco, with availability for customers in early 2021. As you consider our guidance, you should be mindful of several tailwinds and headwinds. For tailwinds, we expect full-year of sales of all new Explorer and improved product mix and pricing from other new products. Additional fitness and benefits from our global redesign and the non-repeat of the UAW bonuses.","For headwinds, we expect the back-end loaded nature of our launch cadence, especially F-150, the cost of CO2 compliance, increased investments in mobility, lower EBT from Ford Credit largely driven by our assumptions for residual values, and the non-repeat of mark-to-market gains on derivatives, and a higher effective tax rate. All of these considerations contribute to our 2020 guidance for $2.4 billion to $3.4 billion and adjusted free cash flow. For adjusted EBIT, we're targeting a range of $5.6 billion to $6.6 billion which assumes at least nominal growth in Auto offset by lower EBT from Ford Credit and a modest investment increase in mobility.","With an effective tax rate in the mid to high teens, our adjusted EPS range is $0.94 to $1.20 per share. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBIT to be down more than $1.1 billion from the first quarter 2019, driven by the continuation of higher warranty costs we experienced in the second half of 2019, lower volume, lower results from Ford Credit and higher investment for mobility. And we expect our effective tax rate in the quarter to be at the high end of our full year guidance range. Relative to calls on capital for the year, we expect capex to be $6.8 billion to $7.3 billion, as much as $800 million lower than in 2019, reflecting benefits from our fitness initiatives.","Funded pension contributions of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion and regular quarterly dividends of $0.15 per share as always subject to Board approval each quarter. For global redesign, we expect to incur $0.9 billion to $1.4 billion of EBIT special item charges with negative cash effects of $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion. Our guidance assumes no material change in the current economic environment including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs. As a reminder, our guidance does not factor in assumptions for impact from the Corona virus as it is still a fluid situation.","Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those detailed in our filings with the SEC. We have a strong bias for action to improve our operating performance, to protect our investment grade rating and ensure a strong balance sheet. Specifically, our commitment to have entering recession, a cash balance of $20 billion and liquidity at $30 billion, to preserve our debt capacity and to sustain the fully funded and derisk status of our funded pension plans. All of our capital allocation decisions are made with these priorities front of mind, including funding our traditional products, and non-product investment plans.","Our growth plans for electrification, mobility, connected services and autonomy and our regular dividend. Before we move to Q&A, there are few things I encourage you to keep in mind as you think about Ford, today and for the long term. First, our customers are informing and driving everything we do. That is why 2019 was and 2020 will be such robust product launch years for us. We are bolstering our winning portfolio of vehicles based on what our customers want and need, reallocating capital to those higher return growth opportunities and carrying out changeovers of our highest volume and most profitable vehicles.","Second, we are determined to always get better to persistently improve our fitness and our operating execution. We have abundant opportunities across our business to drive free cash flow, along with long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including adjusted EBIT margins of 8% or better. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and holding investment grade credit ratings. And third, as I look ahead, I'm optimistic. We have many opportunities to improve our operational execution, drive growth, strengthen our financial results including cash flow, in the process earn the confidence of our stakeholders.","Now, let's open the call for questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good evening guys. A first question. As we look at what you're working on right now, there is kind of two layers of rationalization, sort of, there is this near-term operational execution turnarounds that needs to occur and then there's the global redesign. And as we look at this, I mean you're staring down the barrel of great product launches or great products and you got to get those launches right, and products that have just launched.","So, I mean in the near term, it just seems like you've got the product, the operational execution is just a real issue. I'm just curious, I mean we can all see that you're kind of identifying it but what really turns that around. And it's not - the products there, just trying to understand what really gets this operational execution turned in the near term hopefully. And then sort of as you look at the inflection point on the global redesign, is that the kind of thing that's going to hit in late 2020 or early 2021 because what you're indicating as far as the charges, looks like you'll be halfway through. So it's just, it seems like that inflection point is not going to come until 2021. It might still be a headwind in the near term. So in those two layers if you can kind of talk about the actions, you're taking near term and the inflection point on the global redesign.","Jim Hackett","Thanks, John. Jim Hackett here. I think that's well said. I characterize it in the company that we're always managing the now and the far in parallel and they are synergistic, they feed each other. But they have totally different kind of requirements, right? So in the now, the message in the company is we work really hard to get the portfolio rationalized, communicated, we - just to remind you, we went to work really hard on the platform architectures underneath that whole portfolio. At the same time, we feathered in our connectivity. We're working on car architectures that power the vehicles. We're talking about proportion inside of them with electrification.","So there is a lot in that - in that product turnaround. And the market, it's too early for me to tell you the new portfolio share improvements better than the old one. But the market is giving us really good signs there. It does boil down to, we can't miss a beat now in the product launches. Today, for example, I spent a lot of time with Joe and others are working through the F-150. So that's, that's the state and spirit in the company as we saw the mistakes, we X-rayed that deeply for you in the last call, so that you knew, we went to kind of went to the desert to get to the bottom of that. I have zero question that we have identified what's - what was at risk there, what bad decisions we made? What new things we have to change? That's all kind of in the rear view mirror and now it's about executing on the things that we've laid out this year.","So that's my perspective from the product. Tim, maybe you can address the global redesign. The thing I just want to sneak in on the global redesign. This is - this has to happen in parallel. I give our people a lot of credit, because their day jobs of managing what I just laid out runs in parallel as they redesign the company and there is some really bright spots in that. For example, the Europe team has a lot of momentum right now, and you might mention that Tim in your summary of what's been going on there.","Tim Stone","Yes, so from a redesign standpoint, we made, as Jim said, strong progress in 2019. And it's a highlight for the year. Europe, for example is carrying out strong execution of the redesign of its business, announced closure of six manufacturing facilities, eliminated a total of 12,000 positions, and focused on leadership and doubling down on that leadership in commercial vehicles and importing iconic nameplates as well as passenger vehicles.","South America continued to move to lower cost asset-light footprint, including exiting the production of heavy trucks in San Bernardo as you know and discontinued Fiesta and Focus models. And for the year, we saw charges this year of $3.2 billion and total thus far of $3.7 billion. If you factor in the guidance, we're giving on restructuring charges to be at $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion through the end of '20 and from a cash standpoint through the end of '21, $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. And I think the benefits of the redesign as well as the fitness are starting to show through. If you look at 2018, for example, structural costs were flat. 2019, structural costs were down year-over-year. So you're starting to see it reflected in the underlying fundamentals of our results. And as you suggested they continue to build over time as further actions are implemented.","John Murphy","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question, just quickly on Europe and with the CO2 regs tightening this year, next year and going forward. I'm just curious, if you think with your current product portfolio and what you have in the works with the VW alliance that you'll be able to meet the requirements over there, or will you have to do some kind of pooling or pay fines over the next one to two years? And I mean do you think this is something you can solve in-house with product solution or you going to have to go out-house and you're pooling or pay fines?","Jim Hackett","Yes, fair question. This has come up before, John, in previous quarters. But Joe, you might confirm.","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, John, good evening. So we do expect to be able to achieve the new CO2 requirements without incurring fines or purchasing credits. I just want to make that clear. It's a product-driven plan. We've known about these regulations for several years. They were first public back in 2012, 2013. We've been playing the business accordingly. Since then, by the end of 2020, we will have 14 new electrified offerings in the market in Europe. And by the end of '24, we expect to have 17 electrified vehicles including number of mild hybrids, plug-in hybrids, some full hybrids and then a call - including our electric models. So this also includes improvements in our diesel offerings and other products that are internal combustion engines as well.","So we feel really good about the plan, we need to execute the launches on time to make sure that we get the products that we're planning to meet those, but our plan is definitely product-driven and we do not expect to incur any fines, have to pool with anybody else or purchase credits. Thanks.","John Murphy","Great. And then just one just quick question on slide 14, Tim. This $500 million of negative cost, I mean that has the $600 million of the UAW cost and it's - so on a like-for-like basis, costs actually improved in the quarter. Would that be a fair way to read that?","Tim Stone","Slide 15, you said?","John Murphy","Slide 14 you have cost was a negative $0.5 billion. But I would imagine that's got the UAW contract of $600 million.","Tim Stone","So, yes. On slide 14 in North America, UAW is included in other.","John Murphy","Got it. Okay, all right, great, thank you very much.","Jim Hackett","Thank you, John.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache Wolfe Research.","Rod Lache","Great, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more color on your regional auto EBIT expectations for 2020. It seems like you would have a few pretty significant tailwinds set up, which don't really appear to be flowing into your 2020 EBIT guidance for Auto, which you said was up normally - nominally. I guess, essentially, I'm hoping that you can talk a little bit about the direction that you are expecting for each of the key markets. So, like North America obviously, non-recur of the Explorer launch issues and UAW bonus, which are collectively pretty big, is that offset by the - completely offset by the F-Series launch and other items?","And in Europe, I think Joe Hinrichs, you said that most of the 12,000 people that you had commented on leaving were still on the payroll through the end of last year and would have a bigger impact this year. Are those just swamped by the CO2 compliance costs?","Jim Hackett","So Rod, it's good to hear from you, it's Jim. You know there is not a point tonight where we're going to go market by market. We just don't do that for obvious competitive reasons, but let's just repeat what is in, what color is in the guidance we've given.","Joseph Hinrichs","Great. I'll take that, Jim, thanks. So as we said, at least nominal growth in Auto. Jim just said, we are not going to spread that around by region. With Ford Credit being lower, you may have heard in the call, we expect the auction values to be down 5% year-over-year - compared with 2%, sorry in 2019, big driver there, and then increasing investments mobility. As we saw in 2019, $0.5 billion increase for example in mobility investment. So that's the primary color we are providing on the different segments as opposed to the regions.","We also - I can go through the headwinds and tailwinds for you, but they're not to be underestimated that the headwinds, for example, of 2020 launches late in the year F-150 for example, CO2 costs, mobility as I just mentioned, Ford Credit as I just mentioned and then tax rate up to mid to high teens compared to 11% in 2019. Those are the primary headwinds. Tailwinds, we certainly have a full year benefit of the sale of the Explorer, for example, as well as mix and price of new products, and then as I mentioned in the earlier question, the benefits of fitness and the global redesign and of course the non-recurrence of UAW, it's about a $0.6 billion impact.","Rod Lache","Yes, thanks for that. Did you just say that the mobility investments would be up $0.5 billion in 2020?","Joseph Hinrichs","No, I was - thanks for asking. I was saying they were up in 2019 by $0.5 billion, and 2020 they will be up, we are not giving the magnitude.","Rod Lache","Yes. Look, I'm sure you - I mean there are reasons to not provide color on the regional numbers. But from an external standpoint, you start adding up maybe a $1 billion tailwind from explorer and $600 million from UAW and certainly more than $1 billion from this head count in Europe and big plant closure in South America, it's - those - not quantifying that is, it makes it very challenging for us to really assess what you're, what you're facing and what's in there. Do you have an assumption in there for a further increase in warranty costs this year?","Tim Stone","Yes, it will potentially only add to your comment you just made, but I think we took a step forward this quarter in providing a segment level commentary connected with the cash flow and EBIT guidance that we gave, in addition to not providing regional commentary. We're not speaking to specific attributes from a cost standpoint, such as warranty and so forth.","Rod Lache","Okay. And maybe just lastly, you talked about that $7 billion of cash spending on restructuring, the number has been quite low. I think lower than you had originally anticipated in 2019, and it's only up a bit in 2020. Presumably some of the cost savings are kind of tied to the cash restructuring rather than the headline GAAP charges. Could you just give us some color on what's going on there and changing the timing? And whether we should be reading into the trajectory of the turnaround plan based on that?","Tim Stone","Yes. I think slide 20 illustrates the $11 billion in charges and $7 billion and how we're progressing against that $3.7 billion thus far, as I mentioned we factored in the guidance for 2020 would be $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion, potential actions that we are still considering there. The [ph] cash standpoint, $1.1 billion thus far and with the guidance we gave $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. As far as the calendarization of that, we still have several years to continue to execute. I mean on the global redesign, we don't have a new announcement to make today. But I think one of the things we are seeing in the cash savings, cash side, sorry the saving, the team has been especially thoughtful about how we execute on the restructuring actions in Europe and in South America, for example, and taking every opportunity to save cash in the process.","Rod Lache","Just to clarify; Tim, are you suggesting that the number or the cash number may be lower than the $7 billion, or that it would just be more spread out?","Tim Stone","I was addressing the next question about - apologies. I was addressing the question as to why we made them lower that you might have been expecting through 2020. The number is still $11 billion and $7 billion over\u2026","Rod Lache","Okay, all right, thank you.","Jim Hackett","Thank you, Rod. They are over-performing, which is a good thing. That's kind of in the reviews, I've been really impressive, particularly in Europe, as we said.","Operator","All right. Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I'll first echo Rod's comments and about transparency because they really, it really would be helpful. And we understand that you won't be, you can't know with 100% certainty these items and, but we are certainly used to management teams, given their best guess, particularly at a time when there is so much pressure, and when the stakes are so high. So just to say, good on Rod for zoning in on that. First question for me is Tesla, stocks worth. It's kind of historic day as Tesla is now worth over 5 times the market cap of Ford. Jim or Tim or Joe, can you guys understand, can you, are you sympathetic to why that is that state of the world, does it make sense to you. What's the message the market is sending Ford Motor Company?","Jim Hackett","Adam, it's good to hear from you. And the first comment on transparency did not bounce off the atmosphere. I do understand that in this transformation of Ford, the from-to kind of calculus isn't always apparent. For example, consider we've got a portfolio that is in the midst of some things are sunsetting and all these new things are coming out and you, you want to know what can we project in terms of your earnings performance. And it's my instincts that back when we first started talking together that this is going to make a much better Ford and in fact, I mean now, I am now more certain of that. What I didn't count on and we're going to address of course is that we can't fumble execution because we, the value of Explorer launch back in our year is a different kind of story about Ford. So, that's just to confirm that we are doing our best to try and teach you about where we are in the transformation. But it's my confidence that you're going to be happy with that. Now the thing about Tesla is CEOs don't ever talk from this table about competitors. But I have been really candid in the company since I came about what is the business model that's there and what frankly about is attractive? And what you can see in Ford's commitment. I'm really proud of the team here as we arrived in June '17, the propulsion strategy was kind of nil and we got that squared away. We have 17 new hybrid and all-electric models across the entire lineup.","So picture that Ford's in a position where it's got a portfolio of products for its customers, including a bigger extensive offering than the other guy. But the key component of this is the need to have these vehicles connected and over the air communications and the kind of configuration that one can bring to the customers. We already know that the kind of volume we're going to have in car years usage by 2025 will be over 100 million car years of usage of data, so just let that sink in. And that's what, that's what the market sees right, in the future of the car industry, that there is this kind of opportunity for expansion and growth. But I haven't forecasted that in tonight's discussion. It's not, it's because we got to prove that we can get this done, and get it, get it to produce the kind of results that you're seeing there. But I think we're much further along in that journey than we were just two years ago when you and I first started talking about it. How do I know that this Mach-E has generated more attention and kind of interest than in recent memory of any kind of product? The kind of searching that's going on about Bronco would amaze you. And so I know that it is really high, given the execution and the kind of improvements that I just mentioned. So let me, let you react to that.","Adam Jonas","Thank you. No, that's fine, Jim and I think it's - I appreciate the thoughts and I can't wait to get my Mach-E and my kids really can't wait to see the Mach-E in the garage. One follow-up for me, Jim regarding Volkswagen. Is there any limit to the level of collaboration that you can conceive between you and VW? I'm just I'm wondering if there's anything that's theoretically off limits between the two houses during a really historic kind of tectonic time for the industry where it seems like global major OEMs are forming super groups. I'm just wondering, if there is anything off limits here. Thanks.","Jim Hackett","Yes. Well, thank you for ordering the Mach-E. I got to tease you, I just ordered mine last week. I want the world to know I waited. I want to get in the middle of it. I didn't want to be first in line and went really well and they said that I'm right behind Adam Jonas...","Adam Jonas","I'm probably high on the list than you, but I reckon you will still get it before me. But\u2026","Jim Hackett","No, no, that's not the deal, I want to live it. But thank you. VW, so yes I'm proud of in the repetition of the good things that happened last year, how well that came together in kind of an early phasing of what you are now witnessing and the commentary that we made in the opening was that, you don't have to combine Human Resource departments to get the kind of value in the automotive industry that we think we can, we can get arrangements like that. So, I want you to see the optimism that and hear the optimism in my voice that we're open to lots of ideas there. And I want to also stress that Mahindra similarly is proving to us that in emerging in emerged markets, it really is expanding the power of Ford. So right now the plate is full though with the things that we've committed to each other. Those two companies and Ford, we really got a lot going on, and I want to see the conclusion of that before I start adding a lot more to the plate.","Adam Jonas","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse.","Dan Levy","Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the questions. First question, your dividend is a $2.4 billion commitment annually. Obviously, we've seen some profit compression and you do still have to fund your restructuring. So it just means that the dividend right now is being funded by the balance sheet. Could you just talk to the rationale of maintaining the dividend at this level? And what are the threshold and business conditions for you to maintain it?","Jim Hackett","Well, we would like to return value to shareholders. I know that's a really bad answer, but it's true and the dividend has been legendary value creator at Ford. We are really responsible about the way like you say that you think about the use of the balance sheet to fund that. A year ago on this call, I made it clear that my objective and the way I was thinking about all the things coming in front of us is I want to continue to pay the dividend, I wanted to be able to fund the restructuring and make all the investments in the future. You know that those - the balance, all of those interest was behind the business plan that has rolled out. And so I want to continue that because we said we could do it. And right now we can. And Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Tim Stone","No, that's well said. And that's one of the reasons why we look at our targeted cash and liquidity positions, we established those targets of $20 billion and $30 billion, which were $22 billion and $35 billion now, heading into a downturn. So it could be in a position to invest in our long-term investment, the customer experience and fund the dividend for shareholders.","Dan Levy","So I guess that the view is that the liquidity, you have plus the stream of cash flow that you do have you still feel comfortable enough with this level to maintain the dividend. That's a fair assessment?","Tim Stone","That's right. That's why we gave the guidance for the $0.15 per share dividend, throughout this year per quarter.","Dan Levy","Got it. Great, thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I think, a year ago you disclosed that your global truck, van EBIT margin was 14% in 2018. I think actually it's maybe a little higher when you strip out the corporate costs. So as we think about the deterioration in 2019. And what was the likely deterioration in '20, help us maybe understand if we look back at the profit pools, would you say that the truck margin has remained intact and that it's really deterioration in other parts of the business or has that truck margin deteriorated as well?","Jim Hackett","I am going to ask Joe to answer that, because this is a primarily North American kind of question as well. So Joe.","Joseph Hinrichs","Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Dan. I mean, first off, we're very pleased with where we are with our F-Series and Ranger here in North America and the range of performance in places like Europe and other places around the world. Without getting into specifics of the margins in 2019, we're - I also will say that our pricing, transaction prices, incentive levels relative to the competition, and our overall sales volume were all very good in 2019 here in the US and so we feel very pleased with our progress going into a year when we have a new F-150.","We had a new Super Duty at the end of last year. So we're not worried at all about where our competitive position is on our F-Series trucks. In fact, we're really excited about the new trucks that we have coming this year. And if you know that the cycle times of where things are, we get the benefit of a new truck after seeing what GM and Ram have done and actually held on very strongly to our volume and our pricing. If you look at the pricing specifically, we continue to have the highest transaction prices in the segment with the oldest truck on F-series, F-150 specifically and adding Ranger to the portfolio just added to the business, and in fact gave us the largest pickup volume in the US last year of all manufacturers combined, so - or all manufacturers that we compete with.","So we feel really good about where we are on the F-Series. As Jim mentioned, we feel really good about where we are right at this point in time and the launch was coming up in the second half of the year on F-150. So we're not - F-150 and F-Series is of course the crown jewels of our company and we feel really good about where they are competitively and where they are from a profit standpoint.","Dan Levy","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our final - our last question will come from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Thank you. The first question is, maybe just a clarification, Tim, you mentioned mobility investment up modestly, is that apples-to-apples, because aren't you de-consolidating Argo in 2020? So shouldn't that help with your share of the loss being lower?","Tim Stone","Yes. So again in 2019, mobility investment was up $0.5 billion and explaining our range of EBIT guidance for 2020, along with - at least normal growth in Auto and Credit being lower, now we are saying mobility investments to be up again year-over-year, we are not quantifying the amount. We will be de-consolidating Argo when that transaction closes. As a reminder, that's the self-driving system only, the SDS. The go-to market and other aspects of that as far as vehicle customer value proposition is separate level of investment. We're taking a very prudent approach to it.","Joseph Spak","Okay. But just to clarify then, the - should we expect to see the mobility loss higher in '20 even with the de-consolidation.","Tim Stone","Correct.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And then, just maybe a follow-on to Adam's question earlier. And I guess, in the spirit of disrupting yourself from within Jim. I think it's something you mentioned to me once, now that you have some units coming through in '20 and '21, is there any thought to actually just taking and separating out all the electric assets, the Mach-E, the MEB and Rivian derivatives and break that out as like a Ford E similar to what you've done in mobility to sort of help show us that transition?","Jim Hackett","Joe, it's an interesting thought. I'm actually going the other way emotionally, which is I don't think the company can keep itself like of straddling in an old world and a new world forever, it kind of confuses the organization. And so in some of the challenges that I have on mind to do this, I have a friend in the business who said, he carries around a card with what are the toughest conversations and issues that he has got to address and no one really wants to deal with. From my perspective, the transformation has to accelerate and so I don't want to do anything that makes the organization feel like we can park it on the side. And if it does well and grows up it gets attention, but if it doesn't, we didn't really integrate it and so I have stronger instincts the other way. But I understand your question also in terms of, can we do something to prove that our transformation, and our strategy is actually accelerating.","And I get that; I would like to take that away is something that we, that we ought to do is try and show you how the compounding of our new ideas are actually taking off. That's the confidence I want you have tonight is that, that I am seeing them, it's just not material enough to move the needle. And that's what I want you to get the confidence, that is - it will move the needle and it will have impact.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And maybe if I could just squeeze one more in. The $7 billion cash restructuring, you've only spent a little bit, it looks like you've spent a little bit over $2 billion through 2020. I understand that sort of comes when you could sort of make announcements, but should we think that that remaining just under $5 billion will be done by '21 or is that also pushed out versus prior thinking?","Tim Stone","Yes. As far as the time frame on that as you said, $1.9 million to $2.4 billion through the end of '20, of the $7 billion and beyond that, we haven't given specific timelines or calendarization over the next several years. We'll update everyone as we have more information.","Joseph Spak","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Hackett.","Jim Hackett","Thank you. And tonight, you know our slide started with a picture of the Mach-E. And I was inspired by the picture as I waited for you to ask questions. This product that's on that slide lives in great respect for the Ford legacy, but as it respects, it's not in reverence. It's not in such reverence so that it can change. But this vehicle is an iconic example of what we've been working on, the company has to change. It's changing its portfolio, it's restructuring markets like Europe and South America. Europe hadn't been touched for years. It's taking on the bureaucracy. We cut it by a third, $700 million likely in run rate savings.","We mandated connectivity, which was a multi-billion dollar commitment before we had the kind of software to run on this. We build agile team, that's how this vehicle was created. And then there is an obvious question as you look at that and I look at that is can we execute and of course, we can. We will promise that we will earn your trust in that area. And I don't want you to think that we have to struggle on the way to the future, we are not going to cancel the future because of the focus on earnings. We think these - the improvement in earnings that we all want and the requirement that we have to get to our future can live in a synergistic way and build the kind of excitement in Ford Motor Company that you heard Adam and I talking about tonight.","So, thank you for your time on the call.","Operator","This concludes the Ford Motor Company fourth quarter earnings conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company","Thanks very much, Victoria and good morning, and welcome everybody. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2016 earnings review. Presenting today is Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; also participating are John Lawler, Vice President & Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO Ford Smart Mobility; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.","As usual, copies of the press release and presentations are available on our website. And also as usual, there are some non-GAAP references and those are reconciled in the appendix to the GAAP measures.","Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, actual results may vary. As a reminder, Ford Credit has a call later today at 11 A.M. to discuss third quarter results and later today, we'll be filing our 10-Q and based on some of your feedback, we've added some supplemental information to help with the analyses that some of you've requested and that's on pages 54 and 55 of the 10-Q.","And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Mark. Mark?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered our better than expected company adjusted pre-tax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America and this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty cost from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. Now, during the quarter, in addition to the all new Super Duty, we also launched the all new Lincoln Continental and I'll talk more about these as we go through the call.","Looking at our global market share, it was down slightly and we had improved share in Asia Pacific and that was offset by results in North America, South America, and Middle East and Africa. Turning to Europe, we had our best third quarter profit there since 2007, and it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there.","Looking at Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth plus our best ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remains strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first nine months of the year, our pre-tax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago.","Now, we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company, and that's a full year company adjusted pre-tax profit of about $10.2 billion.","Now, if you turn to slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the four drivers of shareholder value and that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region.","We also announced our intent to have a high volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide importantly new sources of growth for Ford.","In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong, and we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies, net of economics across the business, as we once again in the quarter delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan and that's despite the large recall in the period.","In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million and that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attracted dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date we rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions.","Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start and we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important Truck of Texas award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise.","Moving over to Europe, we launched our new KA+ which is imported from India as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business and the initial feedback on the KA+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near-term with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities.","So, let's turn to our view of the global business environment and you can see that on slide 6. Global growth remains below trend and that's due to recessions in key emerging markets, as well as some constraints on business investment spending. Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume.","Just looking at the UK in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of their present cycle.","So, with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Thanks, Mark, let's turn to the next slide, slide 8. This is our key financial summary and I want to start by just base-lining this with some of the key data. So we'll start with the third quarter, in the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics.","So, first, company adjusted pre-tax results of a $1.4 billion. Net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So, as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations.","If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances very, very strong, and cash above our target of $20 billion.","Now, we're going to go through a number of these things in detail through the deck, but two things I want to highlight that we won't talk about again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pre-tax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations, and our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%.","And if we move over to the first nine months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pre-tax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share, and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see, in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history.","Okay. Let's go to slide 9. And now, we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business, and these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left, and let's look at the segment results, $1.1 billion, in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services. And then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations $223 million negative, that's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about.","Now, if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable, South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart though I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down a $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So, when we get to North America slide, this is really where the story for the business occur in the quarter versus last year.","Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that. Here we had guided you, this quarter being about $1 billion million which is 10% of our outlook for the full year, we did come in better, our view of that is it's simply, a re-calendarization of some items from fourth quarter into third quarter and vice versa. And it's really around marketing accruals. There's about a $100 million of good news in marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. The balance is a number cost changes, cost improvements that took place in the quarter, but it is $20 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost and that will be offset in the fourth quarter yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at Investor Day.","Okay. Let's go on to the next slide, slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesale is down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down one-tenth of a point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower, Europe was flat, Asia Pacific was higher. If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on the global basis that was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe, the other business units or regions were lower.","Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply, that was driven by North America. Now one of things I want to touch on here and I'll mention it again when we get to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall, which if you recall from our 8-K that we issued is around $600 million. Not all companies do that, some companies will treat that as a special item. We included it in the operating results because it is a normal course of the business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics 7% would have been 7.5%. I'll say the same thing when we get to the North America slide.","All right, let's go slide 11, and this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. You can see we're down $1.7 billion, this was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then of course, the impact of the recall and you can see that in the warranty item in the callout box for the contribution cost.","I do want to mention net pricing, this is the first quarter we've had this year, a positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific and that decline was just a usual downwards overall industry pricing \u2013 negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide.","All right, let's move on to the regions and we'll start as usual with North America on slide 12. These are key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%, that was driven by volume.","Market share was down 0.5 point, now within that, that's the region. Canada was actually up 1.6 points, Mexico was up three-tenths of a point, the U.S. was down seven-tenths of a point, that's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S. that was around a retail decline, that was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was more than explained by rental. F-Series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis.","When you look at the SAAR, it was down about two-tenths, 200,000 units for the region; that was more than explained by the U.S. consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units, but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis.","Margin and PBT were down sharply, but again if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So, it's still a very healthy margin and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which again are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis.","Okay. Let's move on to the following slide and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So, North America down $1.6 billion; there are three things that are happening here. Now, I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about a third of the entire decline. The first impact is a Super Duty launch and so this is the effect of less volume, but also launch cost that always comes along with the launch. So, that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day.","The second item is around normalization of F-150 and so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's two things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So, in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix.","In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, a normal balance of series mix and options, although still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago, as we continue to maintain our production alignment demand.","And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So, those three things effectively explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company. I do want to highlight the positive pricing, this is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver, it was a major factor, but not the key driver. So, that was a very positive effect.","And you can see on the far right, we did have \u2013 continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry.","In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%, that's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And just a couple of comments on the market in the U.S. here. Our view is the industry is at a relatively strong level, but the retail market is softening and the pricing environment is getting tougher. And as you've seen and as we've communicated previously, we have taken some production adjustments on a number of selected models to match production to demand and that's consistent with our strategy.","We do expect some further actions in the fourth quarter and that will be primarily related to Fusion and Focus and Escape and one fewer crew next week building F-150 at Kansas City. And then our approach on incentives, Bob mentioned incentives in the industry, our approach is to be competitive and disciplined, and I think, as you've seen in certain segments in the last few months, when the competition has increased incentives, we prioritize margins over market share, and you can see that in our results.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Let's move on to South America. In South America, the key metrics shown on this slide, slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of the economic indicators that while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards.","And so I think we feel comfortable that at least direction of the economies in South America seem to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past, but that's a positive sign.","If you look at the metrics, the top-line is lower, that's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower, that was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10% that was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%.","Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first quarter and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation, as well as negative operating exchange effects.","The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost. In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015.","Okay. Let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us, it was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007.","If you look at the operating margins and profits up very sharply, I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter \u2013 or in the year over $1 billion and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So, we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe. The team has done a wonderful job and it's showing up in the results.","And that's despite the fact if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the UK as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We certainly announced a price increase, a number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down, that was driven by those actions, although actually in the quarter, the SAAR of the UK was unchanged, but we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold.","Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So, up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options, good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange, we're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the non-recurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. But the other thing I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So, Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is, but very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business.","In terms of guidance, clearly we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And just a little bit more flavor on Brexit impacting the UK because obviously we get a lot of questions on that. As Bob mentioned, so far, we haven't seen a major impact on the industry. We've seen retail down slightly, but that's offset by increasing fleet deliveries. And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with transit, which once again was the number one commercial vehicle in the UK and also across Europe.","What we are watching though is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors have taken pricing in the UK and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So, we're getting ahead of that as Bob mentioned from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the potential negative effects on the market.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Let's move on to Middle East and Africa. This is the only slide as usual that we have for this region. This is an unusually large loss for us. If you look at the first quarters and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here.","So, if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down, that's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume, as well as the revenue. Our share was lower, although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for exclude Iran, which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is, the markets we participate in were declining and Iran was growing. So, it's a geographic mix effect.","What's happening in terms of profitability is issues in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's a very oil-based to one that's more diverse pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We are working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter. Probably a loss still, but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter.","But year-to-date you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter, nor do we see this as a run rate. For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago, but again think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made.","Okay. Let's move onto Asia Pacific. This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember we talked about performance issues in China and then and Mark, I think had some commentary around the actions the team that were working to address that. And I think I have to tell you they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here, wholesale is up 30%, the revenue is up 16%. The share improved and that's not just in China, we had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN and India.","So it was pretty broad based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements, in fact most of the improvement is coming from outside China. But having said that, if you look on the far right, towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute on an equity after tax basis $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million and our margin came in at 13.4% which was an improvement of seven-tenths a point from the year ago. So we feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China, but broadly across the region.","Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change and our profitability of $100 million and you can see, it was driven primarily by volume. If you go across the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region, this was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so, we were up a bit more than that but it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations has been at the beginning of the year.","So, when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, a good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was at a year ago and that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And just as Bob mentioned back in the second quarter call, he mentioned that we expected our third quarter to show improvement and the reason for that is, we're going to really leverage our new product launches and also step up our go-to-market strategy. And as you can see from the results, we had market share improvement, importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month, and also then the increased profitability for the quarter.","And as we look forward, obviously we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches, we'll have a full quarter of the freshened Kuga, we have the Mondeo coming in the quarter and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Let's turn to Ford Credit on slide 21. Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter $567 million, that was up little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow that was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio. Performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise, but still below what we would consider to be a normal level, it's probably more around 50 basis points to 60 basis points.","So if we go the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis, this was driven by higher charge-offs and our lease residuals also were down on year-over-year basis and that was driven by, as you can see in the call-out box, our outlook for lower auction values particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles still in our portfolio.","Let's go over to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit, just want to highlight the top two. So on the upper left, you can see auction values, our auction values continued. They were down $235 sequentially looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products.","If we go to the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down although at a very high level, we're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business also and recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years. And so, we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that.","Okay. Let's move now to automotive cash flow. And you can see here, towards the middle of the page, the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in the working capital, largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks and then you can see there is also an adverse effect and timing differences, again that was related to the stock changes, any impact that had on the marketing accruals. If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million.","We're actually changing our guidance for the full year. On pension contributions, we expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we've guided to, that $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. Dividends came in at $600 million and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year.","Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So, I just want to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you last time, we're still looking very, very good for the automotive business as well as Ford Credit.","I would like highlight the pension performance, you can see $7 billion in terms of a funded status but I just want to remind you that we will re-measure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So, this reported number does not reflect the impacts on the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016.","I will say, however, because of all the actions taken over the last number of years to de-risk and to fund our pension plans, we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end 2016, that will largely be outside of U.S., because we're ahead of the overseas market in terms of getting those plans funded.","So, with that, that concludes my comments and I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks Bob. Okay, if you turn to slide 26, this sums up our industry and also our GDP planning assumptions. And all in all, we see some risk to global GDP growth, as you have things like policy uncertainty including what's going on with Brexit negotiation, that adds to existing weakness that we see in global trade flows, but also in just business investment spending in total, and this is offset partially by steady consumer sector in most of the major markets.","So today we're updating our global GDP guidance to 2.9% and that really comes in at the low end at the prior range that we guided. For industry volumes, we are providing some upward adjustments, slight upward adjustments for China and Europe with a small downward adjustment for Brazil.","Now, as you've seen, we have had a strong first nine months for the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pre-tax profit, to be about $10.2 billion and again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000.","And just kind of bringing in it all together, if you go to slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever as I mentioned, but that's following a third quarter that was better than expected, but lower than a year ago, as we guided.","We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking the actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see is a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S., and of course uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit.","Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong, and we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our roadmap to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans, the performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and of course our parts business. Transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed and that includes luxury small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility, that will define and also differentiate the future of our business.","So, with that, why don't we just open it up and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","A lot of investors have been struck by the difference in sort of optimism versus pessimism between yourselves and one of your neighbors. Just a couple of things. One, could you maybe highlight where you see kind of the market going in 2017? Do you think there is risk of further downside? And two, once we get past these dealer stock reductions, how you're looking at the market in terms of fighting for share versus letting it drift down to where it might naturally go?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Brian. First off, I would call our approach realism, not optimism, not pessimism, it's realism. And we've \u2013 number of us have been through a number of cycles, and we're looking at the data and big part is interpreting that and what it means for our business. So, I think as we look at the market going forward, as you look at the balance of this year in the fourth quarter, we expect the SAARs will probably about the same as last year but with retail being down.","And then as we get in \u2013 and with that a tough and more competitive pricing environment. And you can see that in the data that we're all looking at today. You're looking at incentive levels on an absolute basis go up. They're in the industry, they're going up as a percent of MSRP. As we get into 2017 as you know we've guided to an industry that will be slightly down. I think it was 17.7% for next year and then 17.5% for 2018.","So at relatively strong levels, we don't see a recession on the horizon but we do see a marketplace that from a cycle standpoint, it's mature. And we're starting to see the evidence of that and I think we're being very proactive in looking at these pieces of data and taking I think very prudent actions and realistic actions for our company.","And as you look at your comment of fighting for share versus pricing, et cetera. It's always a balance. We want to optimize our profitability and we want to optimize our market share and you've seen, look at the latest quarter, last quarter here in the U.S. in the full-size pickup segment. We saw a lot of variability in incentive spend and even in that environment, our retail share of the segment was even and it's up year-over-year. We spent the least incentives in the segment and have some of the highest transaction prices. And that's the approach that we're going to take going forward as we see the market go wherever it wants to go.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","If I can, the only thing I would add is, we're also seeing a maturing credit cycle. You can see that with the used vehicle values. So I think that's another sign or signal in terms of \u2013 we are just at a different part of the cycle. Again not bad, but just a different part, yeah.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just a quick follow-on question to that, Bob. You \u2013 I'm struck by the pullback in leasing at Ford Credit. Do you think that's having an impact in the showrooms or you are you using other promotional tactics to kind of keep the consumer there?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I think \u2013 Brian, this is Mark. I think as Bob mentioned upfront, naturally we wanted a lower rate, because you just look at the mix of our products, right, we sell more trucks and vans, which you know tend to lease less, we have a less of a percentage of luxury sales.","And as Bob mentioned, we previously guided, beginning of the year, about 20% was about right. In terms of looking at, is it impacting in the showroom? You could say it's having some level of impact. At the same time, we do have an opportunity to take those funds we would spend on that and port them over to maybe some retail incentives. So, yeah, in general it probably has some level of impact. It depends on the region, obviously depending upon the leasing concentration, but probably modest at this point.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Just hoping we can follow up a little bit on kind of the big picture pricing view on North America. You're cutting production, it looks like by 12.5% in the fourth quarter. So, it looks like you're really positioning to have very tight inventory by year-end, but at the same time it looks like GM's production gets in the \u2013 almost the 100 days over the course of Q4 and Q1, and as you mentioned we're seeing some pretty aggressive incentives from Fiat Chrysler. So, I guess my question is, when you're positioning and talking about this strategy, and perhaps willing to accept lower market share but protect profitability, does that strategy kind of vary on a product by product basis? I know you're adding quite a bit of content here on some of these vehicles, particularly the pickup trucks. So does that limit your options, vis-\u00e0-vis pricing competitiveness?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","No. I think overall Rod, our strategy is pretty consistent across the segments. As I mentioned upfront in Brian's question, it's always a balance of optimizing pricing and market share. And that's the approach we take pretty consistently across the patch on all of our segments.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just a data point on Europe and China. Could you update us on what your updated view is on the Brexit impact now with the pound where it is currently? And on China, you mentioned that you're expecting a little bit of a decline; obviously the pricing and the RMB. Could you just remind us of how you are thinking about the magnitude of the pull forward that's occurring now and how that kind of plays out as you look out, maybe preliminarily, on 2017?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I'll start and Mark can supplement. So, in terms of Brexit effect, so what we saw in the second quarter just to remind you, we took a $60 million hit related to the balance sheet, because of the weakness of the sterling that occurred after the vote on the 23rd. We then said we'd see about $140 million of impact in the second half of the year and that was around actions we would take in anticipation of lower industry. So, we've already started to do that in the quarter. So, we start to make those stock adjustments. So, as I mentioned, Rod, in Europe, even though the industry hasn't yet actually declined, we started to take stocks down, so we had a stock reduction in the quarter versus the stock build a year ago.","We announced a price increase, gross price increase of about 2.5% on September 1. A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So, I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on the industry; we're just getting ahead of it with the adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we're expecting, then we've got the ability to react to that, so we'll be very flexible on that.","In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the effect is probably about $600 million. So, think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half, on a full year basis, and the balance is around sterling, and if anything there could be potentially some risk on the sterling, given how weak it became following the Tory Conference, and the comments from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So, we still have a little bit of exposure, but you know we're comfortable right now with that $600 million.","If you look at Asia-Pacific, in terms of what's happening with pricing, and the year-to-date, the industry is down about 6% as best we can tell. We're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate; we talked about that in the second quarter. And we saw that continue to moderate in the third.","In the third quarter, industry year-over-year was down about 4%. I think we were down about 5%, and sequentially I think it was down about 1 point, 1.3 points. So, we are seeing a decline of \u2013 the pace of the decline in pricing. We've built that into our outlook.","You want to add anything to that?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","No, it's good.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, you believe that the price deterioration will moderate as you look out into 2017, just despite some expectations of maybe currently we're benefiting from pull forward demand?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, we think there'll be some moderation. Our assumption \u2013 we've mentioned this before, our assumption is that, the purchase tax incentive will not be extended. We'll have to wait and see. I think there's some conflicting signals now coming from the government. That's our assumption, but again, we're prepared to respond if that's not the case.","I think I would also \u2013 it's interesting you mentioned that what we've seen is because the Chinese renminbi is now part of the IMF basket of currencies. It's actually weakened as the sterling has weakened, because they're trying to balance the renminbi versus that currency and the effect it's had on the basket. So, interestingly Brexit has actually had an effect on us in Asia-Pacific.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I hate to follow up on this question again just on pricing. I mean, it does seem like pricing in the quarter was very strong for you guys. You are being very aggressive on adjusting your stocks to demand with these production cuts, but you are also \u2013 it looks like you've gotten pulled back dramatically on leasing as well. And it looks like you are playing the game of holding up pricing, both on the new vehicle side and on the residual side, and taking a hit on volume and playing sort of the long game. And I'm just curious; as you think about these pricing decisions, I think everybody is focused on inventory production and pricing actions by competitors in the very near term. But as you think about this, I mean, how does the residual value now in the next three to five years play into this decision process? And are we seeing something that is a little bit more balanced short term and long term thinking now?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, John, we always think of both as we make these decisions. We're just standing back and again looking at the macro factors. And Bob mentioned this, when residual values are extremely important to our customers and they're extremely important to us, and we're just looking at the physicals, right? We are looking at an industry, where it is in the cycle. It's mature, the retail industry is coming down, we're looking at the levels of leasing and the number of leasing vehicles that are coming back this year and projecting out over the next two years or three years. They're going to get to levels that we have never seen on an absolute basis in the industry before.","So, that's telling us and informing us and saying, we need to get ahead of that. And that's our philosophy in terms of how we're looking at this, we're looking at the short-term data, we're looking at the leading indicators and that's informing our decisions, both in the short-term and the long-term.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, it's not an either or, we're just trying to balance and try to find the optimal mix, which is constantly shifting, because it's a dynamic competitive environment. But that's what we're doing and that's what we always do.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","It's refreshing. Just a second question on Ford Motor Credit. You cited volume and mix as being a pretty significant positive in the quarter. I'm just curious what was driving that, given volumes were down on absolute terms on volumes. Are you seeing a higher penetration rate and are there other products that you are using that would drive mix positively there? Just trying to understand what's going on.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, one thing I'll mention and then I'll have Marion talk about, which is kind of interesting and I think I've seen some reports on this. We are seeing more Chinese consumers, finance their vehicles and we're participating in that as well. So, we did see more contracts in China as we saw a greater percentage of our customers that we finance, that were going up, and maybe Marion can provide some color and texture.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co.","Thanks, Bob. So, John, Bob is right, we have seen growth in all of our products globally over the last year, remember this is the portfolio business. So, we had good growth during 2015, which then shows the year-over-year growth in 2016 over 2015. So, but Bob, sorry, we did have a record quarter in China and we continue to see volume growth there, but it's been around the world as well.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Then just lastly on pension contributions $1.2 billion versus your previous expectation of $1.5 billion. It sounds like some of that is spilling over into next year, but how should we think about pension contributions going forward, Bob? Is this the kind of thing where you are largely done or are we going to see sort of $500 million to $1 billion numbers going forward?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, what we've said is, recently we said $1.5 billion this year and then $500 million to $700 million, it depends on the year going forward. We don't have to make that $300 million this year, so we're not going to, but we will next year. So, it just moves to the next year. So, think about this year $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion next year, let's say instead of $700 million, it's $1 billion. That's kind of the dynamic that we see. And then going after next year probably in that $500 million to $700 million range, it will depend on the year.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Great, thanks for taking my question. Given Q3 came in better than expected, what is the key reason that guidance for the full year didn't come up slightly? Is it the Q4 production cuts; was that not part of your thinking earlier in the year or? What are the key drivers?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah. Let me take that one. It was \u2013 we thought it was a $1 billion, that was our forecast, it came in stronger. And when we kind of peeled back and looked at what was behind that. So, the first thing was we saw marketing accruals came in about $100 million light or favorable in the quarter, but when we look at the physical, it's just timing that will reverse in the fourth quarter, so that's not going to change anything.","And then the rest, it was really around cost performance. We got about $300 million of cost performance across the regions and across the business. And when we pulled it back, it was $20 million here, $30 million there, $40 million, I mean there wasn't any one big thing and so, as we looked at it and discussed it with the regions I think the view was, it was just timing. So, fairly we've had a huge pressure and focus on cost reductions and hopefully that was also what drove it, but there's nothing compelling that would tell us that the full year is going to come out any differently, so our point of view now is it's just timing.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And It sounds like your view on the US market hasn't changed. Has the mix outlook changed at all with the F-150 production cuts? Does that imply that you think pickups may weaken or is that just response to the competition?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I think when you look at the segment in the quarter, it's relatively strong, maybe not grown as strong as we expected but I think it's against the backdrop, Colin, of \u2013 listen we're still in a strong industry, pickups in general are still strong. If you look at just September, we had our strongest retail F-Series month of the year and when you look at the demand, obviously as I mentioned earlier, we saw a lot of variability in incentives spend from the competitors and that said when you look at the metrics on how we're performing in terms of incentive spends, transaction prices, et cetera, the response to the new Super Duty and transaction prices literally near the top of the industry.","We feel pretty good about the full size pickup segment, but at the same time you have to think about it in terms of overall we're seeing in the industry in terms of some weakening in the retail end and we'll keep watching it and that's why we're being proactive around our stocks. We want to protect that brand, we want to protect that franchise and we want to protect the residual values for our customers.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Going back to Ford Credit, very strong quarter there. Any color on the sustainability of that number though? I think it was the highest since 2011. Is there something unique in the quarter or it seems like you've been cautious on that business, yet it was pretty good.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co.","There was a \u2013 I think the only thing I would highlight was sort of one time in the quarter Colin, and if you go to slide 22 and look at the call-out box you can see we got $41 million of good news in terms of derivatives, which is just it happens in the quarter, may or may not continue on \u2013 it's tied to interest rates. So, that was unusual.","When you look at the balance of the year, we're not going to have a strong quarter in the fourth quarter and the team will talk about that in the call at 11 o'clock, but that is largely around what's happening it's going to continue to happen on residual values. The only thing I would highlight that will be unusual in that quarter, that doesn't change the company results, it's just a payment that's going to go from one part of the business to the other, which is about $80 million payment that Ford Credit's going to make to Ford of Europe. And that's around funding the gap that we have and one of the plans in \u2013 pension plans in Europe that Ford Credit's going to satisfy, and then Ford Europe will actually kind of manage that going forward, and so that will be a shift of $80 million between the two. It will affect Europe's or rather Credit's results, but has no impact on the business, it will be good news in Europe. And I'll talk more about that and give you more flavor at the 11 o'clock call.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And Just one last question. China margins again were very, very strong, I think 15% net income margin. How do you think about that the next year in an environment that may be flat with pricing pressure? Are you going to be able to find cost offsets or should those margins moderate a bit?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, you know, as Bob mentioned as we look at the pricing environment in China, it's been negative for quite some time, that's our assumption going forward and what it means very simply Colin is making sure that we continue to bring out new and fresh product, that's what's driving the performance that you see in the recent quarter in terms of either it's our new MKZ, or Taurus, or Everest or the freshening of the Cougar that's driven there. And as we think about going forward, the continual focus on costs not only structural costs within china and Asia Pacific, but material costs particularly after we launched the products and as you know once we launched the products we have a lot of efforts on material cost.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks Colin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning everybody.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","I wanted to get a little bit more color on the North American pricing performance in the quarter. As you pointed out, this is the first positive quarter for pricing and it clashes a little bit with comments around increasing incentives and pricing environment getting tougher. And so any color on what has been going right this quarter and how to think about it going forward?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah. I think when you \u2013 if you go to slide 13, I think it is \u2013 which is the North American year-over-year details. As you can see in the call-out box, we did have an increase in incentives, it's just that we had more favorable impact on the pricing side.","When you look at the details of it, it was \u2013 obviously we got some good news on Super Duty, although frankly the number of units we sold in the quarter was pretty modest because of the timing of the launch, but we have some good news there. But the rest of it was just the guys pricing \u2013 taking pricing opportunities where they saw them across the portfolio. I mean there was good news across quite a number of our products particularly as we went from 2016 model year or into the 2017 model year that they're starting to just be able to eke out if you will and collectively generated the type of result that we did, it wasn't really so much around any one thing or big launches or whatever, it was very widespread across the portfolio.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And so, looking forward?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","So, looking forward, I wouldn't talk about next year, I think, we could see some continued positive pricing in the fourth quarter, I don't think it would be anywhere near this level, but it could be a little bit positive. But I don't think it will be as positive.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, that's great. Then just on Europe; so you were mentioning some of the dynamics around Brexit and I think you said you are 80% currency hedged for next year. I know it's probably very early to look at beyond next year, but at the same time I guess 2018 is when you have been suggesting your earnings would sort of go back and increase again. What does the Brexit impact look like on the \u2013 once those hedges roll off?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I don't know because I don't what the exchange rates will be, I mean we'll have to see. And in fact one of the things I just want to remind you and remind you all is, we not only hedge out for next year, but we already have some hedges in place, and 2018 obviously much less so than 2016 or 2017, but we've got somewhat 2018 already protected. I think, it's a big uncertainty \u2013 so let me just say one thing. So the team will have more time obviously to respond to what they've seen from the impact of Brexit. Maybe I'm working seriously ever since the June 23 to react to this cost mix, every single part of the business.","So, there'll be more time to sort of reposition and reset the business in terms of this new environment. I think the big question mark for the industry is what happens when the negotiations are concluded, particularly around duty rates, and that's a complete TBD and that will be sometime apparently in 2019.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Let me also \u2013 I know you're asking a question about Brexit, but it's \u2013 let me give some perspective on Europe, because as Bob mentioned if you look year-to-date, we've made over $1 billion. And the growth rates \u2013 the industry across Europe was up about 4% in the quarter, so we're seeing that steady growth. Importantly as we said we're seeing a strong growth in the commercial vehicle market, now in the UK but across the continent which plays well for us given transit.","We're seeing SUVs as the percentage of the industry, it's up another 2 points or 3 points across the industry. And as you know we've had a strategy to reposition the Ford brand in Europe in terms of moving it up a bit. And as you saw from the results and Bob mentioned, the mix improvements have not only come from the products, the product line mix like Mondeo and Mustang and Ranger, but it's also come by a very deliberate strategy on series mix.","And to give you just a couple of data points where we have a very high series mix on our transit of Ranger over 50% of the mix on Ranger is the Wildtrak version, which is the high-end version. And on Edge, over 50% of the mix is on the sport version. So, nearly 50% of our Edge is been sold for \u20ac50,000 or more. So, we're going to continue that strategy across Europe and also in the UK.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, let me just add one other thing. Remember, Emmanuel in my comments I talked about Russia.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Russia is having a very nice positive year-over-year effect in Russia or in Europe. So, you can imagine throughout 2017, 2018, 2019 as that economy continues to improve as oil prices stabilize or even continue to improve further, that's going to have a nice effect on our business. We stayed, because we saw that opportunity, we're seeing it come home even this year, that is another factor, I think you don't want to forget our business in Europe.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","That's great color. Thank you.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody. I got a couple of questions. First, on the topic of vehicle safety, I'm sure you guys have seen the FHA data from the first half of this year, unfortunately with traffic fatalities up by 10.5%, on a comp it was up the better part of 10% the prior year. And you're in an interesting position to be able to commercialize these relatively affordable technologies that really address that, and I'm sure it's in everybody's interest that you do that, and we know you're aware and it's in your interest and you want to do it.","I guess the question for you is, how much on a per-unit basis, as you talk to Raj's team and your suppliers, how much would it take, putting aside the fully-autonomous robo stuff. To make a real dent in vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian safety, like per car, are we talking to make accidents like a third less likely for your new vehicles? Is it hundreds of dollars a car, it is a $1,000 or is it several thousand? Just high-level, Mark, would really appreciate it given all your exposure to this technological discussion?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, high level, yeah, it's some degree of money; I can't give you a figure, whether it's $300, $3,000, et cetera. If you look at the way the safety features, the driver-assisted features that we have on our vehicles today, we literally offer them across \u2013 either standard or options across our vehicle lineup. And if you look at the pricing, we're very competitive along those lines.","To your question around the fatalities, that's why we're so bullish on autonomous vehicles, and as you know the societal and safety benefits that can have from that, but let's face it, I haven't seen the data yet. But if you really want to improve vehicle safety, you take peoples' phones away from them, so they can't text while they're driving, because I have a feeling that a lot of the increase on that has to do with that.","Now, we \u2013 our approach on that is through our SYNC system, allow people to do it, rather than touching their phones, keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel, and that's our approach. But, it's an interesting question, but one in which I can't give you an exact answer.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well maybe just as a follow-up; before this stuff gets regulated and is standard equipment, you do have big players out there like Toyota talking about making AEB, for example, standard across their global lineup by as soon as 2018, 2019. If a big competitor like that does something, I mean is it safe to assume that Ford can't be far behind, just from a marketing and consumer advocacy and safety standpoint?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","When you look \u2013 it's a good question. When you look at our brand, one of things we're known for is safety...","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","...and you can expect that we will continue to build and defend that.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Last question, then. As you make a big push towards electric vehicles, you've been very clear in your capital markets day and your communication on how you are putting potentially billions and billions in that effort of electrification. Does that open up an opportunity for you to bring in an entirely new consumer electronics supply base, players like the LG and Samsung and Panasonic, et cetera, that maybe traditionally were maybe only peripheral automotive suppliers and now could be something a lot more substantial? And for you to bring them in and kind of add a little competitive fire to your traditional Tier 1 mechanical suppliers to kind of \u2013 as a negotiating tactic and to play one off versus the other. Not that it's \u2013 just in \u2013 for the sake of improving the product and getting a lower purchase bill of materials. Is that an opportunity?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, yeah. We're always looking for new suppliers and when you speak of some of the technologies around electrification, we are using a number of new suppliers. The key thing, as you know, Adam, is coming into the auto industry, the duty cycles, the automotive safety grade of those parts and components is absolutely essential. And sometimes, we find when we bring some new suppliers in, they're kind of surprised at that. But our job is to educate them on that, and I think, you'll continue to see us do that, and look across the landscape for the best supplier that give us the best technology, world-class technology at the best cost.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Mark.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to really delve into the Super Duty a little bit more. Are you learning anything different than your expectations about the cost to produce or the line speed, et cetera, that would make you feel any different about its profit contribution in 2017 versus 2016?","I think that the Super Duty is being fully redesigned for the first time in years, so it may be costly to produce. That was part of the thought process that that would offset some of the pricing mix benefits of the new version in 2017. So I'm asking because I remember that the F-150 launch, it went better than expected, right, with cost to produce being a little bit less and that was one of the drivers of upside in 2015. So just curious if maybe you are seeing anything similar as you get more experience producing the product.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I think overall, Ryan, first off from a demand standpoint, we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a really good response to the product. In terms of the launch in the plant, as you know, the plant, we took the learnings from the launches that we had in Dearborn and Kansas City on the F-150. The launch came up very fast, it came up very well; the quality is good coming out of the plant. We \u2013 the suppliers are performing well, we do have an issue on one supplier that's trying to keep up with us on demand and we're working with them on that. But as our usual process, we'll launch, settle the plant down, and that's where the teams \u2013 once we get to the launch levels and the plant is stable, that's when we really start going to town on looking at are there ways of getting more efficient in terms of the productivity on the line, but also material costs.","In terms of 2017, we're going to continue to follow that pattern in terms of impacts, as Bob has mentioned, when you look at the margins on the new Super Duty, they are lower than the previous one, and that's because it's the first time we've redone the product in 18 years. But we'll continue to follow the process and continue to work on the cost and the margins over time.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just the last question is on Middle East and Africa. The loss there was a lot bigger than we've seen historically. And I know, Bob, I heard you say to not take that as a run rate, but also maybe to expect some losses there going forward. So the question is really was there anything unusual weighing on the region in the quarter? And then if the losses are to continue for some time, do you maybe need to reevaluate your participation in some of the many markets in that region, sort of similar to what you did with Japan and Indonesia earlier?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well. First thing I guess I would say, yeah, I think there was something unusual and that's what I was trying to highlight in my comments, which is around the performance of the business in Middle East and specifically in Saudi. And that was a combination of what's happening in the external environment, but also our own, if you will, business performance, which we're working hard to address.","I think we'll get that back on track just like we did in China. When I look at the fourth quarter and quarter-to-quarter, I just think we're going to see on a quarterly basis, improvements across most parts of the business. It's just the thing you've just got to keep in mind, Ryan, I think this is a different conversation than in Japan or Indonesia \u2013 is the external environment is sort of similar to Russia and South America, is this is an environment that's been affected by the commodity cycle, it's been very affected by oil, particularly in the Middle East. It's been affected to some extent by geopolitical issues.","So, I think it's a different conversation and discussion. I think we'll end up with much better results in the fourth quarter based on what we see today, and going forward I do think the team's got a really, really good growth plan that will get us to profitability and very, very good returns over the business planning period.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one just on Europe. As you think about the Brexit headwinds that you've outlined and then some of the positives from Russia, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts if the positives from Russia can actually outweigh some of the negative effects that you're expecting from the Brexit situation.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","We always assumed that we'd see improvement in Russia; I just didn't want you guys to forget about it, because we're still there, and we're seeing that benefit. It's a tool in our toolkit that maybe some others don't have in terms of where the business will go in the future, but that was the case before Brexit.","Brexit is a new thing and we're going to have to respond to that. The team is doing that by looking at every single part of the business. I do think we've got that added benefit of an improving Russia business to help us. But, clearly, the business excluding Russia, we have a lot of work to do to sort of rethink how we get to those 6% to 8% returns that we're targeting, but Jim Farley and his team are all over it.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And just remember, David, the guidance that we gave at Investor Day, that the 2017, we expect Europe to continue to be profitable but at a lower level than we see in 2017 -2016. And that's specifically taking into account the impact that we're presently projecting for Brexit.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And then just on the back of that, when we think about moving from growth in Western Europe to growth in Eastern Europe, what impacts does that have on your mix specifically?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","I'm not sure I understand the question.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, when you think about the vehicles that you are selling, right, in terms of the UK you called out you've been doing well in the commercial vehicle market in the Transit vans. Smaller cars, SUVs; as you move from Western Europe into Eastern Europe, are we talking about larger vehicles that could potentially be helpful? Are you looking at smaller vehicles with less content? I'm just trying to think about the mix of vehicles as we move from Western Europe to Eastern European growth.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, one thing I would highlight and Mark touched on it, we are now providing the KA+, which is coming from India, replacing the vehicle that was actually built by Fiat for us in Poland. So, we've got the opportunity to \u2013 particularly given the reaction that we're starting to see to that product, I think, we've got the opportunity to get a lot more out of that part of the business, plus we've been working very, very hard on our small vehicle business in Russia across Ford entirely, but certainly \u2013 not Russia, in Europe. And I think the actions that will be coming to market in the future are going to give us an opportunity to see more contributions in smaller vehicles, that's certainly part of the equation that Jim and the team are working on. That will help as well.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, maybe it's more appropriate for your 11 o'clock call. But when we think about leasing characteristics, what levels of subvention are you at today? Where is that from a year ago and where do you expect that to go going forward?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, we don't provide that level of specificity. I would just say that the costs of subvention are rising and they're high because of what's happening with residual values. And so that's certainly something that we have to take into consideration because we can take those funds and we can deploy them in other ways that might be more effective in the marketplace and that's certainly one of the balancing actions that our marketing sales team considers as they're thinking about how to go to market.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you for the time.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, David.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks. Good morning.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Bob, can I get a clarification on the pension here? Are we saying at a global basis by the end of next year you'll be fully funded? Is that correct?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, by the end of next year, we expect our global pension plans to be \u2013 it's not fully funded, it's largely funded and by that you might think about 95% funded. So, it really depends on what's going to happen with the interest rates and the asset returns, but the U.S. is already getting close to that. I think we're a little bit behind that level in the UK and Germany. But our funded plans by the time we get to the end of next year should be, if not fully funded than largely funded.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. And just one follow-up on autonomous; if tech and the regulatory environment move faster than you guys expected, would you guys be willing to offer level 5 perhaps sooner than you were thinking or does it depend on the scenario testing that Raj talked about?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, it's really dictated by our technical development, not dictated by regulations. And as we said, we've been working at this for over 10 years and we feel confident in our plans and how we're approaching this. And level 4 is, we think is on track for 2021 and again, it's in defined areas that we can 3D-map in using LIDARs and sensors. Level 5 is a different kettle of fish in terms of the amount of technology on the hardware and the software algorithms to be able to handle all those climatic conditions. And so, well, that's our approach and we're confident in that approach.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you.","Operator","There are currently no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","All right. Thank you very much.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and full year 2016 Ford earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ted Cannis ","Great thanks very much Crystal, good morning, and welcome everybody to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings review. Presenting today is Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; and also participating are John Lawler, Vice President & Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO Ford Smart Mobility; and Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and also Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.","Copies of the press release and presentations slides are on our Web site as usual. The preliminary results discussed today includes some non-GAAP references and these are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix. It also includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, actual results may vary and the significant factors are included in the presentation.","Just as a reminder, Ford Credit will be holding a call to 11 AM to review its fourth quarter and full year results.","With that, Mark?","Mark Fields","Okay. Thanks, Ted, and Good morning, everybody. At our Investor Day in September and again at the Deutsche Bank Conference two weeks ago, we said we were confident that would achieve our second best full year company adjusted pretax profit and we have. 2016 was a very strong year and in addition to our second best full year company profit of $10.4 billion, we had a new record operating margin of 6.7% and our second strongest cash flow of $6.4 billion.","The fourth quarter was also strong with company pretax profit of 2.1 billion. So in total we delivered our seventh year in a row of strong results with 2016 only exceeded by our record performance in 2015. And of course, we will dig into the details in a minute, but first I'd like to turn to how we're creating value in our business.","So, turning on Slide 4, we're continuing to focus on the four drivers of shareholder value, growth, risk, returns, and rewards. So, looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles this year helping to strengthen our core business including the all new Super Duty which further solidified our long-time U.S. leadership in full size pickup trucks. We also took a step forward in the transformation of Lincoln with the launch of the Continental and strong sales growth globally including nearly tripling our sales in China.","In terms of risk we had strong performance in North America and combined profit for our operations outside of North America. And thanks to our de-risking strategy our global funded pension plans held up well, and as a result our globally funded pension plans now are nearly fully funded and our improved risk profile was recognized with the ratings upgrade from each of the four major rating agencies.","Now in terms of returns, a number of key metrics set records or near records, including a record profit in Europe of $1.2 billion and our second-best profit in Asia-Pacific. And our disciplined and focused approach to capital allocation continues to pay off as we continue generating a healthy return on invested capital that's well in excess of our cost to capital. And then finally in terms of rewards, shareholders benefited from our continued success and our strong cash generation as we distributed $3.5 billion including our first supplemental dividend that totaled $1 billion.","Now Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the full year and these include a couple of things. First, the Ford brand was the best-selling brand in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row, F-Series marked its 40th year as the top selling truck in the U.S. and 35 years of the best-selling vehicle. Our Transit is doing extremely well as the best-selling cargo van in the world and helping us to be the best-selling commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the second consecutive year. And when it comes to our emerging opportunities we have expanded Chariot to two cities, San Francisco and Austin, Texas and we have plans to expand to eight cities by the end of this year including one outside of the United States.","We had the most U.S. patents of any automaker during 2016 and I think this is a very good indicator in terms of how we're amping up our innovation efforts inside the Company. And we made progress towards our intent to have a high volume fully autonomous level four vehicle in ride sharing or the ride handling services starting in 2021 with this month's introduction of our next generation fusion hybrid autonomous development vehicle.","So, now let me turn it over to Bob and he'll take us through the details of our business performance.","Bob Shanks","Okay, thanks Mark. And let's start on Slide 7 with the key financial summary, and I'll just go down our fourth quarter and full year and cover some of the key metrics. So let's start in the first column with the top line wholesales and revenue. You can see that we were down just a bit, it was 4% in both wholesales and revenue and that was more than explained by a favorable stock adjustment in North America.","Going down further, you can see our company adjusted pretax results in the quarter came in at $2.1 billion which was down $478 million and you can see above that that each of the segments that we report automotive, financial services and all other which is primarily our treasury operations, our net interest expense, you can see that they were all down.","Going further down let's look at special items on the pretax basis, $3.2 billion, and that was driven primarily by the announcement that we made on January 20th, of losses associated with the re-measurement of our global pension and OPEB plans and that was driven by lower discount rates and just to remind you that\u2019s non-cash. We also picked up a charge of $200 million associated with our decision to cancel our new plant in Mexico, that was primarily for our cost associated with returning the site to its natural state and also compensating the state government for the cost that it incurred in terms of putting infrastructure on the site. We also picked up a little bit of charges associated with the announcement that we made earlier in the year around our withdrawal from the Japanese and Indonesian markets.","If you go down further you can see the net income or loss attributable to Ford in the quarter driven by the specials, was a negative 783, and then further down our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.30 which was in line with First Call and Bloomberg. You can see the liquidity matrix, we'll go through those later, but all of them very, very strong. Let's go down the same call -- the same matrix that we were on the full year column. So we'll start with wholesale and revenue, pretty flat, just up a touch. Going down further to our company adjusted pretax results, marks $10.4 billion which was the second best that we've ever had. ","Special items on a pretax basis, the $3.2 billion in addition to that came in at $3.6 billion, that\u2019s related to separations that we had earlier in the year both in North America and Europe. On a net income basis we came at $4.6 billion, that was down, that was driven by the special items and adjusted earnings per share with $1.76.","Let's now go through the balance of the presentation, the first three Slides are going to be on the full year, those are the only Slides we're going to talk to, they're full year, we have in the appendix incremental Slides that show the bridge between last year and this year's profits for the business units. We are not going to go through them, but if you have question, when we get to the Q&A session, obviously, Mark and I would be happy to answer them.","So looking on Slide 8, looking at absolutes. You can see to the far left the $10.4 billion, at the top automotive which was also the second-best result at $9.4 billion, within that you can see the very strong results in North America at $9 billion, South America a loss, Europe a record result of $1.2 billion, we ended up at negative $300 for Middle East and Africa and the second-best result that we've seen in Asia Pacific at $627. We had solid results in financial services driven by Ford Credit of $1.8 million. All other is primarily interest expense and share market value adjustments to our investment portfolio.","Right, and the other thing I just wanted to mention to this Slide, is that if you were to take the operations outside of North America on a combined basis, we generated a profit of $421 million, that was nearly double of what we did last year and it was the best result on a combined basis for that part of our business in 5 years.","Okay let's turn now to Slide 9, we're going to drill down now from total company to automotive, this is again full year. So, the first thing we see when we set back and look at this slide is how similar it was to last year. So it just shows how close we were to meeting is not achieving, another record. So it was a really strong result, right across the board. When you go across as you look at the market share, the market share came in 10th lower and that was driven by declines in North America and South America. The operating margin we touched on and the pretax results we've touched on and we'll go into detail in the next slide in terms of the change.","Let's move to Slide 10.","Mark Fields","But Bob, before you go on, let me just comment. It's really worth noting that our -- sorry, why don\u2019t you go on, it's really in the next slide.","Bob Shanks","Yes, you want to talk about the next slide. So if I turn to Slide 10. And what Mark is talking about, if you look at the slide you can see we were down a 146 million. The thing that really drove this was higher warranty costs. There is a lot of ups and downs, but the reason we call up warranty costs, is because obviously they're not something that was expected. If you look at the callout box for contribution costs you can see a negative 880, that was driven by recalls and the largest one that we've had in many-many years really drove that, that was the door latch recall that we had in the third quarter, it was nearly $600 million.","I've got a couple other things to highlight, if you look at the callout box for volume and mix, we had a very strong headwind during the year from stocks, that's adverse stock changes, so we had stock build last year, stock reductions this year and that was basically in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. But if you go just below that and this what Mark may have wanted to talk about, we had very, very strong performance on mix. Which has been a deliberate strategy of ours. It's both positive mix performance in terms of the types of products that we sell. It was also positive performance in terms of higher series derivatives that we sell, and that was across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.","The last thing I would just want to mention is, if you go to the far right, you can see some good news there, that is the non-repeat of the ratification bonus that were paid a year ago to the UAW following the conclusion of our UAW contract.","Mark Fields","And just picking up Bob's comments around mix, I think it's really worth pointing out that the mix performance that we achieved last year which is really impressive compared with the prior year and it really resulted in a year-over-year profit improvement for the automotive segment of just about $2.4 billion and that's been mainly in North America, in Europe, and Asia-Pacific.","As Bob was starting to mention, this really reflects a very deliberate and successful strategy to strengthen our brands and enrich to mix of our vehicles, by essentially focusing on the higher margin segments where consumer interest is particularly strong and we've also achieved greater sales of higher series derivatives like Titanium, ST, RS, and Raptor within our individual vehicle lines and I can assure you that this will continue to be an area focused for us and an opportunity for us as we go forward.","Bob Shanks","Okay, thanks Mark. And now we're going to flip to our quarterly slide. So, from this point forward the color and texture that I'll provided will be primarily on the fourth quarter again. In the Q&A if you have questions on full year please go ahead and ask.","So, this is looking at absolute for the quarter, so you can see the $2.1 billion pretax results to the far left that reflected a 2 billion automotive profit, within that a 2 billion profit coming from North America. Profits in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, declines into South America, Middle East and Africa, solid result in financial services and again in all other that's primarily net interest expense.","Let's move to Slide 12, and here we'll look at the key metrics for the automotive segment in the quarter. So, stepping back and looking at it, you can see that wholesales and revenue were down, that was driven primarily by unfavorable stock adjustments, again in North America. If you look at -- we'll it's not on the slide, but if you look at the far right, in terms of the global SAR, it actually came in 2% higher than a year ago and that was driven by gains in Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.","Looking at market share we were down at 10th, as I mentioned earlier that is North America, but actually that was full year. So this is the quarter, North America and Europe, upgrading the margin to 5.7% and then the result on the pretax basis which was down. And if we go to the next slide, Slide 13, and we'll go through what drove that decline of $280 million. It was basically driven by unfavorable stock changes as well as higher costs, so if you look at the callout box on volume and mix, you can see the $1 billion adverse change related to stock changes that was 125,000 units, most of that was in North America, and again related to the stock builds we had a year ago.","A lot of that around F-series, but also products that we're going to be launching in 2016 and this year we've had a stock depletion in the quarter, making sure that our production remains in line with our demand. As you look at the far right, you can see again the impact of the ratification bonus.","Okay let's turn now to the business units and we'll start as always with North America in the fourth quarter. Looking at the far left, wholesales down 105,000; 98,000 of that was the unfavorable stock change that I referenced earlier. Revenue down 7%, that again was driven by that volume change. The SAAR in the region was 22.5 million units, that were up 400,000 that was actually driven Mexico 300,000 units. We did see an improvement in the U.S. That was up 100,000 to 1.4 million SAAR. Our market share was down 0.3 of a point, that was driven by unfavorable fleet performance and that was driven by our rental, as you remember, we had pulled ahead of our rental sales in the first part of the year. So this is, if you will, the payback in terms of share effect in the fourth quarter. It was partially offset by stronger performance on a regional basis and that was driven by F-series.","Operating margin was a record for the quarter at 8.5% and then the $2 billion pretax result to the far right. If you go below the page, I will note the $9 billion profit in North America, very strong, it was just down a touch from the 9.3 last year and the operating margin very, very strong, once again at 9.7%. If we were to exclude the door latch recall, we would have come in at 10.3%. So to give you a sense of the underlying run rate at the business, very consistent with the performance of 2015.","Alright, let's go to the next Slide. And this is the explanation of the change in North America's result on a year-over-year basis down $73 million, you can see that was driven primarily by stock changes and also by higher product cost. If you look at the callout box for contribution cost, you can see materials excluding commodities that as more then explained by higher product cost related to the products that we launched including Super Duty and earlier in the year the Fusion, the Escape, and also the Continental in the later part of the year. Into the far right of course is the ratification bonus.","For 2017, in terms of guidance we're continuing to expect that North America's operating margin and its profit is going to be strong, but as we've said previously it will be lower than 2016 and this is mainly due to unfavorable volume and mix and also to the increased investments that we're making in the areas of emerging opportunities.","Mark Fields","I'll make a comment around F-series. Obviously, we get a lot of questions on F-series. But as you all recall two years ago, we added strength and capability to the F-150, increasing the payload, the towing, the torque, while taking our weight with the addition of the high strength aluminum alloy body. And this past year we repeated that success with the first all new Super Duty that we've had in 18 years. Some people call these innovations a risk, but I think with the response that we see from customers, they are clear successes in the market place. We'll look at just a couple of approve points for that.","Our F-series total sales last year were over 820,000 units and that\u2019s the first-time sales have topped 800,000 units in a decade. And if you look at the fourth quarter, our sales were up 4% with retail up 9%. And for the full year we gained almost one full point of market share in the segment. If you all just look at the fourth quarter, our average transaction price was up over $1,300 versus last year and that's significantly outpacing the segment. And then finally we outsold our nearest truck competitor by 246,000 units and essentially increasing our lead by about 36% year-on-year. So we are really pleased with the market's perception to our F-series and we plan to build on that moment going forward.","Bob Shanks","Okay, let's turn south now on Slide 16 and we'll look at to South America, so the first thing you would note looking at the slide which is encouraging, is that, all the metric are up even though on a pretax result basis you can see, only a change of $2 million, but nonetheless it is the first time since the third quarter of 2013 that we're have seen metric turning in a positive direction, which is enforcing our view that the cyclical downturn that we've seen for the last several years is probably bottoming out, coming to an end, and our expectations for next year is that the loss well improve as we see the economic cycle start to turn.","If you look at the quarter, the improvement in wholesales was basically around stocks, that also drove the improvement in revenue along with some pricing. And in terms of the SAAR, the SAAR was still down for the region, 200,000 units to 3.8 million units, and within that Brazil was down even more 400,000. But it was the slowest decline on a quarterly basis that we've seen throughout the year. We've seen that decline kind of improve on our quarter-to-quarter basis as we've gone throughout the year. So again, another sign of things starting to turn. Within that environment, the market share was better, that was due to strong sales of Ka and Ranger, and that was in Brazil and in all other markets other than in Argentina. And again, the full year came in at $1.1 billion decline that was down about a third from where we were a year earlier and again driven by the economic environment that we were operating in.","And to underscore that if you go to the next slide, on Slide 17, this is the apparent that we've shared with you through much of the past number of quarters. You can see a lot of ups and downs for a change of only $2 million, but if you look at the second column there you can see that while we're continuing to price and price quite aggressively, it is not enough to offset the effect of the high local inflation and the adverse exchange in this case both Argentina and Brazil. And as I mentioned earlier, we do expect in 2017 our loss to improve for South America as the economic cycle begins to turn.","All right, let's move to a very successful story on Slide 18, Europe. This is our seventh consecutive quarterly profit. You can see that the wholesales were actually flat in the quarter, revenue also essentially flat, that decline is more than explained by exchange. In terms of SAAR, it came in at 20.7 million units which was up 1.2 million units, so a strong industry results. Within that our share was down and touch 0.2 of a point and that was explained by lower passenger car sales that was basically Mondeo, Focus and C-Max, but also within that and Mark touched on it earlier, we had very strong performance for commercial vehicles, our share was over 14%, it was up 0.4 of a point and not only were we the number one brand in the year, we were the number one brand also in the fourth quarter. Operating margin at 2.3% and $166 million profit and if you go down and look at the full year, that was a record at $1.2 billion, it was also a record margin at 4.2%.","Then let's look at the change on a year-over-year basis, again lots of ups and downs, up $35 million and it was driven primarily by continuous favorable cost performance. To the point that Mark made earlier around mix, if you look at the callout box on mix, that $39 million within that is about $100 million of good news on mix, both mix among product as well as series mix and options.","Once, the last point I wanted to make on this slide is, as I've said throughout the year, the business has been benefitted from continued improvement in the results in Russia, that was also the case in the fourth quarter. So, for 2017 we do expect Europe to remain profitable, but it will probably be lower than in 2017 and that's driven by the effect of Brexit on the sterling along with higher costs that we expect associated with the launch of the Fiesta and the Eco Sport along with continued investment that we plan to make in the business moving forward.","Mark Fields","And just overall in the business in Europe, as you know we made tough choices and strategic decisions including restructuring in Russia when others retreated and they're paying off as you heard from record profit and operating margin in the region, and as Bob mentioned it's been driven by an aggressive focus on cost, with nearly $400 million in cost improvement in 2016 alone, but we've also had an equally strong focus on our product strategy or the revenue side of it adding a lot of new vehicles and derivatives and segments with the highest growth and profit potential.","So, an example of that is we saw a profit improvement of over 400 million in 2016 from a more favorable mix of progress, of products compared to 2015 driven by products like the Edge, but in addition to that more than half of our passenger car sales in 2016 were high series vehicles, the Titanium's, the Vignale's, the ST, the RS, and this helped push the series mix up more than $300 million compared with last year.","So, bottom line is, we've taken the tough actions, we've invested in the product and the brand and we're seeing the results in the bottom line.","Bob Shanks","I didn't mention it, Mark, but as we do see the cycle change not only in South America, but in '17 Russia also is expected to improve and contribute to a better result at least in that part of Europe in 2017 compared to '16. Let's move to another market that's actually been very much affected by commodities, oil, geopolitical conditions, this is the Middle East and Africa. So basically, for the quarter, and you can see the metrics here on Slide 20, as well as for the full year which is shown below, it's essentially the same capture. It's all of what I just mentioned and when look at the SAAR in the quarter, it came in down 22%, is the worst decline on a quarterly basis throughout the year that we've seen and it really is driven by everything that I just mentioned.","Within that environment we were able to generate higher share both in the quarter and in the full year and that was due to stronger sales of Rangers, Fiesta and Focus in Africa, but whether you're looking at the quarter or whether you're looking at the full year, basically you're seeing the impact of lower industry volume and you're also seeing the effect of adverse exchange primarily the South African rand, and remember we've got manufacturing operations in South Africa and that's why that's an important currency for us there.","As we look at 2017 a very similar story to what I said about Russia, to what I said about Brazil, we are starting to see the commodity cycle change and so as a result we do expect to see Middle East and Africa improve compared with the results that we're showing here for the full year and that's based not only on favorable external conditions, but lower costs and higher net pricing.","All right, let's move to Asia-Pacific on Slide 21. A strong story here both for the quarter and for the year. You can see the wholesale is up and revenue flat, remember revenue does not include the China JVs. In terms of the wholesale improvement that's driven both by stronger industry as well as share improvement. In terms of SAAR 44.4 million, SAAR for the quarter, that was up 5% from a year ago and that was driven by very strong performance in China. In terms of market share we were up 0.3 of a point, again that's China, that's very strong sales of Escort, and then the Taurus, the Edge and the Lincoln all contributing towards the favorable mix that Mark talked about for Asia Pacific.","In terms of margin, strong, but down at 8.4%, pretax results strong, but also lower. Just look at the far right there as usual just a comment on the China JVs, they came in at $380 million, that\u2019s our equity after tax. Our share of the profit there and the margin at what is 12.8%. So it was down, but still double digits, we're still getting a very good overall margin coming out of our JVs in China. ","If you go down to the very bottom, you can see the strong results, the second best at $627 million, that was down and whether you're looking at the quarter or you're looking at the full year was driven by lower pricing in China on an industry basis as well as adverse exchange and that was the renminbi. And if you go to the next Slide on Slide 22, you can see exactly what I just mentioned, you can see the impact in that pricing and the impact on exchange, cost about flat and some favorable volume and mix, including last year in the quarter we didn\u2019t actually have favorable mix, on a year-over-year basis we have launched last year in the quarter Edge and Taurus and so the accounts are a little bit different than the other part of the year.","In terms of '17, we do expect Asia-Pacific's profit to improve. We don\u2019t expect that come from China, we think the China JV profits will be relatively flat, margin will still be double-digit, but probably down a bit, again because of continued negative pricing, although moderating from what we saw this year, an unfavorable exchange. What we're going to see is improved results across the rest of Asia Pacific, which we also saw in 2016, but at a pace that\u2019s even greater. ","Mark Fields","And just to add a little bit of color on China, you look at sales in 2016, it was our best sales year ever in China. We sold about 1.27 million vehicles and that\u2019s up 14% over 2015. And importantly, this was driven not only by Lincoln, which is as Bob pointed our earlier, but also our now five vehicle SUV line up, that really has been a key driver for our sales growth including Edge and Explorer, but also at the same time by our performance vehicles, we've introduced Mustang, Focus RS, Focus ST, and as Bob mentioned we had strong sales of the Taurus in China, after we launched it.","So I think our efforts and we've talked to you about this in the past, to fill out our product line up over the past few years, has really started to pay off in terms of growth in what is the world's largest vehicle market.","Bob Shanks","And we have talked a lot about, focusing on the rest of Asia-Pacific, that improved results that we saw in '16 in the quarter, and then what we're expecting in 2017 is really encouraging as well, better balance of profitability across the region.","All right, let's turn to Ford Credit rate now, we've got three Slides here as usual. So if you look at the far left it grew and you can see that in the first two sets of data. Our pretax results were down and I'll show you what was behind that, it was down both for the quarter and for the full year coming in still strong at $1.9 billion for the full year. And in terms of our U.S. retail and lease matrix, the portfolio performance continues to be robust, all of our origination servicing and collection practices continue to be consistent.","So we are seeing delinquencies start to increase or if they've been increasing, then approaching historical levels but not there. And the same is true for loss receivables. Although there we are starting to get closer to the historical performance of the past.","Let's go the next Slide and look at year-over-year. There are a few things to comment here, we're down a $158 million, if you first go the far right, we had a pension settlement that occurred between Ford Credit and Ford of Europe. There is actually positive offset to this to the dollar in the European results and this is basically just simply, we have a Ford plan. In the past, we've kind of split, if you will, the expense and all the results of that plan between Ford credit and Europe, we've done that in other regions as well.","So what we have done is we've chosen to have Ford Credit settle its share of deficit at this point in time. It will continue to report ongoing service cost, but we're going to put all of the balance now of the risk and rewards on their portfolio to Automotive who will manage it going forward. And we've already done that in other parts of the business over the last number of years. And then if you look at the middle factor around lease residuals, you can see there the same thing that we've seen all quarters of this year, the impact at lower auction value on the business.","And if you go to the next slide, Slide 25, at the upper left, let's focus on the 36 months line which is the one that\u2019s below, you can see that we had pretty stable performance actually up from the fourth quarter and the first, second and third quarters, we had a 6% decline, about $1,060 in the fourth quarter, that was largely in September and October, knock on wood in November, December and so far, we've actually seeing a much more stable performance in auction values. Although we are projecting auction values to be down in 2017 and that\u2019s contained in our guidance. But it was encouraging to see it start to stabilize at least over that period of time.","And then on the upper right, I just want to highlight, you can see that the industry continued to perform or to lease at a pretty healthy rate if you will. We actually have had a strategy to take down our lease penetration as Ford Credit, this is in respond to higher incentive which is making leasing very expensive as well as lower auction values and recognition of all the units coming back to markets. So you can see that we're starting to separate a bit from the overall industry and in fact on a full year basis, which you don\u2019t see here, we leased it 22% which is actually unchanged from 2015, the industry was at 30%, that was actually up 2 points from 2015.","And if you look at the metrics at the bottom you can see, pretty consistent from where we've been in the past, whether it's a resale contract placement terms or FICO and higher risk in mix. For the full year, no change to our guidance, we expect Ford Credit results to be lower probably about $1.5 billion and again it's around our expectation for lower residual values.","If we go to the next slide, this is cash flow. So in terms of our cash flow performance, very strong, you can see operating came in it 1.5 in the quarter, 6.4 for the full year, that was driven by Automotive segment pretax results. Just want to highlight, our capital spending came in a 6.9 billion in the year that compares with 7.1 last year, we're guiding to $7 billion in 2017. So pretty flat over that three-year period.","If you go down further and look at changes in debt, you can see it's positive, that\u2019s the $2.8 million debt issuance that we had early in December of last year. And then you can see pension contributions at $1.2 billion, it's consistent with what we had guided to. We are expecting in '17 pension contributions to be about $1 billion and we're also expecting about $1 billion in '18 and '19, that\u2019s up from the 500 million to 700 million that we've previously guided, and that\u2019s simply a reflection of the higher discount rates. And then dividend, share repurchases $3.5 billion which includes the $1 billion supplemental dividend that we announced and paid in the first quarter of 2016.","Okay, let\u2019s go to the annual update on pension, a few things to call out here. You can see that the underfunded status actually didn\u2019t move much given the very sharp decline that we saw in discount rates which is just below there in the second section of data. The U.S. in fact, hardly moved it all which is really -- just shows the success of the de-risking strategy that we've had in place for the last six, seven years. We saw a bigger movement in the non-U.S. plants and if you look below there you can see that's because the discount rates were actually three times lower than what the declines were in the U.S. We have very strong asset performance, we've talked about pension plan contributions, we had positive pension plan expense in 2016, we expect to have positive expense in 2017. And then of course the re-measurement losses that were announced on the 20th.","Now let's go to my last slide, on Slide 28. So here is the balance sheet summary, so in sum, cash liquidity balance is very strong, Ford Credit's balance sheet is very strong with good liquidity and we've talked about the pensions. The only thing I want to comment on incrementally here is around the cash balance, at $27.5 billion, obviously above our target of $20 billion. And just to share with you how we're thinking about that, 2.8 of that obviously is the debt that we took on in December. And to remind you we took on that debt because we believed it was opportunistic to do so, the market was very favorable, we know that interest rates are going to be going up, so it was a great time to go in and get that debt.","Our balance sheet was so strong that we were able to take it on and still not affect our leverage metrics that we're working towards and again as we look ahead at what we want to do in terms of transforming the business, a core as well as the emerging opportunities where we want to grow that we wanted to take advantage of favorable market conditions and make sure that we have that cash available for those uses. We will be very, very prudent, disciplined in terms of how we use that, but we thought it was great to take advantage of the market and get that cash when it was available.","The other thing that I guess I would mention to you is, while there is a lot of enthusiasm that we're all very optimistic about what may come out of the new administration in terms of growth policies, is also more uncertainty, there is more volatility potentially around that. And also, we're probably closer towards the end of the cycle whenever that might be than we're to the beginning. So, we're not uncomfortable with having a little bit of extra cash at this point in time.","So, with that let me turn it back to Mark and he'll take us through the balance of the presentation.","Mark Fields","Okay, thanks, Bob. So, Slide 29 shows our view of GDP growth rates and industry volumes, and all in all we expect growth in GDP globally in all of the major markets that are showing on the slide there. Similarly, we expect growth in the industry volume and in the volume for all major markets except the U.S. which is going to remain strong.","If you move to Slide 30, that just shows that we delivered strong results in 2016 again in line with our expectations. And then looking ahead, 2017 is going to be a good year for Ford. We expect our key financial metrics for the company as I said in 2017 to be good, yet lower or about the same as 2016. At a company level this is driven mainly by investments that we're making in the areas of emerging opportunities and it's the same guidance that we reiterated at the Deutsche Bank conference two weeks ago.","Now turning to our business units, on Slide 32, to give you a little flavor for kind of what's going on in the business units. We do expect profits in North America and Europe to be lower than last year, while we expect to see improvements in results in South America, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific. And for reasons that were already mentioned by Bob, results in Ford Credit and all other will be lower in 2016. In addition, you can see in the slide the various kind of puts and takes for each region, so you get an understanding of kind of what's going on one level down in each region in terms of the factors driving the business.","So, let me just wrap this all up before we go to the Q&A, we delivered a very strong 2016, in fact as we mentioned our second best adjusted full year pretax profit. We also delivered a full year operating margin in North America of 9.7%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 10% target range, which we've talked about in the past.","We set a number of records for the year including a record adjusted pretax profit in Europe and record sales in China and we expect to deliver another good year this year, again in line with the expectations that we set initially at our Investor Day, last September. So we're making substantial progress on expanding our business and that\u2019s really going from a strong, healthy Automotive company to one that will be even stronger and bigger as we expand to an auto and mobility company in the future. ","Which brings me to Slide 34, and importantly we now have a very clear vision and strategy for our business going forward. And our plan is simple, we want to achieve top quartile returns by expanding our scope from vehicles to mobility, through business model innovation. I can tell you we are more focused than ever before on fortifying our strengths, transforming the underperforming parts of our business and investing in the emerging opportunities that will provide either more profitable growth in the future for us. And as usual we'll look forward to sharing with you our progress as we go through the year.","So, with that, why don't we open it up and start taking your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy ","Just a first question on one of the big swing factors in 2016 being the $1.2 billion stock adjustment. Obviously that is a real thing, it's not one time, but it does indicate maybe you earned a little bit more in 2015 than you would have otherwise and that you took that hit in 2016. So the trajectory of earnings between '15 in '16 actually should be a bit better than what you are show in here.","And as we look forward to 2017, your stock position, your inventories are relatively lean, I think very disciplined and good, but it does seem like there is a potential for you to, particularly as we get through the second half of the year, to maybe build a little bit of the inventory if the industry comes through. I'm just curious how you are thinking about this and if that logic makes sense to you.","Bob Shanks","Well I think you're right in the first part, but that was driven by the launch of schedule and cadence that we had. So if you remember going back to '15 we were coming out of Dearborn and Kansas City for F-150s, so were really building stock. We also then had that pull ahead of rental into the early '16 periods. So again, we had to build stock for that. We then through this year, in the second half of the year we've taking the adjustments -- well, in fact, through the year, we've been taking the adjustments and so you're right, but it was driven by launch cadence and rental timing or cadence as opposed to anything else.","When we move into 2017, John I think you\u2019re right, when you look at every single region, the way we look at it, our stock levels are in very, very good shape and then North America particular where there had been a lot of concern expressed by number of people throughout the year, we kept telling you that it was driven by the cadence of launches last year, this year and what was going on with rental and that we would be in good shape by the end of year and we're actually in very good shape. So we have delivered on that, every other region looks fine.","As we look ahead to next year or this year rather in 2017, I think we just kind of hold that level. I don\u2019t see any big plus or minus on this particular factor in terms of impact on the company, it might be a little bit different by business unit but likely not, because I think everyone is in pretty good shape. I will highlight that we will have the launch of expedition navigator in the third quarter. So that will have an impact, it's not as high volume obviously, as some of the other launches we've had on those type -- on that type if platform in the past, but it is a very high margin vehicle. So it will have some effect, probably more in mix than anything else.","Mark Fields","The only thing I'd add John, all these things are linked, right. As I mentioned any given year we're going to have launches and things of that nature. But when you look as Bob said, we're going to continue our strategy of matching productions and demand, but if you look at our incentives in the fourth quarter, the industry in the U.S. was up 16%, we were up 11% that really follows our strategy of being competitive but disciplined and that allowed us to have average transaction prices in the quarter that were up over 4% and better than the industry. So we're really trying to manage and maximize profitability. Listen, if there is opportunity and there is more business out there, we'll build more. If we're short in any given month, we'll take adjustments. We want to keep those stocks really in shape and be able to react appropriately.","John Murphy","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question. I know there's a lot of puts and takes and things that are going on that you're discussing with Trump as far as new policies here. But just specifically around the potential for expensing CapEx and R&D, obviously in 2017 and 2018, you guys are talking about $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental expenses for EVs and Smart Mobility. And if we see expensing of costs like that could that give you a higher deductibility, which means that you might increase your deferred tax asset and not pay taxes for a longer period?","I'm just trying to understand, if we look at that $2 billion to $3 billion, how much would have gotten expensed otherwise previously and would there be more that could get expensed now that would give you a big benefit going forward?","Bob Shanks","Well, I think I would say on the -- I'll call it the blueprint tax proposal, so that\u2019s the only thing that's really on the table at the moment. There is a lot of different factors there. So a lot of people focused on the broader adjustable tax, focusing on the expensing of CapEx, I mean there is all sorts ins and outs and ups and downs, it just a completely different tax code. We have been modeling that which is what I mentioned at the Deutsche Bank Conference, it looks attractive to us and favorable, but it also depends on the detail, and we don\u2019t know that yet, John.","I\u2019ll say that we are booking taxes at a healthy rate, we came in at let's say 32% or 31.9% for the quarter, I think it was about 30% for the year, if I remember correctly. We're booking at a healthy rate, because of the tax code we have, but our cash taxes are quite low and they're expected to remain low over the next number of years. And the modeling we've done, again it depends on the what the details are, but it doesn\u2019t suggest that that\u2019s going to change to any degree whatsoever.","John Murphy","Okay, and then just one last quick housekeeping one on the accounting for leases. Obviously, you guys are accelerating depreciation where you need to on auction values that might be lower. Just curious, if we think about what we see in the P&L versus the timing of the cash impact to those when those vehicles come back for you and the industry. Is there a cash impact at the end of lease that we might see that's being reflected in the P&L right now on an accrual basis?","Bob Shanks","No, I don\u2019t think it was anything materials I mentioned in that regard, no. Everyone here is shaking their heads, so, I think I'm right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","The first question is really for you, Mark. You've had a couple of breakfasts this week with President Trump. And really wanted to get a sense of your thoughts coming out of there on the policies, how we're shaping the potential changes in the tax code, we've got the house plan that's out there. You clearly mentioned the prospects of an import tariff. Most clients that I speak to are either in one camp or the other that there is 100% probability of a border tax adjustment, and if that doesn't happen, then we're just going to see import tariffs. So really curious as to -- since you've spent the most time with the new President this week, I believe -- what's your thinking coming out of both those meetings and what you've been hearing?","Mark Fields","Well I think first off it's a very positive sign from my perspective, that literally his first two days in the office is -- he had first morning meetings with manufacturing companies, including automotive companies. And I think he's going to be very focused on driving policies that drive investment and job creation in American manufacturing and in automotive manufacturing. And so I think that's going to be a big priority.","I think obviously as Bob was mentioning earlier, a tax reform is going to be a big priority and I know obviously whether it's a border tax or border adjustment, as Bob mentioned, this is a multi-faceted blueprint that's out there. And as Bob said, we got to look at the statutory tax rates, we got to look at the territorial tax system that they're talking about expensing -- media expensing of CapEx and then whatever currency impacts are there. Our approach, as a company, is just going to stay very close to it and also provide input. So, I think tax reform is going to be high on the list.","We did talk about -- he asked very clearly, what are the things that are inhibitors in terms of growing jobs, and your business, we talked about regulations, and particularly we talked about the rule making -- the finalized rule making that was pushed through at the end of the year on the fuel economy, one national standard which really was a decision that we felt was premature and inconsistent with the promise data driven approach, and we think that's really important to get a balanced outcome, balance between making sure that we reconcile interest in reducing carbon into the atmosphere which we're all for, but also with jobs, and also affordability for customers.","So, we may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business but my impression walking away is this is the President who's going to be focused on a number of important priorities and make sure that he makes progress on those. And we want to be helpful in the process in terms of whether its trade or tax or regulatory reform, be a trusted source for input.","David Tamberrino","Understood. That's very helpful. Maybe following up underneath of that, in the event that we don't see a border tax but we do see a potential import tariff and you start thinking about your supply chain, in particular, versus other of your competitors' supply chains. It looks like the cost of being able to produce a vehicle, specifically within the U.S. would have to go up with the amount of local content and then some of the imports come in.","In that environment, do you see passing on price increases to consumers? Do you see pushing that through to the supply chain or you see that more impacting your margin? Just trying to get a feel for how you would manage the business for any potential change or rising cost environment as a result of a very targeted or potentially targeted import tariff?","Mark Fields","Well as Bob, mentioned earlier you know, first of we have to see what the policies are going to be and as you mentioned we're doing a lot of different scenario planning, the blueprint -- every company is going to be like a snowflake, they are all going to be different, right, in terms of what their net imports or exports are, there supply chain. And we're going to just continue to advocate for comprehensive tax reform.","And as Bob mentioned, the broader adjustment piece of this is very interring for us and the reason for that is, we are the largest producer of vehicles here in the U.S., we're a top exporter, obviously, we're doing the analysis on our supply chain because that\u2019s going to play into it. And we\u2019ll see how it comes out. It's going to be a -- I think a pretty -- getting to back to your question earlier, I think the President is going to look for an accelerated rate of getting some level of tax reform in this year and we want to be part of the process in terms of giving them the input on that.","David Tamberrino","Thank you. The one last one for me is just in North America, as I think about one of your competitors is going through a bit of a changeover throughout this year. Is there a potential possibility for you to see better market share gains as a result of that? Or is that an opportunity for you to be more price disciplined as some of the competition volume might be pulling back and they might not be as aggressive on their incentives?","Mark Fields","Well I just see coming back to our strategy, we run this business to optimize profitability for our shareholders, so we're going to continue our strategy of keeping our inventories in line, we're going to be very disciplined on pricing and continue our approach on making sure that our transaction prices are healthy, we're not going to chase bad share that\u2019s not what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers with Evercore ISI. ","George Galliers","My first question was just on raw materials. Clearly we've seen a move in the spot price for a lot of commodities versus the full-year average for 2016. What kind of assumptions do you have for raw material headwinds this year?","Mark Fields","So that\u2019s a really good question, George what we saw in 2016 is an advances and improvement, if you willing, from commodities of about $900 million. Our planning for 2017 and our guidance for 2017 basically assumes that almost all reverses.","George Galliers","Okay, great. And, then secondly, just with respect to China -- and this isn't necessarily Ford specific, we're also seeing it at some of your peers. Volumes are growing both when we look at Q4 and on a full year basis. But when we look at profitability, clearly we're not seeing similar progress. Do you think that -- what's got to change, I guess, for absolute earnings from Chinese JVs to step up going forward? Is it a more stable pricing environment? Is it continued work on the cost front from yourselves? Or is it just -- is there some other factor?","Mark Fields","Well let's just talk about the JVs first, because I just want to remind everybody, the JVs are not the total China picture for us, because we've got imports of Lincoln, we've got imports to Ford, we also incur engineering here as Ford, for products that will be build years ahead, and the JVs we get compensated on that through royalties. So there is a little bit of a disconnect there particularly as we're in growth mode. But just on the JVs, if you look at the JVs this year, perform was good, we actually had good cost performance in the Joint Ventures.","We have two things that are happening to the JVs. One is this continued negative trend that we have seen of negative pricing across the industry, and as I've said it did moderate in '16 versus '15 and our assumptions for '17 is that it further moderates although it will still be negative. And then the second impact is on exchange. Now the exchange hit clearly affected our imports, foreign imports, the Lincoln imports, but while we have very high local content in the Joint Venture, they still import and so that also had a negative impact.","It's really those two things that affected the overall business in China but also specifically Joint Ventures going forward. One of the thing that has been helping us has been the mix and that\u2019s been sort of a quiet of our recipe for success in North America, it has been in Europe and I think that\u2019s probably further opportunity for us in China moving ahead into the future.","Bob Shanks","To put that in perspective, as you look at 2016, 40% of our sales in China came from more profitable segments, the large cars, SUVs, performance vehicles and premium and that was up about less than 1.5 points versus the year ago, so the teams is really focusing on that.","And then to your point earlier on the industry, as you know we have guided the industry to be higher next year in China, but we do expect the end of the tax incentives or the reduction of tax incentives that happen at the end of last year, that\u2019s going to be a drag on industry sales and volumes probably through the first quarter. We've reflected that in our assumptions and we anticipate that the impact from the pull ahead is going to ease from the second quarter going forward, and it's supports our outlook a little over 27 million units.","But we are seeing in January, a payback and the industry is seeing a payback. So we have to get through Chinese New Year is early this year, so let's get through January and February and then I think we'll have a better idea of the run rate as we get into the end of the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","I wanted to just -- I had two things. One is, again, on border adjustments. We came up with an estimate that, just for the overall industry, not Ford specifically, this is something that could potentially increase the cost of a vehicle sold in the U.S. by $2,300. And at the same time it looked to us like the effect would be really small for Ford. And I'm wondering if you've done a similar competitive analysis.","Should we be watching this as one of the more potentially significant changes to the competitive landscape? And post your meetings, if you have any thoughts on timing of implementation, whether there could be a phase in? In other words, is this something that we should be thinking about as maybe a factor or even in the intermediate term, like 2018, 2019?","Bob Shanks","Let me comment first Ron and then Mark can add comments that he might have. So we have been modelling it as I said the one thing -- so your assumption in terms of how we stand versus competition is how we see it. We are in a pretty good place in terms of import, export position as we look at vehicles as we look at our parts.","So we see that as being something that's attractive. Then when you combine with somebody other aspects of the blueprint like the lower tax rate and some of the other aspects plus an assumption that we've made through discussions with the staff that are working on this that some of the things that are important to us like tax attributes will continue into the future. That's what gives us at least for now a positive point of view on that for just a proposal. When we look at our competition we can't see if you will the data around parts, we just can't find source for that anywhere, but we fairly can understand imports and exports of vehicles, and when we look at that again you're right relative to our peers that we're in very good shape and versus some of them extremely good shape.","So, it could have an adverse impact in terms of them, if what we see now as a proposal passes through and for us it looks pretty attractive and actually not having too much impact at all over the next several years in terms of our cash taxes.","Mark Fields","And to Bob's point on -- when you look at our profile, I mean you know the facts Ron, we're the number one manufacturer in the U.S. and also, Ford's not one of the top manufacturers in Mexico. So that adds to our profile. When you look at some of the nuances on how this will be laid out, whether there'll be phase-ins or things of that nature, I think that's work in front of the administration and Congress going forward. There'll be lots of discussion, there'll be a lot of sausage making around this to see ultimately what happens.","My view is as I go back earlier, I think there're going to want to make a significant progress this year and get something passed through Congress this year and I think Paul Ryan last night laid out getting something done by August. Now whether they'll be able to do that, I don't know. But clearly that's their intent.","Rod Lache","Great, thank you. And just secondly, obviously, the market's expectations, vis-\u00e0-vis U.S. growth and inflation and monetary policy have changed a lot here in the past couple months, but your guidance didn't really change since the Investor Day. I was hoping you might be able to just give us some color on how this could affect North America and also the Credit business, whether you see some implications for rates that could be more significant in terms of recent rates, for example. And then in Credit, how should we be thinking about the financing margin and broadly just as the market is transitioning from looser monetary to tighter monetary policy?","Bob Shanks","Now let me take a short at first and then again if there are some broader perspectives, Mark can share. So, I think what we're seen so far, is the market is excited and interested, intrigued and optimistic about what might happen. But we don't have any policies yet. So, I don't -- we don't know. So, we're hopeful, we're also optimistic, encouraged about what might be, but nothing really has changed yet other than maybe sentiment, I think that's -- it's fair to say sentiment has changed.","So, until we see something more definitive, we're not changing our point of view in terms of what our operating assumptions are. And in fact, I think so far this month in January, I think the rate of sales that we've seen for the industry suggest that there's nothing that would tell us that anything is any different than what we've been assuming. And we've built in increasing interest rates, both for this year and going forward.","So, we kind of already assumed what you've talked about, the question is, if we do get a very positive pro-growth strategies that are much more inflationary than what has been assumed? Then obviously, there is an impact there and it would affect many parts of business both pro and con, something that we would manage and deal with as we always do. But there's nothing specific to respond to yet Ron.","Rod Lache","Right. Well, the market rates, Bob, like five-year swaps are up like 75 basis points since November. So the market is starting to reflect a different paradigm. And I would imagine that that's very meaningful, just broadly, on a number of different fronts. So that's more or less what I was asking about [Multiple Speakers].","Bob Shanks","But so far what we seeing as been consisting with what our planning assumptions have been. And we did build in increasing interest rates. I think we're going to market couple of times and everything is consistent with what we had expected in terms of -- actually we're seeing good spreads and I think the rates have been consistent with what we have planned. I understand your point, but it hasn't materialized yet into anything physical that would be different on our planning assumptions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Johnson","A couple questions. Housekeeping and then a more strategic one again related here to the White House. Housekeeping, anything you can comment around quarterly cadence particularly in North America, particularly getting through some of the destock? ","Mark Fields","While as I mentioned earlier I think the destock is behind us. On a company basis, it usually 60-40 in terms of profits, first half, second half I would expect something like that this year. I always hesitate to get into the specific quarters because I'm inevitably wrong, but last year was very unusual, the year before was very unusual, the flip side of that because of the launches. I would say I think the third quarter in North America will be the weakest and that\u2019s going to bed driven by the impact of the launch of the expedition navigator. But other than that I would call a more normal year in terms of cadence.","Brian Johnson","Okay, when I said destock, I meant overstock, if you will, in 1Q of last year. On a strategic question, in addition to what the NHTSA and the EPA control directly around fuel economy and environmental regulations of the EPA, EPA has historically, at least in the eight years, granted California a waiver to pursue its own greenhouse gas policy.","Was there any discussion at the White House around the theme of harmonization of fuel economy and environmental regulation? And sort of the debate, maybe too philosophical, around is this state's rights versus federalism in terms of getting to a harmonized system once again?","Mark Fields","Well we didn\u2019t get into discussion around states rights versus federalism in the meeting, but what we did talk about and I get back to earlier, where we said, we weren't advocating for elimination of the standards. I made the point that, one of the reasons we were very supportive of the One National Standard is because it was one national standard. You had CARB, the California Air Resources Board, together with NHTSA, together with EPA and we emphasized that was important going forward.","Brian Johnson","Well, what if CARB decides to continue to stick to its aggressive goals, perhaps even more aggressive? What do you think the new administration will do through the EPA waiver process?","Mark Fields","I think you have to ask the administration that question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli ","Hi, just shifting maybe away from North America for a minute on South America, just given the flattish losses in the fourth quarter, could you just talk a little bit about what some of the drivers for improvement in 2017 might be? Perhaps the magnitude, roughly, if you can share? And then also a similar question around the non-China Asia Pacific improvement that you are expecting for 2017.","Mark Fields","Well, as you go back to Slide 32, Itay, if you want to go back there. I think this slide shows what the ups and downs are, if you will, on a year-over-year basis. So in South America we do expect to see positive net pricing, we do expect to see favorable volume, even though it doesn\u2019t look like the industries are moving much when you look at the industry slide that\u2019s really due to rounding. We still see exchange as a bit of a headwind including and also cost including commodities, so it's really around favorable volume and mix and especially pricing.","So that\u2019s what we see happening. And it does require the external environment to sort of move forward in a positive direction. And if you go back to the slide, that has our assumptions on GDP, we've had a very modest projection of 0.5% GDP improvement, which is consistent I think with the Brazilian Banks we're talking to and a few other, so I think it's in the range of what most people are expecting.","But I also would say, at least based on the data we've been looking at on a month-to-month basis, it could be more of a second half recoveries than a first half at least in terms of the strength of that, driving that full year result. Not going to get into quantification of magnitude on any of the business units, but I think it will be -- we're expecting it to be a reasonably good improve on a year-over-year basis. But we'll still be in a loss.","Then you asked me on Asia Pacific, I think you are asking around the specific the non-China?","Itay Michaeli","Current.","Mark Fields","Yes, so I got to tell -- we're so excited about that because we've been talking about this for a long, long time. Australia was really having a tough time particularly prior to going into the restructuring and the manufacturing and then after we announced it. ASEAN on was struggling India, of course a big investments and growth node there. And we are still excited because we are now seeing big turnaround particularly in ASEAN in Australia, we see profits -- strong profits in those parts of the business in 2017, and that\u2019s really what's driving the improvement. But even India will be a loss again in 2017, we see a less of loss.","So overall that part of the business in Asia Pacific is really moving forward in a positive direction and something we have been working very, very hard at.","Bob Shanks","And importantly on Australia, we actually completed the closer, the manufacturing facility last year in October, November timeframe. So the team is really focused on not only building our business, but we made announcements late last year around building our engineering capability in Australia, so right direction from the momentum.","Itay Michaeli","That's very, very helpful. Just a quick follow-up, back to North America on Slide 15. The positive other driver, I think of about $250 million, was that mostly parts and accessories? And, if so, what's the outlook for that business globally in 2017?","Bob Shanks","That\u2019s was part of it, you are looking at what Slide 15, did you say?","Itay Michaeli","Yes, Slide 15, the two [Multiple Speakers].","Bob Shanks","Yes, it was parts of service we also had lower legal cost, we have some favorable performance from some of the subsidiaries within North America and there were just other -- just a whole slew of smaller things that added up. But yes, it included good performance in parts and service, which offer the business in 2016 did very well across the globe.","Itay Michaeli","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Some more questions to try to probe this border adjusted tax issue. I just wanted to confirm that your comment at the Detroit show that a border adjusted tax could be potentially a positive not just on a relative but an absolute basis. Does that analysis take into account not just the vehicles that you're importing and exporting but also the parts that you purchase from suppliers that might be imported?","And then as part of your answer, it would be great, too, if you could remind us of your export strategy, because going back to that Europe turnaround call in October of 2012, I think it was, you mentioned then your plan to ramp exports from the U.S. And since then now you're exporting to China, too. So maybe your exports are greater than the market appreciates. Any color or data you could share would be helpful.","Bob Shanks","Let me take that first part and then Mark can respond on the second. So, to be specific, yes, in an absolute sense more outside of our business centric because we're actually modeling this out many-many years, because you have to do that with the first taxes. So it actually can be quite favorable it absolute sense, sort of I'll call it beyond our five-year business planning period. Through our business planning period it's probably more neutral, and that's both in terms of an absolute tax, but in particular to cash tax status that I mentioned earlier. The bigger opportunity in terms of the big change versus where we are today it's more sort of post 2021 in terms of the assessment that we've made.","Mark Fields","In terms of Ryan your question on that export strategy from -- let's say here from North America, as you know what we've talked about in the past is utilizing our manufacturing operations globally, and be better exporters, if you will, and balancing and basically using our manufacturing assets around the world. And that's why in Europe for example coming out of the U.S. we added the Edge which is doing very well in the marketplace. We're getting the new KA+ out of India.","And in terms of other exports out of the U.S. as I said we're a top exporter and part of it is when you look at China for example we're exporting Explorers, Lincoln, we talked about the road fair, actually we have a -- when you take into account imports of parts, we actually we have a -- from the U.S. we're actually -- we're in a net surplus in terms of our trade with China with the exports that we do out of here in the U.S.","So, we're going to continue to utilize our manufacturing assets very efficiently around the globe and this is all around our strategy taking advantage of our scale and making sure we're taking advantage of the assets that we've in different parts of the world.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, thanks. And then just my last question is really what was better than you thought in 4Q because you did $10.4 billion of full year pretax versus $10.2 billion that [indiscernible] at the time of 3Q. So versus our own expectations, it was North America Automotive. I know you don't guide granularly quarterly by region, but was it the Super Duty? Was it some of these profit improvement initiatives that you talked about on the 2Q call? Did those track better or whatnot? And is there any way to say that maybe the stronger profits in 4Q bode well as we enter 2017 relative to guidance or anything like that?","Mark Fields","So, Ryan you're asking specifically about North America?","Ryan Brinkman","Or just what contributed to the implied -- the $200 million implied beat [ph] versus your implied guidance for 4Q, basically, on pretax? ","Mark Fields","Cost.","Ryan Brinkman","Costs. And do those costs continue -- was that one-time period benefit or is there now a stronger base of earnings that you carry into 2017?","Mark Fields","Well it's interesting when we look at the year-over-year costs changed for the total company, I went back and looked a number of years, this is the lowest cost increase that we've had on a year-over-year basis, since I think going back to 2009 or something like that. So, actually we've seen -- we've got a lot of control on cost, North America was a big contributor to that, and that certainly helped us in our performance throughout the course of the year.","As we move into 2017, we've talked about the investments that we're making and the emerging opportunities. If I put that to decide the commodity increase that I talked about, I think everything else actually should be a cost save in 2017. And we have to work hard to do that, but it does show the focus that we put on cost and continue and I get I would highlight what we showed at the Deutsche Bank conference, within all of that we got about $3 billion worth of efficiencies that we're generating right across the business, its helping us to continue the investments we're making for growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Just a quick one here. Alphabet and Waymo seem to have gone around to all the OEMs globally, and I suspect yourselves included, to try to look for a way to work with you on sharing data, creating HD maps and helping your efforts in the autonomous driving revolution. I was just curious if you could reiterate your stance on data sharing with suppliers like a Waymo or Mobileye that ostensibly want to help develop a common crowdsourced 3D map, for example, amongst other things. How do you view the opportunity to do that versus do-it-yourselves, because you obviously have huge scale globally on miles traveled to maybe do that yourself? How do you weigh that and, again of course, versus the value of the data and the sanctity of the data?","Mark Fields","Thanks Adam, in the key as that last part of your statement. We have to look at what the value of the data is. Certainly there is different -- there is a broad spectrum here and very simply put, we continue to be open to work with partners where we can crowd source data that helps the system as opposed to just an individual manufacturer. So we're going to continue to go through that process and really understand the value of the data and when the value of the data -- it points very clearly to working with other, we'll do so.","And it all comes down to, as you look at that value of the data, keep going back to what I mentioned a long time ago, we don\u2019t want to be relegated to a contract manufacturer status and that\u2019s always in top of our mind. ","Adam Jonas","Okay. Because there seem to be different views there. Toyota, for example, seems to have this: We're big enough and we can do it ourselves and its early days and we don't want to make a decision on sharing too early and regret it later. Perhaps Chrysler might be on the opposite side of the spectrum of, we'll cross the line early and work early. I reckon maybe you're somewhere in between. But I'm just curious in terms of timing, do you think that this year would be too soon for you to make a decision? Or is it -- is there even one avenue to go and there may not -- there's no such thing as exclusivity, whether you do-it-yourselfer with a partner? I'm just curious [Multiple Speakers].","Mark Fields","I can't answer your question in terms of the timing of it but, clearly you know what our objectives are, is to have a level four vehicle out in the market place in 2021. So clearly we have a lot of work to do in front of us, but also at the same time we've made a lot of progress and as we said we'll go through that process, what's the data we feel crowd sourced is fine, doesn't have a lot of value, but has a lot of valuing to the system versus what's the one that will have value to us as we looked at new business models to grow our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan","Just a follow-up on all the border tax questions -- border adjustment questions. One of the key elements there is the impact of all this cost and what it might do to actual industry volume. Any color on the price sensitivity that you would see if we see all these border tax pushing costs up, how much auto sales may fall?","Mark Fields","No, I don\u2019t think we have a handle on that, that was part of Rod's concern or question as well. There is another aspect too that we're going to have to look at, which is, what impact did this have on exchange rates. That\u2019s something else that's been mentioned in the strength of the dollar. So the thing that's really kind of interesting but also very complex about this whole thing, so radically different that, it's go way beyond just what's the tax effect it could grow the economy, so that\u2019s a positive. It could strengthen the dollar that\u2019s got positives and negatives.","The point that you mentioned around pricing and affordability that one also could be interesting because, again based on a relative position that individual companies can have, there is probably an industry effect that could be quite different by individual companies. So I just can't answer, we don\u2019t know enough at this time Colin, to give you feel for that. But it's certainly something that we are aware of and we will be looking at as we get more specifics around the proposal itself as it works its way through congress.","Colin Langan","And Trump has talked about a focus on jobs. I think you even mentioned -- I think he even tweeted about it and having a plant opened in the U.S. What would actually -- would you consider, particularly at this point in the cycle, actually putting a whole new physical brick and mortar plant in the U.S.? And what with the criteria be for you to go forward and do something like that, if that what is the objective here?","Bob Shanks","Well, getting to the first part of your question, obviously as you know we canceled the plan down in Mexico because the bottom line is we saw was happening with the segment, we did need the capacity anymore and it didn\u2019t make any sense to add it, particularly now also where we are in a cycle. And going forward, the criteria for -- if we ever build any capacity anywhere, is the growth of our business. And we're comfortable with where we are right now. But we have made announcements, we are expanding our Flat Rock facility to build the new autonomous vehicle and the new battery electric vehicle SUV that\u2019s coming down the pipe.","And as you know, Colin, the things, we look at a lot different factors, both the capacity and where we put it. Everything from logistics to labor cost, the business environment, to tax treatment, et cetera. And we'll continue to look at those things going forward. But nothing on the plate right now in terms of brand new facility somewhere, but we are expanding some.","Colin Langan","And one question I get a lot from investors is you are guiding earnings down, but a lot of your peers, particularly your tracked U.S. peers are guiding earnings up. I imagine a big chunk is the investment in EV and mobility. Do you think you have some catching up to do? Is that why there is a big outlier there? Or is there another reason that you're a bit more cautious than your tracked competitors. Any thoughts on that? I would love to get your perspective since investors continuously ask.","Mark Fields","Well, I\u2019ll give mine first. I mean first of all we have been running at a very strong rate for seven year. So some are catching up to the level of performance that we have been at. But when we look at going into 2017, again I can't talk to others and what's happening in their business, launches or anything else, but we're going to continue the operate in terms of the core Automotive business at a very, very strong level.","It will change in terms of the construct of various factors and probably among the business units because things are different year-by-year. But we think overall the bottom line result for core Automotive will continue to run at a strong rate. Credit will come down for the reasons that we have talked about. The higher net interest expense, but really the difference is around the investments in the emerging opportunities. And we think that those are sort of like where we're planting the seed and we know that we're going to harvest the results. Probably more towards next decade. But this is going to transform the business. So it's something that we're really looking forward to doing and it's the right thing to do for the business. So, we'll have to see where we all end up when the year is out, but we believe that the call that we're making for the business is the right one for us and is still going to generate a strong result and as you know from what we've said around distributions, we're still going to provide shareholders with strong distributions in the year, $2.8 billion.","Colin Langan","And what about the notion that you're catching up to your peers? Do you disagree with that particularly on EVs? Or do you think maybe you are having to catch up a little bit on a relative basis?","Bob Shanks","Well Colin, I absolutely disagree with that in terms of if you look at electrification, I mean we've sold over 0.5 million electrified vehicles since 2004 and when you look at the breadth of HEVs, PHEVs and also battery electric vehicle that we have, it's one of the broadest. And we've made a commitment now as you know to expand that even further, that $4.5 billion and the 13 products that we've talked about, a number of them.","So, we strongly believe that we've lead in this area from a development of the market standpoint, we're working now as was mentioned earlier on infrastructure in various parts of the world for EVs, so we're going to continue to keep ploughing ahead on this. No, I don't believe that we are behind.","Operator","We'll now take questions from the media. We've a question from the line of Patti Waldmeir with Financial Times.","Patti Waldmeir","One question please for Mr. Fields, you were obviously one of the first to stress the positive side of a Trump Presidency for corporate America, but could you say to me about how it feels never to know when you're going to have to deal with, at the very least, a significant markets fallout from a Presidential tweet, could you -- what word would you use to describe your mood in this new normal?","And a question for Mr. Shanks, you said that there was a $200 million charge related to the Mexico cancellation, but I've also seen a $500 million figure for -- of savings for consolidating small car production related to the cancelation of that factory and I'm not sure where that figure comes from, could you say something about that?","Bob Shanks","Let me do that first, and then Mark can respond on how he feels. [Multiple Speakers] So, yes, the $200 million is a charge that we're taking in the fourth quarter, because we've made a decision towards the latter part of the year. So we've booked that in the fourth quarter. In terms of the$500 million, that was the net save, if you will, in terms of capital spending. And we talked about that at the time that we announced the cancellation. So we will save $500 million in capital related to the cancellation of this factory.","Mark Fields","Getting back to how do I feel? I feel good, and the reason I feel good Patti is because you talk about -- you're basically talking about the external environment, and how are you ready for things? And it's been the way that we've been running this business for years now. We're always looking at the external environment, literally every day, we're doing the right things for the business, we're being proactive, we act decisively.","So whether it's a tweet from somebody or a market disruption in another or a natural disaster and in some part of the world, we're going to be ready because we are just watching that external environment everyday and it keeps us riveted on the business.","Operator","This concludes the fourth quarter and full year 2016 Ford earnings conference call.

My name is Katrina and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.I\u2019d now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.George SharpThank you, Katrina and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like you to thank you for spending time with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our second quarter financial results. Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company; and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also in attendance are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit, CFO.Before we begin, I\u2019d like to cover a few items, a copy of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides we will be using have been posted on Ford\u2019s Investor and media website for your reference. The financial results discussed today are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q that will be filed next month. The financial results presented are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix in the slide deck.Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could differ materially from those suggested by today\u2019s comments. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of the presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports.With that, I\u2019ll now like to turn the presentation over to Ford\u2019s President and CEO, Mr. Alan Mulally.Alan MulallyThank you, George and good morning to everyone we are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our second quarter business performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our plan.Let\u2019s start by turning to Slide 3. In the second quarter we delivered our 12th consecutive quarterly pre-tax operating profit generated positive automotive operating related cash flow and ended the period with strong liquidity. Wholesale volume and revenue were lower than year ago. Operating results featured in excellent pre-tax profit and operating margin in North America and another solid performance once again at Ford Credit.Results for South America were slightly better than breakeven while Europe and Asia-Pacific and Africa incurred losses. We continue to project strong total company full-year pre-tax profit, but now expect to be lower than 2011 reflecting automotive pre-tax profit about equal to or lower than 2011 due to the challenges in Europe and South America, and lower profit for Ford Credit but in line with our existing guidance.We are continuing to implement our ONE Ford Plan; this includes aggressively restructuring to operate profitably at current demand and changing model mix, as well as accelerated development of new products that our customers want and value.The ONE Ford Plan has been our roadmap to the successful restructuring of our North America business, the path we followed to the recent recession, the foundation of the dramatic improvement in our automotive balance sheet and the basis of our growth strategy for Asia-Pacific and Africa. It remains our guide as we address new challenges we face today.Let\u2019s look more closely now at the financial highlights of the quarter. Slide 4 summarizes our second quarter business results compared with the year ago. Wholesale volume was 1.4 million units, down 72,000 units or 5%. Revenue was $33 billion, a decline of 2.2 billion or 6%. Pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $1.8 billion; about $1 billion lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.30 per share, $0.19 lower than last year\u2019s earnings per share, adjusted for the tax valuation allowance release.Net income attributable to Ford increased as unfavorable pre-tax special items of $234 million was about $1 billion, a 1.4 billion decrease. Earnings were $0.26 per share, a decrease of net income is explained primarily by lower operating results and higher tax expense related to the valuation allowance release in the first quarter of 2011. Automotive operating related cash flow was $800 million, the ninth consecutive quarter of positive performance.We ended the quarter with $23.7 billion of automotive gross cash, exceeding debt by $9.5 billion. This is a net cash improvement of $1.5 billion compared with a year ago. In the first half, both vehicle wholesales and revenue decreased by 4% compared with the same period a year ago. First half pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $4.1 billion, or $1.6 billion decrease. Net income was $2.4 billion, a $2.5 billion decrease.Shown here on slide five are the other highlights from the quarter. First Fitch and Moody\u2019s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade, triggering the release of collateral security in our revolving credit facility including the Blue Oval. We starting selling the all new Escape North America and began producing the all new B-Max in Romania. In the U.S. we added third production crews in our Chicago and Michigan assembly plants and we added a second shift at our Kansas City F Series facility.We also completed the sale of component businesses in Saline, Michigan and Sandusky, Ohio, leaving us with only one remaining ACH operation. We won the 2012 International Engine of the Year Award for the all new one leader EcoBoost, initially launched and focused in Europe and coming to the U.S. in the near future. In China, we launched new focus in our second Chongqing facility, with availability of sync in Chinese. We also announced a new $760 million assembly plant in Hangzhou that will support our plan to double production capacity of our CFMA joint venture to 1.2 million units by 2015.In Thailand, we opened the Ford Thailand manufacturing facility in Rayong, increasing our annual capacity in that market to 425,000 units. Now I would like to turn it over to Bob, who will take us through more details of our financial results. Bob?Bob ShanksThanks, Alan, and good morning to everybody. Let's start with slide seven which walks our pre-tax operating results to net income. As Alan mentioned, pre-tax operating profit was about $1.8 billion. Pre-tax special items were a negative $234 million including losses on the sale of the two ACH businesses he mentioned earlier, as well personal and dealer actions. Additional detail is provided in appendix three.The provision for income taxes was $557 million, and net income attributable to Ford was about $1 billion. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be similar to 2011. Let's now turn on slide eight to our pre-tax results by sector. Total company second quarter pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion consists of $1.4 billion for the automotive sector and $447 million for financial services.As shown in the memo, total company pre-tax operating profit was about $1 billion lower than last year, with both sectors contributing to the decline. Compared with the first quarter 2012, total company pre-tax profit decreased by about $500 million, explained primarily by lower automotive results. Slide nine highlights the key market factors and financial metrics for the total automotive business. In the second quarter, wholesale volume revenue were lower than a year ago, explained primarily by Europe.Pre-tax operating profit and operating margin were lower as well, more than explained by lower results in Europe, South America and Asia Pacific, Africa. As shown in the memo below the chart, total automotive first half pre-tax profit was $3.2 billion with an operating margin of 5.6%, both lower than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were lower in 2011.Slide ten summarizes the $900 million decrease in second quarter total automotive pre-tax profit from 2011 by casual factor. The profit decline is explained mainly by higher cost related primarily to product and capacity launch this year, investment for future growth and higher commodity cost including hedging effects. Market factors including reduction in stocks and exchange were also unfavorable.As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit decreased by $400 million compared with the first quarter more than explained by higher cost. More details on the quarter-to-quarter change are included in Appendix 6.Slide 11 shows second quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive. Automotive sector profit of $1.4 billion is more than explained by North America. The combined loss for our other operations was $465 million which was somewhat better than our recent guidance. The loss in other automotive mainly reflects net interest expense and an unfavorable fair market value adjustment primarily on our investment in Mazda. We expect full-year net interest expense to be between $0.5 billion and $550 million.Let\u2019s turn now on Slide 12 to our automotive business in North America. Second quarter wholesale volume and revenue were roughly the same as a year ago and pre-tax operating profit at $12 billion was higher than a year ago, with operating margin at 10.2% also higher. This is a second consecutive quarter with profit exceeding $2 billion and operating margin exceeding 10%.U.S Industry SAAR increased from 12.4 to 14.4 million units while our U.S. total market share was 15.6%, 1.7 percentage points lower than a year ago. As shown in the memo below the chart, North America first half pre-tax profit was $4.1 billion with an operating margin of 10.8 both higher than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were higher than 2011.Slide 13 shows the $100 million increase in second quarter North America pre-tax results compared with 2011 by casual factor. Profits were $100 million higher than the strong results of last year; higher net pricing, improved contribution cost and other factors were offset partially by higher structural cost for growth. And on the favorable volume and mix including an adverse change in our U.S. dealer stocks. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit decreased by $100 million compared with first quarter more than explained by higher cost, higher volume was a partial offset.Our outlook for North America is unchanged, we expect significantly higher full-year pre-tax profit and operating margin compared with 2011 as consumers continue to respond to our strong product line up including a recently launched all-new Escape. Next up is the all-new Fusion which launches later in a year. In addition to exciting products, we remain committed to maintaining our competitive cost structure as we grow our business. Side 14 shows our U.S. market share. Our total market share in the second quarter at 15.6% was down 1.7 percentage points from the same period last year. This is explained by lower share in both retail and fleet segments. The lower total share primarily reflects the impact of discontinued product such as Ranger and Crown Victoria. New competitive entrance in the small car segment and Japanese competitors, rebuilding inventories after the Tsunami impact in the second quarter of last year.Our retail share of the U.S. retail industry at 13% was down eight-tenth of a percentage point from the first quarter reflecting five-tenth of a percentage point of share performance and three-tenth of a percentage point of segmentation changes. The share performance was driven by small cars and Ranger while the segmentation change was mainly in full size pickups.During the quarter we continue to discipline approach, we have been using in recent years to maximizing the profitability of our sales and our revenue per unit, while foregoing marginal business that will leave us without adequate supply. As a result, we ended the second quarter with our inventory in great shape and an overall adequate data supply.We have also been focused on adding capacity this year in several facilities to support the growing industry volumes and our new product launches. Specifically, we are adding 400,000 units of annual incremental capacity by the end of this year, with most of the actions launching in the second and third quarters positioning us well going into 2013.Let\u2019s turn now to South America on Slide 15. Second quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased by 12% and 21%, respectively. In addition to the lower volume and favorable exchange was a factor affecting the net revenue recline. Pre-tax profit and operating margin were slightly positive declined substantially.South America Industry SAAR and our market share were down slightly. And as shown in the memo below the chart, South America first half pre-tax profit was $59 million, substantially lower than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were lower than last year.Slide 16 shows the $262 million decrease in second quarter South America pre-tax results compared with the 2011 causal factor. The lower profit is explained by lower volume, higher cost and unfavorable exchange. And although net pricing was higher, it was constrained compared with recent periods, by the more intense competitive environment. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit decreased by $49 million compared with first quarter, more than explained by higher cost, mainly structural cost related to the developing and launching new products in the region.Although we continue to expect South America to be profitable for the full year, we now expect the level to be substantially lower than 2011. This reflects increased competitive pressures, weakening currencies and changes in government policies effecting areas such as trade and access to foreign currency.We are continuing to work out actions, to strengthen our competitiveness in this changing environment looking at all areas of the business to improve our operating results. These actions include fully leveraging our ONE Ford plan, including the introduction of an all new line-up of global products over the next two years. Starting with the launch of Ranger, EcoSport and Fusion in the second half of this year.Slide 17 covers Ford Europe. Second quarter, wholesale volume and revenue declined 15% and 21% respectively, reflecting primarily lower industry volume and market share along with production adjustments to maintain dealer stocks and appropriate levels. Exchange was also a contributing factor adversely affecting net revenue. Pre-tax results and operating margins, went from a profit and positive margin in 2011 to a loss and negative margin this year.Industry SAAR for the 19 markets that we track in Europe, decreased from 14.9 million to 14.3 million units. Our market share of 7.7% was down six-tenth of a percentage point, reflecting primarily lower passenger cars share and an environment of increased competitor pricing activity and our relatively higher price position. As shown in the memo below the chart, the first half Europe loss of $553 million compared with the profit a year ago. Volume and revenue declined compared with last year.Slide 18 shows the $580 million decline in second quarter pre-tax results for Europe compared with 2011 by causal factor. Most of the change reflects unfavorable market factors. Volume was unfavorable due to lower industry share and associated stock changes. Net pricing was lower as the industry responded to excess capacity with higher incentives. Higher contribution costs also contributed to the profit decline.As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit decreased by $255 million compared with first quarter, explained by unfavorable market factors and higher costs. Given the deteriorating external environment in Europe, we now expect our full year loss in Europe to exceed $1 billion. The magnitude of the loss will be affected by a variety of factors including the overall economic environment, competitive actions and our response to these developments.We fully understand the seriousness of the situation in Europe and we view the challenges the industry faces as more structural than cyclical in nature. While we are affected significantly because of our strong presence in the region, we fully understand what it takes to be profitable and to generate an appropriate return on our investments. We have faced very challenging situations in other parts of our business before, and addressed them successfully to our ONE Ford plan.We will do the same now in Europe, which is an important and valued part of our plans. We are reviewing all areas of our business in Europe to address the near-term challenges while ensuring we are building a strong foundation for the future. It is pre-mature to discuss details of what our plans may be in response to the situation in Europe, but we will continue to communicate our plans at the appropriate time with all of our stakeholders.Now let's turn to Asia Pacific, Africa on slide 19. Second quarter wholesale volume and revenue improved 11% and 10% respectively compared with a year ago. Pre-tax results and operating margin on the other hand were lower. Industry SAAR increased from 27.6 million to 33.7 million units, and our share at 2.6%, declined three-tenths of a percentage point, reflecting Japan industry recovery, deterioration of the commercial vehicle industry in China, and lower small car market share in both China and India.As shown in the memo below the chart, the first half Asia Pacific, Africa loss was $161 million compared with a profit a year ago. Volume was about equal to 2011 while revenue was higher.Slide 20 shows the $67 million decrease in second quarter Asia-Pacific Africa pre-tax results compared with 2011 by casual factor. Market factors were strongly positive but they were more than offset by higher cost associated with new products and investments to support higher volumes and future growth as well as other factors. As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific Africa pre-tax results improved compared with first quarter more than explained by higher volume.Although we incur the first half loss in Asia-Pacific Africa, we do expect the results to improve in the second half due mainly to favorable volume and mix as we benefit from added capacity in China and Thailand and the new Focus and all-new Ranger.Slide 21 covers 2012 second and third quarter production. In the second quarter total company production was about 1.5 million units, 49,000 units lower than a year ago. This is 25,000 units lower than prior estimate reflecting lower production in South America and Asia-Pacific Africa. We expect third quarter total company production to be about 1.4 million units up 69,000 units from a year ago more than explained by higher volumes in North America and Asia-Pacific Africa.Although, third quarter production in South America is expected to be about the same as last year, this includes substantial production reductions in Venezuela and response to restricted availability of foreign currency. Compared with second quarter, third quarter production is down 45,000 units reflecting seasonal summer shutdowns in both North America and Europe.Turning now to Slide 22, our Automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow, you can see that we ended the quarter at $23.7 billion in Automotive growth cash an increase of $700 million from the end of the first quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $800 million and our cash flow before financing related changes in dividend was $1.3 billion.Net debt inflows in the quarter of $400 million includes drawdown of low cost loans for development of advanced technologies. We also made payments of $800 million to our worldwide funded pension plan in line with our previously disclosed long-term strategy to derisk our funded pension plan. Of this $0.5 billion reflects discretionary payment to our U.S. funded plan. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled nearly $200 million. In the first half, our operating related cash flow totaled $1.7 billion and gross cash improved $800 million.Slide 23 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the second quarter. Automotive debt was $14.2 billion compared with $13.7 billion at the end of the first quarter reflecting additional draw downs of low cost loans for advanced technologies. We will make our last draw on these loans by August with payment beginning in September. We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.5 billion and Automotive liquidity of 33.9 billion, both increased when compared with first quarter.Turning now to Ford Credit. Slide 24 shows the $166 million decrease in second quarter pre-tax results compared with the year ago by casual factor. The results are more than explained by fewer lease terminations which resulted in fewer vehicle sold at a gain and a lower financing margin. The decline in financing margin is explained primarily by the run off of higher yield in assets originated in earlier years.As shown in the memo, Ford Credit\u2019s pre-tax profit decreased by 414 million compared with first quarter. Ford Credit remains a strategic asset for Ford delivering high levels of quality and customer satisfaction with operating efficiencies that are among the best.For full-year 2012, Ford Credit expects to project full-year pre-tax profit of about $1.5 billion and total distributions to its parent between $0.5 billion and $1 billion. Ford Credit now projects managed receivables at year-end to be in a range of 85 to $90 billion and managed leverage of 8-9:1 for the foreseeable future. This is a decrease from the prior target of 10-11:1 and is consistent with the goal of achieving and maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.And with that I\u2019d like to turn it back to Alan who will cover business environment and our 2012 planning assumptions.Alan Mulally","Thank you, Bob. To summarize on Slide 26 is our view of the business environment. Overall, we expect 2012 global GDP growth to continue in the range of 2 to 3%. Global industry sales are projected to be around 800 million units up about 5% from 2011.U.S. economic growth is expected to range from 2% to 2.5% this year, with industry sales supported by increase in new placement demand given the older age of the vehicles on the road. Brazil economic growth is projected to range from 2% to 3%. This is supported by fiscal and monetary policy easing to stimulate the economy.In Europe we expect weak conditions to continue with several European markets undergoing fiscal austerity programs to achieve debt restructuring. China and India have experienced broad based weakness in growth rates which has prompted some policy easing., including interest rate cuts and increased government spending. We expect more policy actions are likely to stabilize economic growth in these countries.Slide 27 summarizes our first half results and our planning assumptions and key operational metrics for 2012. Industry volumes are in change from prior guidance, although U.S. industry volume, based on recent months results could be at the lower end of our forecast range. We expect U.S. and Europe full year market share to be lower compared with 2011 and continue to expect quality to be mixed. We maintain our guidance in the following areas. For Ford Credit, a pre-tax profit of about $1.5 billion, for automotive structural cost, an increase of less than $2 billion compared with 2011, and positive full year operating related cash flow.Given business conditions primarily in Europe and South America, we now expect automotive pre-tax operating profit and automotive operating margin to be about equal to or lower than 2011, and total company pre-tax operating profit to be strong but lower than last year. We also now expect capital spending to be lower at about $5 billion, reflecting mainly efficiencies.Finally, on slide 28, we summarize our ONE Ford plan, which is unchanged. We will continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at current demand and the changing model mix, accelerate development of new products for our customers and value, finance our plan and continue to improve our balance sheet, work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets.Total company first half profit was strong, driven by our business in North America and by Ford Credit. We have challenges in South America as a result of changes in government policies that are having an adverse impact on our business, combined with a more competitive environment. Europe is significant challenge due to a very tough external environment, a situation we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. And in Asia Pacific, we have continued to execute our aggressive growth plan as we implement our plan to serve customer everywhere, with a full family of best in class vehicles.We have made tremendous progress in recent years by executing the fundamentals of our ONE Ford plan, and we are working towards our mid-decade guidance. Looking ahead, our plan will continue to guide us as we work to sustain our strong North American operation and grow our important Ford Credit business, while addressing the diverse challenges and opportunities we have in other parts of the world. We are still in the early stages of reapening the benefits of our ONE Ford plan, our road map to deliver great products, a strong business, and a better world.We remain confident in our ONE Ford and our ability to deliver profitable growth for all. And with that we will be pleased to take your questions.George SharpThanks, Alan. Now we'll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We'll begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. In order to allow as many questions as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief. Katina, can we have the first question, please?Question-and-Answer Session","Operator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Adam Jonas - Morgan StanleyBob, first quarter for you. Peugeot just reported first half numbers today and then made comments saying that pricing in Europe was no longer deteriorating as bad as it was earlier this year. I just want to see if in real time, whether you share that sentiment on European pricing.Bob ShanksWe have seen through the course of year pressure on margins from increasing incentive levels. Also we are seeing a lot of activity in terms of short cycle sales. We have tried to find a sweet spot between sort of share and volume and contribution margin. And in fact one of the reasons why you saw -- in fact it is the major reason why you saw a share drop for us in the second quarter, because we were trying to make sure that we don\u2019t fully play in the increased incentives that we were seeing around us. I don\u2019t think our experience is out, we are seeing the fall off in incentive activity, in fact, if anything I think that we are seeing that increase as we go through the year. But with the great product set we have got, we have already launched a number of new things in the first half including the one leader EcoBoost, we have got the B-MAX coming, we got the new one-ton Transit coming, Ranger starting to hit the market, Kuga at the end of the year. We feel we are going to have a lot arsenal to be able to compete effectively and what is a very, very difficult environment, but pricing is difficult.Adam Jonas - Morgan StanleyAnd question for Mike Seneski. You guys have given the full-year target for Ford Credit 1.5 billion, you did point 9 in the first half, so, that implies a second half run rate maybe a third lower than you were doing in the first half. Is that really an intentional thing, am I reading the 1.5 billion a little too literally. Do you really expect that Ford Credit profit in real-time really just fall off a cliff in the second half, because that\u2019s what implies (inaudible).Mike SeneskiIn the second quarter we had an 8 basis point loss ratio compared to the previous quarters including the reserve impact, this is worth at least $50 million, good news really we weren\u2019t expecting. I don\u2019t really know where credit losses are heading but if they look like last year for the second half we are comfortable with the about 1.5. Obviously if credit losses are lower than that all else equal we should beat the 1.5 billion.Adam Jonas - Morgan StanleyFinally, Alan question for you, your stock (inaudible), it's a price level we haven\u2019t seen since December 2009 which is a year where Ford made like 110 AVPS sitting a 9 billion of net overall debt. I\u2019m not asking to be a sale side analyst here but, as an industrialist and a business leader what you read into that, what do you think the market is missing about Ford here. That\u2019s my final question. Thanks.Alan MulallyWell, I think it's in the context of very tough business environment worldwide, and I think people are starting to appreciate that we have a tremendous presence and operation in Europe. We have made money there for 6 and last 8 years but they are seeing this very significant deterioration in the economy in the industry and so I think that\u2019s weighing our people\u2019s mind and also the changes in South America. I think it's more of the volatility of the world, having said that Adam, I think people really do appreciate the value creation potential for going forward by supporting the customers all around the world and even during the toughest of times, we continue to restructure our operations to operate profitably at the lower demand the current demand. And also we are accelerating the investment in these new products around the world. So, I think both things are in play, right. I think the best thing we can do for value creation is o continue to implement the Ford plan of delivering a viable exciting profitable growing company. I think that will be appreciated overtime.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson representing Barclays Capital. Please proceed.Brian Johnson - Barclays CapitalJust want to continue building on what Alan said with the economic worries around Europe. So, you think pricing isn\u2019t getting much better, where do your inventory stand, where do you think the competitor inventory stand and is there are any possibility to get through sort of pricing trough at any point this year?Alan MulallyLet me get started and then let\u2019s get some more perspective from Bob. The most important thing about our plan and there has been or will be is for us to match our production to the real demand that has served us well or dealers well, the customers well, the residual values. So, we expect the Europe itself as you see, we continue to decrease our production to match that real demand, and then it continue to work the cost structure addition to the new products. And we are very, very pleased with the dealer stocks we have today, because we have been following that fundamental plan. Bob, you like to add little bit more on the pricing.Bob ShanksYes, just to add, going back o comment that I made to Adam in his question, one of the things I think that gives us a bit more pricing powers we go into the second half as the new products because we clearly can price a new products. And so in addition to the B-MAX which is an all new entry , we got as I mentioned C-MAX coming in with one leader FOX engine, we\u2019ve got the Kruger coming, the Transit coming. In Russia we\u2019ve got new products. We have got TH!NK coming across the board. So I think, we feel much, much better about pricing as we go into the second half. And as Alan said, we have maintained day supply in very, very good shape, really across the world. We have got a bit of an issue in China that we need to address which we will do so in the third quarter. But stocks are in great shape in Europe and the team there has done an excellent job of staying ahead of what's happening around them in terms of overall stock situation.Brian Johnson - Barclays CapitalAnd just quickly on the cost side. I sort of recognize what you are saying about structural cost and not wanting to communicate before you deal with stakeholders. I guess two things. One, when can we expect anything around maybe these things you talk about with the stakeholders. And then second, are there cost actions outside of labor and capacity around commodities, material, other structural costs that we could expect sooner progress on in and what would the pace of that be.Alan MulallyWell, we will not be providing any indications about specifics, sort of what our plans might be or timing, but as I mentioned to someone earlier today, we are clearly looking at the situation in Europe with a great sense of urgency and we are kind of all over the issues that we have got and worked at the plans to put the business on a firmer foundation going ahead.The only I would like to just sort of maybe add to what you just said, as we are doing that, and as we are thinking about the applications of the ONE Ford plan and the challenges that we have there. It isn\u2019t just a cost story here, there is tremendous opportunities for us on the revenue side in addition to the cost side, working on products, working on brands. Clearly, cost is something that we are going to have to address because our outlook is that the industry going forward is not going to recover to where it had been the previous five years or so.So clearly we have to address that. But this is going to be a holistic response to serious business situation. And if I were you guys I would go back and look at what we did in North America which was a comprehensive plan that addressed really what were Ford issues, more so than external issues. Here its bit of us but it\u2019s a lot of external issues that we are going to have to respond to and we will do so with our ONE Ford plan.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Matt Stover representing Guggenheim. Please proceed.Matt Stover - GuggenheimTwo questions. I believe, Bob, in your comments you described North American profits as being significantly higher in the second half as you bring out the new capacity and the product launches. I can see the improvement for margin versus 2H last year. But would you describe the margins progression versus the first half of this year as you launch those facilities and new products.Bob ShanksYeah, it\u2019s a good question, Matt. What we have talked about in terms of North America is that we will have significantly better results for the full year compared with last year. We have not provided any specific commentary on the second half with regard to North America. I think the way I would think about North America is it\u2019s running on all cylinders, clearly as you just noted the first and second quarter. Those were record in terms of profits and operating margins, is the best that we can tell.So running extremely strongly. All elements of the business are contributing. And as we think about the second half of the year, we have got the Escape that we have literally just launched, so that\u2019s going to help us out in the second half of the year. We have also got the Fusion coming on stream for which we have very high hopes for. When you think about Fusion and Escape, those are two of the biggest segments in the industry here. So we are very excited about the twosome there pushing the business forward. And we have got MKZ coming for Lincoln and the added capacity. So we feel very, very good about the second half of the year, in fact the whole year. And I think you will see strong results from that part of the business throughout the year and margins as well.Matt Stover - GuggenheimWould it be too much of a stretch to think that margins could stay flat in the second half?Bob ShanksI think the margins -- all I would say is you are going to see strong margins in North America throughout the year.Matt Stover - GuggenheimOkay. And the last question is. On Europe, you took a $190 million incentive adjustment. How much of that was associated with inventory?Bob ShanksVery little with inventory. I mean this is simply us, again going back to my earlier comment, recognizing that the pricing environment has slid as the year has progressed and trying to get sort of that balance and that sweet spot between volume share and net pricing and in particular, we are seeing that to be a very difficult situation in Southern European markets.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.Patrick Archambault - Goldman SachsActually I just wanted to piggy back a little bit there on Matt\u2019s question. Maybe on the aggregate level, I mean it looks like at the high end of your guidance, if profitability on the Automotive side were to be fairly even with last year again at the high end of your guidance that would imply a pretty meaningful increase in margins year-on-year in the back half. If I\u2019m correct. And maybe I don\u2019t know if you want to take this question either, sort of in aggregate volume price cost store, if it's easier to take it by region, but I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of what would be driving that year-on-year improvement?Alan MulallyThat\u2019s a very good observation, if you go back and look at the last couple of years, we clearly saw our profits and our margins sort of decline as the year progressed, second half in particular, and I think it was pretty much sequential if I remembered correctly. But when we look at this year, I think we might have touched on this a bit in the first quarter call, we think that we are going to see a different situation this year. We got the added capacity coming on stream in North America, we\u2019ve got more capacity that we just launched in China and Thailand, and the weight of our product launches this year and the impact for those launches is really a second half phenomena compared with the first half phenomena. Last year we also were hit by commodities, and the second half the year that just became bigger headwinds as the year progressed this year, it's much more benign. So, I think we feel much more comfortable about at the favorable impact all those factors will have on our second half relative to what we saw last year. So, your observation is correct, we do expect compared to last year to see the business hold on better in the second half.Patrick Archambault - Goldman SachsAnd then one, I think you mentioned in the update on the quality of that, the outlook was still mixed, can you just maybe just bring us up to speed, how the efforts are progressing there, what kind of cost implications are there if any materials ones to think about?Alan MulallyThe thing interesting about that is on the TGW side which is what thing has gone wrong, which is what that metric is really about. We are seeing really strong improvement in South America and Europe and in Asia-Pacific Africa, we are going to be probably about flat in North America and that is because of the fact that the issues that we had on MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch along with some of the power train issues associated with the dual-clutch transmission that\u2019s in the Fiat and Focus. We\u2019ve put software upgrades and fixes in on those which really didn\u2019t have much effect until we got into later part of the model year. We are seeing very positive results particularly from the software upgrades on the entertainments and connectivity systems that I just referenced. We are seeing big improvement in customer satisfaction and the consumers are telling us that they really appreciate the changes that we have given them, but the interesting thing is when you go to the cost side, however, this isn\u2019t translating into cost, but cost per unit or warranty spend, we are actually seeing good news on the cost. So, while the TGW is going to be about flat in North America for the total business on the cost side including North America, we expect to see good news on warranty.Patrick Archambault - Goldman SachsAnd then by next year, these fixes that you have put in place, you would expect to see a pretty good improvement there.Alan MulallyYes.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Rod Lache representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Rod Lache - Deutsche BankFirst question is just on this plan for fixing Europe, like you alluded to unlike North America you can\u2019t really count on a significant improving external environment. Do you think that there is an opportunity to reduce your European cost structure by $1 billion overtime to get to breakeven kind of on your own accord. It seems like that would be a pretty big drop, you have got about 35,000 hourly people maybe 2 billion of hourly cost and 1.2 billion of D&A, that would be a pretty big percentage versus that. Or do you really have to say that only part of this can be accommodated to cost and really you have to count on improving pricing and volume from the new products.Bob ShanksThat\u2019s a good question. And it goes back a little bit to what we were talking about earlier. I think when you look at any significant restructuring that you have to do in the automotive business, you generally, if you are facing that type of challenge, you are going to have to hit all part of the business in order to set it right and give it a firmer foundation for a profitable growth in the year ahead. And that\u2019s what we are going to have to do in the case of Europe.Well, we have to improve the breakeven from the cost side of the business, yeah, of course we are going to have to do that. Because our expectations in terms of what the industry is likely to generate in terms of overall volume is not as robust as what we might have thought a year or two ago. We also are seeing much more competition coming into Europe in terms of what the Koreans are able to do now because of the free trade agreements. So that aspect of the external environment has brought in a new element of competition as well.So we are going to have to be leaner in terms of our cost. But we really strongly believe and we have got the experience of this in North America. If we had just gone after a cost in North America, we would not have been talking about $2 billion of profits in second quarter. It\u2019s got to be a revenue story which is not only brand but also product. And it\u2019s going to have to be a cost story. We intend to work both aspects of the business, to put the business right going forward.Alan MulallyRod, I would just like to add a little bit to what Bob said on the product side too, because clearly with our ONE Ford plan and our complete family now of vehicles, especially in the B to C, the CD size or the compact pickup, and the commercial vans. We have a lineup that we have never had before. And this is going to allow us to dramatically improve our market coverage in Europe also. And as we have talked also that the quality of the brand continues to improve not only with the product but also with the success of doing a strong business that Ford is having.So clearly we are going to work the cost structure just like we did, we have around the world. But I think the other part of it is that we want to continue to work the -- we see great opportunity using our ONE Ford plan to work the revenue side also. And even on the cost side, Rod, like we have talked about. The fact that we are moving to our global platforms and the efficiency that we get for developing, I mean, plus the B, the C, the CD size, the compact pickup and the commercial vans, that\u2019s going to be accounting for nearly 80% of our volume worldwide. All made simply in different locations around the world.So we are going to get efficiency as we continue to implement that plan also.Rod Lache - Deutsche BankOkay. And can you comment on the -- there seem to have been a pretty big variance between production wholesales in North America in the first half, is that something that reverses? Are you sitting on an inordinately higher level of inventory kind of within the company? And then just some comments on commodity inflation and structural costs. Earlier in the year you had talked about flat commodities. Looks like its up so far but a lot of spot prices are down. And on structural cost the inflation rate of only $600 million, looks like it\u2019s running quite a bit below that $2 billion or less than $2 billion number that you have thrown out there. Any additional color on those items?Alan MulallyMake sure I don\u2019t forget, so remind me if I do. I think you have got three questions here, and they are all good. In terms of the first question, as you know, production versus wholesales, always sort of flip-flopping back and forth between each other as you quarter-to-quarter. I think it was affected in the second quarter because of the launches that we had in North America. So that\u2019s, well, I believe to be the biggest factor there.There is nothing funny about stock levels. We did have a little bit higher levels inventories, we were working through the launch and you saw that in our working capital, effect. But that was just sort of a onetime factor that we are already through. So I think that\u2019s probably what's happening there.In terms of commodity costs, we are up I think through the first half. Our expectation is as we go forward because as you know commodity prices have been declining as the year has progressed so a good portion of this increase you are seeing in the first half is actually hedging effect. And what we think is going to happen in the second half is we will start to benefit more fully from the lower commodity cost on the portion of our buy that isn\u2019t hedged. And if you remember we had the big hit in commodity hedging last year in second half which will shield us as we look at the second half of this year on a year-over-year basis.So we still think for the full year it\u2019s not going to have a material impact on our business including a hedging affects.And in terms of, were you asking about structural cost, the third question? In terms of structural cost as we look at the full year, we still feel comfortable with our guidance of below $2 billion, we do think that there will be an increase in structural cost as we move into the second half of the year because of the product launches and capacity increases. The impact that has on both manufacturing and advertising and sales promotion. So, we think we will see more coming on the stream as the year progresses, but pretty much in line with that 2 billion or less number.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseA couple of things, maybe first, a big picture question. We have heard from some of the industrial and consumer related companies that we talked to that they are already starting to see some tentativeness or [paralyses] on behalf of their customer\u2019s because of the election of the fiscal cliff. Are you seeing any of that currently, do you think that\u2019s a risk in second half, maybe even just from your commercial fleet customers can you talk about that?Alan MulallyI think that from our perspective we try to point that out with our guidance, we clearly are going to be higher than what we thought for the U.S. based on the continuing expansion of the GDP, but at that lower end of the 14.5, because we are seeing a little bit of softness, but overall even though it's a slower recover that we had from past recessions, we are seeing that expansion around 2 to 2.5%. And also Chris, the age of vehicle is really playing into this, I think the average age is over 10 now maybe even close to 11 years old. And the vehicles we have now you can make an economic argument to economically replace your older vehicles with a value to get from the increase in fuel economy over the liability unless maintenance. So, we are starting to (inaudible) plan that we are seeing more and more of the consumers want to move up to the new vehicles. And from the fleet customers good consistent steady demand and again we probably have the best product line now for them also. So, good steady demand there also.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseAny update on the pension situation on the buyouts, to take rates what are you expecting there and have you considered maybe offering an annuity option like some of other pension sponsors have?Alan MulallyActually not too much more to say on our lump sum initiative, we\u2019ve just sent out the initial offers or the individual information to the first group of employees or retirees rather that are eligible for the lump sum. So, we don\u2019t know yet what their reaction is going to be, so, just kicking that often we will probably have more to say as we get into the latter part of the year. In terms of annuitization, it is something that we have looked at as we were developing all of the strategies around our pension derisking, isn\u2019t something that we thought at the time that we wanted to pursue. It's still not something that is part of our plan, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily take it off the table. But not something that\u2019s currently in our thinking.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseAnd then just last quick one. On the bridge that you provided for North America on slide 13, you showed that volume and mix was a negative. Your production was up about 27,000 units year-over-year about equal between cars and trucks. So, that should be a plus, is it a minus because of a difference between wholesales and productions which you mentioned briefly on the call or was it a function of a mix within the mix. In other words, a year ago, may be you had particularly strong cars and trucks and you couldn\u2019t match that this year?Alan MulallyIt was the production versus wholesales. As you know our profits are based in wholesales.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli representing Citigroup. Please proceed.Itay Michaeli - CitigroupJust two quick questions on Europe; one, can you talk about the cadence of the results throughout the quarter, what as June like proportionally, or the other two months. And then why the contribution cost 182 million negative in the quarter. I thought that maybe we would come in a bit better, just given the volume in the quarter?Bob ShanksI don\u2019t think there was anything of note in the month. I mean, good Lord, our quarters have so much volatility when you look at month-by-month, my head hurts. So, I don\u2019t think there is anything that I\u2019d have read from looking at the individual month. When you look at the contribution cost, you know they were up $180 million or so. And it was kind of spread into three relatively equal segments. We had about $60 million of commodities including hedging and kind of talked about that already. We had $40 million or so from material excluding commodity and the majority of that was related to products including some Stage V emissions cost increases on commercial vehicles. And so that will be -- you have to kind of think about that also in relationship to what we will see coming down the stream in terms of product pricing to the extent that we can recover any of, that type of increase.And then finally, we had about $80 million of increase which was largely in warranty. And that was the non-repeat of a good news item that we had a year ago on some warranty accrual adjustments.Itay Michaeli - CitigroupThat\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly, I think you mentioned that the tax rate for 2012, I may have missed it earlier, so can you share that. And then also do you expect Asia-Pac to be profitable in the second half of the year?Bob ShanksYeah, we think that the operating effective tax rate will be -- for the full year about the same as it was last year, and that was about 31% or so, if I remember correctly. 31%-32% -- 32%. So that\u2019s what we are seeing at the moment for the full year. In terms of the second half for Asia Pacific, Africa, we think it will be better, and substantially better than it was in the first half but we are not making any characterizations about any absolutes.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.Ryan Brinkman - JPMorganHi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. In regards to North America, where you guided to 8% to 10% margins over the long run. I am just wondering if you think that could be potentially conservative, given the margins that you have been able to achieve since establishing that guidance range. In particular the margins you have been able to achieve just in the last two quarters and at this point in the cycle. You know I am thinking as we ramp from maybe 14 million SAAR to a more normal perhaps 16 million, that ought to provide you with some ability to leverage fixed cost. The higher tier 2 wage workers etcetera. Am I thinking about that wrong?Bob ShanksWell, first of all, welcome. I don\u2019t think I have had a chance to talk to you before, so kind of welcome to the Group here. I think in terms of margins, the way I think about it, step back from, you know after North America. But if you look at any of the guys that are kind of generating the best in the business on margins, sort of 8%, 9%, 10%, that\u2019s the level that you seem to be able to achieve on a sustainable basis. You will see quarters where you can do maybe a little bit better, but that seems to be a level that it\u2019s really, really good. It\u2019s very strong.We have demonstrated the ability so far this year to do that, through the first half. I think the full year will look very, very strong and within the range that you are talking about certainly. As we go forward, what you have to think about is what's going to happen if we go up to 16 million units or more, you are going to see more costs come in because we are going to have to put more capacity in. We are continuing to invest in the business so that will affect other parts of our cost structure as well.You will undoubtedly see competitive activity that will affect our ability to go above and beyond through the levels that you are talking about. I think that\u2019s sort of some of the natural brakes, if you will, that effect the company once its start to reach that level of performance. And we not capping it ourselves. Trust me, we are going to go for as much as we can get. But I think that\u2019s going to be a factor. And then for us as well in North America as you know, our expectation is that full size pickups will be smaller as a percent of the total industry going forward. And that is a very profitable segment of the industry and so we will probably have a bit of a drag on our business in terms of sort of segmentation mix.Ryan Brinkman - JPMorganOkay. That\u2019s helpful.Bob ShanksIf we can go for more, Ryan, we are going.Ryan Brinkman - JPMorganGood luck to you. On the lower CapEx guidance, does it relate to Asia Pacific, is it more global in nature? And will you characterize it as scaling back of investment or simply a matter of doing more with less?Bob ShanksThe latter. We haven\u2019t -- we obviously what's behind the factors that are giving us the ability to do more with less. It\u2019s not because we have cut anything or delayed anything, it\u2019s because we have generated more efficiencies as we have tried to do more with less, and that\u2019s what we are seeing so far this year.Ryan Brinkman - JPMorganOkay. And then last question, we talked about the fact that the issues you are facing large structural, how would you characterize the issues that you are facing in South America in terms of structural versus cyclical. And do you think over time you can return to the type of profitability in that market which you enjoyed even just a year ago?Alan MulallySouth America is completely different story and it's not one single thing. When we look at the business and the pressures that were under there, it's probably four different things, one is and we talked about this in the first quarter. It is a region, it's a protected region and if you are inside the walls of that region, you are able to in general and years passed we may make really good return and a good profit and so we are seeing more and more players who want to participate that. So, many of them have announced plans to come into the marketplace, to add capacity and players inside the walls of South America have also indicated plans to increase capacity. So, there is more pressure coming from added capacity and added competition.The second thing, that\u2019s happened is the governments have, it's not one government, the governments have thrown a few curve balls over the last six months or so, generally in the areas of trade policy and access to foreign currency. We have setup our business such that we could take advantage of free trade agreement that were in place primarily between Argentina and Brazil and Mexico. And those trade agreements have been challenged and to some extent at least temporarily suspended and that obviously had an adverse effect on our ability to compete along the lines that we had expected in terms of where we built vehicles and to supply those vehicles to the markets in which we were planning to sell them. So, that\u2019s not something we can respond to overnight as you can imagine because of the footprint that we put down.And then the third area is in currencies we have seen weakening currencies in Brazil in particular and that had a pretty dramatic impact on the business and given us some headwinds in terms of competing.Bob ShanksRyan, I might just add little bit to your comment about the product development and the capital investment. When we all put together the ONE Ford Plan nearly six years ago, we knew the foundation will be based on continuously improving our cost structure and operating profitably at the changing model mix and different volumes around the world. But the other main piece of it is to accelerate the development of the new products that people really do want in value. And we made a brand promise and a commitment to our customers that with Ford you could be able to get a full family of best in class vehicles and we [even mentioned that to them also]. So, for the last six years we have absolutely fully funded our product development plan to deliver that brand promise and even during the worst of times we have never backed off on the investment in the future which is a life line in this business. And the piece that you see there by us cutting down little bit on the careful investment for this year is a net of (inaudible) of our increase in the efficiency of developing and introducing these vehicles worldwide, but just as a main intent in our plan you will never see us back off on the investment in the future.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, at this time we would now like to welcome questions from the media community. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin with the Associated Press. Please proceed.Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated PressIf you could just briefly talk about the Escape launch, you had two [recalls] in two weeks and in some quarters that might be seen as a quality symbol. And I\u2019m just wondering how you view that launch within Ford.Alan MulallyClearly, it's a really important vehicle and a very important launch in response first of all has been fantastic to the vehicle people. Absolutely, I love the functionality, the quality, the fuel efficiency, the safety features and of course, the value. So, we are very pleased, the response is getting on the [recalls] as you know when we found out that we had a defective part in the fuel line, we move very, very decisively to take care of our customers. And as you know we are picking up the vehicles, we have given them (inaudible) we are going to take care of fixing that and we will do it very, very fast. And we are very disappointed to find that defective part, but clearly we are going to make it okay really quickly.And on the other issue associated with the pedal size, now that was something that we also found that we want to improve just to follow our standards. And so again we have a fix in place and we are implementing that very aggressively too. But, again, very important launch for us going forward. And kind of a neat thing too about it, Ian, is that the fact that we are attracting new customers with that vehicle. Because it\u2019s such a tremendous improvement. And we are going to be turning them in around five days too.So I wouldn\u2019t characterize it at all as a more fundamental issue in the quality, but we are actually going to keep moving decisively to make it great for the customers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel representing Detroit News. Please proceed.Karl Henkel - The Detroit NewsBob, you mentioned earlier about the European situation continuing for this foreseeable future. But can you really make a long-term decision with the complete uncertainty and variety of variables right now surrounding the external environment ecumenically. Or do things kind of have to settle down before something that long-term can be made?Bob ShanksWell, that\u2019s a good point. I mean we always have to have a base assumption. Right. There is always volatility in our business, in fact there is lot of volatility in our business. So we have to make a call in terms of sort of a base line assumption. And then as we develop our plans and we have done this, for example in North America, you have got to build in enough of a cushion if you will, in terms of the overall structure of the business that you establish, revenue and cost and so forth, that you are satisfied that you are able to be profitable even in an environment that may be as less robust as your baseline assumption. And that\u2019s certainly what we are going to do in the case of Europe.So it\u2019s a good point but we got to assume something. And we will do that and then we will make sure that we can have a good business even on the downside in terms of external assumptions.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Keith Naughton representing Bloomberg. Please proceed.Keith Naughton - BloombergAlan, do you need to close a plant in Europe?Alan MulallyWell, as we discussed this morning, we think it really is a structural issue and not cyclical. And so we are going to bring to bear all of the elements of the ONE Ford plan on the revenue side and the cost side. So we have nothing to announce more today. But as we further develop the plant or turn to profitable growth we will include all the stakeholders.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of [Mathias Ruge representing Financial] please proceed.Unidentified Analyst ","I also want to ask for the plants in Europe. There are two plants in Germany and others in other countries. Can you rule out that you are thinking about closing a plant in Germany or is every option on the table.Alan MulallyWell, I think that we need to -- we are going to have a very robust plan to return to serve the customers, our customers in Europe and have a strong business too. And as we have talked about today, our ONE Ford plan is very proven in that respect. Because it includes both the revenue side by having the products and people really be one in value but also having a cost structure that allows us to produce the vehicles with a reasonable return.So we are going to work all those elements of the plan just like we have with Ford all around the world. And our ONE Ford plan really gives us some competitive advantage because of our global products and our common designs, our common manufacturing processes and being able to make the vehicles in different locations simultaneously. So I will have more later as we develop the details of that plan with all the stakeholders.Unidentified Analyst ","As far I know you are just using like 65% of your capacity, product capacities in Europe right now. Do you think that this will go on like that in the next years, or is it just let's say for a year or so and you are keeping the plants open because you think that you will use the higher percentage of actual capacity pretty soon.Alan MulallyWell, I think, first of all you can calculate utilization in lots of different ways, but to your point, absolutely, we have over capacity now. And I think the other thing to your point is that we are assuming that this is a structural issue not a cyclical issue. It\u2019s not going to come back fast and we are going to be saved by volume, because we think it really is a structural issues that needs to be addressed. I think you are seeing the same view point from most of the automobile companies and so as we go forward, as we pointed out we will continue to match our production to the real demand which means bringing the production down, because the demand start there, keep the dealers stocks in line, protect the value of the brand and the residual values.And then again you use the revenue potential of the ONE Ford Plan with our global products, heavy more market segments with terrific vehicles. And also we continue to work our fundamental cost structure as we pointed out, and we develop the details of that we are going to share with everybody just like we did in North America.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Nathan Bomey representing Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.Nathan Bomey - Detroit Free PressWe hear a lot from the unions in Europe, they don\u2019t really seem to be willing to move too quickly. I\u2019m just wondering d you think you need to join the chorus of people who are putting more pressure on the unions and the labor councils in Europe. I mean (inaudible) out there putting a lot of pressure on them, do you need to kind of join that chorus (inaudible).Alan MulallyI think part of the ONE Ford Plan that work so well for us, is we include all the stakeholders including the unions, and as you know watching the transformation of North America, what everybody really cares about is being a viable exciting profitably growing company, because that is the only way that we can continue to provide growth and great jobs and great careers. And the worst thing that any business can do is to continue to lose money and go out of business. And so what we have found is that if we include everybody, we share what the realities are, we develop a plan together to deal with the current reality, but also with an eye for a long-term viably growing company that is the best for everybody. And we have gotten a tremendous response from all of the stakeholders involved when we approach it that way. So, we are going to do the very same thing, we will continue to do very same thing in Europe to include everybody in the solution.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey representing The Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.Mike Ramsey - The Wall Street JournalSo, two questions; one, Alan you mentioned this and you talked about a lot with leveraging the ONE Ford Plan and the ability to build on common platforms. After these new vehicles launch the Fusion and the Escape, which are now integrated with Europe. Can you now build and export to Europe Mondeo in Mexico, Flat Rock or an Escape in Louisville and send it to Europe, giving the opportunity that if you had to close the plant in Europe you can do that without any issue. That\u2019s question one. And question two is, when do you stop, when do revenue and sales in China start to overcome the expenses, do you have a sense of when that will start to not be a loss. And will switch the other side.Alan MulallyOn your first question, on your first question Mike, clearly one real advantage of the ONE Ford Plan is their ability to serve the different markets around the world with common platforms, but also with the [top hats] that people really do want. So, technically absolutely, we can move the vehicles around. But also we have to take an account with the transportation cost are in the freight and the other things that go with doing that. And we will continue to look at that, but the most important thing, we respect to your question about Europe is that, we continue to work on the fundamental cost structure for our operations there along with the revenue side.On Asia-Pacific, Mike, which really about the Asia-Pacific plan of course is that we are (inaudible) this capacity but also are bringing in the new vehicles, and we are timing at pretty close to the market and you can see that in the financial numbers that even with the large investment we are making we are seeing very close to profitability. And so, I think it goes right with the vehicles and the production capability. We are in the midst of bringing on nine new plants, we are going to be going from 5 vehicles in China for example to 15 vehicles. Where we are going to be going from maybe 30% market coverage up to nearly 65% market coverage. So you can just see all this next few years and like that mid-decade guidance that we provided. And as the production comes on and our ONE Ford vehicles are implemented, then the profitability and the [cost reduction[ in the company will just follow that over this next few years.So we are very pleased with the progress we are making today and it\u2019s going to be a very, very important contributor to Ford\u2019s growth plan going forward. Katina, we have time for one more question?OperatorThank you, sir. Your next question will come from John Murphy representing Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.John Murphy - Bank of America\/Merrill LynchTwo quick questions here. First, (inaudible) pricing compression, it\u2019s been positive for a while now but only slightly so. Given your focus on keeping inventory lean and all these new product launches, would have expected to be a little bit better. Is it the kind of thing that we are sort of going to see accelerate as we go through the second half of this year and we see this all new Fusion launch on top of really the first product in the product renaissance, the old Fusion. And we\u2019ll sort of get this redoubling of good product or all new product on top of the really good product and we will see some real pricing momentum in the second half of this year and maybe even more so going forward. I am just trying to understand why pricing hasn\u2019t been a little bit better given your lean inventory and very good product launches.Bob ShanksI am really glad you asked that question because I just wanted to make that point. When you look at slide 13 and you look at that net pricing of $100 million, year-over-year you look at that. And your reaction could be exactly what you described. But I think what you have to think about is a year ago -- you know a year ago, think about what the situation was like in North America and in the U.S. You had the Japanese that really had incredibly constrained supply. The market was really able to leverage and use it pricing muscles if you will.And to me, what it says -- and we haven\u2019t had a lot of new products in the first half in North America. And a lot of the pricing comes with new products. So to me the message is, we have been able to hold on that pricing which could have been shorter term in nature because the Japanese clearly are back in the market place with adequate supplies of stock. We have held on to that and added pricing.And when I think about the second half of the year, we have got quite a bit of new product coming in play. And I think that you will see us able to generate additional and incremental pricing compared to what we saw in the first half. Having said that, I think, John, we have to remember that over the last number of years as we restructured North America and worked on the brand and improved the product, we have seen dramatic closing of the discount versus our key competitors that we had for the Ford brand over that period of time. So that one element of pricing recovery probably doesn\u2019t bear to the extent that it was over the past five-six years.John Murphy - Bank of America\/Merrill LynchOkay. That\u2019s incredibly helpful. Then just the second question on cash levels. It seems like you are bouncing around between $9 billion and $10 billion and that seems to be your net cash target. A lot of the free cash flow looks like you will generate in the second half of the year is going to get sopped up by your pension contributions. I was just wondering if that\u2019s correct and when we will see potentially more return of value to shareholders. Do we need to get through these contributions to the pension plan, continue to generate free cash flow and then see -- should this increase in the first half of next year or could we see this more specifically in the second half of this year.Bob ShanksAnother good question. We don\u2019t specifically have a target for net cash if you will. But in terms of capital allocation, we clearly have a lot of mouths to feed and we have got a pretty sophisticated and I think a well thought through capital allocation strategy and it touches on all the areas that you have talked about. So what we try to do is to balance business needs and business opportunities with those of all the various stakeholders and make sure that we think we have got the right balance. And that\u2019s something that we update and look at regularly and we will continue to do that.And in terms of dividends, in terms of buybacks and that sort of thing, nothing to announce differently today versus where we are, but it\u2019s certainly something that we are looking at constantly. And if we have something new to say we will share that with you.John Murphy - Bank of America\/Merrill LynchAll else equal, Bob, that $3.5 billion that\u2019s going to the pension plan is a pretty good sort of full stop on putting money into the pension plan, I think it\u2019s a big contribution. I mean we shouldn\u2019t expect more going into the pension plan after that in the near term. Is that correct?Bob ShanksWell, we are going to have substantial pension contributions over the period because we are substantially under-funded, and most of what you will see over the coming years is mandatory in nature in terms of what we have to do. So we will continue to have a pretty heavy requirement for pension contributions over the next several years.Now we have got in the 3.5 billion or so that you just talked about, we have got $2 billion of voluntary contributions this year. And that was part of our strategy and our long-term strategy around pension derisking. And we are not saying anything about that aspect of our contributions going forward. But in total they will be significant in the years ahead. Because we have got to close that gap that we had at the end of last year which, if I remember correctly was in under-funded status in total of about $15 billion.Alan MulallyAnd John as you know, it\u2019s just so good for the business to remove that volatility of the balance sheet so that we can really focus on the automobile cycle.George SharpOkay.

On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I'd like to thank you for spending time with us today.","With me this morning are Bern Silverstone, Ford Credit Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marion Harris, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I would like to review a few items. As a reminder, we've moved the format of this call to focus only on Ford Credit's earnings and we have expanded the content of our communications to provide increased disclosure on topics for which we commonly receive questions from the fixed income investment community. All automotive-related questions should be directed to the Ford Equity Investor Relations contacts, as detailed in the Ford press release.","I'd also like to remind everyone that we posted our Ford Credit University slides on our Investor website on July 15.

Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Thank you, Steve. Let me add good morning to everyone, and on behalf of Marion, Neil and myself, thank you for dialing in or indeed joining via webcast. So, today, we will review our results for the second quarter and we'll look at key metrics and trends for the business, bring you up to speed on our funding, of course, and as usual take your questions.","So we can get started if we can turn to slide one, where you should be familiar with this. We talked about this slide last quarter, but I did want to quickly touch on it, again, today, really to reinforce our focus on running our business with clear operating principles executed by our very experienced team. Consistency and discipline continue to define our origination practices and world-class customer service.","Additionally, strong risk management and focus on business fundamentals are cornerstones of how we run the business and they really underpin our results. So if we can move to slide two and we will start the review of some of those results for our operations for the second quarter.","So as you can see, in the second quarter, we made $400 million of pre-tax profit. Now that was lower than a year ago, but is still a very solid result and that puts us at more than $900 million in pre-tax profit for the first half of the year. Also, our receivables were up as we continue to grow in line with expectations and you'll see later how our worldwide credit losses were actually down for the second quarter versus the first quarter, but here you see that in the U.S. market our loss-to-receivable ratio was higher versus the second quarter last year.","However, the loss-to-receivable ratio remains close to historically low levels and consistent with our expectations for this stage in the ongoing recovery, it continues to edge closer to the longer-term trends.","For placements, our average placement FICO scores \u2013 just to remind everybody \u2013 this is one component of what we use for proprietary scoring models, but it remains very consistent and strong, and U.S. delinquencies, although slightly up, remaining at very low levels.","So, starting on the next slide, Marion will go through the results in more detail.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Thanks, Bernard. On slide three, you'll see our $400 million of pre-tax profit. The decrease from the second quarter of last year can be attributed primarily to unfavorable lease residual performance, higher credit losses and a couple of factors in the category we call other. Partial offsets were favorable volume and mix. These were driven by growth in finance receivables globally, plus operating leases in North America.","Unfavorable lease residual performance primarily reflected higher supplemental depreciation in North America related to lower expected auction values on smaller vehicles in our lease portfolio. The higher credit losses reflected higher charge-offs in North America and an increase in the credit loss reserve. The higher charge-offs reflected increased defaults and severity, as well as growth in receivables. Other reflects a few items, including higher storm-related insurance losses and unfavorable derivatives market valuation following the BREXIT vote.","The slide four shows North American financing share and contract volume. Financing shares were down slightly in the second quarter and first half from the year ago periods. The lower retail and lease financing shares were driven by marketing programs and the lower total contract volumes from the second quarter and the first half are more than explained by lower retail installment and lease financing shares.","Turning to slide five, this shows our financing share and contract volume for our international operations in the second quarter and first half. In Europe, share was largely unchanged from last year and in China, share and volume were higher related to marketing programs. Total contract volume was higher primarily reflecting higher financing share in China and higher industry volume in Europe.","Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","So just on some of those quarter-over-quarter movements that we can see in these share metrics just to give you a little bit more texture. In the U.S., the reduction in share mostly reflects the lower leasing share, which is consistent, in fact, with the outlook that we talked about at the end of the first quarter.","And of course, we're always reviewing marketing programs to understand customer needs and market trends and then respond appropriately, which means that it's also quite normal to see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in share. And additionally, looking at China, we continue to see a gradual increase in market acceptance of credit, as a means to acquire vehicles and that's particularly true amongst younger customers.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Bernard. So turning to slide six, you'll see placement FICO in the U.S. in the second quarter was up slightly from the first quarter, and our average FICO scores remain very, very consistent. And as Bernard mentioned earlier, FICO is just but one component of our proprietary scoring models.","As you know, we support customers across the credit spectrum and our higher risk mix has been running consistently around 6% in recent quarters and has been stable for over 10 years. Our average retail term remained largely consistent with recent periods and lower than the industry.","So slide seven shows our U.S. retail and lease credit loss metrics, as we continue to come off an extended period of extraordinarily low credit losses. Delinquencies at 12 basis points remained at historically low levels and repossessions were up slightly in the quarter from the second quarter a year ago.","The severity increase in the second quarter from the prior year primarily reflected lower auction values, higher balances at repossession, and higher amounts financed. Severity has been relatively flat from the first quarter. Our charge-offs and loss receivables ratio were higher year-over-year and that reflected primarily higher defaults and severities.","So, now on slide eight, as Bernard mentioned earlier, our worldwide credit loss metrics remain very, very strong. Worldwide LTR in the second quarter was higher than a year ago, reflecting primarily U.S. retail and lease business that we covered on the prior slide. The credit loss reserve was up from a year ago, primarily reflecting credit loss performance trends. The reserve as a percentage of managed receivables was also up from the second quarter of 2015.","So on slide nine, our lease placement volume in the second quarter was about the same as last year's second quarter, but our lease share continues to run below the industry. We continue to expect our lease share of retail sales to be lower than the first quarter.","Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","I just want to mention here that, as we've talked about before, just to remind everyone that our placements and shares continue to be managed as part of our overall One Ford Lease strategy and we've referred to that before because that's where we work with our Ford partners to plan leasing considering things like share, term, model mix, all those things that we've got unique insights to.","And in fact, it helps us balance sales and residual values in the future and of course, as we've also emphasized before, our focus on the trade cycle so that we've got satisfied customers and a sustainable leasing program. As you know, the industry of leasing stayed about flat and we've taken a more proactive approach, we believe, by managing down our lease mix, as we indicated in the first quarter. We think this will help address some of the supply concerns around returns of off-lease vehicles given the growth in leasing these past few years.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Okay. So, on slide 10, you'll see we had 62,000 units of lease return volume in the second quarter. This was higher than last year and reflects our higher lease placements in recent years, as well as an increase in the return rate. Our used vehicle auction values in the second quarter were lower than a year ago, but have been flat from the prior quarter \u2013 past couple of quarters, in fact.","Although, Manheim reported an increase in used vehicle values in the quarter, our results reflected a larger mix of two and three-year-old smaller vehicles, which have had lower auction values. Our mix of newer vehicles is just a subset of the broad range and age of products that make up the Manheim Index.","Let's go to slide 11. Slide 11 shows our trend in funding of our managed receivables and at the end of the second quarter, managed receivables were $134 billion, up $7 billion from the year-end, and our securitization funding was about 35% of managed receivables. And as we've said in the past, we continue to expect the mix of securitized funding to trend lower over time as our unsecured funding becomes a larger part of our funding structure.","However, the calendarization of our funding plan may result in quarterly fluctuation of the securitization funding percentage. Our funding strategy really continues to center on having a very strong investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and funding that's diversified across markets and channels and investors.","Just one other thing I want to point out on this slide. You will note that we are no longer providing a range on year-end managed receivables and funding structure and that reflects the recent regulatory changes around the use of non-GAAP measures in guidance.","So turning to slide 12, this slide shows our public term funding plan, and we are off to a terrific start this year, and we've completed more than two-thirds of our full year funding plan with only just halfway through this year. And for 2016, we do continue to project funding in the range of $27 billion to $33 billion. This is a bit tightened on the range from the first quarter and both the amount and composition of our full-year funding plan are consistent with our issuance in 2015.","Turning to slide 13, you can see our leverage and liquidity metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our financial statement leverage was 10.2 to 1 and our managed leverage was 9.4 to 1. We target managed leverage in the range of 8:1 to 9:1 and our managed leverage was above our targeted range reflecting the recent growth in receivables and the continued impact of a strong U.S. dollar.","For liquidity, we target at least $25 billion to protect against downturns and market disruptions. Our quarterly levels can be affected by near-term debt maturities, receivables growth, timing of transactions and other factors like that, but we feel very good about the very strong liquidity we have.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Bernard, to wrap things up.","Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, Marion. So if we could turn to slide 14, here we show that we now expect our pre-tax results to be lower than 2015, which is really impacted by the higher ongoing depreciation reflected in our expectations of continued lower auction values on smaller vehicles. We do expect, however, that second half pre-tax results will be about in line with our first half results.","And as you've heard earlier in the Ford earnings call, both Ford and Ford Credit are already finding improvement actions and working to mitigate some of the risk that we discussed. Also, on this slide in terms of Ford Credit working to return leverage towards our target range, one of the initial actions we've taken is to continue to change our plan for distributions and you can see it's consistent with our first quarter guidance.","So, now we go over to the takeaway slide, slide 15, before we turn to your questions. But before I actually go through them, just wanted to touch on the British vote to leave the European Union, as I know that is certainly on many people's minds and to mention at this stage we continue to monitor the developments closely and assess any impact on our business. And of course, we will act appropriately under any new regulations that result as and when we understand and what those are going to be.","So, now just to summarize our performance. We've had a solid second quarter and first half. We know expect our pre-tax profits to be lower than 2015, reflecting the increased depreciation charges that we've mentioned throughout this presentation. We do, however, expect our second half pre-tax results to be about in line with the first half results.","So, as always, we remain focused on disciplined and consistent execution to support sustained performance, all based on a very strong balance sheet. So that's how I report out. Steve, back to you. Can you open the line for questions.","Steve Dahle - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Bernard. We will now start the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we will only take Ford Credit questions on this call. Automotive-related questions should be directed to the Ford Equity Investor Relations contact as detailed in the Ford press release. LaTonya, may we have the first caller, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle with SunTrust.","Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the time again. I kind a hitting on the lease share, and I do appreciate how you guys have \u2013 I think Mark said it on the last call \u2013 you guys are always very early to react, which is why we appreciate color from you guys because you guys are always honest and early. You guys are decisively giving up some lease share. Financing is still available to you. The auto side needs support. Is this a Ford Credit risk-adjusted return decision looking out at the ALG guide? How was this made to move away from the lease market? And is it something that the other financers are going to pick up the slack because there's so much growth in that area?","Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","First, Eric, thanks for joining us, and thanks for your question. So I think I can relate it back to really as we talked about our One Ford Lease strategy. So it's definitely a joint approach to how we think about leasing. I think one of the keys also to underpinning that is our view that leasing has to be sustainable. Not to go back to 2008 and 2009, but you know what happened there.","So we're taking a long view in terms of the dimensions we've talked about and they spit out, if you like, some concentration parameters for us and we've used those in aggregate to look at our overall lease share. So we may be giving up some leash share in the short term, but would it be good lease share in the long term? When those customers come back in two or three years' time, if there isn't a comparable lease program, then it's really not sustainable.","One of the main benefits, of course, is the loyalty we see, the satisfaction we see, as well as the near-term impact on sales. So we are certainly going to be present in the leasing market at the right level, but we are managing this to make sure it's also sustainable and that when those customers come back at the end of their lease, we can have a good experience and offer them a new product again and hopefully enjoy the kind of loyalty we've always seen from our leasing presence.","Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I appreciate the holistic view. I've worked at a bank for 20 years and I always tell my bankers it's easy to initiate a loan; it's hard to sell it. So, obviously, short term\/long term is obviously appreciated. Looking in the States, it's obviously well-advertised and well-expected, sedan glut concentrated with the Japanese and Germans. How can they come in and support residuals? We're hearing stuff that they are getting a little bit more conservative on some of their structures. How can they \u2013 because I feel like if they support the residuals, some of the overhang goes away. Are you seeing them come in and really come in and support some of that residual risk? Anything they are doing that would help bottom that trough, and kind of how are you all looking internally at that sedan glut? When does the glut kind of peak and kind of move through the snake, per se? When is the worst of it? And are you seeing any of your J3 or G3 captive competitors step up to support the residual risk that they have because it seems like it's more pronounced over there?","Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","I'll kick off on that one and just say that I think you can see it on the numbers on the page there that the industry is still running higher than we are certainly running, so clearly the marketing offers there are presumably being supported in terms of as you say the residuals that are being held out.","When that eases, I think it's back to the disciplines we talked about in the earlier call, that if the industry holds its discipline, if indeed the pattern that we are seeing is across the industry in the various segments, and you've called out a couple of segments that I think are very valuable and clear insight on your part there, then you'd think there would be an adjustment.","But clearly we don't have insight to their specific plans so I can't give you a call of when that will change. We are taking our own actions and you can see it in our numbers there that we've moderated our leasing programs to make sure we can be there through the cycles.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Eric, this is Marion. I would just say that where industry leasing is today is about the peak of where it was almost 20 years ago. And so our view is that, at those kinds of levels, it's a bit too high. And as Bernard said, we have to manage our own business and we do that through our One Ford Lease strategy and you want to keep it at such a level that you are not getting people into cars with so much Motor Company subvention that it gets them into a car that they really probably shouldn't be in as opposed to a different, a lower price point vehicle.","And you see that. You see it in the luxury segment. Sometimes when folks are chasing share, they will do very aggressive lease programs and they'll support the residual very strongly and in the end that ultimately results in a bunch of returned leases that run through auction at lower prices and over time kill the brand.","Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","We've all seen the One Ford work through the cycle, so as a credit guy, we appreciate it and I do appreciate your time today.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Thanks, Eric. Good to hear from you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garland Buchanan with Legal & General.","Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Can you just confirm, of the remaining $2 billion to $4 billion issuance recorded out of Ford Motor Credit, how much of that is expected in the unsecured market and the tenor views there?","And then another question, in terms of rating migration, you've communicated a desire to go upward. Do you think that you need to get through the cycle in order to get that upgrade, or is that something in your conversations with the agencies that you see as possible going into a downturn or even in a downturn? Thanks.","Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Yeah. I'd say, I'll start and then kick it very quickly over to Neil. If you look at our slide 12, this shows in the forecast for our funding plan. So we have somewhere between $2 billion and $6 billion left to do in unsecured and you can see it broken out by region and then what we need to do left in securitization. So that gives you some guidance on where and how much is left to do. And then as it relates to tenor and rating agency questions, I will ask Neil to comment.","Neil M. Schloss - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I think on the tenor question, which I think we both look at the market, but also manage our maturity profile to fit into where we are not overly concentrated in any one calendar year or calendar quarter for that matter. And so we've issued these things sort of three years and 10 years, manage to an average maturity sort of in the middle there, but then we also look at the market from a standpoint of where best to issue.","And then on the ratings, I think your guess is probably as good as ours from the standpoint of what it takes. I think we continue both at credit and auto to manage to a, single A credit from a standpoint of our balance sheet. We think we are there. You look at some of the metrics on both leverage for the company, as well as for Credit and they would, based on the rating agency metrics, would say we are single A.","So it's getting the business there and obviously getting through a cycle being able to maintain our funding, being able to maintain our base dividend would obviously go a long way to supporting a higher credit rating.","Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.","Okay. So I'm sorry, to confirm then that slide 12, if you just look at the $2 billion to $4 billion issuance remaining, that does not include commercial paper? That's correct?","Neil M. Schloss - Ford Motor Co.","Correct. This is unsecured term and secured term.","Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC","Just to add a little bit of flavor on this page is something that I think underscores some of the values that we've espoused into how we run the business. If you look in the middle there at our European operation and what they funded through July, you can see how we approached having the contingencies in place for Brexit, not knowing how the vote would go, but really having a great step forward on the funding. I think it more talks to the values we espouse about being a consistent player and making sure we are fully funded and that's why we've got the strength of the balance sheet that Neil just referred to.","Neil M. Schloss - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, and specifically on the CP side, we ended the quarter with about $4 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which is up from where it was at the beginning of the year, in part because we now have a two rating from all of the agencies, which obviously creates new demand for us on the short-term programs.","Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Dahle, I will turn the floor to you for closing remarks.","Steve Dahle - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, LaTonya. With that, I would like to conclude today's call.

And welcome to the Ford Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by Executive Director, Investor Relations George Sharp. My name is Julie and I am your event manager. (Operator instructions)","Now I\u2019d like to hand over to George Sharp. Please go ahead.","George Sharp","Thank you, Julie, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results.","Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Mark Fields, Chief Operating Officer; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s investor and media website. Please note that the financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Final data will be included in our Form 10-K and any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck.","Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings.","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the presentation over to Alan.","Alan Mulally","Thank you, George and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to review our fourth quarter and full year 2013 business performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our One Ford plan. We will also reconfirm today our major plan assumptions and key metrics for 2014. Let\u2019s turn to the first slide, please.","The foundation of everything we do is our One Ford plan shown here. Across the Ford enterprise, we continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at current demand and the changing model mix to accelerate development of new products our customers want and value, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet, and work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets.","Our commitment remains to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles, small, medium, and large cars, utilities, and trucks, delivering profitable growth for all. We continued to make good progress towards this goal in the fourth quarter, which we will now review starting on slide two. The company had a solid fourth quarter, achieving our 18 consecutive profitable quarter.","Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive and liquidity remains strong. The topline grew year-over-year for the fifth consecutive quarter, with market share gains both in the U.S. and in Asia-Pacific and Africa where we realized record share.","Among our business units, North America delivered a strong profit, Asia-Pacific and Africa earned a record profit for the fourth quarter, South America incurred a loss as expected and Europe reduced its loss compared with last year. Ford Credit once again contributed solid profits.","For the full year, the company\u2019s pre-tax operating profit was among the best in our history and automotive operating-related cash flow was a record. These full year results reflect an automotive sector and operating profit that was the highest in more than a decade, with record profits in North America and Asia-Pacific and Africa, and about breakeven results in South America and a loss in Europe -- and a lower loss in Europe than last year. Ford Credit was solidly profitable.","Volume and revenue grew compared to last year with market share gains in the U.S., South America and in Asia-Pacific, which was driven by record market share in China. Retail share was also higher in Europe. Our global pension plans funded status improved about $10 billion compared with year end 2012. Global pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at year end 2013.","Our outlook for 2014 remains unchanged from what we communicated in December. We continue to expect automotive revenue to be about the same as last year. Automotive operating margin to be lower and automotive operating-related cash flow to be positive but substantially lower than 2013. Total company operating profit expected to range from $7 billion to $8 billion.","Before turning to the financials in detail, let's recap some of our other achievements from 2013. On slide three, during 2013, we launched 11 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally.","The next-generation Mustang was revealed in six cities on four continents, based on latest available Forbes data, Focus was the world's best-selling nameplate and Fiesta was the world's best-selling subcompact car through the first nine months of the year.","In the U.S. the F-Series achieved truck sales leadership for the 37th straight year and vehicle sales leadership for the 32nd year in a row. In Europe we announced plan to accelerate our product launch plan to at least 25 vehicles in the next five years.","In China, our joint ventures opened two new plants and we announced plans to bring two new global products to JMC. For the Middle East and Africa, our new business unit, we announced plans to launch 17 vehicles over the next two years to accelerate growth in the region.","Consistent with our plan to provide regular growing dividends that are sustainable over an economic or business cycle, we doubled the dividend in 2013 and as you know, we announced an additional 25% increase earlier this month.","In the U.S. we will pray record profit sharing to our employees for 2013. And finally, we received an investment grade rating from S&P. With this upgrade four of the major rating agencies that rate us now report Ford and Ford Credit as investment grade.","Bob Shanks will now take us through the details of our financial performance in the quarter and for the full year. Bob?","Robert Shanks","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Starting at the top of slide four, fourth quarter wholesale volume was $1.6 million units, up 76,000 units or 5% from year ago. And revenue was $37.6 billion, up $1.3 billion or 4%.","Pre-tax profit was $1.3 million, excluding special items, $402 million lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.31 were unchanged.","Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges of $311 million and favorable tax special items of $2.1 million was $3 million, $1.4 million higher than year ago. Earnings were $0.74 a share, up $0.34.","Automotive operating-related cash flow was $0.5 billion, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of positive performance. Automotive gross cash was $24.8 billion, exceeding debt by $9.1 billion.","For the full year, vehicle wholesales increased by 12% from a year ago and revenue improved 10%. Pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $8.6 billion, a $600 million improvement. Net income was $7.2 billion, $1.5 billion higher. ","Slide 5 walks our pre-tax operating results and net income. And we\u2019ll focus here our comments on the fourth quarter. As just mentioned, total company pre-tax operating profit was $1.3 billion. Pre-tax special item charges of $311 million included $156 million for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe, to support our transformation plan, and $155 million associated with our now completed U.S. salaried lump sum payout program as part of our pension derisking strategy. You can find additional detail on the special items in the Appendix 3 and on the pension derisking in Appendix 6. ","We also benefitted in the quarter through $2.1 billion of tax special items, including the impact of a favorable increase in deferred tax assets related to investments in our European operations and the release of valuation allowances held against U.S. state and local deferred tax assets. ","In addition, Ford Credit tax liability was reduced. As a result, net income attributable to Ford was $3 billion. For the full year, our operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown, was 27%. Looking ahead to 2014, we expect the rate to normalize at about 35%. ","As shown on Slide 6, both of our sectors, automotive and financial services, contributed to the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits. Total company fourth quarter pre-tax profit of $1.3 billion was $402 million lower than a year ago with both sectors declining. ","Compared with third quarter, total company pre-tax profit declined $1.3 billion, nearly all in the automotive sector as shown in the memo. Total company full year pre-tax profit of $8.6 billion increased by $600 million from last year explained by the automotive sector. ","The key market factors and financial metrics for our total automotive business in the fourth quarter are shown on Slide 7. As previously mentioned, automotive fourth quarter profit was driven by continued strong performance in North America and record fourth quarter profit in Asia Pacific Africa.","Wholesale volume and revenue, both increased from a year ago. The higher volume primarily reflects higher industry volumes in all regions and higher market shares in North America and Asia Pacific Africa. Lower dealer stock increases this year compared with a year ago were a partial offset. The higher net revenue reflects favorable mix, higher net pricing and the volume increase. ","Operating margin of 3.1% was seven-tenth of a percentage point lower than a year ago while automotive pre-tax profit was $924 million, down $338 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, full year wholesale volume and revenue were higher than a year ago by 12% and 10% respectively. Operating margin at 5.4%, and total automotive pre-tax profit at $6.9 billion were also higher. ","Slide 8 shows the factors that contributed to the $400 million deterioration in total automotive fourth quarter pre-tax profit. Higher costs, mainly structural, and unfavorable exchange were offset partially by a favorable market factors in all regions. The cost increases mainly reflect investments for higher volume, growth and new products, both for this year and the future.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion lower than the third quarter, more than explained by higher costs, including the seasonal increase in structural costs as well as higher warranty costs in North America. You can find more details on the quarter-to-quarter change in Appendix 10.","Slide 9 shows fourth quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive. Automotive sector profit of $924 million was driven by North America and Asia Pacific Africa with losses in both South America and Europe. Other automotive is mainly net interest expense. ","On Slide 10, we show the factors that contributed to the $600 million improvement in total automotive full year pre-tax profit. Favourable market factors across all regions were offset partially by higher costs, mainly structural, and unfavourable exchange principally in South America. ","Full year pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown as Slide 11. North America and Asia Pacific Africa delivered record results while South America was about breakeven and Europe incurred a loss as expected.","All regions improved compared with a year ago with the exception of South America. Other Automotive reflects net interest expense, offset partially by fair market value adjustment of our investment in Mazda.","Now, we'll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector starting on slide 12 with North America. North America continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, driven by a strong industry, a robust full-size pickup segment, our strong product lineup, growth in U.S. market share, continued discipline in matching production to real demand and a lean cost structure even as we invested more in product and capacity for future growth.","As you can see in the two graphs on the left, North America wholesale volume and revenue grew modestly in the fourth quarter. The volume improvement reflects higher U.S. industry sales, increasing from a SAAR of 15.4 million to 16 million units and higher U.S. market share. Partial offsets were in favorable changes in dealer stocks and lower volume in non-U.S. markets.","The higher revenue primarily reflects the volume increase and favorable mix. North America operating margin was 7.6%, down eight tenths of a percentage point from last year, while pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion about $200 million lower than last year's record profit.","As shown in the memo below the chart, North America\u2019s full year wholesale volume and revenue both improved 11% compared with last year. Operating margin was 9.9%, half a percentage point lower than a year ago, while pre-tax profit was $8.8 million, up about $400 million.","On slide 13, we show the factors that contributed to North America\u2019s fourth quarter pre-tax profit decline of $200 million from last year. The higher costs, mainly warranty and structural, and lower net pricing were offset partially by favorable volume and mix. The higher warranty expense of about $300 million primarily reflects costs associated with the Escape 1.6 liter recall announced in the quarter.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit decreased compared with third quarter, more than explained by higher cost including a seasonal cost increase in structural cost with favorable market factors and exchange and partial offset. Ford\u2019s U.S. market share trends are shown on slide 14. Total U.S. market share and retail share of the retail industry, both improved in the fourth quarter and full year compared with the year ago. Both share metrics also improved compared with third quarter.","Starting with the left chart, our total U.S. market share was 15.4% in the fourth quarter, up one tenth of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by Fusion, F-Series and MKZ. Our share was up half a percentage point from third-quarter, explained primarily by higher Ford share of the fleet business as well as higher fleet mix of the total industry, which is typical in the fourth quarter.","As shown in the right chart, our retail market share of the retail industry was 14% in the fourth quarter, up four tenths of a percentage point from last year, more than explained by Fusion, F-Series and Escape. Our retail market share was up eight tenths of a percentage point from third quarter, more than explained by F-Series, Explore and Fusion.","And finally although not shown, we continue to have success with what we call super segment vehicles, small utilities and small to midsized cars, particularly on the coasts. Our full-year super segment market share was up eight tenths of a percentage point compared with last year with the coastal regions contributing three quarters of the improvement.","Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 15 and review South America where we are continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product lineup and progressively replacing legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. In the fourth quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased by 6% and 11% respectively from a year ago. The lower volume is more than explained by plant downtime in Brazil in preparation for new products in 2014 and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of U.S. dollars.","Our revenue decline in South America primarily reflects unfavorable exchange, volume and mix, offset partially by higher net pricing. Operating margin was negative 4.7% and pre-tax loss was $126 million. Both metrics deteriorated from last year\u2019s profitable results.","As shown in the memo below the chart, full year wholesale volume and revenue both improved 8% compared with last year. Operating margin was negative three tenth of a percent and the pretax loss was $34 million, both lower than positives results a year ago.","On Slide 16, we showed the factors driving the $271 million decline in South America\u2019s fourth quarter pre-tax result. Higher costs, unfavorable volume and mix, and unfavorable exchange were offset partially by higher net pricing. The higher net pricing reflects partial recovery of the adverse effects of high local inflation and weaker local currencies, along with pricing associated with the company's new products.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax result were $285 million lower than third quarter primarily explained by unfavorable volume and mix, higher cost and unfavorable exchange, higher net pricing with a partial offsets.","Let\u2019s turn now to Europe beginning on Slide 17. In the fourth quarter, we continue to implement our transformation plan for Europe. Europe\u2019s fourth quarter wholesale volume was down 3% from a year ago, but revenue improved 10%. The volume decrease is more than explained by unfavorable changes in dealer stocks and lower volume in markets outside the 19 markets in Europe that we tracked. Europe\u2019s higher revenue mainly reflects favorable mix.","Europe\u2019s operating margin was negative 8% and the pre-tax loss was $571 million, both improved from last year. As shown in the memo below the chart, Europe\u2019s full year wholesale volume and revenue were up less than 1% and 5% respectively from a year ago. Operating margin was negative 5.8% and the pre-tax loss was $1.6 million, both improved from a year ago despite higher restructuring costs of about $400 million, lower industry volume and unfavorable exchange.","Slide 18 shows the factors that contributed to the $161 million improvement in Europe\u2019s fourth quarter pretax results from a year ago. The improvement is explained by favorable market factors and several favorable items and other including higher parts and services profit, offset partially by unfavorable exchange and higher cost. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results declined $343 million compared with third quarter. This is more than explained by unfavorable onetime factors, a seasonal increase in cost as well as a seasonal reduction in parts and services profit, higher product and warranty cost and higher restructuring costs.","Europe market share trends are shown on Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, total market share was unchanged from a year ago. The retail share of the retail passenger car industry improved. Both share metrics deteriorated compared with third quarter reflecting primarily a seasonal decrease in the U.K. industry. ","Starting with the left chart, our total fourth quarter market share for the Europe 19 markets was 7.5% unchanged from a year ago. Full year market share is 7.8%, was now a one tenth of a percentage point mainly reflecting low availability of Mondeo, S-MAX and Galaxy in the first quarter.","As shown in the right chart, our passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 7.5% in the fourth quarter, up seven tenths of a percentage point from the same period last year. This retail improvement was underpinned by solid performance of Fiesta, C-MAX and Kuga. Full year market share at 8.2% was up one percentage point. Although not shown, our commercial vehicle market share for the full year at 9.2% was up seven tenth of a percentage point compared with the prior year and our highest share since 2007. In 2013, Ford was the fastest growing commercial vehicle brand and transit nameplate was the leader in the commercial van segment.","Let\u2019s now review Asia Pacific and Africa in Slide 20. Our strategy in Asia Pacific and Africa continues to each grow aggressively with an expanding portfolio of global One Ford products with manufacturing hubs in China, India and ASEAN. As shown on the left, fourth quarter wholesale volume was up 29% and net revenue which excludes our China JVs grew 16%. Our China wholesale volume not shown was up 45% in the quarter and about 50% for the full year. The higher volume in the region reflects mainly improved market share. Higher industry volume increasing from a SAAR of 33.1 million units to 38.1 million units and favorable changes in dealer stocks also contributed.","Our fourth quarter market share was 3.9%, half a percentage point higher than a year ago and a quarterly record. The improvement was driven by China where our market share improved half a percentage point to a record 4.4%, reflecting mainly strong sales of Ecosport and Kuga.","Asia Pacific Africa's higher revenue primarily reflects favorable volume and mix. Operating margins was 3.3% and pre-tax profit was $106 million, both higher than a year ago. This was the region\u2019s sixth consecutive quarterly profit and a fourth quarter record.","As shown in the memo below the chart, Asia Pacific Africa\u2019s full year wholesale volume and revenue improved 30% and 17% respectively compared with a year ago. Operating margin was 3.5% and pre-tax profit was $415 million both substantially improved from last year\u2019s results. The $67 million year-over-year improvement in Asia Pacific Africa\u2019s fourth quarter pre-tax profit is explained on Slide 21.","Market factors were favorable as was other mainly reflecting higher royalties from our joint ventures and an insurance recovery. Higher cost as we continue to invest for future growth were partial offset. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific Africa pre-tax profit was $20 million lower than third quarter more than explained by higher cost. Our favorable market factors were partial offsets.","Turning now to Ford Credit, Slide 22 shows the $46 million decrease in fourth quarter pre-tax profit compared with year ago. The decrease primarily reflects unfavorable residual performance related to lower auction values and lower financing margin, both in North America as well as credit loss reserve changes. Higher volume was a partial offset.","Ford Credit higher volume primarily in North America, was driven by in increase in leasing, reflecting changes in Ford's marketing program as well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher dealer stocks. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit\u2019s pretax profit was $59 million lower than third quarter.","Slide 23 provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit\u2019s full year profit compared with 2012. The improvement of $59 million is more than explained by higher volume, primarily in North America, driven by an increase in leasing reflecting changes in Ford's marketing programs, as well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher dealer stocks.","Partial offsets were higher credit losses due to lower credit loss reserve reductions in all geographic segments and unfavorable residual performance related to lower than expected auction values in North America.","Next on Slide 24 is our automotive growth cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive growth cash at the end of the quarter was $24.8 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion from the end of the third quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $500 million, more than explained by automotive profit.","During the quarter, we contributed $1.1 billion to our global funded pension plans, which included about $700 million of discretionary payments to our funded plans as part of our pension de-risking strategy.","Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $400 million and we concluded our compensation related share repurchase program for 2013. Full year automotive operating related cash flow was a record $6.1 billion and gross cash improved $0.5 billion.","Slide 25 shows the automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.7 billion, which is a $100 million lower than third quarter. We entered the year with net cash of $9.1 billion, $900 million lower than a year ago and automotive liquidity of $36.2 billion, $1.7 billion higher than a year ago.","Slide 26 provides our annual update on global pension plans. Worldwide pension expense in 2013, excluding special items was $1.6 billion, $400 million higher than 2012. Special item charges were about $800 million, including about $600 million associated with U.S salaried retiree voluntary lump sum payout program which had now concluded.","In 2013, we made $5 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, up $1.6 billion compared with year ago. In 2014, cash contributions to our funded plans are expected to be $1.5 billion globally, most of which is mandatory. This is $3.5 billion lower than last year reflecting our improved funding status.","Worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at year end 2013, about $6 million of which is associated with our unfunded plans. In total, this represents an improvement of nearly $10 billion compared with the year ago driven primarily by higher discount rates and our cash contributions. Consistent with our de-risking strategy, we continue to increase a mix of fixed income assets with the objective of reducing funded status volatility.","The fixed income mix in our U.S. plants at year end 2013 was 70%, up from 55% at year-end 2012. Asset returns in 2013 for U.S. plants was 3.7% reflecting strong growth asset returns offset partially by fixed income losses as interest rates rose. For 2014, our expected long term return assumption for the U.S. is 6.89% down about 50 basis points from a year ago reflecting higher fixed income allocations. ","Slide 27, summarizes our 2013 results of our planning assumptions and key metrics compared with the plan we shared at the beginning of the year. Overall we delivered strong results in 2013 meeting or fitting all operational and financial metrics with the exception of quality. Despite a challenging environment particularly in Europe and South America, we achieved total company pre-tax profit of $8.6 billion, one of the best full year results in our history. ","In Europe, we continue to implement our restructuring plan as we remain on track to return our business profitability in 2015. And in Asia Pacific, Africa, there are multiple proof points of the success of our growth strategy, record volume, revenue, market share and pretax operating profits. And we\u2019re continuing to invest heavily in the region to support even more growth, profitable growth in the years ahead. Importantly, we also generated record positive operating related cash flow. So again, 2013 was an outstanding year for Ford. ","With that let\u2019s turn it back to Allan who\u2019ll take us through 2014 outlook. Alan?","Alan Mulally","","Thank you, Bob. Slide 28 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% to 3% range and global industry sales to be in the 85 million to 90 million unit ranges. U.S. economic growth is projected to be in the 2.5% to 3% range with the industry sales supported our continued improvement in the housing sector and replacement demand as a result of the older areas of the vehicles on the road. Policy uncertainty now has reduced with the federal budget agreement and the Federal Reserve policy announcement in December. ","In South America, Brazil\u2019s economy is relatively weak with the low trend growth, while in Argentina and Venezuela there are escalating risk as both the economies are weak with unclear economic policy direction. In Europe, on the other hand, economic indicators are stabilizing. ","For 2014, we expect GDP growth of 1% in the Euro area and 2% in the UK. The European Central Bank goes passed the interest rate to quarter 0.25% in November and has indicated it will keep rates low for an extended period. ","The Bank of England also has indicated it will keep rates low until the unemployment rate has declined. In Asia Pacific and Africa, stable economic growth is expected this year. In China as it cherries out the structure reform transitions to a consumption lead economy. Growth in India is expected to improve modestly as the country moves beyond election uncertainty and a new government assures in more pro-growth economic policy. ","Overall, despite challenges, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2014.","Slide 29, summarizes our 2014 outlook for our automotive sector and Ford Credit. First, we expect North America to be strongly profitable, but at a lower level than 2013 with an operating margin ranging from 8% to 9%. This outlook reflects the impact of launching sixteen all new or significantly refreshed products. ","As a result, we expect production downtime for model changeovers to result in lower wholesale volume than in 2013. With regard to the all-new F-150, we\u2019re scheduling this year 11 weeks on production downtime including the summer shut down here at our Dearborn plant and two weeks including the summer shutdown at our Kansas City plant. We will provide additional information later this year about next year\u2019s Kansas City launch.","In North America, we also expect net pricing in 2014 to be slightly unfavorable, as we run out outgoing models and assume a continuation of a more competitive pricing environment for small and medium cars and utilities due to the weaker yen. We also expect higher manufacturing, engineering and spending related costs to support our launches as well as for the products and capacity actions that will be launched in later periods. And finally, North America will not benefit this year from dealer stock increases as it did in 2013.","In South America, results are expected to be about equal to 2013, or about breakeven. This outlook reflects improved profitability in Brazil and Argentina, offset by deterioration in Venezuela, including very low levels of production and our planning assumption that a major devaluation with a $350 million profit effect will occur in the first quarter. There are risks to this outlook, however, given the volatility of the situation in Venezuela and increasing risks in Argentina, where devaluation of the peso is accelerating and the government recently issued controls on vehicle imports.","In Europe, we expect reduced losses, including restructuring costs of about $400 million that will be reported in 2014 operating results. The European transformation plan continues to progress well and as mentioned earlier, Europe remains on track to achieve profitability in 2015. Our new Middle East and Africa business unit is expected to approach breakeven results in 2014.","In Asia Pacific, pre-tax profit is expected to be about the same as in 2013, reflecting continued investments to support growth in 2014 and beyond, a slower rate of revenue and volume growth than a year ago due to production constraints, a more competitive pricing environment, and finally, unfavorable results in Australia as we restructured the business and reflect the effects of a weakening Australian dollar.","Automotive net interest expense is expected to be about the same as 2013. And finally, Ford Credit expects pre-tax profit to be about equal to 2013. Profit from growth and receivables should offset continued normalization of credit losses, the continued run off of higher-yielding assets and the impact of Ford Credit's strategy to increases percentage of unsecured debt as we continue to build a stronger investment-grade company.","Ford Credit also expects managed receivables at year-end of about $110 billion, managed leverage to continue in the range of 8:1 to 9:1 and distributions to its parent of about $250 million. Now let\u2019s look at what this means for the total company on Slide 30 please.","For 2014, we project U.S. industry volume, including medium heavy trucks to range from 16 million to 17 million units. In Europe, we expect the range of 13.5 million to 14.5 million units. And in China, we expect volume to range from 22.5 million to 24.5 million units.","For our financial metrics, which are now aligned to the key drivers of total shareholder return, we expect automotive revenue to be about the same as 2013. Automotive operating margin to be lower, automotive operating related cash flow to be positive but substantially lower than 2013, including higher capital spending consistent with our mid-decade outlook of about $7.5 million. Pre-tax profit for Ford Credit is to be about the same as last year and company pre-tax profit, excluding special items, to range from $7 billion to $8 billion.","In 2014, we continue to invest to create innovative products such as the all-new F-150 to ensure Ford has the freshest and most attractive product lineup in the industry. At the same time, we are investing to expand our portfolio into new markets, as well as adding capacity, where appropriate, to satisfy increasing demand. As a result, this year will be a solid year for the company and a critical step forward in implementing our One Ford plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all.","Turning to Slide 31, in closing, our One Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, a comprehensive strategy, and relentless limitation. As results we announced today, we made clear, our One Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world and we are absolutely focused on building great products, creating a strong business and contributing to a better world.","2013 was an outstanding year for Ford, the fourth year in a row, including continued strong results from North America, breakeven results in South America, as we work to adjust to an uncertain environment in the region. Continued successful execution of our transformational plan for Europe as we work to return the profitability in 2015, continued strong road and record profitability in Asia Pacific and Africa, consistent performance from our Ford Credit operation which continues to deliver world class customer service and solid bottom line results and record breaking operating related cash flow which enabled us to continue to our pension derisking strategy resulting in a reduction of more than 50% of our global unfunded status. Now we\u2019d be pleased to take your questions. George?","George Sharp","Thanks, Alan. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two.","Julie, can we have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","You can indeed. And the first question from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much indeed, just a few questions. First could you take this opportunity to describe how the F-150 truck change over, given the 11 weeks of production downturn that you highlighted in the prepared remarks, how that can impact North American results this year by quarter even qualitatively? Any extra guide qualitatively could be very helpful given the potential for significant disruption quarter to quarter.","Robert Shanks","Sure, Adam. Okay Adam, it's 13 weeks in total. It\u2019s 11 at Dearborn and two at Kansas City. And I think it's first of all, stepping back. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that when you look at the decline year-over-year that we\u2019re expecting in North America\u2019s results, it\u2019s largely attributable to the F-Series. And that\u2019s probably about all we\u2019re going to say in terms of the financial affect of F-Series. In terms of [counterization], I\u2019m going to answer that somewhat differently because we didn\u2019t provide any specific commentary today on [counterization]. I was expecting that you guys would ask about that. I think it could atypical year and I think it\u2019s because of the product launches.","It's also because of the uncertainties around particularly South America from the emerging economies and the effect that they could have on us quarter-by-quarter because we said in New York and similar internal assumptions, we\u2019re assuming some sort of evaluation that will be able to reflect in Venezuela. But given the recent announcement from general government, they are not clear exactly how that would happen if they set up this two-tier network and how we\u2019d be able to capture that more accurate value of the currency and let that flow through to a devaluation. So I think it's going to be an atypical year and what I plan to do is as we go through these quarter and we kind of see where you guys are if we think we need to kind of nudge it one way or the other we'll try to find an opportunity to do that in the course of that quarter.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thanks Bob. Yeah, that would be very helpful given the potential disruption and of course to get the investors to kind of more think about 2015 and get some comfort this year, thanks. And just the second question then; on the Turkish Lira and the economy, can you guys remind us on your open position in Turkey. Are you net long or net short Lira given the export of transit and if so it maybe more simply, if the Lira were to weaken substantially or stay weak, does that help your exports more than it hurts your local sales in terms of translation of profits? Thanks.","Robert Shanks","Well, some of that depends on the degree to which we can price in Turkey for that. But I think what it probably means is that it will hurt the profitability of the Ford Otosan joint venture, but could have benefits or at least more balance if you want to cross Ford because so much of what they build in Turkey is exported back into Ford Europe.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","So you're not highlighting any particular direction. One way or the other would you say it\u2019s kind of balanced over all, the impact on the company?","","Robert Shanks","I think maybe slightly negative. We actually had some negative effects within the year-over-year performance in Europe related to the Turkish Lira.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks very much.","Robert Shanks","","Thanks Adam.","Operator","Thank you for that. (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please go ahead sir.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Talking about capacity actions and some of the cost of those both in our \u201814, for later years, wondering a couple of things. One just strategically given that we seem to be in era of cheap oil given the U.S. domestic production, ageing demographics and given that your planned capacity utilization seems to be running better in trucks, SUVs and in cars.","Are you thinking about cars any differently, the balance between cars, SUVs and truck any differently than you might have been say three or four years ago. And secondly, are any of these capacity actions to have SUV capacity or to make more of your factories flexible between the SUV and car variance of your platforms? Thanks.","Alan Mulally","You bet, Brian, Mark will take a lead on that.","Mark Fields","Well, I think, fundamentally as you know, as you see in the past, we view the price of fuel overtime to rise, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been so focused on fuel economy as a reason to buy for Ford. So I think we have not changed our view on that. I think, we\u2019re well positioned from a capacity standpoint. As you know, we\u2019ve been designing our manufacturing plans to be very flexible.","And also as the same time as we mentioned before, we now with our global One Ford products, we also have more flexibility on where that production comes from, depending upon the region. So I think we\u2019re comfortable with our assumptions right now and we have the flexibility if we see changes.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","So what are the capacity actions here contemplating?","Mark Fields","Well, as we said from our capacity standpoint here in North America, we have six facilities that will have some capacity actions this year. Globally, as we mention we\u2019re opening three plants this year, two in China, one in Brazil and that\u2019s part of overall in Asia Pacific or 10 plants we\u2019ve been building which we\u2019ve opened four so far and six to go. So as we grow the business, we think that we\u2019re making sure we have the appropriate amount of capacity and flexibility to use the assets to the greatest extent.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","So are you going to make more plants in North America flexible, let\u2019s say focus estate?","Mark Fields","Well, I think, majority of our plants are flexible here in the U.S. We\u2019ll talk about -- we won\u2019t get into additional details of what we\u2019re doing but clearly our whole approach of being able to match production to demand and do that flexibility as you see in a number of plants, we\u2019ll continue to walk on that path.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay. Thanks.","Mark Fields","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Market. Please go ahead.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just you guys have talked a lot in the past about the ongoing negative mix shift in North America and if we just reviewing the year that totaled about $1 billion this year during which where trucks significantly outpaced cargo. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense from you guys. Are we through the largest part of this year-over-year decline this year or does it actually get worst from 2013 looking ahead?","Robert Shanks","This is Bob. How are you today?","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","Good.","Robert Shanks","Good. Yeah. We did have a negative effect. Year-over-year, it wasn\u2019t as large as you indicate. I\u2019m just checking my factory here. We\u2019re looking on a year-over-year basis of about eight-tenths and only about six-tenths of that was mixed among vehicles which is what you're talking about.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","Okay.","Robert Shanks","And that was largely the fact that we had such great success with our super segment vehicles. S-series were less as a percent of the total. It actually grew it share of the segment and in the growing segment, so it's a big positive for us. So I think as we talk about this before, Joe, I think it\u2019s a positive. We\u2019re focused in a one element of change which is mixed but its more growth in total.","And so while the margins of those vehicles are as great as they are in the larger vehicles, it\u2019s more in total in terms of revenue and profitability and certainly helping our returns. And that is our plan going forward in terms of extending our portfolio and particularly focusing on all segments, not just trucks as we did historically.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","Stuart, would you classify where we are on that path along the shift as through the larger part of the steeper decline?","Stuart Rowley","I wouldn\u2019t expect to see that type of the set in 2014. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see in terms of what happens after that.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","Okay. And then just maybe point of clarification for me on the outlook. When you are talking about Asia Pacific about equal, is that what the actual printed results or I\u2019m assuming eventually we\u2019re going to get some sort of split up between with the Middle East and Africa being separated out. So maybe you could just pull out a little bit of clarification there? ","Alan Mulally","Yeah, that\u2019s with or without Middle East broken out; we probably would have given the same guidance.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","","Okay.","","Alan Mulally","And what we\u2019re planning that we\u2019re going to have a Ford University event later in the quarter and one of the things that we\u2019ll do and I think we\u2019re going to do this in the 10-Q as well as to provide some insights in terms of, what the impact of that changes on the affected business units.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Market","","Okay, thank you.","","George Sharp","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Matthew Stover - Guggenheim","","(Inaudible)","","Alan Mulally","We can't hear you, Matt?","George Sharp","We'll go on to the next question, Operator.","Operator","","Matthew Stover into the call.","","Alan Mulally","Matt are you there?","George Sharp","","Why don\u2019t we move to another analyst?","","Operator","","We have now John Murphy from Bank of America.","","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Good morning guys, can you hear me?","","Alan Mulally","You bet John, loud and clear.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","First question; as we moved in the declining in margin in North America from 2013 to 2014, you highlighted the F-150 as the major reason for the -- you had a change over there, it\u2019s the major reason for the decline. As we get into \u201815 and \u201816, are there any other structural factors you think are going on in the market or in the business that shouldn\u2019t allow you to get back to that 10% margin range we\u2019ve seen for the last two years?","","Alan Mulally","Well, we still think that the target of 8% to 10% that we\u2019ve talked about is appropriate. I think as we go forward, yeah, we just had the question from Joe I think, we\u2019ll see pressure from a higher mix of smaller vehicles and we talked about that before. The pressure from increasing cost to meet regulatory requirements and the extent to which we can price or not to recover those as well. And then as you recall in the discussion that we had in New York in December, we\u2019re building into \u201914, we wanted to see how long does it last, but we're building in a proper pricing environment because of the benefits that Japanese manufacturers have from a weaker Yen. That can change over time, but we kind of built that in going forward as well.","So we\u2019re still comfortable with 8% to 10%, but those are types of examples of factors that, sometimes we have quarter that's well over something like that, we all get excited and think that we\u2019re on a some new step level of performance in North America. It\u2019s these types of factors that we think are going to keep us in that 8% to 10% range.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","12% is a good number in a quarter. You get excited about even if it's just for a quarter.","","Alan Mulally","I would love to have that for and we agree.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Second question on the U.S. pension plan; I mean, given that you\u2019re now probably 5% underfunded or maybe even a little bit less than that and the trajectory of rates should be reasonably good for that funded status going forward. Do you think there is the potential to free this plan or potentially cut a deal with the UAW similar to what you did in 2007 with your Health Care Trust? ","It just seems like you're getting to a point where you have other parties that might be interested in taking this on and sort of taking it out of the company and really eliminating their risk in the equation. Just seems like, given that the funding status has improved so much, you might have some options on the table. Have you had those discussions or have you thought about potential structural solutions here now that you\u2019re getting closer to fully funded?","","Alan Mulally","No, we can comment on discussions that we may or may not be having with UAW on this. That would be private between us. It\u2019s true that -- we\u2019re finally -- the light isn\u2019t at the end of the tunnel in terms of the funded status and all of our global funded plans and we expect to get there by this decade. One thing I would say is John is that our objective is to get to a funding status on an economic basis, not just on a U.S. GAAP basis. So we have to go a little bit beyond in terms of what you\u2019d see from these data which are U.S. GAAP. But we\u2019re close.","I think what it really means is that we don\u2019t have to contribute as much over the next two or three years and we talked about that in December and now maybe about a billion to two a year, maybe at the low end of that range to get the fund status.","And then, of course, there are options, because once it\u2019s fully funded, you can think about some of the things that you\u2019ve talked about. There is always a premium involved in that. I don\u2019t know if that would make sense with one investor or cash and outlay, but it\u2019s certainly an option that we don\u2019t have any plans to do that at this time.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And if I could just sneak in one follow-up question on the F-150, traditionally when you go through a changeover that is large, there is a period, a quarter or maybe even few where there is an inventory buffer that\u2019s builds ahead of the changeover and then there is also some pricing actions ultimately to clear out that inventory.","Do you think that you are going to manage this launch differently than that sort of historical pattern where you actually might be in period where the inventory is really incredibly light or will you build this buffer? I\u2019m just trying to understand this because it is -- if it\u2019s a big issue because if you don\u2019t build that buffer, the industry can be wildly short of pickup trucks and pricing of pickup trucks should be very strong this year. So just really trying to understand if you are going to build that inventory buffer or not?","Alan Mulally","Well, I think, overall, John, it\u2019s a good question. As you know, we have a lot of experience with this going back to the current generation of our F-150 which we did about four, five years ago and then the new generation five years before that where we have staggered launches.","So I think what you are going to expect from us is we have assumptions obviously around the industry and around segmentation. So I think we are well-positioned from a stock standpoint to support dealers throughout the year. You may see some months where it might be a bit elevated depending upon the sales rate but we are manufacturing out our accessories of production this year and we feel comfortable with our assumptions.","George Sharp","Move on to the next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Alan Mulally","You bet, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","You touched on Argentina, obviously, it\u2019s still an evolving situation. But could you perhaps help us a bit more in the potential near-term negative impact, perhaps by relying maybe how much cash is in that country relative to, a place like Venezuela? And then, I am curious, if you see any potential longer term benefit, given that you export a lot of vehicles, I think, the folks from range from there to Brazil and other places too?","Alan Mulally","Ryan, your question actually highlights why we look at South America and what\u2019s going on now on it, just trying discuss exactly what\u2019s going to happen, because all those things are in play and it depends to the extend in which we comprise, it depends to the extend, the government could take other actions as they did in Venezuela.","We have been able to get cash out of Argentina away, we don\u2019t have the same type of exposure that, that we face in Venezuela, where we have been unable to get the cash out. We still have about $700 million of cash sitting in Venezuela, whereas in the case of Argentina cash at minimal impact our local balance sheet relative balanced. So don\u2019t take that issue.","There is also positive, I mean, the thing is interesting as Argentineans trying to store value and something that\u2019s more durable has actually created maybe a bit of the bubble in the overall industry, pricing has been good there recently and because people want to purchase their currency or their value and something car like a vehicle, so it\u2019s actually been a positive.","But, overall, clearly, now what we are seeing is much, much higher labor inflation, much, much higher level of devaluation, we will have to see how the government chooses to respond to that in term of any constraints they put on since we try to manage the business.","Longer term, we could make Argentina more competitive and as you point out we do export from there, so that would be a positive. But we just have to wait and see how all that mixes out with the time it is.","I think you have highlighted something, I wanted to underscore today, which is to repeat maybe with a bit more emphasis than what I even said in December, which is we have got an outlook for South America about the same as what we saw last year, but I would just underscore again the level of risk that we are going to have to manage particularly over the next few months in Argentina and Venezuela.","We expect to see how that all sorts out. I would remain you we have been in Argentina 100 years, so we have been through this before, but it takes a lot of work, we have got folks no matter even that type of environment.","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Okay. Very helpful and interesting. Then just second and last question, I understand that you just increase your dividend sizably, but also that $36 billion in liquidity your $6 billion over your target with a lot of your outside pension contributions now behind you. So how should we think about the timeline of progressing toward your $30 billion target? Thank you.","Robert Shanks","Yeah. We will go back to what we have talked about in August as the conference relate on our cap strategy. We still have ahead of us about $6 billion reduction in automotive debt, so if you remember we talked about getting down to about 10 and we\u2019re 15 -- 157 I think at the end of last year, so that's got to be handled. Going back to the earlier answer on pensions, we still have $1billion to $2 billion a year over the next two or three years, can manage there. We also -- I'll remind you we\u2019ve got the -- one of the large convertibles that needs to be taken care towards the end of this year that we worked about a $1.6 billion or so depends on the stock price to take care of that if we were to use cash as opposed to stock and so that option is on the table. So I think if you take all those together, you\u2019re going to find us getting down to $36 billion and cash $20 billion to $21 billion.","","Ryan Brinkman - J.P. Morgan","Great, thanks.","","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.","","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everybody. ","Alan Mulally","Hey Rod. ","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","You mentioned earlier and said this maybe a week or two ago that you\u2019re looking to expand capacity at six plants in North America. Can you clarify is F-150 among the products that you\u2019re looking to build capacity for you basically holding at the three shifts capacity at two plants?","Alan Mulally","Mark?","Mark Fields","","Yeah. Rod. We'll just reiterate on the F-150. As you know we had a third crew on Kansas City last year. So that is not one of the plants. There were weak in their capacity, we have sufficient amount of capacity at the F-Series plants. It\u2019s really some of our other plants and some of it is adding capacity, some of it is changing line rates and those type of things. ","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. So if you were thinking about the drivers of North American earnings beyond 2014, obviously the thirteen weeks of downtime for F-Series doesn\u2019t recur an opportunity for truck volume beyond that or you basically kept out and is there an opportunity to improve contribution margins or is that something that you would think as more difficult given the regulatory requirements?","Robert Shanks","","I think -- this is Bob. I think we\u2019ll see -- our expectations are that we\u2019ll see industry growth. We\u2019re still making investments in products that could include expansion in the portfolio, we'll have to wait and see. And we\u2019re working to strengthen the brand and to make sure that we can get more out of every unit that we sell in terms of revenue. So I think -- and of course F series getting a back up to speed after the changeover to the all-new F-150, obviously will put that back on track. So I think it just -- it\u2019s growth across the entire portfolio supported by a growing industry.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And just lastly, structural costs grows quite a bit in 2013 and historically you\u2019ve given us some feeling for magnitude and regional increases and structural cost. Do you have any thoughts you can pass along for 2014?","Robert Shanks","","Yeah, I think we\u2019ll see another year of increase in structural cost as we continue to grow across the world. It just will be quite to a level that we saw in 2013.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. All right, thank you.","Robert Shanks","","Thanks, Rod.","","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of George Galliers from the ISI Group. Please go ahead sir.","George Galliers - ISI Group","","Yeah, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I had two questions on Europe, firstly, you\u2019re making big strides in retail share, but commented that the course was weaker sequentially dude to a seasonal slowdown in the UK. How much of your retail share gain is down you exposure to the UK, which is clearly been outperforming and therefore not structural and how -- what do you see as a sustainable level of retail share going forward?","Alan Mulally ","","Yeah, I don\u2019t know the answer right off the top of my head. As you know, we have a higher share in the UK than we do on average across Europe. So certainly the fact that the UK industry has outperformed the rest of Europe has benefited us. But, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a major part of the share increase at all, it\u2019s largely due to the retail focus that we\u2019ve had in Europe and across a number of different vehicles including Fiesta Kuga, we\u2019ve got Eureka Ford sport coming in and so forth. So I think it\u2019s largely around the focus of the team, the new products that we\u2019re rolling out, 40% to 45% of the lineup was new this year in terms of what we told. So I think that\u2019s a bigger driver than the effects of the UK although that actually didn't help us. ","Robert Shanks","","I would just also add on the second part of your question on growing our retail shares going forward. It\u2019s all based obviously on getting great product to customers and you\u2019ve heard in the past our 25 vehicles that we\u2019ve been launching in the last five years. So we launched 11 last year, we are going to launch 12 this year. So that gives you a little indication of the product part of the plan and how we are supporting new products to the marketplace. A little over 40% of the sales in cost lining Europe in 2013 was from new products or significantly refreshed products.","And when you look at our order banks, December year-over-year it\u2019s up about slightly less than 30%. So we feel as long as we can continue to deliver these great products to customers, we are very encouraged by the response from them. And importantly our dealers are feeling more encouraged. They improved their profitability last year and also importantly they have stepped up and over 2,500 dealers have agreed to upgrade their facilities over the next year or two. So they are also very encouraged in anticipation of the growth.","And finally from a brand standpoint, getting back to our Europe transformation plan around product brand and costs. On the brand front, the brand is getting stronger based on the metrics that we see. Pricing is improving versus the competitors. And as you know, we\u2019ve gotten our stocks in line, particularly along the lines of self-funded stocks which are down significantly resulting in our brand.","George Galliers - ISI Group","Excellent. That all sounds very positive. Actually just sort of accelerating on from start, my second question was could you provide some color on your European forecast where you have production down slightly year-on-year in Q1? It just seems a bit conservative to me given stock today is around 5% higher than Q1 last year and as you mentioned your stock levels are down considerably based year-on-year and sequentially.","Alan Mulally","Well, right now when you look at our stock levels, they are broadly in line with our plan. Obviously it\u2019s part of our process. We look at the sellers, both across Europe and within each country on a monthly basis when we make appropriate production changes. So we will stick exactly to our plan of matching production to demand and as we see the industry, potentially as it picks up we will produce more and if now or just our stocks accordingly. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yeah. The next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Alan Mulally","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Bob, just a point of clarification, with the improvement in the pension in 2013, can you provide any outlook for pension expense in 2014, any thoughts with North America and international if you have it?","Robert Shanks","","As you saw on the slide 26, the pension expense was $1.6 billion. We expect that to be lower in 2014, reflecting the improved tonnage status.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Okay. And expect to be more in North America given the contributions, or would that improvement be a bit more broad based geographically?","Robert Shanks","Mainly, North America and Europe.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Okay. Perfect. And then just the second question, hopefully we could do a bit more of a big bucket walk into the profit outlook for Europe in 2014. I know you\u2019ve had some slight market growth assumption. I think there is maybe a $50 million tailwind from lower restructuring. Any other big buckets in terms of what you are expecting, or are you kind of modeling in for pricing and maybe, other cost buckets we should think about for Europe in 2014?","Robert Shanks","Just very broadly, I mean, the way that I would think about Europe and I would put into any dimension the actual improvement that we are looking at, at least not at this point in time. But we are going to see positive market factors in Europe in 2014. And we would expect that to be both and sort of more on the mix and I think we will do better on net pricing. Going to back to Mark\u2019s comments around all the new products as well as the fact that the markets seems to be slightly turning, which is going to help a bit. We don\u2019t expect to see too much change in total one cost and so one of that will just flow through.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. (Operator Instructions) We are now switching to media. (Operator Instructions) First question comes from the line of Craig Trudell from Bloomberg News. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig Trudell - Bloomberg News","Hi, good morning. I have a question related to the guidance for pricing for North America and the comments about the Yen. Ford has been pressuring the government to include some provisions related to currency issues in the TPP trade deal. I wonder to what extent you can talk about just how respective you\u2019re sort of feeling -- how receptive the regulators are about to that as they work on this deal?","Alan Mulally","Craig, this is Alan. We\u2019re very positive with the response and discussions that are taking place, which is clearly the awareness of the global interdependencies and the importance of global rule based trading is really, really becoming clear to everybody. So, currency discipline and having the markets set the currency rates is going to be very well understood and the importance of it. So we are very pleased about the dialogue that is going on now, as you pointed out with TPP.","Craig Trudell from Bloomberg News","","Great, thank you.","","Alan Mulally","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle from Detroit Free Press. Please go ahead.","","Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press","","Good morning, gentlemen. Can you hear me?","","Alan Mulally","We can Alisa, it sounds good.","Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press","Excellent. I just wanted to ask, you were saying that basically all of your metrics were met except for quality. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re able to quantify sort of how far off you are and more importantly how you would -- are addressing up for 2014 and now you think this year will be better on that front?","Mark Fields","","Hi Alisa, it\u2019s Mark. When you look at our quality performances, as we mentioned the three big areas where we\u2019ve talked about before in North America around MyFord Touch and transmissions and [some security items], we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, interestingly enough, significant progress on MyFord Touch. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen a much higher take rate of MyFord Touch. So that has tempered our improvement that we\u2019ve seen there. I can tell you that we\u2019re all intensely focused on continuing to improve our quality, not only hear in the U.S. of course during the year, we have a lot of launches, but when you look in South America we had some issues at the end of 2012. We think we\u2019re through that. We\u2019ve had very good performance in Europe as well as Asia Pacific. So we\u2019re just going to stay intensely focused on that and keep listening to our customers and improving our quality. We\u2019re absolutely committed to that.","","Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press","","Because it\u2019s -- with the focus that has been coming down from the top for a number of years and as you say this is going to be an even tougher year. So I don\u2019t know -- just try to figure out what changes to tackle it?","Alan Mulally","I think (inaudible) -- as we mentioned consistent commitment to this. Joe Hendrix and the North American team are very focused on this particularly around the launches as well as the implants controllable. We\u2019re very confident, we\u2019re working on the right items and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel from The Detroit News. Please go ahead sir. Seems to be some interference on the caller\u2019s line. Karl, are you there?","","Karl Henkel - The Detroit News","I am, yes.","Operator","Please go ahead, sir.","Karl Henkel - The Detroit News","","Sorry about that. The pie chart that normally is on Slide 1 of your presentations and the breakdown between Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific and Africa, I\u2019m just wondering with the Middle East and Africa breakout now, how we should kind of view that break down moving forward. And then the second question is, we brought in the F-Series and more on the powertrain side. I know you\u2019re adding the new EcoBoost engine for the lineup, but I haven\u2019t quite heard, are you saying anything about where that incremental production is going to come in at and how you\u2019re going to -- I guess worked at situation during the kind of extended crossover from this generation to the next generation.","","Alan Mulally","Karl, I\u2019ll take the, kind of the first one and Mark can maybe help you out in the F-Series question. I think the way to think about Middle East and Africa and obviously we'll talk more about that as the year progresses. Is this maybe about 70%, 80% the size of South America in terms of the industrial volume? We\u2019ve had about 5%, 5.5% market share. So when you think about where the volume will come from, you\u2019ll see some volume coming from our North America and that was largely going towards Middle East. So we will see some volume coming out of Europe because that volume largely was going into North Africa and into Israel, and other parts of Middle East and then you\u2019ll see some volume coming out of Asia Pacific Africa and as far as the Ranger, that was exported from both AAT and Thailand and a little bit in South Africa.","So that will all collect into what is -- but will be our new business unit in Middle East and Africa. So it was only about, maybe 250,000 units to 20,000 units something of that range and you break it among the three, it\u2019s not going to have a big effect immediately. What we are really targeting is the huge growth opportunity. That region was about 3 billion of customers that represents in the year ahead. If there is (inaudible) income continued to rise.","Alan Mulally","And, Carl, the second part of your question is part of the [Escape\u2019s] launch capability. We stressed capability, so we have the four new powertrain, like two of all new when you mentioned the 27, our EcoBoost. We have a new V-6, naturally aspirated and of course the 5-liter as well as the 3.5-liter EcoBoost. So from the manufacturing standpoint, we\u2019re not going to discuss the 2.7 today but we will in the future as we get closer to the launch.","","Karl Henkel - The Detroit News","Thank you.","Alan Mulally","Thanks, Carl.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey from the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","Hi. Good morning everybody. I, mainly just wanted to ask the question and maybe Bob, or anyone who want to take this. In terms of the heavy investment cycle for new products, you have a large meat of the share. If we were to look out over the next couple of years, it\u2019s just your heaviest year for big investments around the world and will it ease up in the next couple years after this, or are you going to stay on this kind of levels investment for a few years out?","Robert Shanks","Well, what we\u2019ve guided is, with the mid decade about $7.5 billion of CapEx for years and months, we would expect to the years ahead. That will fluctuate little bit around that and as we find more and more growth opportunities, hopefully, I hope we have the chance to invest more into even more growth and that\u2019s actually what happened on June \u201911. And June 11, we guided to $6 billion.","And as we understood the opportunities of the ONE Ford plan, we just found so many more ways in which we were going to be able to drive the business growth slower and that, results in the increase in spending. But I think $7.5 million plus or minus over the next two to three years is probably about right.","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","In terms of the cash flow growth, I\u2019m curious whether the cash flow situations expected to maybe improve out after this year in terms of positive net cash flow?","Robert Shanks","Yeah, I would expect that.","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","Okay. Cool. Thanks.","Robert Shanks","Thanks Mike. That thing is very helpful. Great summary, Mike.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin from Associated Press. Please go ahead.","Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press","Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. On slide 23, Bob, you talked about unfavorable residual and lower than expected auction values impacting Ford Credit. Can you just explain that a little bit, what was going on there?","Robert Shanks","Yeah. I\u2019ll give a brief comment and then, Mike Seneski can fill in. When you look at what happened, this is largely -- if you look at the previous slide, it all happened in the fourth quarter. And part of what happened is we had a reduction in auction values, but also what you had -- last year, if you remember we had hurricane Sandy that really devastated northeast. And the northeast is an area of high lease take rates. And so that storm had the affect of creating, if you were a little bubble if you will have auction values. Now the year-over-year basis, we kind of normalized versus that and so on a comparative basis, you're seeing a big decline. I think that explains lot of what Mike supplements.","Mike Seneski","That\u2019s exactly right, Bob. Overall, the industry for late model used vehicles was down pretty substantially and is because you\u2019ve got a strange comparison. Hurricane Sandy really increased values for those vehicles, not only in the fourth quarter of 2012 but also in the first quarter of 2013. So we don't think this signals any type of bad news trend for our residuals and we will keep a good watch on it going forward.","Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press","Okay. Thank you. That helps us plan. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Joann Muller from Forbes.","Joann Muller - Forbes","[Ian] asked exactly the question I was going to ask. So thank you very much. That\u2019s all. ","Operator","We now go back to the investors\u2019 questions. And the first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Wanted to ask you a point of clarification on the tax rate in the quarter. Obviously you had a big tax benefit which you excluded from the operating results. But given the operating results, it looks like the tax charge was quite low. I apologize if you (inaudible) already. But could you please explain what happened?","Robert Shanks","No, on the operating side, we had a benefit from a change in our repatriation plans of distributions from Ford Credit outside the U.S. So we have booked (inaudible) assumption that we would make that repatriation but we didn\u2019t through some restructuring in Europe leaving the cash there. So that enabled us to -- we had to reverse that, if you will, into the fourth quarter. ","The other thing that happened on the special front, which is about $2.1 billion good news which as you said was not included in the operating, about $1 billion of (inaudible) have to do with investments in our European legal entities which enabled us to increase our deferred tax assets. And then in addition to that, we had about $440 million, good news that was a tail of what we did back in December of 2011. At that time, we released most of our valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets but not all. The ones we didn\u2019t release were largely related to U.S. state and local income taxes. And (inaudible) concluded that as we look ahead that we\u2019re going to be able to utilize those assets that we have released valuation allowance against that which enable to defer tax assets that show up, if you will, on the balance sheet and flow-through income. So those two explain largely $2.1 billion. ","Alan Mulally","And what I would like to do is answer my own question. So my own question is, why are your results in the fourth quarter in Europe so much worse than the third quarter, as I kept waiting for someone to ask the question. Since you didn\u2019t, I am going to ask it for you. And the answer, as I said, is largely around the fact that -- and this has been (inaudible) couple. We had about $110 million of a number of different one-time [comp clean-up] factors that occurred in the fourth quarter. We had about $50 million to $60 million of favorable tax in the third quarter which I did not highlight, because it\u2019s not material, we normally wouldn\u2019t talk about something that\u2019s small (inaudible) getting caught on a quarter-to-quarter basis, going from favorable to unfavorable. But about 50% of the impact -- and this is about $115 million or so of seasonality, so it\u2019s about 34% of the difference, which is largely a cost but also there is a seasonal effect in Europe in terms of how the profitability of parts and service. So that basically explains most of it and the balance is related to higher restructuring in the fourth quarter versus the third.","So I wanted to tell you that because I know that, that\u2019s probably going to be a question that you guys will be coming back and talking to George and John as a team, I just wanted to get it out there publicly so that they could talk with you about that.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","All right. Well that was not going to be my second question. But so still very helpful. Just wanted to get back on the North American margin guidance, I understand that you will provide some helpful guidance throughout the year to help us in the right direction. But when I think about the full year number of 8% to 9% margin and the fact that your downtime seems to be more weighted towards the second half, how much below this 8% to 9% can margin be in any given period?","Alan Mulally","I would not provide any guidance on that. But I would like to maybe share one other thing with you that maybe will help you guys as you\u2019re thinking about the first quarter. One of the things that we\u2019ve noted is that in general you guys are expecting higher wholesales relative to production than what we are seeing. And I just wanted to let you know that we expect to see bigger gap between production and wholesales in North America in the first quarter than what you\u2019re presently expecting on average. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve got increased export, some of that is a phenomenon of Middle East that I talked about which those units now no longer will be in wholesales for North America at least the ones that they send over and that will be joined us in Middle East and Africa. And we also have normal inventory so far in the year end shutdown. So just wanted to make your guys aware of that as we\u2019re kind of looking at your analysis, which we do.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Right. Thanks for your answer and thanks for your question.","Operator","Thank you.","Alan Mulally","I hope I answered my own question.","George Sharp","Thank you. Okay. With that, we\u2019ll wrap today\u2019s session. I\u2019d like to thank everyone and we\u2019re really glad that you\u2019re able to join us.","Operator","Thank you, George.

Please proceed.","George Sharp","Thank you, Katina, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I'd like to thank you for spending time with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our fourth quarter and full year 2001 (sic) [ 2011] financial results. Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford Motor Co.; and Lewis Booth, Chief Financial Officer. Also in attendance are Bob Shanks, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. ","Before we begin, I'd like to cover a few items. Copies of today's -- this morning's press release and the presentation slides that we'll be using today have been posted on Ford's investor and media website for your reference. The financial results discussed today are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-K that will be filed next month.

With that, I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Ford's President and CEO, Mr. Alan Mulally.","Alan R. Mulally","Thank you, George, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our fourth quarter and full year business performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our plan. We also will share with you this morning our major assumptions and key metrics for 2012. ","Let's start by turning to Slide 3. Our fourth quarter results reflect higher volume and net revenue, the 10th consecutive quarterly pretax operating profit and positive Automotive operating-related cash flow. In the quarter, North America drove our Automotive profitability with strong performance. However, since the third quarter earnings call, the deteriorating external environment impacted most of our Automotive operations outside of North America. In addition, commodity costs, exchange rates and the floods in Thailand all had a greater-than-expected adverse impact. As a result, our margins were somewhat lower than the guidance we provided in October. ","In 2011, we improved total company pretax operating profit and improved Automotive operating-related cash flow, enabling us to further strengthen our balance sheet. In addition, Ford Credit continued to perform strongly, providing significant contribution to our overall profit, consistent with our guidance. ","During the quarter and throughout the year, we continued to invest for future growth in a stronger product lineup around the world. Turning to 2012, we expect to continue improving our business and delivering solid profits and strong Automotive operating-related cash flow while working to strengthen our operations in Europe and South America and continue to grow. We believe our 2011 performance, as well as our guidance for 2012, confirm that we are well on track to achieve the mid-decade outlook we provided in the middle of last year. ","Let's look more closely now at the financial highlights for the quarter and full year 2011.  Slide 4 summarizes our fourth quarter and full year business results compared with a year ago. In the fourth quarter, vehicle wholesales were 1.4 million units, up 38,000 units or 3% from 2010. Revenue was about $35 billion, an increase of about $2 billion or 6%. Pretax operating profit, excluding special items, was $1.1 billion, $189 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.20 per share. Net income attributable to Ford was $13.6 billion. This includes a favorable special item in our taxes totaling $12.4 billion, reflecting the release of almost all of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We also had a favorable pretax special items of $349 million. Earnings were $3.40 per share. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $700 million, the seventh consecutive quarter of positive performance. In the full year compared with the year ago, vehicle wholesales increased by 7% and revenue improved by 13%. ","Full year pretax operating profit, excluding special items, was $8.8 billion, a $463 million improvement, and income attributable to Ford was $20.2 billion, $13.7 billion higher than a year ago, reflecting mainly the tax valuation allowance release. Operating-related cash flow was $5.6 billion for the year. We ended 2011 with $22.9 billion of Automotive gross cash and with Automotive gross cash exceeding debt by $9.8 billion. This is a net cash improvement of $8.4 billion compared with a year ago and $1.7 billion higher than the third quarter. Despite a challenging external environment, we had a good fourth quarter and a strong full year, reflecting the strength of our business and our ONE Ford plan. ","Slide 5 recaps our key highlights in the fourth quarter, as well as some of the many things we accomplished throughout 2011 as we executed our ONE Ford plan. We continued to introduce strong products in the fourth quarter, launching the new global Ranger and 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine. We also debuted the all-new Ford Escape. ","2011 was our third straight year of higher U.S. market share. Ford brand market share also increased by 3 points over the same period. We finished 2011 with higher share in Asia-Pacific and Africa. And in Europe, we have reported 3 consecutive quarters of year-over-year market share gain. ","In October, we reached a new full year agreement with UAW that improves our U.S. competitiveness. We announced 2011 profitsharing for eligible hourly workers, and in December, we announced that we will resume paying a quarterly dividend. ","Included in our 2011 results, we now have 2 consecutive years of more than $8 billion in pretax operating profit, as well as 3 consecutive years of improved annual operating profit. We reduced Automotive debt by $6 billion and increased our Automotive cash net of debt to $9.8 billion by year end. ","Finally, we continued our aggressive growth plans by breaking ground on 4 new assembly and powertrain plants in Asia-Pacific and Africa and by launching our new FordSollers joint venture in Russia. ","Now I'd like to turn it over to Lewis, who will provide more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Lewis?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Thanks, Alan. Let's start with Slide 7, which shows our financial results compared to the year ago. Since Alan already summarized the results, I'll focus on onetime special items included in our results. ","Pretax special items in the fourth quarter were a positive $349 million. This includes a $401 million gain related to the sale of our Russian operations to the newly created FordSollers joint venture, which began operations on October 1. Within our benefit from income taxes, there was a favorable onetime noncash special item of $12.4 billion related to the release of almost all of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Given the magnitude of the impact related to the release of the valuation allowance, let me provide some additional insights on the next slide. ","In Slide 8, we began to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in 2006, reflecting large cumulative losses incurred, as well as our financial outlook at the time. Consistent delivery over the past few years of strong improvements in our business results now supports the release of almost all of the valuation allowance, resulting in the favorable onetime noncash special item of $12.4 billion in the fourth quarter, improving both after-tax profit and equity. ","Going forward, this change is expected to result in ongoing operating tax rates of about 30%, although our cash tax payments will not be affected, remaining at low levels for a number of years. To allow for appropriate future period-to-period comparisons of our non-GAAP operating after-tax results and earnings per share, we now are expressing our 2011 quarterly and full year tax expense as if the valuation allowance had not existed as of the start of the year. This does not, however, affect results reported in line with U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the appendix for details. ","While this action is a matter of following accounting guidance, it also is a significant milestone in our restructuring, underscoring the steady and sustained progress in our turnaround. It's also a strong indication of the confidence we have in our future results. ","So let's now turn to Slide 9, where we look at our pretax results by sector. Total company fourth quarter pretax profits of $1.1 billion reflects positive contributions from our Automotive and Financial Services sectors. As shown in the memo, total company pretax operating profit decreased by $189 million compared to 2010. Compared to the third quarter 2011, total company pretax profit also declined. Total company full year pretax profit of $8.8 billion reflects strong results from both sectors. And compared to last year, total company improved, driven by $1 billion improvement in the Automotive sector and Financial Services delivering strong results, although lower than last year, in line with our guidance. ","Slide 10 highlights the key market factors and financial metrics for our total Automotive business. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue both increased compared with the year-ago period, but pretax operating profit at $586 million decreased by $155 million. Operating margin was 2.2%, down 0.8 percentage point from a year ago, and this includes an adverse effect of 1.9 points from higher commodity costs, including the hedging losses. ","Full year wholesale volume, revenue and pretax operating profit were higher than the year-ago period, but operating margin at 5.4% was down 0.7 point. Higher commodity costs reduced our margin by 1.8 points. ","Slide 11 summarizes the decrease in total Automotive fourth quarter pretax profits compared with 2010 by causal factor. We had strong performance in market factors. That is volume, mix and net pricing. ","We're actually improving $1.8 billion despite production losses in Asia-Pacific and Africa due to the Thailand floods. This is more than offset by higher costs, which included commodity costs across all regions; our contingent compensation costs, such as the onetime ratification bonuses and profitsharing in North America related to the UAW agreement as previously disclosed; and unfavorable exchange. ","Slide 12 summarizes the $700 million decrease in fourth quarter total Automotive pretax profit compared to the third quarter by causal factor. Market factors were positive, driven by favorable volume and mix, mainly favorable dealer stock changes in North America, while stock levels across the globe are at an appropriate level, consistent with our practice in matching supply with demand. This was more than offset by a normal seasonal increase in structural costs and the higher compensation cost in North America. ","Slide 13 shows fourth quarter pretax results for each of our Automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. Our Automotive pretax operating profit of $586 million was led by our North American operation, with South America also reporting a profit. Europe and Asia-Pacific and Africa incurred losses. The loss in Other Automotive of $138 million reflected mainly net interest expense. ","Slide 14 summarizes the $1 billion improvement in total Automotive full year pretax profits compared with 2010 by causal factor. The profit improvement was driven by strong performance in market factors and lower net interest expense, offset partially by higher costs, high compensation cost in North America and unfavorable exchange. Within the increase in contribution cost of $4.2 billion, $2.3 billion, or about 55%, is attributable to higher commodity costs. Structural costs increased by $1.4 billion, which is lower than prior guidance, as we continue to identify and achieve efficiency. These cost increases include the effect of higher volumes, new product launches and investments to support our future product capacity and brand building plans. ","Slide 15 shows full year pretax results for each of our Automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. Total Automotive pretax profit of $6.3 billion was led by a $6.2 billion profit from our North American operation. South America earned a solid profit, while Europe was about breakeven and carrying a small loss, driven by the economic uncertainty in the region. Asia-Pacific and Africa incurred a loss as well, more than explained by the impact of the Japan and Thailand natural disasters. The loss in Other Automotive reflects net interest expense and fair market valuation adjustments, mainly for our investments in Mazda. ","In 2012, we expect net interest to be about the same as 2011. While interest expense will be reduced through our debt reductions, the effect of lower interest rates will lower interest income. ","Turning now on Slide 16 to our Automotive business in North America. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue increased compared with the year ago, improving 13% and 14%, respectively. Pretax operating profit and margin improved despite an adverse impact on the operating margin of 2 percentage points due to higher commodity costs. U.S. industry SAAR increased compared with the year ago, but our U.S. total market share declined by 0.1 percentage point. Full year wholesale volume, revenue and pretax profits were higher than in 2010. Operating margin declined 0.1 percentage point. This includes the adverse impact of 2 points due to higher commodity costs. ","Slide 17 shows the $200 million improvement in fourth quarter North America pretax results compared with 2010 by causal factor. Market factors improved compared with last year by $1.6 billion, including a favorable stock adjustment of $500 million. Total costs increased by $1 billion, mostly explained by higher commodity, warranty and freight costs. Other includes higher compensation costs, such as the onetime ratification bonuses and profitsharing related to the UAW agreement, as previously discussed. As shown in the memo, pretax profit decreased by $700 million compared with the third quarter, reflecting normal seasonal increases in structural cost, higher compensation cost and increased warranty cost. Favorable volume mix is a partial offset. ","As we look ahead to this year, we expect North America to continue to be the core of our Automotive operations, with improved profitability for full year 2012 compared with 2011. ","Slide 18 shows our U.S. market share. U.S. total market share in the fourth quarter of 16.3% was down 0.1 percentage point compared with the same period last year but equal to the third quarter. Our retail share of the U.S. retail industry in the fourth quarter, estimated at 14.2%, is up 0.1 point from a year ago, and our share was unchanged from the third quarter. In the full year, our U.S. total market share improved by 0.1 point, with the Ford brand improvements of 0.8 percentage point more than offsetting the discontinuation of Mercury. Our U.S. retail share of the retail industry was unchanged. ","Now let's turn to South America on Slide 19. Fourth quarter wholesale volume declined 13% compared with a year ago, while revenue was unchanged. Pretax and operating margin both declined. South American industry SAAR and Ford share both were lower than a year ago, with the share decline due to increased competitive pressures. Full year wholesale volume and revenue increased compared with a year ago. Pretax profits and operating margins declined. ","Slide 20 shows a $173 million decrease in fourth quarter South American pretax results compared with 2010 by causal factor. The lower profit is explained primarily by unfavorable exchange and higher costs and essentially all of the total cost increase driven by higher commodity cost. And as shown in the memo, pretax profit decreased by $168 million compared with the third quarter, reflecting mainly unfavorable exchange and higher structural costs. ","Looking ahead, the competition in South America is intensifying, with substantial capacity increase planned by a number of companies and new entrants. Against this background, we expect our South American operation to continue to generate solid profitability for 2012, although somewhat lower than 2011. We are continuing to work on actions to strengthen our competitiveness in the changing environment. These actions include fully leveraging our ONE Ford plan, including the introduction of an all-new lineup of global products over the next 2 years, starting in the second half of 2012. ","Slide 21 covers Ford of Europe. Fourth quarter wholesale volume declined 2%, while revenue increased slightly compared with a year ago. The pretax loss and operating margin were lower than a year ago. Industry SAAR for the 19 markets we track was lower, while our fourth quarter market share improved 0.3 point, primarily driven by C-MAX. Full year wholesale volume improved slightly compared with a year ago, while revenue increased by about 15%. Both pretax profit and operating margin declined, with higher commodity costs contributing a negative 1.5 points to the European full year margin. ","Slide 22 shows the $139 million decline in fourth quarter Europe pretax results compared with 2010 by causal factor. In a difficult external environment, market factors include -- sorry, in a difficult external environment, market factors, including net pricing, were favorable compared with the same period in 2010. Contribution cost increased by $225 million, approximately half of which is due to commodity costs, and this was offset partially by structural cost improvements. Other reflects continued investments in our Craiova facility in preparation for the production volume ramp-up in 2012, as well as lower joint venture profits. ","As shown in the memo, fourth quarter pretax results improved $116 million compared to the third quarter, driven mainly by favorable volume and mix. The external environment in Europe is uncertain and is likely to remain so for some time. Given the challenges in Europe, we will continue to review, take and accelerate actions to strengthen and improve our business. This will include the full leveraging of ONE Ford plan in our global resources. ","And now, let's turn to Asia-Pacific and Africa on Slide 23. All the fourth quarter key metrics were impacted adversely by the Thailand flooding. Asia-Pacific and Africa's industry SAAR was lower than a year ago, more than explained by China, and our fourth quarter market share was unchanged. ","Full year wholesale volume and revenue increased, but we incurred a pretax loss compared with a profit a year ago, and a lower operating margin. ","Slide 24 shows a $106 million decrease in fourth quarter Asia-Pacific and Africa pretax results compared to 2010 by causal factor. Pretax profit declined due to the impact of the Thailand flooding, primarily reflected in volume and mix, as well as higher costs associated with new products and our investments for future growth. Higher net pricing is a partial offset. ","As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific and Africa's pretax results were lower compared with the third quarter, more than explained by lower costs -- by higher costs. We expect Asia-Pacific and Africa to grow volume and be profitable for 2012, even as we continue to invest in additional capacity and our product lineup for an even stronger future, in line with the implementation of our ONE Ford plan. ","Slide 25 covers 2011 fourth quarter and 2012 first quarter production. 2011 fourth quarter total company production was about 1.4 million units, up 20,000 units from a year ago and 60,000 units lower than our most recent guidance. The decrease reflects lower demand for commercial vehicles in China and the impact of Thailand flooding. We estimate the production impact of the Thailand flooding was about 34,000 units, about 4,000 units higher than we assumed in our fourth quarter guidance. We expect first quarter total company production to be about 1.4 million units, down 51,000 units from a year ago. This reflects lower industry demand in Europe and the launch-related effects of new products in Asia-Pacific and Africa. This outlook is consistent with our disciplined strategy to match our production with consumer demand. And compared with the fourth quarter, first quarter production will be up 32,000 units. ","Turning now to Slide 26, on our Automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. We ended the quarter with $22.9 billion in Automotive gross cash, an increase of $2.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. ","Automotive operating-related cash flow was $700 million. Our cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions was $1.9 billion, including receipts from Financial Services of $1.3 billion. Net debt inflows in the quarter totaled $300 million, reflecting primarily an increase in low-cost loans for the development of advanced technologies. We made payment of $100 million to non U.S.-funded pension plans. Full year Automotive operating-related cash flow was $5.6 billion, and cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions totaled $9.3 billion. For 2012, we expect strong positive Automotive operating-related cash flow. ","Slide 27 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the fourth quarter. Automotive debt was $13.1 billion at the end of the year. We continue to make significant progress in improving our balance sheet, and we ended the year with net cash of $9.8 billion, an improvement of $8.4 billion compared with the end of 2010. And Automotive liquidity is now more than $32 billion. ","Turning now to Ford Credit. Slide 28 shows the $66 million decrease in fourth quarter pretax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. In line with our expectations, the results are more than explained by fewer leases being terminated, which results in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, offset partially by Other, reflecting primarily foreign currency translation adjustments related to the discontinuation of financing in Australia. ","As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pretax profit decreased by $75 million compared to the third quarter, more than explained by the same lease factor just mentioned. ","And Slide 29 provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit full year results compared with 2010 by causal factor. Ford Credit reported full year pretax profits of $2.4 billion, a $650 million decrease. The decline reflects fewer leases being terminated, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, as well as lower credit loss reserve reductions. Ford Credit paid distributions of $3 billion to its parent during 2011. ","For full year 2012, we expect Ford Credit to be solidly profitable but at a lower level than 2011, reflecting primarily the same factors just mentioned. The pretax profit contribution related to the lease and credit loss reserve factors was about $800 million favorable in 2011, and these factors are expected to be minimal in 2012. ","In addition, Ford Credit expects to pay distributions of between $500 million and $1 billion. At year-end 2012, we expect managed receivables to be in the range of $85 billion to $95 billion. ","And Slide 30 covers Ford Credit's liquidity and funding. The left box shows committed liquidity programs, cash and the utilization of Ford Credit's liquidity sources at the end of the fourth quarter. Ford Credit's available liquidity was about $17 billion. ","As shown in the right box, Ford Credit completed $35 billion of full year funding despite volatile market conditions. Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and investors. Our liquidity remains strong. We will continue to maintain cash balances, funding programs and committed capacity to ensure we have strong liquidity to reach our business and funding requirements. And at the end of the fourth quarter, Ford Credit's managed leverage was 8.3:1 and equity was $8.9 billion. ","Slide 31 provides an update to our pension plans. Worldwide pension expense in 2011, excluding special items, was $900 million, $300 million higher than 2010. In 2011, we made $1.1 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, up $100 million compared with a year ago. And worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $15.4 billion at 2011 year end, a deterioration of $3.9 billion compared with a year ago. This primarily reflects sharply lower discount rates. ","At the end of 2011, our projected long-term return on assets assumption for the U.S. is 7.5% at our present asset mix, down 50 basis points from a year ago. ","Slide 32 provides background on our long-term strategy to de-risk our funded pension plans. This will reduce our balance sheet and cash flow volatility and, in turn, improve the risk profile of the company. ","Key elements of the strategy include limiting liability growth in our funded plans by closing participation to new entrants, reducing planned deficits through discretionary cash contributions and progressively rebalancing assets to more fixed-income investments. This will provide a better matching of plan assets to the characteristics of the liabilities, which will reduce our net exposure. And finally, other strategic actions under development, which we will share with you at a later date as appropriate. As part of our long-term de-risking strategy, 2012 cash contributions to funded plans are expected to be about $3.5 billion globally compared to $1.1 billion in 2011. 2012 includes discretionary contributions to our U.S. plan of about $2 billion. As we've said previously, based on our present planning assumptions for long-term asset returns, a normalization of discount rates and planned cash contributions, we expect to have global pension obligations in total to be fully funded over the next few years, with variability on a plan-by-plan basis. ","And now, Alan will cover the business environment, our key metrics for 2011 and our key planning assumptions for 2012.","Alan R. Mulally","Thank you, Lewis. Slide 34 provides an overview of the business environment. Overall, we expect global growth to continue at a 3% pace during 2012. Economic growth in the U.S. is expected to be in the range of 2% to 3%. Growth in Europe, however, remains very challenging. We expect weak conditions in Europe, with some markets doing better than others while fiscal austerity programs are implemented. Several key emerging markets, including China, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Turkey have entered cycles of policy easing to support economic growth. Despite recent declines in commodity prices, we expect them to increase modestly in 2012. Longer-term, we expect prices to continue to trend upwards, given global demand growth. ","Overall, we assess the global business environment for automotive industry growth to be favorable in 2012, with sales projected to be about 80 million units, up from 76 million units in 2011. In light of the volatile external environment, however, 2012 sales could range from 75 million to 85 million units. ","Slide 35 summarizes 2011 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics compared with the plan we shared at the beginning of the year. Overall, we achieved solid results across the business in 2011, meeting or exceeding our plan in most instances. Importantly, we delivered improved total company pretax operating profit and Automotive operating-related cash flow compared to 2010. ","U.S. and Europe industry sales were in line with our expectations, and we met or exceeded our share targets for the United States. Both structural and commodity costs increased in 2011, as we had expected. Capital spending was less than we projected due mainly to efficiency. Shortfalls to our plan occurred in quality in the U.S. and with our Automotive operating margin. We believe we have the quality issues well in hand and are back on track to deliver quality levels that are among the best in the business. ","Our operating margin shortfall can be more than explained by higher commodity costs which, we noted earlier, reduced our margin by nearly 2 percentage points. In summary, 2011 was a strong year and kept us well on track to our mid-decade outlook. ","Now let's turn to 2012 on Slide 36. Our entire organization is energized as we enter 2012, keenly aware of the challenges but also the opportunities we face in the current environment. While the uncertainties surrounding the European debt crisis and its impact on the global economy presents a challenge for everyone, our strong product portfolio and this prospect of global economic growth offer opportunities for our business going forward. Although we will keep a close eye on economic environment throughout the year, we are sharing key current planning assumptions as follows: We expect full year industry volume to range from 13.5 million to 14.5 million units in the U.S. and from 14 million to 15 million units in Europe. We project full year market share in the U.S. and Europe to be about equal compared to 2011. For quality, we expect to deliver year-over-year improvement. ","Compared with 2011, we expect our 2012 financial performance to reflect the following: Automotive pretax operating profit to improve; Ford Credit to be solidly profitable, although at a lower level due primarily to the factors mentioned previously; total company pretax operating profit, excluding special items, to be about equal; Automotive structural costs to increase by less than $2 billion as we support higher volumes, new product launches and our growth plans; and Automotive operating margin to improve. For 2012, we expect capital spending to be $5.5 billion to $6 billion. Although not shown in the table, we are expecting nonmaterial increase in commodity costs for 2012. ","Overall, we expect 2012 to be a solid year for the Ford Motor Co., consistent with our glide path to our mid-decade guidance. We're off to a good start with the overwhelmingly positive reactions to recently introduced global products, including the all-new Fusion at the Detroit auto show, the all-new EcoSport at the Delhi auto show and the all-new Escape in Los Angeles. ","Finally, Slide 37 summarizes our ONE Ford plan. Clearly, we remain focused on delivering this plan, which is unchanged. Our track record for making continued progress in delivering great products, investing for global growth, building a strong business and providing profitable growth for all Ford stakeholders is evident in our results. ","What especially excites all of us in Ford is the knowledge of what lies ahead, knowing that by building on what we have accomplished so far, the majority of the benefits that we will ultimately deliver from leveraging our global scale are yet to come. We recognize that we have both challenges and opportunities ahead. Chief among our tasks is the acceleration -- accelerating the realization of full potential of the global scale and operating margin benefits inherent in our ONE Ford plan. This task includes improving even further our already strong operation in North America; strengthening and growing our profitable South American operation in the face of increasing competition in the region; ensuring that our European operation remains on track to deliver sustainable and appropriate returns in an uncertain environment; achieving strong growth and profit contribution from Asia-Pacific and Africa; and continuing the strong performance of our strategic asset, Ford Credit. ","We will continue our laser-like focus on strengthening the Ford brand around the world and continue the journey of making Lincoln a world-class luxury brand. Thanks to the strong performance in 2011 and our plan for continued strong performance this year, we are going further to achieve the full potential of our ONE Ford plan, including the achievement of our mid-decade outlook. Now we'd be pleased to take your questions.","George Sharp","Thanks, Alan. Now we'll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We'll begin with questions from the investment community then take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Katina, can we have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Himanshu Patel, representing JPMorgan.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to just delve into Europe a little bit. You guys, particularly you, Lewis, have been speaking very cautiously on the market for about 6 months now. But your 2012 volume guidance says it's down but not that much, sort of mid-single-digit volume decline. You've posted 2 quarters in a row of net pricing growth in Europe year-over-year, and I think even sequentially in the fourth quarter, it was sort of flattish. So I'm just curious, what are you sort of seeing prospectively to sort of cause the caution? And is it really sort of just the general macro kind of hedged comment that you're making, that volumes haven't fallen yet but you sort of expect them to? Or is it something you're seeing prospectively on net pricing that maybe is just not evident so far in the data in the last couple of quarters?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Okay. Let me try and frame this. I think, for the obvious external reasons, we remain cautious about the economic development of Europe. Very different by country: some countries well in recession; some countries perhaps on the verge of recession; and 1 or  2 countries continue to do okay. We haven't seen dramatic volume drops, although we have seen incentive spending increase. Encouragingly for the Ford team, we've seen, as you said, net pricing improvements. We've achieved positive pricing that more than offset the increased incentive spending. So I think our overall caution is around the customers' concern about the economic environment. And it's hard, just where we stand at the moment, Himanshu, to say is it going to show in volume or is it going to -- with volumes coming off a bit more. Or is it going to show in incentive activities, with incentive spending going up a little bit, because as you know, we've been restructuring the European business, really, for over a decade. But there's still -- most of our competitors have tremendous amount of open capacity, which results in some incentive activity levels that isn't great for the business.","Alan R. Mulally","Himanshu, I might just add to Lewis' comments that we have been continuing to restructure Europe over the years, and we are at about 93% utilization of our capability. And in addition to that, it was really important on our ONE Ford plan to accelerate the development of the new products that we believe the European customers want and value. And also, in 2012, we'll be launching 10 new or significantly refreshed vehicles, including the all-new Ranger, the B-MAX and the Kuga. So I think both on the revenue side, in addition to our continuing matching the real production -- our production to the real demand, that we have opportunities both on the revenue side and the production side.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would you guys expect Europe to be loss-making this year?","Lewis W. K. Booth","It's too early for us to give you a clear view of that. I think, as you think about the Automotive business,  we're guiding the total Automotive, we expect to be up year-over-year. But we're not giving a guidance on Europe for the moment.","Himanshu Patel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. If I could sneak in one more on Europe, a lot of the U.S. banks are very happy with automotive lending. It clearly seems like an asset class where they're comfortable, coming out of the Lehman recession. What is sort of the outlook on European consumer credit availability, particularly as it pertains to vehicle financing, not just for Ford Motor Credit, but what you're kind of seeing out of the banks out there?","Michael L. Seneski","Yes, Himanshu, it's Mike Seneski. At this stage, actually, we have seen a pretty stable environment for consumer credit. We have not yet seen any follow-on impacts. And the banks have indicated that there will be some slowdown in lending, but to this stage, we have not seen anything.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer, representing Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Quick one on medium- and heavy truck in Brazil, if I could. Can you give us a sense of how orders have been coming in? I would guess the backlogs there are a quarter or 2, and it just seems like expectations are ranging pretty widely from down materially to up a little bit. It seems to be clear there were some prebuys in 2011 ahead of the Euro 5 emission standards that went into effect.","Alan R. Mulally","Yes, exactly, we're ahead of plan. The new vehicle has been very well received and very, very competitive.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Do you have a sense if orders are stepping down in the first quarter of 2012 and how you expect that to go through the year?","Alan R. Mulally","We think relatively flat.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then secondly, on Slide 34, I was wondering, the 80-million-unit global industry production forecast, how does that compare to 2011?","Lewis W. K. Booth","2011 came in at close to 77 million. So it was like 76.8 million or 76.9 million or so. Global industry tends to carry on counting for a few weeks after the end of the year, so it's moving up towards 77 million.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then just one little detail on the less than $2 billion automotive structural cost increase guidance for 2012. Can you give us a little -- how much more below $2 billion it might be?","Lewis W. K. Booth","No. The guidance is less than $2 billion. You're seeing an increase in structural costs associated with our growth plans, both in continued investment in new capacity around the world, continued investments in new products around the world and then continued efforts by Jim Farley and the team to get the message out through advertising and sales promotion to continue to improve the brand around the world. So it's really associated with the growth of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak, representing RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a couple of quick ones on North America. Given that a good portion of your North America production is brand-new, what's the outlook for net pricing? You've been able to make good progress, but the comps do get a little bit tougher, so maybe just a little bit color on that.","Lewis W. K. Booth","Well, as we said, I think several quarters in a row, we expect to see continued improvements in net pricing -- but slowing down. I think, slowing down for a couple of reasons. One, as you said, the comps are more challenging. But really, the plan around the North American recovery was to have low-cost products and to achieve competitive transaction prices, and we are closing the gap with the best of the competition. So there's less gap to close as we continue going through our new product launches. But the other key to the North American plan is to keep products fresh. And I think you could -- if you were at the Detroit show, you could see the real efforts going on to continue to have really fresh products, not just in North America but around the world. And that's the underlying -- that's what ONE Ford is about: great products, fresh around the world, earning competitive transaction prices with competitive cost because of the scale we can generate.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then maybe just some color. Last year, you sort of gave the outlook for retail share in the U.S. equal to improved. Maybe some color on what you expect in 2012. And then similarly, strong operating-related cash flow. Will it be higher than 2011, in line or maybe a little low?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Let me talk about the operating-related cash flow first. Yes, we do expect it to be stronger. I think if you think about it as probably comparable with this year but adjusted for the increased CapEx we're expecting. We're guiding to more than $1 billion of incremental CapEx this year, so if you think about it as comparable, adjusted for the CapEx levels. We're not giving out specific details of retail and retail share. We think we're talking about total share being equal or slightly improved.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just do one quick one, you mentioned in Ford Credit, I think you said you still had a benefit of -- or either $800 million from the lease and credit loss this year -- even though I think on a year-over-year, it was a headwind. But I understand that's coming down. But is that to imply that 2012 will be roughly about $800 million lower than '11?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Well, that's one of the major factors of our outlook for Ford Credit being lower in 2012 than 2011. We've been guiding for some quarters the very favorable factors associated with very strong residual values on the vehicles being returned from lease and astonishingly good performance by our book, with our customers really paying for their vehicles. We did expect those to be tailing off in the period. We're now at record low credit loss reserve, so there's no more credit loss reserve to release. In fact, as our receivables start to grow, as we've guided, you can expect us to actually increase our credit loss reserves a little. So yes, those are the significant parts of the year-over-year reduction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold, representing Jefferies.","Peter Nesvold","I'll be very brief. So one of the things that jumped out from the outlook was that material costs are not expected to be significant in 2012. Was that a function of your hedging programs, or are you seeing some other relief there that gives you more optimism there for 2012?","Lewis W. K. Booth","We saw commodity cost come off a bit in the fourth quarter, and we're seeing that sort of levels in the first quarter. But we do expect commodity cost to be up a little bit year-over-year. But if you think on a year-over-year comparison, we'll have -- got the benefit of hedging, we've got the non-repeat of hedging losses that we saw in 2011, and we've got some modest commodity cost increases. But net, we don't expect it to be material.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy, representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'll just keep it to 2 questions. First, how much lending is Ford Motor Credit doing in Europe as a percent of your total sales? Is that in the ballpark of 30% to 40% like we'd see in North America, or is it a lot lower or higher?","Lewis W. K. Booth","It's lower. If you separate out between wholesale and retail, it's stronger on wholesale -- most of our deals are financed through Ford Credit, and a bit lower on retail.","Alan R. Mulally","If you look in Appendix 17, John, it gives you a breakdown of our receivables by our North America and international.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And you feel like you could probably step in there and support the business like you did in North America in '08 and '09?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Yes. I mean, I think you can watch our behavior. We'll keep the credit company well funded. It's an important asset both here and in Europe, and we're not going to deflect from that plan. And we're comfortable that we can do that. Just one other observation about Ford Credit because I was describing the year-over-year reduction. I think we can expect to see a bit of pressure on margins because we are moving some of our borrowing towards unsecured. So we can see -- as well as the factors we've been talking about, I think you can see a bit of pressure on margins because of that.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a second question, Alan, for you. As you look at your, sort of your midterm targets, I mean, you're basically talking about global Auto op pretax margins 8% to 9%. We're roughly running about 300 to 400 basis points below that currently. I mean, if we were to see the market somehow all of a sudden shoot up to those midterm targets on volumes or sort of mid-trend levels in North America and Europe, do you think you would get there just by the cycle and volumes recovering? Or are there other steps internally at Ford that you think you need to take to make some significant changes to get there? I'm trying to understand what's internal and what's just returning to trend volumes.","Alan R. Mulally","I would put both of those in there, John, because clearly, the expansion in the world economy and the industry is a plus, but also the power of capturing the value of the ONE Ford plan, as we've talked about. And we -- as we've talked about, we are just on the beginning of being able to capture that value because as we move to our global platforms and our aligned business framework with our suppliers worldwide over the next 2 or 3 years, we're going to have -- nearly 85% of our volume is going to be on these 9 platforms. And as we continue to implement this across the product line, we'll continue to reap the benefits and the value of that. So I'd say I'd have both of those in there.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I mean, to try to characterize that, would that be 1\/3 pricing, 1\/3 volume and 1\/3 cost, roughly? Or is that parsing it too fine?","Alan R. Mulally","I think that's a little bit too fine. But to your point, we're clearly -- as we talked about a little bit earlier, we're clearly seeing us closing the gap on the value of the products, based on the quality and the features and the fuel efficiency and the smart-design features. People really are valuing the Ford product line, so I think we'll continue to stay competitive that way. We'll see the volume increase, and then we'll see continuing year-after-year increase in the productivity, including the investment efficiency because of the ONE Ford global platforms also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, representing Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Lewis, so any comment on preregistration activity in Europe? We hear it's running as high as 20% in recent weeks.","Lewis W. K. Booth","No, it varies by manufacturer. It varies quite significantly by country. We'll stick to our process of not chasing marginal business.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But are you seeing a pickup from the competition?","Lewis W. K. Booth","We're seeing -- yes, we've seen tick-ups, particularly right at the month end.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's the way it usually works. Mike, a question for you. You mentioned that the credit loss is still at historic lows, and I think even improving quarter-on-quarter -- at least, they were 3Q. If you really were pressed to look anywhere for a sign of weakness in terms of credit quality, not the availability -- you said to Himanshu's question that was pretty stable, where are you seeing it start to crack? Or anywhere?","Michael L. Seneski","We're not. I mean, you'll see in the fixed income call our input FICOs look good. The credit quality of the portfolio looks good.","Lewis W. K. Booth","Adam, we should comment. Clearly, in some of the peripheral markets in Europe, there's tremendous pressure on the consumer. And we've seen some pressure there, but that's not material to the Ford Credit business.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Finally, quick one. Just North American model launch disruption this year: Fusion, Escape, MKZ, the big ones. Can you kind of try to dynamic when it's most disruptive, when we'll start seeing the benefit? I'll leave that more open-ended for you to describe to us so we can have a better understanding quarter by quarter, please.","Lewis W. K. Booth","Yes, we've got a huge amount of product launches -- not just the major car lines you're talking, but continued expansion of EcoBoost, for example. The biggest periods of launch are the second and third quarter, but you can expect us right through the year to have a lot of launch activities. So in the second and third quarter, you'll, in particular, see some manufacturing launch losses. But you'll also see we've got capacity actions. So we've got third shifts coming on in 3 of our plants, with a second shift coming on in Kansas City truck. And they're spread, I think, mostly in the first half. And then you'll see -- if you think about structural cost, you'll see the advertising and sales promotion that goes with all those product launches. So I mean, actually, it's going to be a pretty busy year. I know Mark is sweating with the thought of it, but excited because -- I just want to get back to the thesis. If you come on to our stand [ph] at Detroit, you see what our future looks like -- I mean, just great product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, representing Barclays Capital.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, rather than rehash guidance, one really question for Alan. How would you say you're managing the company differently, along with Lewis, in an era where we're looking at some macro downturns in Europe and South America as opposed into the rising environment we've generally had over the last 3 or 4 years? And in particular, how is that affecting the cost discipline? Are you looking for faster cost takeout than you normally might have looked at? How is it affecting how you're monitoring pricing, which seems to be holding up even in the face of some of these weakened macros? And are there kind of other changes, say, for example, in your Thursday meetings as we go forward?","Alan R. Mulally","Oh, you bet. Well, it's just fantastic. The way we manage the business has enabled us in the past and now to move decisively to the changing conditions. And to your point, every Thursday, we review everything: macro environment worldwide; also where we are versus the plan; areas that need special attention. Clearly, what we're working on now for this year is to continue to improve an already very well operating operation in North America. We're strengthening and growing our profitable South American operations in the face of the increasing competition, as we talked about. We're ensuring that our European operation remains on track to deliver sustainable and appropriate returns in an uncertain environment, as we've discussed, using our ONE Ford plan; and of course, continuing to implement growth and increasing profit contribution from Asia-Pacific going forward; and as we've covered today, continuing to really perform in Ford Credit. So if you look at all that together, then you come back to our plan, the thing that's enabling us to respond decisively around the world is the fact we have dramatically simplified and focused our Ford plan. So we're continuing to match production to the real demand. We're continuing to accelerate the development of new products. And as we just talked about, we're looking to accelerate getting the value out of our ONE Ford plan, led by the global platforms and the simplification of the product line and also expanding our market presence around the world. So the ONE Ford plan, the way we manage the business is continuing to serve us very well.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in particular, as you kind of look at markets like Brazil, how do you make the trade-off? Would you -- if the pricing -- a, is the pricing deteriorating there and you're standing out, and that's why share is declining? And is there a point at which you would accept even greater volume declines?","Alan R. Mulally","Well, as you well know, the fundamental strategy is to manage for profitable growth. And in Brazil, specifically, as we've talked about, the market is becoming more competitive. And again, based on matching the production to the real demand -- and also in Brazil, the introduction of all the new vehicles that we have that are moving onto the global platforms for the first time, we're going to be able to work the revenue side even much better in addition to working our fundamental productivity with the global platform. So Brazil is going to continue to be a really good market for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover, representing Guggenheim.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had one sort of administrative question, a real question. The first question is on materials and the commodity hedge. What was the full value of that? I must have missed it -- in '11, Lewis.","Lewis W. K. Booth","Total year-over-year increase was $2.3 billion.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","That was on the hedge?","Lewis W. K. Booth","That was commodity and hedge. We haven't split them out this time.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, so when you make the comment about the commodities, then it's off of that base? We don't see material improvement or change at all off of the...","Lewis W. K. Booth","Year-over-year, we expect a slight increase, but we don't expect it to be material.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question is, Alan, you made a comment about Europe running at 93% capacity utilization, and the business right now is losing a couple hundred million bucks. I recognize that there's a structural issue in Europe. There's just way too much capacity. Given that high level of utilization, do you folks look at your fixed asset base and feel as though you need to do something?","Alan R. Mulally","Well, we are. And I think that's an important question because we're continuing to utilize even more our lower-cost operations in Turkey and Romania. And we're also -- as you know, we've just signed a very mutually beneficial joint venture with Sollers in Russia. And so we are nearly tripling our production capacity there to serve the Russian market, which is going to be, over the next year or so, probably the biggest market in Europe. So we'll continue to look at the balance of our production throughout Western and Eastern Europe and Turkey. But again, I think the most important thing, as Lewis mentioned, is that we have continued to work the structure and the competitiveness of Europe over the years. And this is just a tough last year, especially with the commodities and the economy slowing down and the industry slowing down. But I think the fact that we have been working and we continue to work is -- I think we'll be in very  competitive shape going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan, representing UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you comment on South America? The margins fell pretty significantly in the fourth quarter, and you seem to indicate that the margins will be lower next year. I mean, is the fourth quarter abnormally worse, or is that going to be the new run rate? And also, I know there were some import taxes in Brazil that came into effect in December. Is that going to help in the first half of the year as some of your competitors are kind of pushed out of the market there?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Let me try and give you a sort of slightly broader answer. I think what we're seeing in South America and Brazil, in particular, is a sort of a change in the environment. The way the real has strengthened so dramatically has attracted people in, importers that typically hadn't been a big player in the marketplace. And that put pressure on pricing for a couple reasons. One, just increased competition. And secondly, those importers were bringing in global products, whereas historically, most of South America was really operating on legacy products. So what we've seen is -- in the typical past of Brazil with high inflation, high local inflation and the exchange rate variability, we could price to offset that. What we saw in the fourth quarter is that ability to price to offset -- in the fourth quarter, both pretty high local inflation and deterioration in the -- weakening of the currency, we couldn't price to offset that. As we look forward, I think the real key is we are moving towards our global products. And we'll see, starting in the second half -- and no secret, we showed it at Delhi, the new EcoSport, a tremendously important product for South America. And starting from then, we'll potentially have a complete transformation of the product line from historically legacy platforms and local solutions to global platforms and global solutions. And by the mid-decade, we'll have 16 new products, 15 of which will be on global platforms. So I think that's the sort of transition you can see in the market. And I think -- as you think about 2012, I think we would expect to see the second half better than the first half because of the launch of the new products.","Alan R. Mulally","I might just add also that in the fourth quarter specifically, nearly 50% of that deterioration was exchange. And just one more comment, building on what Lewis shared, is as we introduce our new ONE Ford global platforms, we're going to be increasing our market coverage from 67% up to nearly 82% with our new family of vehicles. So we have some real opportunities to serve new market segments going forward also with products that are going to have a lot more value and a lot more competitiveness.","Lewis W. K. Booth","And I talked about EcoSport in the second half. I should also -- we're very excited about Ranger because Ranger is going to be important around the world, and it's going to be in South America in the second half of this year.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I guess just 2 more quick ones. I mean, any color on what you're expecting for FX next year? It seems to have been an issue this quarter. And any comment on structural cost? It's up $2 billion this year. At what point does it sort of hit a plateau where the incremental growth is no longer that large? It sounds like you've been doing maybe some global catch-up over the last few years.","Lewis W. K. Booth","Well, in terms of our structural cost, we still got some period to go because, as we said, we broke ground on 4 new plants in Asia-Pacific last year. We've got 7 plants in Asia-Pacific under construction now. As our volumes grow, we'll have increased manufacturing cost just because of our volumes growing. And as we want to continue to improve our brand, we'll have increased advertising and sales promotion. So I think it's too early to say we'll get to a plateau. It's something we pay a lot of attention on in the Thursday meetings. It's something that gets discussion at every Thursday meeting. In terms of foreign exchange, I wouldn't want to guess on that.","Alan R. Mulally","But clearly, it's part of our plan to grow towards that mid-decade guidance that we gave, that we're going to move up to around 8 million vehicle production, as well as moving the guidance up to 8% to 10% -- the margins up to 8% to 10%. And that's fueled by especially the growth in Asia-Pacific, as Lewis mentioned, both on the product line coverage as well as the new production facilities.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we would now like to welcome questions from the media community.","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin, representing the Associated Press.","Dee-Ann Durbin","You talked about the loss of U.S. market share in the fourth quarter. Since the retail share remained the same, I wanted to talk about the fleet, apparently, that you're losing. Is it good fleet? Is it bad fleet? What's going on with fleet?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Dee-Ann, I think, really, it's more noise than any signal. I mean, it was only a very small change, so I don't -- we don't see any signals in that. It's just the timing of the orders.","Alan R. Mulally","And Dee-Ann, like we've talked about, the fleet is really good business, dominated by the companies, and a very big and important part of our plan.","Dee-Ann Durbin","I just wondered if you were -- I mean, are you losing, for example, police contracts, taxi, that kind of business?","Alan R. Mulally","No, not all. And just with that one specific, I think our new Interceptor, and the fact that it was designed in concert with the police throughout the United States, is going to be a terrific product for them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Klayman, representing Reuters.","Ben Klayman","Today's GDP numbers show inventories accounted for a big chunk of the economic growth in the fourth quarter, and I was just hoping to get your guys' insight as to are you guys still ramping up inventories, are you keeping them stable or letting them run down? And sort of what signs are you picking up about the strength of demand from U.S. consumers?","Lewis W. K. Booth","We're being very careful on inventories. In the U.S., we had some dealer stock build in the fourth quarter, but it was really to make sure we had the inventories that are now -- to support the going rate in terms of days supply. I think we're at 58 days, which is just slightly actually lower than our typical level. So I think, as you've seen over the last several quarters -- in fact, several years, Mark and the team have done a really nice job of matching our production with demand. We do see our running rate -- the industry running rate is going up. So you can expect to see dealer stock levels increase a little bit as the industry goes up, but not our days supply. We'll keep our days supply well under control.","Alan R. Mulally","We've talked about this a little bit. This is a slower recovery than we've had from recessions in the past, but it's a very important recovery. The guidance that -- or the economic expansion we see now in the United States is going to be between 2% and 3%. And also, we've moved the industry volume up from 13 million units this year to between 14 million and 15 million next year.","Lewis W. K. Booth","13.5 million to 14.5 million.","Alan R. Mulally","I'm sorry, 13.5 million to 14.5 million next year. And the neat thing about that, too, is that with the average age of the vehicles getting closer to 11 years, that the consumers really do want to obtain the value and the fuel efficiency of the new vehicles. So we got a number of things in here that look really well for us going forward in the market.","Ben Klayman","Okay. And then one other quick question I just had about freight cost, and I was hoping you guys could provide some color as to where you're seeing that. Is it in the U.S., and is it rail? And are you going to be able to pass that on to the customers?","Lewis W. K. Booth","The freight cost increase we've seen is really associated with the premium freight we've had to enable to support our plants for a couple of reasons. One, during the year, as we went through the tsunami crisis and then the Thailand crisis, we had to sort of accelerate our supply lines by putting stuff in air and premium freight. And then as we've grown, our suppliers in 1 or 2 cases have struggled a little bit to keep up with us. And again, we've had to have some premium freight to keep the plants going. So it's more expedited freight cost levels rather than specific ambient freight costs.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Shepardson, representing the Detroit News.","David Shepardson","Lewis, you talked about other strategic actions you're considering with the pension plans. Are you considering a hourly pension buyout program?","Lewis W. K. Booth","David, when we're ready to talk about our other plans, we'll talk about it at the appropriate time. We're not ready to talk about things we have in mind.","David Shepardson","And how many years do you think it will take until you can fully fund your pension plans?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Well, as we guided, we expect, with both asset returns -- a return to a more normalized discount rate -- I mean, the discount rate is at historic lows, and our cash contributions, we expect overall, our funded pension plans to be fully funded by the end of the plan period, so in the next few years. Obviously, there were 3 caveats you just heard, but that's what we expect.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle, representing Detroit Free Press.","Alisa Priddle","You've talked a lot about North America being the real driver in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little bit of context of how dominant you think the role of North America will be in 2012?","Lewis W. K. Booth","Yes. I mean, we would expect North America to continue to be an extremely strong contributor to the business, I think, for a couple of reasons. One, it is our largest business unit by some, and more importantly, it's operating in a gradually expanding environment. And then also within North America, by far, the dominant part of Ford Credit's profits are earned in North America. Europe, you've heard us express some caution about giving guidance. South America, we expect to be strongly profitable next year, although perhaps a little bit lower than this year. In Asia-Pacific, we expect to return to profitability. But within that context and within the fact we're investing for the future and many of the other reasons, we expect North America to be a very strong contributor to 2012.","Alan R. Mulally","One of the neat things about North America, too, is it has the widest -- and most of all the members of the complete family of best-in-class products. And so it really is the engine also for supporting our growth worldwide.","Alisa Priddle","And in terms of net pricing, can you give any kind of color on -- now that you're adding the Fusion, completing the car line, what kind of effect do you think it might have?","Lewis W. K. Booth","As I said earlier, we expect to see continued net pricing opportunities. We're seeing a fairly stable pricing environment in the U.S. And as our products continue to get great, every time we launch a new product, we close the gap. And I think we'll continue to do that.","Operator","At this time, I'd now like to hand the call back to management to proceed to closing remarks.","George Sharp","Well, thank you very much, Katina.

By the way, you can see Bob's blushing. Okay. So let me turn to our results which we believe signal positive momentum for Ford. Our solid results this quarter, if you look at slide 2 and the recent strategic initiatives, demonstrate two things in our minds.","First, we have a solid plan to create value in the near and long term. 2018 was a pivotal year for Ford, as we mapped out a fundamental redesign of our entire company. And this is required to ensure we could simultaneously strengthen our core business while making the necessary investments to be a successful player in the future. We know that the industry -- our industry is entering a period of profound disruption and reinvention.","Second, we're taking action, moving decisively, and building momentum on this global redesign of our company. 2019 is a year of action as we target sustained improvement across key metrics including growth, profitability, cash flow, and returns on capital.","Now, if you look at slide 3, which is titled 2019 A Year of Action, let me focus on some of the key enablers. Let's start with the winning portfolio. Across the world, we're fortifying our franchise strengths in trucks, commercial vehicles, and performance vehicles and bolstering our SUV franchise, executing the unique approach to electric vehicles that takes advantage of our strongest nameplates.","And as you saw a year ago, we're phasing out vehicles that cannot grow and deliver the strong returns that are needed. And as you see -- as you will see when Bob reviews our results, these actions are already driving improved mix with higher average transaction prices and margins.","If you look there at fitness, I've often referred to this as the state of our ability to compete. We are improving operating leverage, we're lowering our breakeven, and we have reallocated capital to higher return investments. For example, over our plan period, globally, we now expect to dedicate 91% of our capital to trucks, utilities, and crossovers. And we will achieve this while we also lower the capital intensity of the whole business. We expect these actions to drive higher operating cash flow and that will be led by Automotive.","An essential part of Fitness for Ford is partnerships and to this end, we've advanced our alliances as you know both with VW and Mahindra. And yesterday, we were proud to announce a partnership with Rivian.","Next, I want to focus on our global redesign. We are accelerating this. Our recent announcements in Western Europe, Russia, and South America, as well as the redesign of our global management structure show how we are rationalizing our cost structure, our portfolio, and footprint to ensure the company overall in each of our regions drive sustainable profitable growth. I want to touch on this a bit more in just a moment.","Finally, as you look at the Smart Vehicles for a Smart World, we have the opportunity to help create a better transportation system that will improve lives. To this end, we made the decision to connect with modems virtually all of our new vehicles going forward and to leverage this connectivity to continuously improve our vehicles and services and create better experiences for our customers. We know this will build loyalty and deliver recurring revenue streams.","Well, for your information, by the end of this year, 100% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. will be equipped with those modems and by 2020, 90% of our new vehicles globally will also be equipped with modems.","So, in parallel, we're laying building blocks in the form of platforms to help us realize the vision then of a Smart Vehicles for a Smart World. Examples include Autonomic's Transportation Mobility Cloud or we nicknamed it the TMC. This is the world's leading automotive cloud.","Earlier this week, we announced a global agreement with Amazon for our TMC to be powered by Amazon Web Services. This is great news because it expands the availability of cloud connectivity services and connected car application development services for the whole transportation industry.","In addition, we launched FordPass Rewards. Now FordPass has been downloaded 6.4 million times and we now have 3.8 million members signed up. We do expect the growth of these members to accelerate. We also announced FordPass Pro. This is for our fleet vehicle customers.","Returning to autonomous vehicles. We've selected a third city for business operations in commercial deployment and we expect to announce the location later this year. Also Argo AI, recently received a license to test AVs in California, making it the fifth state we're now testing in.","If we can move you to slide 4 and you see announcements at the top. Here are some of the major initiatives, we've announced or taken so far this year. Our North American operation continues to move closer to its longer term EBIT margin of 10% with action to enhance effectiveness and reduce costs.","The North American business will also benefit this year from a significant wave of product launches that includes some wonderful badges for us, Ranger, Super Duty, Explorer, and Escape as well as exciting new entries for Lincoln. In fact by the end of 2020, we will have replaced 75% of our current U.S. product lineup.","We've also taken action to increase production of Expedition and Navigator in Kentucky for the second time to keep up with continued strong demand, so over 40% greater than what we had planned.","We announced we're expanding the battery electric and AV capacity in Michigan. And we'll optimize costs by building the next generation Transit Connect for North America in Mexico instead of Spain.","You can see the progress we're making in our first quarter results as North America drove a 2% increase in revenue despite lower industry sales and wholesale volume. And at the same time it achieved a 90 basis point increase in EBIT margin to 8.7%.","In South America, we\u2019re moving to a more asset light business model. The team has made some significantly tough decisions. One was to exit heavy trucks and close our facility in S\u00e3o Bernardo. Through our collective approach and collaborative approach, we're working to minimize the near-term impact on all of our stakeholders.","We're also beat now in the redesign of our European business as we have targeted a sustainably profitable business that delivers a 6% EBIT margin. Our future business there will be leaner, more focused and that will capitalize on profitable franchises strengths in commercial vehicles and utilities.","We plan to significantly reduce our cost base there by discontinuing loss making product lines and adjusting our manufacturing footprint. For example, we've announced the closure of our Bordeaux France transmission plant. We announced the restructuring of our JV in Russia. We've offered separation programs in Germany and the U.K. and we confirmed we'll phase out two of these products the C-MAX and C-MAX Gran models later this year.","If you look at slide 6, I want to just take you back to a decision we made a year ago when we announced our decision to phase out sedans in North America. Now remember, we want customers to understand the silhouettes that they prefer are the ones we're going to bring them. So in fact we don't intend to lose any of these customers long-term.","But now in hindsight it was absolutely the right call. This slide underscores the benefit of thinking about a winning portfolio. We expect to drive over $1 billion improvement in annual profitability from our Michigan assembly plant once we fully ramp production for the Ranger and Bronco that are now being built there.","Okay let's look at slide 7 and here I want to cover the financial highlights and before I turn it over to Bob let me touch on the quarter. We delivered good results and this is consistent with our view now that we will deliver better company results in 2019 than last year. Against the tough quarterly year-over-year comparison, the company-adjusted EBIT and margin increased despite a decline in wholesales and revenue, while we increased investments for future opportunities in Mobility.","On an adjusted basis, we grew EBIT by 12% to $2.4 billion. Margin increased 90 basis points to 6.1% led by 8.7% EBIT margin that I mentioned in North America. We also delivered EPS of $0.44, which we're happy with the big beat there, but were also up year-over-year. These results clearly demonstrate the benefit of our fitness actions, the hard portfolio decisions and the aggressive business redesigns all of which are still very much underway and we expect more to be generated from all these actions.","Lastly, we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and ended the quarter above our cash and liquidity targets with $24.2 billion in cash and $35.2 billion in total liquidity. Needless to say, I and the team here are very encouraged by the strong start to the year.","With that, let me turn this call over to Bob Shanks for his last quarterly review as Chief Financial Officer. Bob?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Jim, and good evening to everyone. I'd like to start with four key points: First the results this quarter are high quality and driven by the key specifics of the business; second while top line metrics were lower than a year ago, the company's revenue decline was driven largely by exchange as strong mix and higher net pricing about offset the lower volume.","And even though market share was lower, we're growing share in trucks and commercial vehicles and expect improved performance in utility segments as we launch new and in some cases new-to-market entries over the next couple of years.","Third, company-adjusted EBIT the best since the second quarter of 2017 improved despite external headwinds of about $0.5 billion versus a year ago. This includes lower industry volume continued those smaller increases and commodity costs including tariff-related effects; and adverse exchange. This $0.5 billion impact is net of pricing of about $100 million that we took in South America to partially recover the region's adverse inflationary and exchange affects.","Fourth and most importantly, we saw progress in each of the three regions that drove the year-over-year decline in company EBIT China, Europe and North America and I'll touch on each one of them.","First in China, we incurred a loss of $128 million on lower volume. This was an improvement from the $150 million we lost a year ago which was by far the best quarterly result in 2018.","In fact, to put the current quarter into further context, last year in the second through fourth quarters, our average quarterly loss was $465 million. So the improvement in China from a year ago was driven by our consolidated operations offset partially by lower JV equity net income.","The main elements of the consolidated improvement were strong cost performance and favorable exchange, although we also saw favorable mix and achieved flat year-over-year pricing in a negative industry pricing environment. The favorable currency effect essentially was a reversal of an equivalent adverse impact we incurred in China over the past couple of years.","The lower JV equity net income was entirely due to lower volume. Importantly, we ended the quarter with dealer stocks in good shape and improving dealer profitability. While we have a lot of hard work ahead of us in China to return to sustained profitability we are encouraged by the early progress, Anning Chen and his team are making. So for the full year, we expect to build on the first quarter outcome and deliver a considerable improvement in profitability year-over-year although still a loss.","In Europe, we were profitable but at lower level than last year more than explained by nearly $100 million of unfavorable exchange, most of which was a balance sheet effect. Within Europe's results we delivered strong EBIT and healthy returns for our growing CV and truck business. This was offset partially by losses on passenger cars, although the latter continue to generate positive current period operating cash flow.","As you are aware, Europe's business redesign is underway and progressing well and we will have more to share with you as the year progresses. For the full year, we expect to deliver substantial improvement in profitability versus last year, driven by favorable mix, higher net pricing and lower cost.","Turning to North America. We achieved our best EBIT since the second quarter of 2018 and as Jim mentioned a margin of 8.7% both improved from last year. The team achieved this through strong mix and higher net pricing aided by structural costs that were slightly lower than a year ago.","From a product standpoint, North America's EBIT improvement was driven by our F-Series, despite new competitive challenges; Ranger as it came to market, and Transit America's best selling van. The region's EBIT also benefited substantially from the decision to exit traditional passenger sedans.","The strong financial performance of F-Series was matched by robust performance in the marketplace. In the quarter and in the face of new competitive entries, F-Series customer sales and average transaction prices held strong from a year earlier while share of segment increased.","And from here our plan is to strengthen our position further with the new Super Duty launching later this year, a new F-150 coming in 2020, followed by a BEV relatively soon thereafter. For the full year, we expect North America's EBIT and margin to improve from 2018.","Now coming up from the regions to our automotive segment. We saw improved EBIT from a year ago. North America's performance flowed straight through to Automotive as the combined loss in regions outside North America was unchanged from the year earlier. However, this did represent a strong $630 million improvement from the fourth quarter.","Within Automotive cost was flat year-over-year. So as a result, we generated strong operating leverage in the quarter, which drove a higher automotive EBIT margin. For the full year we expect automotive EBIT to improve, driven by gains in China, Europe and North America.","Now moving to Financial Services, Ford Credit delivered very strong earnings before taxes in fact the highest in nearly nine years. All of Ford Credit's metrics were healthy including the continued focus on a lean, best in class operating cost structure.","In the quarter, Ford Credit benefited from lower depreciation on vehicles in our leased portfolio and improvement in credit loss reserves, reflecting continued strength in consumer credit metrics.","For the full year, we now expect EBT of Ford Credit to be about the same as in as in 2018. This includes a continued expectation for auction values to decline on average over the year by about 4% at constant mix.","In our Mobility segment, we incurred an increased EBIT loss as we invested more as planned to buildout our capabilities to win in the future with mobility services as we leverage the connectivity of our products, while also progressing our developments in autonomy.","For the full year, we expect a larger loss in Mobility as we increase our investment in mobility services and as our AV efforts move closer to commercialization with a bespoke product in late 2021.","Turning to company-adjusted operating cash flow, in the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion with the majority coming from the Automotive segment. As mentioned, cash and liquidity balances at quarter end were well above our target levels.","And speaking of liquidity, earlier this week, we extended our $13.4 billion corporate revolver and we also closed on a new $3.5 billion supplemental credit facility further strengthening our liquidity and providing additional financial flexibility.","Unlike our corporate revolver, the supplemental facility is intended to be utilized and includes a $2 billion revolver and a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan. We expect to fully draw the term loan over the course of 2019, however, the impact of any draws will be leverage-neutral after taking into consideration debt reduction actions we took late last year including a repayment of about $1 billion of higher cost affiliate debt.","Now, turning now to special items in the quarter, this represented an EBIT loss of nearly $600 million with negative cash effects of about $100 million. The vast majority of the charges in the quarter were associated with the redesigns of Europe and South America.","As you'll recall last year, we identified about $11 billion in potential EBIT charges for our global redesign actions with negative cash effects of about $7 billion all through our plan period but primarily through 2021. This year we expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of the EBIT charges with negative cash effects of about $2.5 billion. We expect almost all of the EBIT charges to be treated as special items.","Relative to our other costs and capital for the year, we continue to expect CapEx to be similar to last year, pension contributions to be about $650 million, and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion.","Now, before I turn it over for Q&A, just a few summary comments. Our first -- our view of the quarter is that it's a really good start to the year for the company. And while we expect our first quarter EBIT to be the strongest quarter of the year, that's due to seasonal factors and major product launches ahead, it does clearly put us on track to deliver better company results for the full year 2019.","Due to our intense focus on improving fitness across the company, the work on our product portfolio, the redesigns of our business, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, the business is now turning in a positive direction even as we continue to invest in future opportunities.","We clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, but we have a solid plan and we're demonstrating the ability to effectively execute a heavy work statement, while concurrently delivering stronger business results.","Our opportunity and our firm intention in the months and quarters ahead is to build on the momentum we're generating and ultimately deliver returns that are among the best in our business on a sustainable basis.","Operator, we'd like to now turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy","Good afternoon guys. Good evening I should say, actually it\u2019s been a long day. Bob, I just want to say, congratulations. It's been a long great career, and I only wish I had something in the slide deck to measure and give you a hard time about, but the results were really good. So congratulations. But you understand that.","Jim is just a first question. As we look at sort of the discussion tonight in the slides, it seems like you're leaning back a little bit more on product being the core of the company sort of here in the near-term and in the long-term, a little bit more than you have in the past.","And in the past you've been a little bit more focused on sort of the future tech and the opportunity. Is something kind of shifting in your thinking here really maybe it's an 80\/20 shift or something like that, because it does seem like product really is king and you're starting to really grasp that a little bit more in the near-term and the long- term opportunities are a little bit more long-term?","Jim Hackett","Thanks, John. No I don't think there's any shift at all. In fact if I take you back to this regime's arrival in June of 2017, one of the first things that we attacked was the product portfolio.","In fact, this recent organization where Jim Farley and Joe take on respectively new roles, I've explained to the company that we weren't ready for this current organization back in June of 2017 because we had to get the product in shape. And Jim Farley and Joe and how they did an incredible job in very fast order getting that turned around.","If you think about the essence of that like is it in competition with the future, it's not because as we're turning the product around, we're thinking about the design of smart vehicles for a smart world. What do they have to actually be capable of doing to enable the future things that we're seeing, including autonomy, connectivity and cloud-based interactions with cities? So, all three of these things are in our thinking.","So what's nice is that the improvement in the product portfolio is fueling, of course, of the good news tonight, because that's what Ford stands for. And it didn't depreciate any of the investment or effort in the future tech that's all alive and well. ","John Murphy","Great. And then just a second question. I mean, price and mix were wildly constructive and positive in the quarter. But maybe if we focused on slide 25, and I don't know if this is for Joe or Farley. But you have a $1.259 billion positive on mix and price in the quarter, and we're still staring down the barrel of a lot of product coming out of.","So I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what the key driver is there? Is it the F-Series? Is there something going on with fleet or and retail? Was there something really constructive maybe on the Super Duty side? Just a very big number and just trying to understand what's going on there?","Jim Hackett","Yes, look, I'm going to hand that to Jim Farley. John.","Jim Farley","Thanks, John. Look F-Series is an incredible franchise, John. We gained share. We finished the quarter at 41% share of the pickup truck business. That's a nine-tenths increase. We had built a leadership position over the number two player by almost 100,000 units in the quarter.","Our average transaction price was just under $48,000 for F-Series, and we have the lowest incentive spend for any of the major trucks. And that was a big fitness exercise for us in terms of yield management.","One of the big strengths to your point in the first quarter was commercial and government. We saw 11% growth for us in the first quarter much higher than the industry. The sectors that drove that were telecom and utilities. We saw daily order rates grow. The strength of Super Duty is really one of the key facets for the quarter. And obviously, we also launched Ranger. In fact with Ranger and F-Series together we had our best pickup truck quarter in 15 years.","So look we have a lot to do, it's a very competitive market, but we have a great team. And we saw very strong demand for our product. And as Bob said, the product portfolios is chockful of new product. We have the new Super Duty coming later this year and an all-new F-Series next year. So we've got a great franchise for connectivity services and automation as well. There's a very strong quarter for our trucks.","John Murphy","And maybe if I could sneak one last one in for Bob. There's been a lot of speculation about the potential downgrade at Moody's for your credit rating. But with what we've seen in this quarter, it seems like that may have been staved off. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of update in your perception as what's going on there or maybe any update on the metrics we should be focused on as really kind of turning the ship on that negative review right now?","Bob Shanks","Yes, thanks John. Obviously, that would have to come from the rating agencies. But we talk with them a lot. We believe that we understand very clearly the areas of improvement they're looking for. And it is on the operating side of the business.","As I said numerous times that it is not the balance sheet, its not distribution, it's on the operating side. So I believe that while this is just a quarter, the fact that we saw the improvement in North America, we saw an improvement in China. Although again, lots of work ahead.","We got to a profit, which haven't been expected in Europe, because a lot of that redesign is still we get ahead of us in terms of the impact of that and portfolio changes as well. I think that we are hitting the parts of the business that they want to see improvement in not just a quarter, we got to do this quarter in quarter out. But I believe that's a nice step forward in terms of the things that they are concerned about.","John Murphy","Great. Congrats again, Bob. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.","Colin Langan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us the sense that there's been a lot of announcements through the year so far and restructuring actions. I mean, where are we in terms of what we should expect for the year? I mean, is there more -- is the -- go through the year is most of it kind of out there and we should start to see the benefits coming? How should we think about what else might be coming on the plan?","Jim Hackett","Yes, Colin I just want to emphasize, because this is important in the trust that I build with you guys is we've been very consistent with what we've started with the fitness initiatives in terms of our target and where we are. So I'll let Bob fill in the blanks, but there's not a lot of shifts here from what we've been talking about.","Bob Shanks","Yes, Colin, I think the way I would describe it is, while perhaps the areas where you'll be seeing impacts on the business from the actions that we take won't be new-new CEO for example we've talked about the redesign of Europe is underway, but we haven't given you much of the details behind that. Because we're in the process of the discussion with our social partners in terms of what that actually will be.","We expect that to be completed sometimes around the middle of the year and then we'll start seeing more specifics. So you'll get more details. I wouldn't say that's more announcements. It's just more details of what we've already announced.","We have talked about the fact that we're still chatting with VW and Mahindra about different opportunities. So there again nothing new in terms of areas, but potentially more in terms of what comes out of those discussions. Obviously that would be something ahead of us.","So I think it's more about more clarity and more details. And the way that I would further put into context what's yet to come, is the commentary I provided on the special items.","We only have about $500 million in this quarter of the $600 million, which relates to business redesign. And as I mentioned in my comments we expect to see $3 billion to $3.5 billion of charges for the full year.","So you're going to have a lot more happen in terms of actions that are then from an accounting standpoint it's going to hit the books. And that's going to be second, third, and fourth quarter.","Colin Langan","That's very helpful. How about South America? I think in your past presentations you showed that there's profitability there is very tough but not many product in that region and profitable.","When you have the plant closure, have we seen any benefits from that in the quarter? And should we expect more actions considering the challenges in that region?","Bob Shanks","Yes, I wouldn't necessarily assume that the announcement of the action on S\u00e3o Bernardo is the complete redesign of the region, because it's not. There's more and we'll announce things when it's appropriate to do so.","You're not getting any effect of that action in the quarter other than the special items, because the plant is going to continue to run until towards the very end of the year. So there's no benefit today but we do expect to have a good benefit.","I think we've indicated a payback of about two years from that action. So there will be more to come from the actions in South America. The thing to note there is Argentina has really been hit hard, with a very deep recession, extremely high inflation that's affecting the industry.","We're pricing as much as we can but we're frankly not keeping up with the inflation, nor the effect on the exchange rate. So that's sort of a unique factor in the shorter-term that certainly affected the business. Over time our history tells us we recover those effects but in the shorter term a bit of a challenge.","The thing to me that's positive is they basically held constant on a year-over-year basis without new product with the action in S\u00e3o Bernardo announced with all this going on in Argentina, but they continue to find good cost performance that enabled us to keep the business where it was and so that was a win from our standpoint.","Colin Langan","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Bob Shanks","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Great, thanks for taking my questions. Looks like the faster than many expected improvement in China was really driven by cost and exchange rather than volume. But JVs on the British side I know are shown as a single bucket. But Bob you referenced volume being the main negative driver there.","So, the question is really how to think about volume going forward for you in China? How should investors weigh? On the one hand a still very soft industry with on the other hand some pretty easy compares in the back half of the year.","And now this new comment that dealer stocks are in good shape. So, are the product launches enough to allow you to grow in China even in the current environment?","Bob Shanks","Let's -- Ryan let's turn that to Jim Farley.","Jim Farley","Thanks for your question. Obviously we -- we're working really hard to stabilize our sales this year. We've launched a new product as you know and we've gotten very positive pricing. We do have opportunity for momentum in the second half of the year.","But right now we're focused on stabilizing our sales. It's great to see the profitability improvement for the dealers and the stock. Stocks have come down, which is really a health measure for us. But right now we're looking at stabilizing our sales.","Bob Shanks","Yes. I would if I could add to that the way that I would think about the business, Ryan is we're really focused a lot on the dealer profitability and the margins they're earning. So we're being very thoughtful and very careful in terms of that particular part of the business. So we're certainly not pushing and driving for volume. We're really focused on profitability and their engagement. So that's the number one priority.","So as a result of that, I wouldn't expect to see significant if any volume improvement necessarily. This is really more trying to get the margins back particularly at dealer level and get the business stabilized on the locally produced front.","The thing that's interesting that you see in the bridge is the consolidated part of the business has turned around very, very sharply and very quickly. And that includes the imports of the Ford brand those products as well as Lincoln in fact profitable, frankly in the quarter and a substantial improvement year-over-year. So that part of the business that we control and have our arms around, we're making faster progress. We have a lot more work and are really doing a ground-up on the JV side. ","Jim Hackett","Ryan, Jim Hackett here. I just -- I take my gaze a little further on the horizon with China as you might imagine. And the earlier question that John asked about product and was that a new leg under our stool, it's not. But I would admit that as we were rationalizing that product portfolio what became clear to me is that our position in China had ascended very quickly from where we started to where we hit at the peak was a function of we knew what the market was, but we lost track of that.","And we lost track of it in a way that was going to take advantage of the things that John was asking you about. It seems like you guys are getting your act together on the product portfolio. So we're applying what we've learned about getting the portfolio in shape as we start to fix, China.","So there's a longer term opportunity here that we've got to prove to you that this team that really I think understands product. And we've got a wonderful leadership team there. I just want to warrant to you that there's going to be better solutions in China for Ford than we're seeing right now.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly for me, you've been warning about the sustainability of Ford Credit earnings for sometime now only to see the profit there just continue to inflect higher. You've been anticipating normalization in used car prices from some of the data we're able to track. I thought we started to see that in 1Q but you continued to record these big off-lease gains. Does the 1Q profit there cause you to think any differently about full year credit profit potential?","Jim Hackett","Well, it did actually because in January, I think we indicated that we thought the results would be lower than 2019 and 2018 and today in my comments I indicated that we expect them to be about flat so that would be around $2.6 billion.","We do not expect subsequent quarters to be at the level of performance in the first quarter. But if you -- I mean you've got last year's number, $2.6 billion we made $800 million. You can do the math it will be a very healthy second, third and fourth quarter but it will not be based on what we see today at the level of the first quarter.","Ryan Brinkman","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas","Thanks. Hi, everybody. First I want to say congrats to Bob. And Tim, Bob has got the bar set a little higher for you. But don't worry stock -- auto stocks go up 8%, 10% after quarter results. That's a very normal, so just get used to it. So, first question is for Jim, are we at peak trucks?","Jim Hackett","Are we at peak trucks? What's interesting, and Jim Farley, I know I think is the one you're after.","Adam Jonas","Both Jim.","Jim Hackett","Okay. Well, I don't think so, because we've -- in the face of some really good competition we're doing very well, Adam as you can tell. And Jim talked about where we are in the Series evolution right now, what we've been winning with versus what we're going to have.","Jim Farley","Yes. As you know, we updated the F-Series a year or so ago, which was great. But we have really strong product coming. So that bodes well for our chances. For the market in first quarter, I think that the strength for Ford in commercial and government was a really important sign.","We saw sectors including for the growth of Transit for package delivery, telecom, utilities, that really drove Super Duty F-Series and Transit sales in the U.S. double-digit growth year-over-year. So that's a really -- those customers as you know are really driven by cost of ownership. They're that very discerning customers. They want the best capability, but they also want the best efficient -- most efficient vehicle. And I think that bodes really well.","The other thing to mention is that in the first quarter for us, Ranger, we only sold about 10,000. We're just still ramping up Ranger. And there was a very strong demand. I think our average turn is like 18 days now for Ranger, and that was incremental to our F-Series. So for us, we have a very new product cadence. We have more coming, and the strength of the commercial business is a good sign.","Adam Jonas","Got it. Thank you for that. Second question is on the suppliers. If global auto production continues to let's say, flat-line deeper in the cycle and trucks don't provide as much incremental profit as they have up to now. How big of the opportunity for smart redesign intelligently contenting or rationalization of powertrain combinations that the consumer really doesn't care about or even noticed.","That\u2019s extract some seriously better pricing or terms in your supply base who in large part are out-earning you and tell us all the time that OEMs are just going to keep increasing content all the time, and that they're just going to keep winning. Are they wrong? Is there an opportunity to you to kind of -- I don't want to say turn the table. That sounds too adversarial, but just saying 'Come on folks, pitch in here. We're going to simplify this and decomplexification can mean de-contenting.' How big of an opportunity is there for you? Thanks.","Jim Hackett","Thanks, Adam. And you know I love the question, because like some of the comments tonight, this was one of the early things that we actually went after, which is in the fitness initiative. Joe Hinrichs, who\u2019s going to take this, and I have long talks about product complexity in how getting that right would start to be the gift that kept on giving. So Joe, you might talk about our efforts there and...","Joe Hinrichs","Sure. Thanks Jim. Thanks for the question, Adam. I think certainly from our perspective one of the major fitness initiatives has been around capacity reduction, and we're continuing to see good progress there. And it's not just de-contenting, but putting the right content in the vehicles, especially as we think about to contemplate the new vehicles that we're designing for the future.","I think what you're also seeing of course is the alliances and the partnerships that are taking place give us broader scale. When we partnered with Volkswagen on van programs, we have the opportunity to get together both for engineering savings, but also from a capacity utilization and supply base and ourselves improvement there as well.","So you're seeing a number of these partnerships start to come around, which are also helpful with how we work with the supply base for scale. I wouldn't necessarily condition it like it's an adversarial relationship because there is an increase in technical componentry and content going into the vehicle because of all the capabilities that Jim's been referring to in the Smart Vehicles and Smart World.","But rationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition into electrification. So, this is the kind of areas I think you'll see progress alliances powertrain and also just leveraging the scale of the industry has to better utilize the supplier's capacity.","Adam Jonas","Thanks everybody.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino","Great. Bob congratulations. First question as I think about the cadence of your net cost savings benefits you're achieving from Jim's fitness initiatives should we be really circling the structural cost improvement of $309 million in the quarter and the slide 23 walk? Or is there another level or a hidden layer of cost savings that you're already seeing achieved in the P&L?","Bob Shanks","Yes, that's a good question. I mean obviously every quarter is a bit variable, but I think the important message from today if you take from the quarter that applies to the full year particularly on structural costs is that they're not going up. And that's probably inclusive of headwinds on a lower level of income from pension and OPEB.","As you know that's been declining for some time, declining again this year several hundred million dollars. So, that's inclusive of that. And that's an important element because when you think about the contribution costs and material costs and we're making a lot of progress there for the earlier comments from Joe, there is an element of those increases that do come with the higher pricing and so forth.","So, it's not just pure cost, it's costs that gives us the benefit. So, that structural cost capping if not slight reduction is going to make a huge difference in terms of our operating leverage which is what's driving the improvement in margin.","","David Tamberrino","Got it. As a second question curious as to what the company's plans are and what it has embedded within its long-term 6% margin guidance for Europe in terms of spend to meet the CO2 emissions that are tightening?","Jim Hackett","Yes, thank you, David. This is something that we've talked a great deal about and I think I'm delighted with where Ford is relative to what's happened in Europe. I'll let Jim share more here.","Jim Farley","Yes, great question. Obviously, earlier this month the European team shared our plans to expand electrification from mild hybrids all the way to full electrics and it's a really aggressive plan with 16 electric vehicles.","One of the things that's just such a differentiator for us in Europe is our strength of commercial vehicles. And so although there are cost going in for electrification and CO2 compliance especially for 2025, we're in a really good shape to continue to nurture that commercial vehicle business which is really profitable and has more upside.","For example in the first quarter, we gained almost half a share point in our commercial business. So, although there are more costs going in Europe as you say for the more stringent requirements in 2025 with the 15% reduction, we have the opportunity in the commercial side to continue to grow our profitability.","David Tamberrino","Okay. But no quantification of how much you think that's going to put incremental costs in your vehicles for the region? ","Jim Hackett","No, not going to share that. ","David Tamberrino","Bob, if I may a comment on the press release attributed to you in regards to the seasonal earnings with 1Q being the strongest of the year. Can you elaborate on that a little bit further? I think a lot of the investors will have a question on that. ","Bob Shanks","Yes, I mean usually the first and second -- not every year, but the first or second quarter's usually the strongest of the year. In this particular year, we have a lot of launches that are taking place after the first quarter. And while coming out of the launch that's a lot of opportunity for us -- the launch itself because of lower volume launch expenses we start to amortize the investment and so forth. It is a bit of drag over a short period of time. So that's ahead of us.","Also as you know in the third quarter, Europe shut-down its plants for four weeks so there's no production. North America does it for one or two weeks so you've got in general lower volume in the third quarter because of that impact as well. In the fourth quarter because of the end-of-year holiday and that 10 days or whatever we end up sort of draining the inventory that we have across the system and so therefore we have more labor and overhead the system inventory for most of the year and it kind of flows out and goes into the income statement in the fourth quarter. So that's a downward pressure there. So those types of things.","We're still going to have good quarters coming forward. It's just we want to signal that you shouldn't think of the first as a run rate. It's a very good quarter. We've done better in the first quarter before.","So no we need to restrain our enthusiasm, but we are extremely pleased with the start to the year because it gets us off to a good start in the year that's been a lot of heavy work ahead of us but it\u2019s a wonderful way to begin that journey. ","David Tamberrino","Appreciate all the colors. Thank you very much. Congratulations again, Bob.","Bob Shanks","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. ","Rod Lache","Hello, everybody, and congrats Bob from us as well. Really enjoyed working with you over the years and I do wish you the best. I'm interested in just following up on some of the questions about China and the China plan. You had $160 million of structural cost reduction year-over-year in the quarter.","And it seemed like a lot of the restructuring that you were pursuing actually started late in the quarter. There was a shift for example to Nanjing from Shanghai. Can you talk a little bit about what we should be expecting going forward? What the magnitude of the structural cost reduction could be to correspond with your plan? ","Jim Hackett","Yes, I just want to remind everybody that this is on the consolidated part of the business. So just to simplify what need to think about that's the net engineering. So that's the engineering we incurred net of the royalties we received as the vehicles are produced. It is the import business both Lincoln brand and Ford brand. It's the overhead of the team that's there in Shanghai.","There's also a portion which is a component sales that we ship the components into the JVs and so that's a piece of it as well. So I'm just talking not about what's happening in the JVs which is where really the bulk of the business is in that portion of just described.","And so what we've been focusing on is driving down costs as quickly as we can. We've seen less engineering, less manufacturing expense from -- this is also fitness right this is fitness of Ford on the imported vehicles that's now benefiting China those vehicles go over. Certainly our engine has been drifting out and addressing the size of the workforce in Shanghai. That's an opportunity more ahead of us than in the quarter but it has begun.","So it's really broad-based it's not any one thing, it's across-the-board, but the results have been very encouraging in the first quarter. And I would expect as kind of look at the full year that that would be an important element of what will be the improvement of the loss that we had last year in China relative to what we delivered this year.","Rod Lache","So just to clarify is this the run rate of year-over-year cost reduction or do you anticipate that it actually increases from here?","Bob Shanks","I think it's pretty representative. It's going to be plus or minus.","Rod Lache","Got you. And just broadly on strategy. Maybe this is a question for Farley. You're consolidating in almost every region to segments that have very strong brand equity. So in Europe, you're going to be mostly in commercial trucks in the Ranger South America presumably at some point a lot of it's going to be pickup trucks.","And in North America, lot of what you guys are emphasizing now is brand \u2013 is products with very strong brand equity that's established. China is obviously very different. There seems like there are a lot of new products. It's expanding pretty widely. Obviously, it's a tough market. It's a fragmented market and you're a 2% player there.","So, could you just maybe from a 30,000-foot view just help us understand what you want to be in this region? How broad you want to be and what kind of investment you're willing to put behind that?","Jim Farley","Well, thanks for your question. First of all, we have \u2013 I just want to reiterate the ambitions we have to grow our utilities business globally. We have a great opportunity North America and in Europe with our utilities.","For China, the story is a growth story. I mean, as shared last week with his 30-30 plan in the next three years we have 30 new products, a lot of those utilities you can expect Ford to really lean into the utility space. If you see the success, we've had in Territory, which is the new nameplate for us that's great.","But we have the opportunity to localize a lot of utilities in China and also refresh the products that are at the very end of their life cycle. So you can expect China to be a growth story for Ford over the next several years as well as a lot of localization and a growth in our utility lineup.","Rod Lache","Do you have a target market share or sort of size of the business that you'd like us to ultimately achieve?","Jim Farley","Yes.","Rod Lache","Could you share that?","Jim Farley","No, I think it's best just \u2013 Rod just to leave it with our growth ambition. I mean, that's the most important.","Rod Lache","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Jim Hackett","Thank you, Rod.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Steven Hempel","Yes. Hi, team. This is Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson. Just wanted to drill down a little bit further into the North American profit improvement here. Maybe just discuss, how to think about the sustainability of North American EBIT for the year and maybe discuss the quarterly cadence throughout.","I suppose maybe a two-part question split-up between kind of cost including the launches. I understand, obviously launches are going to ramp up for the remainder of the year, but maybe discuss which quarters you expect to see the largest year-over-year headwind from those launch costs.","And then secondarily, pricing which has been obviously key strong year-over-year tailwind now for the past two quarters maybe discuss that business and the key drivers of that North American pricing improvement in the quarter. Bucket it up, between F-Series yield management and any others as we might be missing.","Bob Shanks","Yes. I guess, the way I would describe it is first of all, quarters are unpredictable to some extent. But I actually -- as I look ahead based on what we see now for North America, I think every quarter should be a pretty good quarter. There will be plus or minus us where we are this quarter, but I think every quarter looks good, strong. They are benefiting or being hit by the things I touched on earlier. But, in general, I think, strong performance by North America throughout the year.","It will be feature costs that are relatively flat, in fact flat if you exclude the impact of the pension OPEB that I referenced earlier. The volume probably is not going to be as great, so that will be a headwind in parts, best the industry that\u2019s coming through. But in addition what you'll see that will drive the business will be favorable mix and you'll have very strong pricing throughout the year. And against that flat cost, it really just kind of flows right through to the bottom line.","I would refresh everyone's memory. I think we talked about this at Deutsche Bank. There is a new contract this year. So with UAW so in the fourth quarter, in general, there's a large charge that we usually pick up once the ratification is achieved and that\u2019s probably to the tune of about $0.5 billion or so, and I mentioned that back in January. So that would be something that would be unique and one-time in the calendarization of the results in North America this year.","Jim Hackett","And Steven, I got to slip this in because I don't know how close you've been to Ford. But the management team that's running North America is exceptional Kumar Galhotra was put in that job and we're just reviewing today kind of their serial quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter kind of improvements that they've generated.","In fact, he from a method standpoint was one of the first parts of the world to build this new flat agile structure with these energy rooms. This is all serious commitment to moving faster and moving collegially across the company, reducing bureaucracy and it's been copied.","And now I just add that the people leading the other parts of the world have similar kind of talent. So when Bob just talked to you about the way to think about the rest of the year, I was thinking about the guy running it and want to make sure you know how solid he is.","Steven Hempel","Yes. That's definitely helpful. I guess switching gears here internally to South America profit. More so specifically the long-term outlook. It's basically saying that you payback for the currently restructuring this in place which basically roughly flat or breakeven which is clearly an improvement from where we're at today.","But I guess, how do we think about the business long-term? It's -- move back in 2014 you mentioned long-term target of 7% to 9%. I'm not sure if that's really realistic anymore given you're exiting some of the businesses, but maybe this. And I guess is it more realistic to maybe think that Ford will actually exit South America completely and redeploy capital to higher margin businesses?","Jim Hackett","Yes. I think where we are today is consistent message that I've said that we have the right or wrong design in these markets. And so, you're seeing us tackle, both in Europe and South America as examples that are now playing now.","As Jim Farley has talked about the portfolio strategy there, we're working on a better design for South America. And that's -- there is more to come there, but these initiatives to get us in shape so that we have the right cost structure and all that, will be followed by really the right kind of things to win in those markets, with where we want to play with.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. And I wanted to thank -- my congratulations, Bob. The first question is, just turning back to China. I think in the past something else you mentioned that was impacting, was the widening royalty. I think that was an impact in the back half last year. And also, some of the excessive structure in the Shanghai regional office. I was wondering if you could talk about how you think those two things trend as we move through 2019.","Jim Hackett","Yes. We worked hard on both of those.","Bob Shanks","Yes. The net engineering actually is still going to be a substantial drag on the business in an absolute sense, but it will be less so than what it was in 2018. Obviously, part of that very much dependent on the volume, because that is what drives the royalties. And you asked me about the central admin costs. Is that what you're asking me?","Joseph Spak","Yes.","Bob Shanks","Yes. We would expect to see improvement there, probably more second half weighted than first half, as Anning's working through the redesign of his organization. But yes, there will be an improvement in that that will contribute towards the year-over-year lessening of the loss this year.","Joseph Spak","But that's still to come, that's not in the results we're seeing today?","Bob Shanks","I would say its part -- I think, we've seen some improvement in the quarter. There's no question about that, but I think there's more opportunity ahead.","Joseph Spak","Okay. And then, turning back just the question about CO2 compliance in Europe. I understand you're not going to sort of give us the cost. But maybe you could just help us understand \u2013 I mean, it's \u2013 I think it's a mass-based target. So maybe where are you or what is your actual target and where is the portfolio today?","Jim Hackett","As you know, between now and 2025 or compared to 2021, the CO2 targets for our passenger cars and commercial cars are a bit different. And so I think by 2030 the current regulation is about a 30% improvement in \u2013 or reduction in CO2 for LCV and more for passenger cars.","In the short term, obviously, we had the 6.2 emissions last year in the second half, which Ford really weathered very well. And between now and 2021 there's another new set of requirements which we're in a good position for, because of our new lineup. But the requirements in Europe really start to ramp up between 2021 and 2030 with the new regulations from the EU.","Bob Shanks","So the parallel there, Joe \u2013 the parallel is that, it could have been better coincidence, which is at the time we're trying to figure out the redesign in Europe and the product portfolio going forward, we were aware of this kind of influence. So we've been addressing that all along in the strategy.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you. Good evening and Bob congrats. So I want to ask a high level question on North America. I think this is the third quarter in a row where you're growing EBIT with the declining SAAR.","And clearly a lot of the investors with Ford start the analysis looking at the SAAR. When it seems like a lot of your profitability has been driven by the F-Series franchise and so forth, with the fundamental seem very, very different from SAAR and have for a long time.","I guess the question is, as you think about how investors might appreciate results like this. What are the merits and the pros and cons to disclosing the F-Series franchise or the pickup truck franchise separately, to let investors see kind of what's the key drivers away from the SAAR itself?","Jim Hackett","Well, we have the option of doing that. And in fact in a couple of the disclosures we've made over the last what a year or two, we've provided sort of segments and things of that sort of trucks or whatever high-performing products. So we're starting to show you more on the product line basis.","I don't know where that will go frankly. As you know, one of the big changes in our organization has been to provide a much -- I call it the third leg of the stool of the lens of the business. We've got central. We've got scale teams regions.","Now we're going to have a much stronger product line focused. That\u2019s our organization that Jim and Bob talked about at the conference last week or so. So I think -- and in my comments gave you a little bit more texture than what we have in the past. The improvement in North America was driven by the trucks. But I have to tell you also, the improvement was driven by the fact that decision we made around the passenger sedan. That was hundreds of millions of dollars or will be over the course of the year.","So that's not immaterial, but it's something that we have the option of doing I suppose. It\u2019s not how we report the business, but we will be very thoughtful going forward Itay in terms of what we do with this information and form investors going forward, but clearly and I know your thesis and we don't disagree with that Ford Motor Company has a moat of trucks particularly F-Series, but not just F-Series.","We're the biggest player in the world on vans, the Ranger we're number two or three, depends on how you cut it and that\u2019s without North American the mix and know we're going to combine forces to some extent with VW, is also a strong player. So more to come I guess on that.","Itay Michaeli","That's really helpful Bob and then may be got my follow-up, may be for Jim on the expansion in the autonomous development to other cities. Love to get a little bit more color on decision behind that. And the reason I asked because some of the other competitors seem to be consolidating testing in like one particular city just to kind make sure that they are able to kind of conquer that city first.","So love to go understanding of kind of decision to expand that I think you mentioned California testing as well and kind of what's gone into that as well as if you have any kind of updated size of the testing fleet over the next maybe year or so.","Jim Hackett","Yes, I appreciate that Itay. I think, let me -- I'm going to ask Marcy Klevorn to help me with this because she and I just were in Pittsburgh two days ago for a full day reviewing with Jim Farley kind of our development there. I want to report it's -- what a great team we have in Argo AI and take you back to Miami. When we brought investors and media there, I think we got at large really thumbs up for experience -- intentional is the fact that we're testing in some really challenging areas.","I mean I don't want to pick on any competitor because it's not my purpose, but you could put these vehicles in places where the weather never changes. There's not a lot of intense urban kind of challenges, mostly everyone's retired and the roads don\u2019t change a lot. I mean we've opted into some really difficult settings to prove this capability. So Miami's going really well in Washington D.C all of us on the call and the table have been in that city so you know the challenges.","And in fact, the long-term viability of this capability is its ability to work in cities. And so that's why I think you're going to love the Ford position. Now to the direct part of your question in how we're picking cities and where we are going from here, I\u2019ll let Marcy fill in what the plans have been.","Marcy Klevorn","That's a great question and as you say some are choosing to focus in a limited geographic location. And in that regard, it might be easier to wrap up pure like point A to point B miles. So we believe on Jim's comment is that complex miles are more important. And so we're picking cities as Jim side like Miami that are very complex to those at the Miami \u2013 they heard Senator Brandis's opening remarks, he said Miami was a black diamond city. It has so much going on in the city.","And we embrace that and so those who participated or they read about it, saw that it was a Brandis that show that we could handle complex miles, different types of construction, different types of activity in the city, bilingual city and doing that well. So, now we\u2019re on to DC. We've got a third city selected for deployment, which we'll announce later this year, but continue to really build out complex miles.","And in conjunction with that what we also did was we partner with businesses, so we've announced the likes of Chris Meno of Walmart. We\u2019re also partnering with local businesses to become a part of the fabric of the city. And that helps us learn how cities operate in urban settings, very important, it helps us learn how to monetize the autonomous vehicle in the future by working with local businesses and these big partnerships.","And then finally it helps inform the SDS self-driving system software in addition. And that's really important, because over time as standard emerge and legislation takes place, pieces of that will have to be codified and those pieces in the SDS will become a commodity like happens over time in technology.","And so because we're learning these complex situations, because we're learning how we might monetize working with these businesses, we will be left with some IP that will help us set us apart.","And then finally to build on Jim Hackett's idea around human centered design, it helps us really learn more about in these complex situations, how humans want to interact with the vehicle and helps us build those humans center used case into our thinking and into our assessment.","Jim Hackett","Yes. We laughed that if autonomy was only destined for the L.A. freeways, you don't have to deal with dogs and baseballs running across them and no need to recognize that. And so the argument that you see in the press about how intense the LIDAR commitment has to be is a function of that.It's our intent to have these things perform really safely as I've said.","Another interesting thing is that we've been intentional about the way we think about the external environment in the vehicle relating to each other. And I've been on record at the CES talk a year ago, describing how cities are going to be communicating back to the vehicles and vice-versa. We're experimenting with that and all these tests. So there's a lot more in terms of the system's evolution that I think is going to be wonderful to talk about as we get there.","Marcy Klevorn","And to answer your second part of the question about how many vehicles, we'll have 100 on the road by the end of this year.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks.","Jim Hackett","Thank you. And before we close, again I want to welcome Tim. Bob, thank you for incredible service. I want to reinforce four key points. First, we have a solid plan to create value in the near and long-term. We believe we're gaining credibility with you that we're doing as we said.","We also as we said this was a year of action and making these decisions, building momentum with the global redesign of the company as we target sustained improvement across key metrics. And we're mindful of growth, profitably, cash flow and returns as we do that.","Third, our results this quarter clearly demonstrate the benefit of our fitness actions, portfolio decisions that we've labored over and the business redesigns. And we do want to assert that there's more to come there.","And fourth, we want you to know that we really do believe we've delivered a solid quarter. It is not just one thing it's across the board. And we now believe we're on track to deliver better company results for this full year and recognize in parallel that we have a lot of work ahead of us. So thank you for joining the call tonight.","Operator","This concludes the Ford Motor Company First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions, following the prepared remarks.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ted Cannis, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company","All right. Thanks very much, Maria. Good morning and welcome everybody to Ford Motor Company's first quarter 2017 earnings review. Presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; also participating are John Lawler, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO of Ford Smart Mobility; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.","The results today includes some of our non-GAAP references, these are reconciled to the GAAP measures in the appendix of the slides, also today includes Ford's earnings material and Ford Credit's earnings material presentation, as we're no longer holding a Ford Credit calls, so you have an all one-in-one package here.","Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, of course actual results may vary, and most of the significant factors are included in the presentation.","So with that, what we'd like to do is pass over to Mark Fields. Mark?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. As you can see on slide 3, we're focused on three sets of as strategic priorities and importantly taking the actions that will drive value for our shareholders as we expand to an auto and a mobility company. And we are reallocating capital to fortify our core strengths, transform underperforming parts of our business, and investing aggressively but prudently in emerging opportunities. And while we reallocate capital in each of these areas, that decision making is being governed by where to play, where not to play, and how to win. So with that as a backdrop, what I would like to do is take you through our first quarter results.","So in the first quarter, as you can see on slide 4, we delivered total company adjusted pre-tax profit of $2.2 billion, which was lower than our best ever quarterly profit a year ago. Importantly, revenue was up and that reflects favorable mix. All the other key metrics were down and our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.39. We're reaffirming that we will remain on plan for our full-year guidance and we continue to expect total company adjusted pre-tax profit to be about $9 billion this year with stronger profits in 2018.","Now, turning to slide 5, our strategic priorities are focused on the four drivers of shareholder value \u2013 growth, risk, returns, and rewards. So let me take you through each one of these.","In terms of growth, we grew our top-line in the quarter with company revenue up 4% and that was driven by favorable mix. Here in the U.S. our average transaction prices increased by nearly four times the industry average. Lincoln sales continue to show improvement. They were up 24% globally in the quarter and that was 9% in the U.S. and 114% in China..","In terms of risk, we're sitting at $28 billion in cash, which provides both protection in the current business environment, but also reflects the potential for strategic acquisitions and other prudent investments in the years ahead. In addition to that we remain fit for any future downturn in North America with a healthy breakeven SAAR at 11 million units in the U.S. And finally in terms of risk, our global funded pension plans are nearly fully funded and de-risked. And Ford Credit continues to be disciplined while at the same time being a very healthy contributor to our bottom line.","In returns, we had $2 billion in cash flow in the quarter. We delivered our eighth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. And we had our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements across all key metrics in South America, and that includes market share.","And then finally in terms of rewards, shareholders benefited from our continued success and also our strong cash generation, as we distributed $800 million in the quarter. And that includes a supplemental dividend that totaled $200 million.","Turning to slide 6, this summarizes the progress that we're making on executing our strategic priorities. And we are fortifying our profit pillars, including our leadership and strong global franchise in trucks. We've announced that we'll be launching an upgraded F-150 in the second half of the year and reintroducing Ranger to North America in 2019. And this introduction will help us expand our 40-year leadership in full-size trucks, while introducing a competitive entry into the U.S. midsize pickup segment \u2013 pickup truck segment with an addressable retail market of more than $12 billion.","In utilities, we introduced the all-new Expedition, which is a critical vehicle in helping us capture market share in the small but lucrative full-size SUV segment. We also announced the global introduction of Bronco coming in 2020.","And in performance, we have a true global leader with our Mustang. Mustang is now sold in 140 countries. And Mustang was the best selling sports car in the world in 2016. And to reinforce our continued leadership and to fortify that pillar in performance, our new 2018 Mustang is coming this fall.","When it comes to transforming traditionally underperforming parts of our business, our transformation of Lincoln continues to gain momentum. We introduced the first all-new Lincoln Navigator in more than a decade. And we also announced plans to manufacture an all-new Lincoln SUV in China for the Chinese market, which will have the benefits of improving profitability and cash flow, while at the same time allowing us to better respond to market needs more quickly.","And when it comes to growing in the emerging opportunities, I think we've clearly laid out our electrification strategy, playing to our strengths and electrifying vehicles to provide more capability and productivity and performance and better fuel economy for our customers. And I believe a prime example of this is our unveiling a couple of weeks ago of the industry's first pursuit-rated hybrid police car. And I believe that further cements our strong franchise among law enforcement and cities by delivering a hybrid vehicle that will power the high electrical loads of a police vehicle, but also reduce engine runtime and reducing emissions.","So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Bob. And he'll take us through the details of our business performance.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay, Mark, thanks. And good morning, everybody. On slide 8, that's where we'll start. And what I'll do \u2013 as usual, Mark has already touched on a number of the metrics on the slide, I will also cover some of the other ones later in the presentation. So I want to focus my comments here only on the things that you will only see on this particular slide.","So let's start first with the special items pre-tax sort of in the middle of the slide. You can see they came in at a favorable $24 million, $210 million better than a year ago. And that is driven by the fact that we reassessed the cancellation charges associated with the cancellation of our plant in Mexico. We booked that in the fourth quarter. It was $199 million. We've taken that down by $46 million, so the cancellations charges on that basis would be $153 million. So that's what's driving the $24 million. The balance are European separation costs.","When you look at the year-over-year, the $210 million good news is lower separation costs associated with our European restructuring actions, as well as that $46 million improvement in the cancellation charge that's related to Mexico.","The second point I want to make is around our adjusted effective tax rate. It came in at 28.6% for the quarter. That was 80 basis points better than a year ago and consistent with our full-year guidance of an adjusted effective tax rate of about 30%.","And then the last point is on the lower right of the slide in the text. We came in with an adjusted EPS of $0.39. Only about a month ago I suppose, I guided to $0.30 to $0.35 based on what we were looking at at that time. The $0.39, that difference is due to favorable timing of cost performance and wholesale volume largely in North America. But we did see some good news in other parts of the business. So this is timing. And we don't see it having any impact on our outlook for the full year.","All right. Let's move on to slide 9. What we're looking at here is total company absolutes and the reporting segment absolutes. So we have solid results for the total company. Solid results for automotive at $2 billion, which made up the bulk of the company's results. Solid results in the financial services segment at $466 million and within that Ford Credit at $481 million, which we'll cover a bit later. And then, to the far right, you can see all other, a loss of $212 million. Most of that, in fact almost all of that, was net interest expense on our automotive debt. There was a very small loss at our FSM, Ford Smart Mobility LLC.","And then when you go below the chart, you can see the changes on a year-over-year basis. And I want to spend a little bit of time here. And I'll do this in selective places throughout my comments this morning.","In the lower left you can see a decline of $1.6 billion in the quarter year-over-year and this was against last year's record results. We have guided for the full year to a total company adjusted pre-tax profit at $9 billion. Last year, we made $10.4 billion. So we're expecting a decline year-over-year of roughly $1.4 billion.","Effectively, that decline has happened this quarter. Now when we look at the next three quarters, they will be up and down. But if we look at the aggregate of the second, third and fourth quarters, and compare that to the same period in 2016, we expect those results to be essentially flat to a little bit better. So effectively, this is the quarter in which the full year decline flows through to our full year results.","When we think about what's going to happen in terms of our absolutes, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest absolute. And that's going to be driven by normal seasonal factors, the plant shutdowns in the U.S. and Europe, but also the launch of the Expedition and the Navigator.","So with that let's move on to the next slide, slide 10. This is the Automotive segment absolute results. So a $2 billion total profit. You can see North America, Europe and Asia Pacific profitable with losses in South America and Middle East and Africa. And when you go below the chart, you can see that all of the operations were down on a year-over-year basis with the exception of South America with an improvement.","Go to the following slide. And here we're looking at the key metrics for the Automotive segment. They're all down across the board with the exception of revenue. You can see revenue is up a bit and that is driven by favorable mix. These metrics were in the context of a global industry that was about flat on a year-over-year basis. As you look at our market share, our market share was down three-tenths of a point that was driven by China and by the U.S., and we'll get into the details on that when we get to the appropriate regional slides.","Let's go to the following slide. So this is what drove the change in profitability for the Automotive segment. So $1.6 billion for the company, $1.5 billion in Automotive, so this is where almost all the decline for the company occurred. And as you look at it, you can see there are three major drivers; one, unfavorable costs. So if you look at contribution cost, structural cost, that's a $1.2 billion, so a $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion was cost increase, and we'll talk about that in detail.","Secondly, is lower volume. So if you look at the volume and mix and look at the callout box above that, you can see we had $400 million of good news on mix, so that positive story continues in the quarter. So we had about $0.5 billion of unfavorable performance related to volume, that was the second factor. And the third was around exchange, and that was driven by the sterling, that's the Brexit effect that's coming true, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real.","So in terms of cost, the cost performance was basically around higher warranty expense. So we had guided to during the quarter about a $300 million increase related to recall, so that's one effect. We also had increased reserves for coverages, engineering expense, so that is not actually emerging opportunities, that is increases related to as, Mark was talking about relocation of capital to our fortified pillars, so this is around those utilities, the five new utilities we've guided to between now and the end of the year. So you're seeing the engineering come true for that, as well as on trucks and advancing commercial vehicles. Product cost that's basically the effect of the launches that we had last year post first quarter, and Super Duty is the biggest one which took place in the second half. So on a year-over-year business we are seeing that cost because it actually wasn't in the first quarter a year ago. And finally, commodities, we'll talk about that in the next slide.","So when we look at the full year for cost, we're up a $1.2 billion in the quarter. So how should we think about that? If you look at the lower left or rather the left side of the slide, this is what we're expecting for the full year, it's just a bit more than a $1.2 billion. So, again, just as I talked about on process, for cost, our view is that basically the cost increase that we're seeing in the quarter is a cost increase that flows through to the full year.","When you look at the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarters individually, there will be some ups and downs. But again, if I look at the aggregate of those quarters, cost should be effectively flat or maybe up a little bit. Now this is the same slide that we showed at Deutsche Bank when we gave our initial guidance for the year. The pattern of ups and downs is exactly the same as what we talked about at Deutsche Bank.","If you go to the far right of the slide, those are the increases related to emerging opportunities, those are the investments and costs in electrification, autonomy, mobility, connectivity, data and analytics. That is going to represent about two-thirds of the full year cost increase. So if you take that bar, move it all the way to the left, that's about two-thirds of that. The balance is basically the net of the rest, which is around the core business.","We're still expecting to see efficiencies net of economics of about nearly $3 billion, and that is net of commodity increases of over a $1 billion. So those efficiencies mostly offset the investments in the core business also price related design, which actually brings revenue with that, and also regulatory cost. So this is our view for the full year. So just as just as with profits, we think most of the cost increase for the full year has happened in the quarter closer to the full year..","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And let me just make an additional comment and explanation point on cost, We are continuing our intense focus on cost and the reason for that is not only mindful of the current environment that we're in, but also I think preparing us even more for a downturn scenario, which we've talked to you about in the past.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Let's move on to the first of the regions, North America. Many of the things I talked about for the Automotive segment apply directly to North America. So these are the key metrics. You can see they're lower with the exception of revenue and as with the Automotive segment, that revenue is driven by favorable mix. This was in an industry that was down about 300,000 units that was both for the region, but it was driven by the U.S.","Our market share was lower for the region, it was driven again by the U.S., market share in the U.S. was down 0.4, that was more than explained by fleet. Fleet was down six-tenths of point. Within that, about half of that was rental, the rest was a commercial and government lease, we think that's largely timing. That was offset partially by an improved retail share that was up to two-tenths of a point and that was strong performance of that series, our utilities and also Lincoln.","Let's move to the next slide and look at the decline in profitability. For North America, $1.1 billion from the record results last year. And you can see it's exactly the same pattern of things that I talked about for the Automotive segment, and it's exactly the same reason. So I won't go into details here, but that pattern continued here.","In terms of guidance for the full year, it's essentially the same thing that I said earlier. We're expecting North America to be solid in terms of its actually strong portfolio results but down from last year. It's going to be driven due to higher cost. We think we'll also see some efficiencies coming through in all the other cost categories that will give us partial offset. We also see exchange as being unfavorable. And the majority just as we talked about for the total business and automotive, the majority of North Americas full year profit decline and increase in cost has occurred in the first quarter.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","So if we turn to slide 16, what I'd like to do is just dive a bit deeper into our disciplined approach to the marketplace. So for example, if you look at the upper left of the chart here, our average transaction prices in the first quarter grew nearly four times faster than the industry, and that's really due to the great performance of F-Series and the continued growth of Lincoln as I mentioned earlier.","In addition, like F-150, we reinvested some of the Super Duty aluminum weight savings into capability and features, our customers appreciate and most importantly, are willing to pay for. We also saw F-150 transaction prices increase with strong demand for the new Raptor. At the same time, we also continued our disciplined approach to incentives. And while incentives grew for the industry, as you can see, Ford levels were relatively flat as we managed supply and demand well and that we benefit obviously from the strength of our new products.","If you look at stocks, our U.S. stocks are in very good shape and we continue to take a disciplined approach to matching production to demand. And just a note, our day supply, Ford's day supply tends to be slightly higher than the industry average, because of our stronger position in trucks due to the large number of product configurations which is a real strength of ours.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay, let's move on to South America and this is a story of improvement. This is the second consecutive quarter where all the metrics have improved and this was in an industry that actually did grow. You can see the SAAR was up 3%, Brazil unfortunately didn't grow but the positive sign was that in the month of March for the first time in 24 months we had a monthly improvement in the SAAR. So we are seeing positive signs even if Brazil starts to show up.","We did generate positive revenue in the quarter and that was around volume, pricing and exchange. And our market share was up and that was on the back of the strength of the Ka, our sub-compact, as well as the Ranger.","If we go to the following slides, we can see what happened in terms of causal factor. It was driven by higher net pricing and volume. Those are the key drivers. Inflation, what was behind the total cost increase and then you can see the exchange, which was driven by the real.","In terms of guidance, we are seeing signs of improvement in the economic environment of South America. PMIs are looking better, consumer confidence is better, the Central Bank has been cutting its policy rates pretty aggressively and so we believe that we are close to the trough of this current economic cycle. As a result, we continue to believe that the South America will see an improvement in terms of loss this year relative to last year and that will be driven by the favorable market factors tied to the economic recovery. We think most of the improvement for the full year will take place in the second half of the year. And that's tied to the momentum that we expect to start to occur in terms of the economic environment.","All right. Let's move to Europe. Europe had another profitable quarter, the eighth in a row. So feel very, very good about what's happening in Europe despite the effects of Brexit. We are seeing a growing industry in which we gained shares. So very positive overall performance across our European business. You can see that revenue was up that was driven by volume and mix. The share was up. This was driven by Cougar and our commercial vehicles. And once again in the quarter, the Ford brand was the number one selling commercial vehicle brand in the market. So feel very good about that performance.","When you go to the following slide and look what's behind the results, you can see that the results were profitable, they were down on a year-over-year basis and this was due to higher cost. Some of that associated with the launch of the all new Fiesta. Some of it related to increased manufacturing costs to support the higher volume that we're projecting for the full year, but also related to recall. So Europe was one of the business units that was affected by the recalls that we announced during the first quarter. About $100 million affected their results for that particular factor.","In terms of our outlook for Europe, we continue to expect Europe to remain profitable, although at levels below 2016. The key factors driving the decline are going to be the weaker sterling, but also higher costs particularly associated with the launch of the Fiesta and the EcoSport, which is coming later this year, as well as for continued investment for future growth. We do expect to see favorable market factors and we saw in the quarter again, and we expect the full year to see a continued improvement in Russia.","The majority of the full-year profit decline in 2016 is expected to occur in the first half of this year due to cost and stock effects related to the Fiesta launch and also the major recall I just referenced that took place in the first quarter.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","So let me just provide a couple of additional comments on European business. And I just want to reemphasize that we remain committed to our strategy in Europe, as you know, which has been focused on product, brand, and cost. And taken the actions necessary to ensure that our business not only remains competitive, but also delivers sustainable returns. So on that, on the revenue side, we'll continue to take actions to increase the mix of higher margin vehicles and that includes adding the ST-Line for both EcoSport and S-MAX in the second half of this year, and also launching what we call the active and then the Vignale trim levels on the new Fiesta. So, work on the revenue side of the equation.","But let me also just talk about in terms of what we see in the market and addressing specifically the drop in diesel demand in Europe. The industry in the quarter was down about 4 points to 46%, our mix is about 45%, so just a tad lower. And our product and our manufacturing plant is flexible and I believe we're well positioned to meet customer demand and also the regulatory compliance through the success of our EcoBoost engines, but also our plans for electrification in the region. And the diesel engines that we have, meet the stringent Stage VI requirements.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay, let's move on to Middle East and Africa. And here the story is basically one word, it's volume. The volume is affecting every metric that you can see here on the page. Decline in volume the industry in which we participate, that excludes primarily Iran as the major market that we don't participate in. You can see that SAAR was down 12%. We've also seen lower market share. That's primarily in the Middle East where we've had some performance issues and also we had adverse market mix. So volume is the story in terms of the metrics.","And Middle East and Africa and if you go to the following slide, you can see that very, very clearly here the causal factor slide, $124 million more than explained by the volume decline. You can see across the rest of the business the team has done a great job of managing pricing, keeping that flat. And cost performance has been favorable and we're seeing some good news on the exchange and that's related to the South African rand.","For the full year, we continue to expect Middle East and Africa to improve compared with 2016 and that's going to be driven by lower cost and favorable exchange with lower volume being a partial offset. We do expect that the year-over-year improvement will largely be realized in the second half of the year.","If we move on now to Asia-Pacific, and Asia-Pacific is actually a two story, so there is a China story and there is a story in the rest of the region. China, this was a challenging quarter. You can see the industry was down 1.6 million units, which more than explain the decline in the overall region. This was the effective payback into the fourth quarter from the stronger fourth quarter performance related to customer expectation that the purchase tax incentive would be eliminated at the end of the year, as it turned out only half of it was, but clearly had an effect on the industry. It had an effect on us. Our share is down and that was largely around the units that were most affected by that purchase tax incentive that was the escort and the focus.","And when you look at our JVs, you can see it affected them as well. We are under good profit of $274 million on a net basis with a margin of 13%, but that was down on a full-year basis.","The other part of the story is around the rest of the region. The rest of the region was profitable, every market other than India was profitable. And every market including India improved on a year-over-year basis.","If we got to the next slide and look at the factors behind the change in Asia-Pacific largely driven by what happened in China, and you can see that with the net pricing that's the negative industry pricing in China. The volume effect. And then you can see we're able to hold cost flat and a bit of exchange that was more than explained by the weakness of the renminbi.","For the full year we continue to expect to be profitable in Asia-Pacific and to actually improve versus 2016. And that's going to be due to higher volume, we believe, we'll see recovery of volume in the balance of the year. We expect cost to be about flat. We will continue to see negative net pricing and we do expect to see adverse exchange related to the weaker renminbi.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And as Bob mentioned, obviously the China tax incentive change drove a pull ahead in sales of cars obviously with the smaller than the 1.6 liter engines into the fourth quarter of last year. But there is no doubt we faced higher competition, and also our own market performance issues in China. And we've taken actions to respond, and that includes changes in our go-to-market plan. And we do expect to return to growth in China from the second quarter onwards through the balance of the year as both the industry strengthens and our go-to-market changes take effect in the marketplace.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Let's move into Ford Credit. There has been a lot of concern, lot of articles written, lot of papers written over auto financing in the broadest sense of the word, and we've actually been talking about that for a year. All I can tell you is that we feel like we're in a really good place with Ford Credit and with Ford, based on what we see today, what we know today, and how we've kind of factored that into our outlook.","If you look at the metrics here, you can see on the second set of data there that the business grew, managed receivables were up 6%, pre-tax results fell only 6% to $481 million. When you look at some of the portfolio metrics, the next three sets of data, the FICO score is very, very strong at 741, that's on average. You can see delinquencies are up a bit, but still below the historical experience that we've had, but it's moving up, it's still not even at that level. And then in terms of the loss-to-receivables, it's approaching historical performance, but still at a very healthy level.","So the portfolio is performing as we had expected in the environment that we had expected. And that's because the team continues to follow the same tried and true disciplined and consistent practices around servicing and origination that we've been following for many, many years.","If you go to the following slide and you look at the decline of $33 million of profitability and look at the very middle, it's around the lease residuals. And that's the supplemental depreciation that the team has taken in response to what we have seen in terms of auction values. The rest of the factors on a net basis actually improved, driven by the favorable volume and mix of the business on a global basis. So nothing this year that to us is a surprise or was unexpected.","If you go to the following slide, looking at financing trends, again everything in line with our expectations. If you look at the upper left in terms of our lease share as a percent of retail sales, you can see that both the industry and ourselves are beginning to pull back, if you compare that back to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to track below the industry, largely because of our product mix. If you look at auction values in the upper right, we actually saw a sequential improvement in auction values, that's seasonality.","If you look at the 2017 first quarter versus 2016 first quarter, that's a 7% decline in auction values. That's consistent with the industry. Our view for the full year is that it will be about 6% on average. So you'll see ups \u2013 different factors by quarter point-to-point, but on average about 6%. And everything we see says that we're on track for that.","On the lower left, everything looks good in terms of what we're seeing relative to reposition ratios and severity. And we've already covered the LTRs in the lower right. So again, everything is very much in line with our expectations.","And then on the next slide, we just tried to capture everything that we've been looking at and everything we've been reading about in terms of concerns and trends around the financing industry. And our view is that both Ford and Ford Credit's outlooks have incorporated these industry trends appropriate. And as a result Ford Credit itself is on track for the profit that we've guided to for the full year of $1.5 billion with an expectation that the results will improve in 2018 as a result of less supplemental depreciation.","If we go to the following slide, which is slide 29. So this is around cash flow, so solid performance on cash flow. If you look at the first \u2013 maybe the fourth line there I guess. Automotive segment pre-tax profit at $2 billion, it basically flowed right through to the operating cash flow. So the negative net spend was completely offset by the combination of the working capital and the timing differences.","If you look at the capital spending of $1.7 billion, it suggests to us that we're on track to the full year guidance of $7 billion. If you go further down the page, you can see the changes in debt, $200 million. That is just us making normal debt repayments.","The pension contributions in the quarter of $200 million, that's in line with our full year plan of $1 billion, no change there. And in terms of the shareholder distributions, Mark mentioned that. That's in line with our plan for the year of $2.7 billion.","And then finally for me on the balance sheet, very simply put, auto cash liquidity balance is strong. So Automotive is looking strong, Ford Credit is looking strong, well-capitalized, strong liquidity. And when we go down and look at the pensions, everything that we're seeing right now relative to asset returns, discount rates, our plan contributions would suggest that our funded status at the end of the year should improve compared with the end of last year.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Thanks, Bob. So since our last discussion, we've updated some of our expectations for the full year industry sales for all the major markets. So if we look at the new news here on slide 31, it's really within the industry. And we now expect Brazil to be slightly higher in 2017. And that reflects, as Bob mentioned, better performance from the fleet sector.","In Europe, we expect industry volume to be slightly higher compared to our prior guidance in 2017 and 2018. And that really reflects gains across most of the EU 20 markets with the exception of the UK.","And then turning to China, we expect the industry volume to be higher at 28.2 million units in 2017 and then flat in 2018. And that really reflects the positive economic momentum that we've seen in the first quarter.","Just a note, we continue to expect the U.S. to decline slightly this year but remaining at a historically high level.","On slide 32, our 2017 company outlook continues to be consistent with the previous guidance.","And then turning to our business unit guidance on slide 33, you can see our latest assessment of what we call puts and takes for each of the regions or segments, compared to the results from a year ago.","And while our guidance remains unchanged, we are seeing a significant increase in headwinds from higher commodities. And that's mainly steel. But we see it across most commodity groups. And as I mentioned earlier, we're increasing our efforts to deliver greater cost efficiencies across all parts of the business to mitigate this headwind and, of course, further improve the fitness of our overall business.","Turning to slide 34, again we expect total company adjusted pre-tax profit this year to be about $9 billion. And that sets up a platform for a stronger result in 2018. We do expect this improvement to be led by gains in our core business, and that's thanks to the full-year availability of important new high margin vehicles like the Navigator and the Expedition. But we also expect F-Series to continue to perform well in the market.","As Bob mentioned, we also anticipate Ford Credit to benefit from lower supplemental depreciation. And at the same time we'll continue to invest in the emerging opportunities that will drive not only future growth for the company, but profitability as well.","So putting it all together on slide 35, we delivered a solid quarter. And again we continue to expect to deliver another good year for this year in line with our previous guidance.","And then just wrapping it up on slide 36 before we open it up for Q&A. We have a very clear vision and strategy for our business going forward. We remain fully focused on the strategic priorities that will drive value as we continue our expansion to an auto and a mobility company. We're focused on fortifying our core strengths, transforming the underperforming parts of our business, and investing aggressively, but also prudently, in emerging opportunities.","And I believe that we're already well along the process of transforming our business from a business that's a strong, healthy automotive company to one that will be even stronger and bigger going forward. And as usual we look forward to sharing with you our progress throughout the year.","And with that I'd like to have my colleagues join me. And we can take any questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a reminder, we will take calls from the investment community first, followed by questions from the news media. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Actually talking about the last slide, you talk about transform and the focus on luxury, small car and emerging opportunities. Can you give any color on what is the timeline for getting those on track and fixed? In particular there has been a lot of chatter around small cars, those may be possibly losing money. And any plans how could you get those back to profitability?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Colin, it's Mark. And as you said, we're going to stay very focused on our strategy of fortify, transform and grow. As you think of the transform areas, listen, in some of these cases we've said it's a journey and we want to show continual improvement. And if you look at each one of those areas, if you look at luxury, we've talked about not only the sales growth that we've had with Lincoln. But if you look at what I call the hygiene factors of the brand in terms of how the brand is viewed, in terms of customers set, both on the service and sales end, both here in the U.S. and in China, we made a lot of progress. We've announced the localization of production of our Lincoln SUV in China which is going to help the profitability. So we're seeing, we have very clear metrics around this, we're on plan and as we said, going back to our Investor Day, we want to make sure that our sales success is matched with financial success with Lincoln and we're in the process of making improvements on that journey.","In the case of small vehicles, again we've talked about some of the key elements that drive small vehicle profitability, reducing complexity and we've talked about how we significantly reduce complexity of vehicles like our Focus and Fiesta and continue that going forward with the next models. We've talked about low cost production and we've been very clear in moving our production here in North America for our small vehicles to low-cost areas, and even in the case of Europe with the launch of EcoSport in Romania. So we're going to continue to make progress on that, and show you the proof-points along the way.","And then finally, in emerging markets, obviously last year we took actions to exit some markets and also to close our plant in Australia, which is one of the reasons, as Bob mentioned, outside of China, our operations are profitable, including Australia. And we've said we're in the process of examining our strategy in India, and when we have something to talk about, we will. But we will continue to work this, and keep you apprised.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Actually on your last point, that was one of the more interesting comments when Bob's going through his question \u2013 commentary. So when we look at Asia Pac, we take out China, it's losing about a $150 million, but everything except India is actually making money. So is India really losing? Is that the pace and what can you do to kind of address that? Or is there other factors in that $150 million loss that I'm not thinking about?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, let me \u2013 just to be clear, first of all, China made money in the quarter, and you have to remember that China has a number of different components, it's the JVs, it's Lincoln, it's the imported Ford brand, it's also charges that we hold centrally like around engineering that we're incurring today that would be compensated for in the future through royalties from the JVs. So China made money. Outside of China, we made money. In fact the only major market that didn't make money was India, and India improved. So, we saw improvement everywhere through the region outside of China, and we're profitable.","So, it was, if you will, both sides of the equation were working for us in terms of profitability in the region. But yeah, as we talked about, China was a challenge in this market. I mentioned, we do expect and are restarting to see signs of that improvement both in terms of the overall market but around performance as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you for taking our questions this morning. I think the first one I want to harp on is we've seen a lot of the bank's earnings so far this year and \u2013 or this quarter, and most of them talk about pulling back on their auto loan profiles. So it seems as if credit is somewhat tightening from that perspective.","Do you anticipate or do you expect to grow your asset base within Ford Motor Credit as you might see a little bit more challenging times for customers being able to get loans from your third-party partners or from other lenders?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, let me comment first and then I'll turn it over to Marion, CFO at Ford Credit, if he has anything he wants to add. But we are growing. I mean, you saw that in the first quarter. We would expect to see growth for the full year. It's not just here but it's around the world. And I think you also have to remember what the role of Ford Credit is. For the role of Ford Credit in Ford is to be there, good times, bad times, I mean that's why the practices that we follow around origination and servicing. We've been through the good and the bad and we know how to manage the business appropriately in either condition, which is why we believe that we were ahead of recognizing some of these factors that are now being written about so much across the region. But we think that we will grow over the balance of the year and we think that it will grow in a way that's very healthy and supportive of the overall business.","Marion, do you want to add anything?","Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.","Sure, Bob. The growth is much around the world as it is in the U.S. And with plateauing sales in the U.S., our growth in receivables here is really not that large. And for all the \u2013 although we've seen written about in the press, we have seen a number of banks start to pull away from deep sub-prime lending or longer-term financing, but it's really at a plateauing kind of level. And so we haven't seen a real retrenchment yet. And as Bob said, this is the value of a captive to ensure that we're able to support Ford when banks come and go.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just following up on that, is there a specific total asset base or total level that you'd get up to or maybe you'd stop yourself at?","Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.","We haven't guided on a number like that, we wouldn't expect it to continue to grow. But with North American volumes plateauing, we don't expect dramatic growth.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And just my second question. So I look at the European profit segment, it look like incentives were much more of a headwind this year or this quarter than it was previously and net pricing was down year-over-year. But on slide 33, you are effectively looking for the full year to see a positive net pricing. So I'm just wondering, what you're expecting in the back half of the year or even in the second quarter onward from a pricing perspective within that region?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","When you look at our European business, obviously the net pricing that we have was taken away by incentives and that's really where we are in the cycle of some of our product, some of our key products in Europe that are ageing. Maybe example I'll use is Fiesta, we're on run out on that right now and that represents 20% \u2013 25% of our volume in Europe. So we do expect is when we launch the vehicle and what I mentioned earlier around some of the new additions, in terms of the high-end that is \u2013 that's the physical, if you will, that will, you kind of flip the outlook for the remainder of the year once it's launched at the back-end of the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Had a couple of questions. First on Europe. How do you \u2013 just given the declines in diesel that we're seeing in the market broadly, I was wondering if you can share some perspective on how are you think companies are going to behave effectively, I think, that as a result of the CO2 emissions are basically moving backward, just given that diesels are more CO2 efficient. So is that something that is a risk for that region, this spending on equal (45:48) or other technologies need to accelerate versus the prior plan or do you think that the industry starts to incentivize diesel a little bit more to support demand?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I think a lot of that, around that, Rod, is also going to be based on what some of the tax regimes are in the various governments, but it's very clear, as you know, that both consumer sentiment and regulation are going to \u2013 we believe are going to continue to reduce diesel. And that's why I think we're well positioned for a couple of reasons. First off, what we're not seeing is we're not seeing diesel demand decrease in the commercial vehicle end of the business. And as you know, that is a very important piece of our business in Europe and from a profitability standpoint.","At the same time, even though we're not seeing it, we are making the investments, which are in some of our emerging areas. As you know, we're going to be introducing a plug-in transit, hybrid transit in 2019 into the region. And as you get back to the passenger vehicle side, our belief is we're well positioned from a couple of different aspects. One, manufacturing flexibility. if people swing more back to obviously petrol engines, we have the capability to have that flexibility and we also have, as I mentioned in my comments, we built a very strong brand around EcoBoost engines. At the same time to your question of whether we have to spend more, I mean we are, we've laid out our electrification plan and then includes Europe. So I think, our plans to introduce not only a plug-in hybrid transit, but also some of the other vehicles that we've talked about will serve us well.","And we'll have to see how the market behaves in terms of incentive spendings in the interim, I mean, you've seen a number of our competitors make a number of announcements of moving towards electrification et cetera. But I think either way, we'll be prepared for that.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And switching gears to China, I was hoping you can give us a sense of, the full year earnings expectation there, maybe you can define and quantify some of the key earnings drivers that are within your control and also what some of the factories you considered when \u2013 it looks like you are assuming flat demand into 2018.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I didn't (48:10) guide to China, we guided to the region. So in terms of the region, as I said, we expect to improve, we think that will be driven by higher volume that includes China. So that will be the industry that Mark talked about, we also believe and we are already seen it in the month of April that will \u2013 our own performance will pick up from where it had been in the first quarter. And that's against a backdrop of cost that we expect to be flat. They were actually flat as you saw in the quarter. We think, they will be flat for the full year, So that will be partially offset that by the pricing that we talked about and the exchange. But it will basically be around volume.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And just lastly, really quick, you mentioned U.S. auction values down about $1,150 year-over-year. Pricing in the new car market is not down to the same extent. And I was wondering if you could just kind of square that for us and from a consumer's perspective, obviously there is an impact on affordability, but are you seeing any effects on mix or is it basically volume pressure that's coming in as a result of that?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, as you saw in the quarter, we had favorable mix. I do think, in North America, when we look at the balance of the year that -well, hold onto the mix improvement that we've been getting over the last number of quarters, I don't think that you'll see that for the full year, I think, in terms of an improvement. I think, we'll see probably mix about flat, if not a little bit lower, because the comps obviously get tougher as you get into, but we had Super Duty in the second half of last year and so forth.","So, I think, the mix improvement in North America on a year-over-year basis will probably end in the second half of the year. We do expect that we'll still see negative pricing in North America for the full year on a year-over-year basis. So we actually we're a bit positive in the quarter, but we've actually factored in some negative pricing in the second half of the year. And again, that's related to some of the timing of launches that we had last year, which helped us actually on that front.","So, I think, we've factored in both an end of mix improvement year-over-year, we have factored in continued negative pricing other than the first quarter. And we've also factored in a lower industry. So we think that we've got a pretty good handle in terms of \u2013 I'll call it the cyclical pressures that you're talking about that are affecting the region.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. You previously communicated, I think, at your Investor Day that embedded in your 2017 guidance is an expectation for the Super Duty to be a year-on-year headwind to profits on increased cost to manufacturer, or higher amortization of tooling et cetera. At the same time, looking at your slide deck today, your ATP is on slide 16 are externally strong, and you're driving good mix benefits as shown on slide 15, that's not all Super Duty, I'm sure But I'm curious, if \u2013 and my question is, if maybe the price and the mix benefit of this vehicle might be outperforming your expectations, and how that is netting out against the cost of the vehicle relative to your expectations?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I would say that's a good observation, I would say that everything is coming out better than what we had expected, not just on Super Duty but F-150. The volumes are stronger, we have grown share, the pricing has been better, the mix has been stronger, we've actually seen some favorable performance on cost. So I think everything right across the board on the whole Super Duty lineup has been good. Of course we've got \u2013 diesel is coming in as well. So that's going to be another better and ahead of F-Series in terms of what we can do to attract consumers in the segment. So I agree with you, everything is better than what we had expected when we talked about that about a year or so ago.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","And I would just reemphasize, this is another example of how we are fortifying the profit pillars, because when you look -Bob mentioned our overall F-Series performance and not only were our transaction prices up significantly and much more than the competition, but our share of the segment, our share of the full-sized segment is over 38% now. So it's up over a 1.5 point in the first quarter. So customers are really seeing the value and the capability that we've made and the investments and the aluminum body and the high-strength steel frame. And we're not resting on our laurels. We know we have the updated the freshened F-150 coming in the fall of this year, then we have the Ranger coming, et cetera. We're going to continue to reinforce this profit pillar and as I've talked about in the past kind of build out our moats around this because it's such an important part of our business.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great to hear. Thanks. And then just lastly for me, probing the implications of GM's exit from Europe. Firstly, is the sale of Opel\/Vauxhall to PSA a threat because it makes a stronger competitor with more scale or is it instead maybe an opportunity because it removes weaker competitor that was maybe competing on price?","And then secondly, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're committed to your operations in Europe and of course you had a really great 2016 there. But can you just sort of summarize for the investors what you think are maybe the biggest differences between your European operations and GMs such that staying in Europe is the right thing for you to do, for your shareholders, even if leaving was the right thing for theirs?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, again, I'll just talk to Ford. In the case of the PSA purchase of Opel, I think the answer to your first part of your question is yes in that I think there is some opportunities, particularly near-term opportunities and we're actually seeing that in the marketplace right , in terms of share and things of that nature. I also think, longer term it does take out one more competitor. At the same time, we have a bigger competitor. And I think we're factoring that into our plans.","In terms of Europe, as we go forward, I won't kind of do a comparison. But I think from our standpoint, our business, we have \u2013 we're going to stay focused as I mentioned on that strategy of product, brand and cost. And importantly, our strategy in Europe is really to play to our strengths. Commercial vehicles, utilities which we've grown a lot and where the market is moving, one out of every Ford vehicles on the passenger side, part of the market in Europe last quarter was SUVs and performance vehicles.","And as we do that, we can leverage kind of our global scale and technology at the same time, as we go into not only improving our petrol engines, but electrification and diesel. And the other element that's different is, remember, we decided to stay in Russia. And you heard from Bob, we're seeing improvement in that Russia business. So this is where we take a point of view on the future, we put a plan together, it starting to bear fruit and its' helping our European business.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Galliers of Evercore ISI.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Just following on from Rod's questions around diesel. I was wondering if you could give any indication of your exposure to diesel of residual values in Europe, and have you made any adjustment to those given declining share changes in consumer sentiments and clearly political risk?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, in terms of lease, I think we actually provided some data on that at the last chat event back in March. We actually do almost no leasing in Europe. And so from that regard, which is a different than some of the competitors that we're up against in Europe, so from that regard, there is no lease exposure relative to residuals. If you think about just the overall market in terms of residual values, I mean that would, depending upon how that plays out as Mark was talking about, I think that would be impacted, would be an industry effect that we would have to deal with as it happens. But it wouldn't be an impact that would affect leasing, because we don't do that to any significant degree in Europe.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","The only other think I'd add, George, is when you look at \u2013 and I mentioned our mix in Europe is about 45% diesels, which is about a point or two below the industry. But if you look at the UK, which is our largest market, represents 30% of our sales, our diesel mix is somewhere in the neighborhood of around 35%. And that's just due to the mix of our products, right. We're selling more SUVs, more larger vehicles, and so we're \u2013 I think we're \u2013 it's an important market for us and we're below the rest of the industry.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, another thing too is that it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. But if there is that kind of shift, you would think it would also start to give you a bounce on, in terms of the residual values of the petrol vehicle, because of the consumer movement into that and the demand for the petrols relative to diesels. So it's not just one way.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. And just to be clear, and I probably should know the answer to this, you're not underlying on your retail products on this sort of trade cycle management product with respect to minimum future guaranteed values of the Ford Credit (57:18) on the diesel?","Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.","We are, George, but it's at a significantly lower level than what projected residual would be. It's a trade cycle management product in Europe and it's more like a balloon where a customer does have the ability to turn back in a vehicle, but this \u2013 the product is structured with a deep equity position.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. And then the second question I just had was sort of bit of housekeeping. In the deck you gave distributions for this year of $2.7 billion, I thinking on the Detroit deck it was $2.8 billion. Is the difference related to some of the anti dilutive buyback?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I finally found something good about lower share price and that's the fact that the cost of the anti dilutive share repurchase program isn't as great as what we had thought.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","(58:14).","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, let's be clear be on that.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","That's the only thing good.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Morning, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Just have three quick ones here. First, as raw material costs go up, is there an opportunity to potentially share that with some of your partners, namely your suppliers, if that becomes a real headwind?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, the way that we structure our interactions with the supply base on commodities, it's a number of things. Steel is contract, right. So I'm sure that our purchasing organization is negotiating as hard as they possibly can in terms of those contracts to make sure that we get the best price that we possibly can.","If you look at many of the other commodities though, we actually index. And so as a result of that, I think that's probably one of the reasons why when commodities are falling, we tend to get a much faster and quicker improvement, because it will flow through to us relatively quickly from the indexing. I think the converse is true when prices start to go up.","So I think the team actually is working though with the supply (59:33) the amount of various commodities that we have on our components and then the suppliers' components that they are working on that.","The other thing that I would mention is that we do some hedging. And so there is some protection for hedging. So in fact at this point in time about half of our full year exposure is already locked in through the combination of contracts as well as hedges.","The other thing that's interesting about the commodities is there is actually a correlation of some commodities with some of our currencies. And so what we'll see is while there might be bad news on a particular commodity, often times it's going to be offset by good news on a particular currency. Australian dollars are really a good example of that.","So you can't just look at the one factor. It's actually something that we look at across both exchange exposures as well as commodity exposures.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And just a second question on cash conservation or I mean really your cash balance is a little bit higher. Then I think you've talked about it in the past. I mean at this point in the cycle, are you just going to let the cash build up on the balance sheet and really just be set to take advantage of opportunities and to be incredibly cushioned in case we do go into a downturn sooner rather than later?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. Let me make a number of comments. So as Mark mentioned, we're not uncomfortable at all with the fact that we have a lot of liquidity at this point in the cycle. But I want to remind you, John, that about $3 billion of that is related to the debt issuance that we had back in December, which was very specifically for \u2013 to give us the capital that we could use at some point in the future to support both the core business and the emerging opportunities around strategic opportunities, whether it's equity into something, purchase of something.","As Mark said, we're going to look at that very prudently. And it has to be completely consistent with our strategic framework and our objectives. But that $3 billion of that is for that.","So think about the rest of it is around $25 billion, which is still above our minimum cash of $20 billion. So we think that that's not a bad place to be at this point in the cycle, but also depending upon our results, it gives us the ability to provide a very nice supplemental dividend, which was the other means that we'll use to provide distributions to shareholders above and beyond the regular dividend.","So we'll have to see how the performance comes out in terms of the year relative to net income, but that's the other way that we would utilize that, consistent with our strategy on the supplemental dividend.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. And then just lastly, and I hate to ask a question like this in this forum. But I mean on cadence of earnings, traditionally you guys have been around 60%, 40% first half, second half. This \u2013 the way you're talking about the guidance per region as you went through your comments kind of like indicates that the second half might be equal to or maybe even a little bit stronger than the first half.","I just wondered if you can give us some color there, because it looks like estimates are still looking for the first half to be a bit stronger than the second half. And it sounds like your commentary is more equal weighted to maybe even a little backend loaded?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","My least favorite subject is calendarization, it's like trying to grab Jell-O. So the third quarter will be the weakest absolute of the year, so I can say that with some confidence. I think in terms of first half, second half, probably the historical experience is more or less right, probably 55%, 60% somewhere in that range, would be about right. But I have a big asterisk beside anything I say with calendarization.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. We'll make our estimates. Thank you very much.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Grabbing Jell-O, I like that one, Bob. Mark, Continental in their Powertrain Capital Markets Day a couple days ago said that they are engineering what they see as their last generation internal combustion powertrain to be launched in 2023. Do you agree with that kind of spirit that this is the last generation of ICE?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I can't speak to Continental. I did see Elmar [Degenhart] and what they laid out in their plans, how they were going to spend their capital.","Listen, our view very, very simply and you've heard us, that in the next 15 years we expect in the industry there to be more electrified options in the marketplace than ICE ones. And electrified being hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and full BEV.","At the same time, there will still be a market for ICE engines. Part of that is due to the job to be done and the duty cycles for things like truck applications or heavyweight applications or climatic applications. And our view is that over time the cost of ownership of an internal combustion engine is going to cross with an electrified. They'll probably do it first for hybrids, then for plug-ins, and then after that somewhere down the road in BEVs. And that's going to be a combination of improvements that we see in the technology and the scale and also the infrastructure for electrification. And on the other hand you're going to see costs go up on the ICE side of the house because of regulations.","So that's why we're making the investments. But I can't speak to individual suppliers, but I do believe that there will be some portion of this industry where ICE applications will be very appropriate, plus at the same time, the world is not sitting still in terms of the technological advances in ICE engines.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Plus, the hybrid and the plug-in hybrid includes an ICE.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Right.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. And Mark, you actually kind of brought up my second question, which is when do you see that crossover occurring? I mean you guys are obviously doing a ton of work on this space and you have your own assessments and experiences of the sell cost at the pack level, et cetera. When do you see that for , let's say the average application of a pure EV, forget hybrid for a second, but pure EV, being the lower cost to ownership than an ICE, whether it has \u2013 whether it's a hybrid or not?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, we haven't \u2013 we haven't really talked about that, because there's lots of moving parts on that. But I still think that's a ways away.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","I still think that that is a ways away, and as I said, I think it will happen first for hybrids and then plug-ins, BEVs they're still \u2013 when you look at the cost per kilowatt hour and some of the advances that have to be made, I still think that's we're ways away on that.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And my last question on cars. There's this old adage out there that, it doesn't matter what happens to car sales, because car companies make all their money in trucks and SUVs. But my understanding was that you, Ford in particular, relative to your U.S. domestic peers used to make some really good money in passenger cars through your global platform architecture and the right product, the right place and EcoBoost and that was a different environment perhaps in hindsight 2020. But I just want to understand, is that true that you used to make good money in cars and does this mean that the segment shift that's under \u2013 that the industry is going through, we kind of have a shunning of cars, if you will, whether it's cyclical or secular that you have to kind of overcome those decrementals with something else, yeah?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I'd actually turn that around and say the industry shift that we're seeing around the world from cars and SUVs plays to our strengths.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. But that's not to say, I mean again I know you don't disclose profitability on a model line basis, but you \u2013 are you able to say, are you able to comment on \u2013 on and directionally whether that is accurate that you had have been making positive \u2013 that you had have been making positive profit on the cars throughout much of the cycle?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I'm not going to comment on our past profitability around cars or any of our vehicle lines. But we obviously want to make sure that as we go forward, we're allocating our capital to those areas that are going to drive value in the company. And that's why I think when you look at how we're doing that in some of the examples we talked about earlier, plus the segmentation around the world, it's going to play to our strengths, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two questions, one about for Ford Credit and just a kind of broad strategic question. The first question on Ford Credit, okay 7% auction declines year-over-year, couple of kind of sub-questions around that. As you look \u2013 first as you look forward through the remainder of 2017 and since two-thirds of your lease book almost by definition is in the out years, what sort of auction declines are you keeping and has it that already been factored into the supplemental depreciation or if we see further weakening on a \u2013 further weakening, will there be more sequential depreciation that's going to be needed?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","So Brian, what I would say is that as we've mentioned already, we're expecting an average decline of 6% this year. We also have assumed and we haven't provided nor will we today, further declines in the forward years. So we are writing new contracts, if you will, on the assumption of those lower declines. So we believe that we've called that right that we have factored in what is going to happen over the next several years and have that reflected appropriately, and the books that \u2013 what's going on the book today. That would not be supplemental depreciation. I mean that's us just writing the contracts at the right level, look at the right return. It would mean, for example, if those were lease vehicles, that the leasing expense will be more expensive for Ford Credit. They can either pass it along, they absorb it in favorable marketing, but we think that we've called that right and that's how we've set up the business.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess my question just in the weeds was, if you had a 1Q 2016 origination and that car is not going come back till 1Q 2019, what have you assumed, have you taken the hit that you think you're going to get in 2019 now or do you have to wait till ALG walks those guidelines down?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","No, we don't take any hit, because you basically have written the contract with the assumption that that is the lower and have a lower value. Obviously, that means if the Ford Motor Company in terms of what it may have to do in terms of subvention and so forth could be more expensive than in the past, but let me have Marion just add or supplement if you want to.","Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, so you have to \u2013 it's complicated, you have to understand the accounting around this. But in your example if a contract had been written in the first quarter of 2016 and ALG, 2016.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","2016, sorry.","Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.","So if a contract had been written in the first quarter of 2016 and ALG has subsequently lowered their outlook on that, we immediately start to take supplemental depreciation for that. So we're taking a substantial amount of supplemental depreciation this year, as we talked about at the Let's Chat event, we took a lot in 2016 and we took our first cut of the \u2013 bite of the apple beginning in 2016 and then second cut of the apple at end of 2016, so we're taking more supplemental depreciation in 2017 than we did in 2016. And that is for the entire portfolio all the way out through 2018, 2019 and into 2020.","And it's completely contained within our outlook. And that's why we're \u2013 we've guided that we expect our 2018 results to improve from 2017, as we would expect to have lower supplemental depreciation. We've factored those sequential declines into our outlook and it's rolling through our accounting today.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","And Brian, I just wanted to \u2013 just to reconfirm though that for new contracts, not only have we obviously assumed what would expect to happen this year, but we have further assumed declines post 2017 and that should add into the new business that we're writing.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Second question for Mark. There is an automaker who makes about a 100,000 Runway Cars a year, who is valued higher than Ford or roughly the same. We can debate the valuation of that company, but in terms of your investments, whether it's big data, autonomy, mobility, electrification, what do you think the market is missing in that comparison?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well again, I can't speak to Tesla, I know you didn't mention the name, but I know that's what you are referring to. And we're just going to stay focused on our strategy. First off, I just want to say on the valuation, we're absolutely committed to making sure that we create value for our shareholders and as we execute the strategy of fortifying our profit pillars and transforming the underperforming parts of the our business and growing in the emerging opportunities, that I'm confident that we're going to create value and we will continue to return value to our shareholders.","In terms of maybe what the market is missing, in terms of you look at the valuation of our business, and I will \u2013 first off, I think we have a robust and defensible core and you've heard this morning how we're fortifying the efforts around that. The cost structure that we've put into the business and also the strong balance sheet allows us to pay a nice sustainable dividend, which by the way has a nice yield.","And I think the upside around as we transform the underperforming parts of our business and grow in the emerging areas. And I think on the growing in the emerging areas, and you mentioned them, mobility and data and autonomous vehicles and connectivity, I think we need to do a better job as a company in dimensioning what that means for us in the future in terms of revenue and profit growth. We have talked about the investments and we will do that going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks, good morning. ALG had said yesterday they are looking for industry incentive spending to peak in July and I was just curious, if you are that optimistic or do you think the industry might continue to remain somewhat irrational, but keep the SAAR above 17%?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I don't think, the industry has been rationale, let me just say that first. If you see what's happening, there has been a very, very slow, long, progressive increase in incentives, going all the way back from when the downturn ended. So we are just on that track. We have so far seen the ATPs continue to stay ahead of that. So that's inclusive of that.","So I don't \u2013 and I don't see any particular manufacturer on a consistent basis doing something that I would think is unhealthy for the business. I think everyone is very much focused on margins, profitability. Does anybody in any particular month or quarter maybe try to address an inventory situation or gain a taxable advantage, yes, sure that happens. But I have not seen that in terms of a consistent approach to the business.","So I think overall the industry is relatively disciplined. Mark talked about what we are doing. We are going to continue to do what we are doing. I am not aware of anything that would suggest that that trend of small increases, progressive increases is going to end.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justine Fisher of Goldman Sachs.","Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning.","Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The first question that I have is just following up on two questions that go in terms of the outlook for used values in 2018 and 2019. I know, Bob, you said that you guys weren't going to put specific numbers around your expectations in 2018 and 2019. But we do know that the off lease vehicle supply increases significantly in 2018 and 2019. So could you give us color as to whether you expect the declines to accelerate or decelerate year-over-year in 2018 versus 2017?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, we expect the declines to continue and it's actually \u2013 we have factored in exactly what you referenced, which is the fact that we know how much is going to be coming back as we know what's been leased. And so we've factored that into our thinking. So we do see a continued decline, but I don't want to get into any characterization of the slope of that decline.","Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then the second question is following up on something that we talked about at the Let's Chat. You mentioned that you expected lower used vehicle prices to manifest themselves more in new vehicle volume than in new vehicle price, i.e., that the OEMs would cut production instead of just lower their prices on new cars. So, can you give us color on what the size of that price insensitive market is, i.e., how much would vehicle production has to go down in order to shrink the consumer-base to that population that will still buy a new car with trim and features even if used car prices have \u2013 are down? Have you guys done work on that?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","My head just exploded from that question, but (01:17:19).","Let me just explain how we think about it in my very simple way of thinking. So the reality is that, first of all, people that buy used vehicles tend to be people that buy used vehicles, people that tend to buy new, tend to buy new. So there is some sort of area where maybe people will flip back and forth between the two, but they actually tend to be quite separate consumer sets.","Second thing I would say is that, clearly with lower used vehicle values, it's going to have an effect on the ability to price for new. It will put tension on that because of residual values and so forth. So it may affect mix, you may find people that start to move down series or even down from segments, potentially while staying in new so there could be an affect there. It could affect variable marketing, because again what we talked about earlier around subvention cost. So there's so many different impacts that could take place.","The way that we have generally and largely expressed that as our view of just lower volume, and so that's one of the key factors that is behind our view that the industry will decline this year from last year, and will decline in 2018 from 2017. Now, it may play out a little bit differently than that, but the thing that is interesting so far is that what we've seen today would suggest that that is what's taking place right now. I don't know if Mark wants to add anything.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","One other thing when you look at the data, Bob mentioned the small overlap between new car buyers that buy used and vice versa. When you dig into the data, actually the segments that are a little bit indexed a little higher are cars, and it's mainly compact and midsize cars where you see that. So you could see that manifest itself from the volume side of the house on the car side of the industry.","Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks so much.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin of The Associated Press.","Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press","Hi. Thank you for taking the call. Good morning.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning, Dee-Ann.","Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press","I just wanted you to talk really briefly about recall costs that hit you in the third quarter, that hit you again. What are you doing to improve quality or tackle on these kind of recurring big, huge costs?","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Well, first off, Dee-Ann thanks for the question and obviously, we are absolutely committed to making sure that we provide top quality to our customers. And when you look at some of the work that we're doing, we're doing a lot of work obviously in making sure the initial quality of our vehicles is very good, because that gives you an indication to the long-term quality. And whether it's our own internal measurements that we have but also external J.D. Power and others, it shows we're making very good progress along those ways.","At the same time, one of the reasons you see when we do have, in some cases a recall and it's fairly large, remember we were a little bit ahead of the industry in terms of reducing our platforms and getting more commonality of parts across our vehicle lines. And so when there is an issue, whether it's our own issue or whether a supplier, it intends to hit a bigger population. And as usual, whenever we see something from a quality standpoint, we are going to act very proactively to fix that for the customer. And that's exactly what we are going to continue to do.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","And Dee-Ann, if I could just add to that, just maybe to help to understanding. So what we do in terms of cost related to quality, I'll say, is we actually reserve with every single vehicle sold a certain amount for coverages. So that's the three-years, 36,000 miles, if you will. But we also reserve for every single vehicle we sell an amount that goes into a reserve for what we call field service actions, which are recalls. So we reserve for that.","So what happens though is that if we get a particularly large recall that comes through that is above and beyond what we can manage within that reserve, and then effectively it forces us to let it flow through the bottom line more or less, and then we've got to \u2013 top up the reserve back to the level that's \u2013 we've \u2013 we've developed a minimum level that we have to have, and we have to go back up to that minimum. So a lot of recalls you never hear about, because it's covered by the reserve. It's these sort of big, one-time, large ones and driven apart for the factors that Mark mentioned that force us to handle it on more of a flow right through the bottom line basis.","Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press","Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.","Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks Dee-Ann.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Ted Cannis for any additional or closing remarks.","Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company","All right. Thank you very much for participating in today's call, and we look forward to the next one. Thank you very much.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] After the question-and-answer session, there will be closing remarks.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations.","Lynn Antipas Tyson","Thank you, Ian. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Business, Technology and Strategy; and David McClelland CEO of Ford Credit.","Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of quarter and our progress against our strategic initiatives. Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and then we'll turn to Q&A. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.","Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials, at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance.","Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 68. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.","Now let me turn the call over to Jim.","James Hackett","Thank you, Lynn, and hello to everyone. As we meet today, we're a little past the midpoint of 2019, which we said would be a great year of execution for Ford. And I am pleased with the progress we're making toward creating a more dynamic, innovative and profitably growing business. And our second quarter result demonstrates the global redesign of Ford is driving positive shifts in our business.","We are improving our fitness or our ability to compete and the trajectory of the company is improving in terms of growth, cash flow, and profitability. We are making tremendous progress in Europe, which I will expand on in a moment. We are also seeing discrete signs of stability in our business in China, even as the economy in vehicle market there under recent and persistent stress. At the same time, we are actively working on the design and launch of new products that will help us grow in this market.","Now, additionally, the redesign and restructuring of our business in South America is on track as well. We view all of this progress with humility, and the reason is that it's been my experience that the compounding positive effects of getting so many aspects of our business in shape does take more time. Yet, at the same time, these disparate aspects build on each other, which allow us to reach our full potential as an outstanding business.","I'll touch briefly on some other highlights from the quarter. In Automotive, we delivered a 19% increase in EBIT, supported by a broad-based improvement in market factors led by North America, Europe and China. We achieved these results even with the natural drag on profitability in North America from ramping three very important product launches in the quarter. Our all-new Explorer and Police Interceptor Utility, as well as our new-to-market Lincoln Aviator.","Now, if you recall, in Q1, we said our first quarter results would be the strongest of the year in part because of the magnitude and cadence of these future product launches, as well as normal seasonality. Importantly, we delivered positive adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, significantly better than last year, notwithstanding major launch headwinds. And on a year-to-date basis, we delivered $2.1 billion adjusted free cash flow, which is up 80%.","In addition, our cash balance of $23 billion and total liquidity of $37 billion remained strong and well above our target levels. Our year-to-date results support our target to improve both free cash flow and profitability this year. Tim will go into more detail about our results and perspectives on the full-year in just a moment.","Now, as we've discussed in the past, we're focused on four strategic areas for creating value. First is the winning portfolio, where we are fortifying our strengths, improving mix and expanding our commitment to electric vehicles. Second is fitness. It's our ability to compete, including advancing alliances, such as those with VW and Mahindra. Third is the acceleration of our global redesign, which was to ensure each of our regions in generating sustainable profitable growth and cash flow. And, fourth, is smart vehicles for a smart world. We are scaling products and businesses that connect to the world around them in ways that benefits our customers.","Let me touch on a few highlights of each of these. We're now beginning to rollout our new portfolio, powered by the dramatic shifts in capital allocations of trucks, SUVs and performance vehicles, including the hybrid and all-electric offerings. This chart you see covers 2019 and 2020. We're expanding our lineup where the volume and profit is where the growth is and where the Ford brand excels.","Of course, this includes pickups like the new F-150, Super Duty and new Ranger; commercial vans like the new two-tonne Transit and SUVs such as the new Explorer, Escape, Territory and Puma; rugged off-road vehicles like the Raptor and upcoming Bronco; and our Mustang-inspired BEV, that's going to be an SUV.","In fact, in North America, we're driving down the age of our passenger vehicle showroom by almost one-half, as we replace 75% of our products by 2020. Over time, the new models we're adding for customers will more than make up for any share and volume loss by the phase out of sedans, while simultaneously improving profitability and returns.","It's no small feat to deliver this many new products in such a short timeframe. Unfortunate, that I have a seasoned automotive veteran in Joe Hinrichs at the helm of our automotive division. When you witness the extend of the work that was done, much of it like clockwork, we will complete our assignment to successfully launch these products.","For example, the transformation of our Chicago plant to launch the Explorer, the Police Interceptor and the new Lincoln Aviator was in some ways a bigger endeavor than the 2014 overhaul of our truck plants in Dearborn and Kansas City for our aluminum bodied F-150.","In fact, the Explorer launch is arguably our most complex one over the next 18 months, combining an all new high volume platform along with what is effectively a new factory and a new body shop. We also launched our broadest ever Explorer line up with both hybrid and ST performance models, and we're introducing a plug-in hybrid version of that Aviator.","Now, to achieve all this, we installed hundreds of robots, new technologies and moved out the scrap metal equivalent of the weight of the Eiffel Tower. I'm pleased to say that the demand for this new products \u2013 these two new products is strong. We are selling these vehicles as fast as we can build them. In fact, we are now expanding our capacity in Chicago.","So, when you have a moment, do me a favor and click on the link on this page to watch a short video summarizing what it took to get our plant in Chicago ready for these key launches. I think you'll be positively impressed.","Explorer, Police Interceptor and Aviator are just three examples of our dramatic shift in capital allocation to higher return trucks utilities and crossovers. At the same time, we are working to lower the capital intensity of our business.","Of course, we remain highly committed to quality and customer satisfaction and everything we do. You can see that in the results from the most recent J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study. For the first time ever, both Ford and Lincoln ranked among the top five auto brands in the US.","I will expand a bit on our renaissance that is underway in Europe, where we made significant progress in the quarter. In early January, our team in Europe unveiled a comprehensive roadmap to improve or exit less profitable vehicle lines, address underperforming parts of the business, and improve profitability through efficiencies and a significant reduction in structural costs.","In the first half of this year, our team did a tremendous job, achieving important milestones as they position the business in Europe for a 6% EBIT margin longer-term. These milestones include, number one, a new operating model and organization, including three customer-focused business groups, each with a dedicated management team and bottom line accountability.","The first of the three groups is commercial vehicles, where we have reallocated resources to capitalize on our position as a top commercial vehicle brand in Europe, including leadership in the pickup segment. Now, over the next five years, we're targeting to double our profitability in commercial vehicles.","The second group is passenger vehicles, which will focus on European built cars and SUVs. Third group, well, this is imports, a niche portfolio of iconic passenger vehicles, including the Mustang and Explorer. Importantly, we have largely concluded consultations with our social partners. And in the UK and Germany, we have carried out separations.","In Russia, we have completed the restructuring of our JV there, which includes exiting passenger vehicles and Ford taking a minority stake and to improve manufacturing efficiencies we have proposed to confirm the closure or sale of six assembly and component manufacturing plants in Europe by the end of 2020.","In the midst of this restructuring, we've also announced growth initiatives, including producing new all-electric vehicles and electrified options for all-new passenger vehicle models. These new vehicles will support our compliance with the new European CO2 regulations, which we expect to, achieve without having to buy credits or pay any kind of penalty. And our alliance with VW to support commercial vehicle and electric vehicle growth.","Now, if I can get you to turn to Slide 8. Earlier, I mentioned the four strategic area that prepares Ford for this new era in our industry. I refer to this as smart vehicles for a smart world. Now this strategic area has benefited, as I expected, early from Jim Farley's mix of automotive and entrepreneurial history. He appropriately focused early on the conclusion of the negotiations with VW to broaden our collaboration.","Now it's important to expand to you today why we're so enthusiastic about this news. At a time when industry consolidation is daily makings, we believe we found a more thoughtful approach to collaborating in key strategic areas without adding the complexity of cross-ownership.","It started back in January, where Ford and VW announced a deal to develop commercial vans and medium-sized pickups for global markets. This collaboration remains on course and we're excited about the potential.","Two weeks ago, VW CEO Herbert Diess and I said that our companies will expand this collaboration. Now, this included VW joining us within investment commitment to Argo AI. This is one of the most capable autonomous vehicle platform developers, as you know, based in Pittsburgh.","The transaction with VW establishes an estimated value for Argo of more than $7 billion. Collectively, we believe we're on a path to create one of the most important autonomous vehicle platforms in the industry. Here's how our companies will work together going forward on autonomous.","First, we will collaborate with Argo on the self-driving system, known as the SDS. That means that Ford and VW will be able to reduce our respective investments and development costs for the future AV businesses. We will be able to co-create common AV standards, both now and in the future, and we'll share valuable data with Argo to help build the best visioning and mapping models along with data utilization analysis for traffic and fleet management.","Second, we'll share cost and expertise, so that we can each design and engineer unique, safe and efficient self-driving vehicles.","Third, Ford and VW, of course, will remain vigorous competitors and pursue independent go-to-market strategies using this common Argo SDS platform with each of us designing and delivering unique experiences for our customers. In addition to our collaboration autonomy, we also announced we are extending our alliance to electric vehicles.","Ford will become the first additional automaker to use VW's MEB, electric vehicle architecture. We'll leverage this architecture for high volume zero emissions passenger vehicle in Europe and this is designed at our Ford Engineering Center in Cologne, Germany. Ford of Europe will start building this vehicle in Ford facilities in 2023.","We're also considering a second electric model based on this MEB architecture for our Ford lineup in Europe. This more expensive strategic relationship between Ford and VW is another important building block in the renaissance underway at Ford of Europe that I described earlier.","But, with that good news, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Stone. Tim?","Tim Stone","Thanks, Jim. Hi, everyone. A few things to keep in mind as we discuss our results. First, both 2019 and 2020 are robust launch years for us as we bolster a winning portfolio for customers, reallocate capital to higher return growth opportunities and execute changeovers of our most profitable and highest volume vehicles.","Second, our global redesign and fitness initiatives are progressing well, improving the trajectory of future growth, cash flow, profitability and returns on capital. Third, Ford Credit continues to deliver excellent results. And, fourth, relative to auto, we continue to expect strong execution this year, especially in North America, Europe and China.","In the quarter, we generated $0.2 billion adjusted free cash flow, which was a significant improvement from last year. This performance includes the impact of our launches in the quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow was up 80% to $2.1 billion, supported by improvement in working capital in auto. The ability to generate sustainable growth in free cash flow over time is our most important financial measure and we are on our way to achieving this.","Wholesales declined 9%, driven by China, lower industry and the launch-related volume impact from North America, as it ramped Explorer and Police Interceptor. Interceptor, by the way, accounted for half of all police vehicle sales in the U.S. last year and the new models even more capable.","Although wholesales were down, revenue was flat, as strong mix and pricing supported by our franchise strengths were offset by lower volumes and adverse exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue grew 3%.","Auto posted a second consecutive quarter of EBIT growth, something we have not achieved in over three years. EBIT grew 19%, up from 16% last quarter, and EBIT margin expanded by 60 basis points. These results were supported by strong mix in North America, reflecting our franchise strengths and strong pricing in every region.","In North America, EBIT declined 3%, driven by the changeover of Explorer, Interceptor and the introduction of Lincoln's all-new Aviator, as well as higher warranty. Our strategic investments in Mobility increased by 46% as we continue to build out our capabilities, including mobility services, connectivity and autonomy.","Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter posting a 29% increase in earnings before taxes. Favorable loss metrics reflected healthy consumer credit conditions in auction values for off-lease vehicles performed slightly better than expectations. We now believe auction values will be down by about 3% on average for the year. Receivables were flat. They remain below our previously announced cap of $155 billion.","Corporate other expense of $286 million included a mark-to-market loss of $181 million for our investment in Pivotal. On an adjusted basis, both company EBIT and margin for the quarter were flat at $1.7 billion and 4.3%, and EPS was $0.28. Excluding the Pivotal loss, adjusted EBIT would have been $1.8 billion, EBIT margin would have been 4.7%, and EPS would have been $0.32.","In the quarter, we've recorded a $1.2 billion of special charges with cash effects of $0.2 billion. As expected, the vast majority of the charges in the quarter were associated with the redesigns of Europe and South America. This year, we continue to expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of EBIT charges with negative cash effects of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion, reflecting a shift of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion in cash effects to 2020. Lastly, we ended the quarter above our cash and liquidity targets with $23 billion in cash and $37 billion in total liquidity.","Let me touch on the few areas of the business in more detail. In North America, as I mentioned, EBIT was down and margin contracted by 30 basis points to 7.1%. The region continued to deliver strong mix in net pricing supported by F-Series, as well as our decision to exit traditional sedans. This favorability was more than offset with the launch-related declines in volume and higher warranty.","For additional perspective, wholesales for Explorer, Interceptor were down by 72,000 units year-over-year, which led the 7% overall decline in wholesales in the quarter. As Jim mentioned, demand for Explorer is strong with production already oversubscribed.","Relative to wholesales, it's interesting to note that in the quarter sales of Ranger completely offset the decline from discontinued sedans. Last quarter, we showed you the benefit of this intentional shift in our portfolio using our Michigan assembly plant as an example. Once this plant completes the transition from sedans to Ranger and Bronco, EBIT was improved by over $1 billion.","In the US, our SUVs posted a strong momentum in the quarter, including a 50% increase in Expedition and this month, based on healthy customer demand, we started to run additional capacity for Expedition in our Kentucky Truck Plant.","By the end of this year, on a volume-weighted basis, we will have the freshest SUV lineup in the industry, led by our all-new Explorer and all-new Escape.","Also, in the US, sales of total pickups accelerated in the quarter, marking our best overall pickup sales performance since 2004. SUVs continues to do well, maintaining market leadership with the lowest incentive spend at primary competitors and the highest transaction pricing. Ranger, which we launched at the end of 2018, more than doubled its volume sequentially, while also steadily increasing segment share to 14.2%.","Europe delivered $53 million in EBIT in the quarter, an improvement of $126 million year-over-year, supported by our redesign actions. Favorable market factors aided by flat structural costs, excluding pension, drove the improvement in profitability. This is the first quarterly year-over-year improvement in profitability for Europe in two years. Commercial vehicles were once again a strength in the quarter, as Ford remained Europe's number one commercial vehicle brand.","And, as noted in our product roadmap, we will be launching an updated two-tonne Transit in the second half of this year. In addition, Ford remain the market leader in the UK with Fiesta, Transit, Custom and Focus as a top three selling models.","In China, consolidated revenue increased 48% year-over-year, driven by higher Lincoln volumes. EBIT loss narrowed to $155 million, an improvement of $328 million year-over-year, supported by improvements in consolidated operations in volume, mix and pricing, lower tariffs and structural costs, as well as favorable exchange.","The team has taken action to stabilize sales with second quarter retail sales of 13% sequentially and aggressive reductions in inventory to improve dealer health. In fact, our dealer inventory is at its lowest level in the past 18 months and we manage the run out of Stage V effectively.","In addition, China has implemented initiatives ranging from enhanced capabilities within in-depth Chinese market experience to strengthening cooperation with joint venture partners. Sales of our new Ford Territory SUV accelerated in the second quarter, making it the best-selling Ford SUV in China this year.","Now, let me turn to our updated outlook for the year, which focuses on growth in cash flow and profitability. We continue to target an improvement in adjusted free cash flow year-over-year driven by Auto and we are now introducing a range for full-year adjusted EBIT of between $7 billion and $7.5 billion compared with $7 billion last year, representing up to 7% growth.","These targets include continued strength in market factors and improved structural cost, excluding pension, led by North America, China and Europe, as well as launch-related impacts and strength in Credit. As a reminder, we expect to conclude our negotiations with the UAW in the fourth quarter.","Assuming a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of between 18% and 20%, which would be up from 10% last year, we are introducing an adjusted EPS range of $1.20 to $1.35 compared with $1.30 last year. The tax headwind is worth roughly $0.12 to $0.16 in EPS for the year.","Given the cadence of product launches and normal seasonality, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT to be higher than the third. Among other things, these targets are based on the current economic environment, including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs.","Relative to calls on capital for the year, we continue to expect CapEx to be similar to last year at roughly $7.7 billion, funded pension contributions to be about $650 million and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion.","A few final comments before we move to Q&A. 2019 and 2020 are robust product launch years for us, as we bolster our winning portfolio for customers, reallocate capital to higher return growth opportunities, and execute changeovers are our most profitable and highest volume vehicles.","Our results this quarter and year-to-date demonstrate the trajectory of our business is meaningfully improving, supported by our product portfolio, global redesign, and fitness initiative. We have many opportunities across our business to drive free cash flow, long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including EBIT margins of 8% or better, and we continue to be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings.","Now, let's open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.

At the midpoint, if I focus on the EBIT metric, it looks like your EBIT \u2013 you're guiding for an EBIT that would be down about $1 billion between the first half and the second half.","And I was hoping you could maybe bucket this for us into what the main drivers are. It seems like you're flagging launches, in particular, but obviously the second quarter had quite a bit of that as well. So maybe just from a high level point of view, second half lower by $1 billion versus first half, what drives that?","James Hackett","Emmanuel, thanks. It's Jim Hackett. As I hand \u2013 I'm going to hand this question to Tim, but I just want to tell the audience tonight that this is Tim's first call as our CFO and he has really done a great job of feathering into the Ford culture, bringing new perspective, new questions and he's become a great partner.","When we sat in front of you in January, I remember thinking about how we were going to help the Street see our year and sitting in front of us, from my perspective, as a CEO, was an open question about the tariffs, Joe can talk about the back and forth there. We were working on our corporate redesign; this is the white-collar kind of effort that management reporting layers. We had restructuring that you were just starting to learn about in Europe and we were actively working on our own recovery of China. In fact, I just came back from there.","So, from January to July, I just want to report to you, Emmanuel, as you look at those five issues, we've \u2013 I'm really happy with the way the company's tackled each one of them and the progress we've made. And you kind of teed up the good question in the right when I think about the second half of the year, which are these product launches.","So, tonight, I want to make sure that you see that this a capability that we have to prove we're really good at. I have a lot of confidence that we are and you'll hear that we've tackled the toughest one first in Explorer and Aviator. But Tim maybe before Joe, if Joe wants to add color on the launches, you could just talk about the guidance and how we worked ourselves to that.","Tim Stone","You bet. So, thanks for the question, Emmanuel. As you said, with the $4.1 billion in the books in the first half, the guidance range is $7 billion to $7.5 billion with growth up to 7% or $0.5 billion implies $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion, $3.4 billion, excuse me, in the second half.","And as we said on the call is through these cadence of product launches and you can see in the materials, we distributed on Slide 5, the winning portfolio slide, we got a number of launches ahead of us through the remainder of this year and continue to ramp up on Explorer and Aviator. We have Corsair, Escape, Kuga, the two-tonne Transit, for example. And then normal seasonality as well.","So, for example, in 2018, 56% of our profits came in the first half of the year and, as a reminder, again, we had \u2013 we have UAW negotiations concluded in this fourth quarter. So, we believe the guidance is appropriate based on what we're seeing in the business and including the risks and opportunities and that was appropriate to provide a range for the year.","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes. So quickly, I'll add. We have Super Duty launch towards the end of the year, which is really important and the seasonality is real. We have the European shutdowns and we have the North American shutdowns in the summer months and then, of course, there are the holidays later in the year. So, there is the annual seasonality. So, it's launches, seasonality and UAW negotiations. Thanks.","Emmanuel Rosner","Yes. And that's very helpful. And then just, sort of, as a follow-up. Would you be able to give us a sense, again, second half versus first half, how you think about it for your main regions, I assume that the bulk of the decline is North America, at least based on the launches that you highlighted. But is there any other region where you expect this to be the case and in particular in North America anything else besides sort of like the launches, that's a big bucket?","James Hackett","Yes. Thanks. Thanks again. Some of the launches we've talked about are happening in Europe, for example, two-tonne Transit and Escape \u2013 and many of these launches around the world. But I just want to comment before we get too far down the path here that beyond the guidance that we've provided for the EBIT range, the EPS range, and most importantly free cash flow.","We aren't going to be giving any further details on the inputs that go into the final output. So, for example, regional guidance or macro commentary or commodities or exchange to tariffs and so forth. So, recognize that to change. But we also changed by providing EPS guidance range and arrange for EBIT. So, I started coming on that in response to the question. Joe something else you wanted to add.","Joseph Hinrichs","Well, obviously the bigger launches are North America and UAW leave it at that.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great.","James Hackett","Thanks Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is line of John Murphy from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. John.","Aileen Smith","Good morning or good afternoon. This is Aileen Smith on for John. First question on the structural cost headwind in North America. Can you detail what these costs were specifically in the quarter and how you'd think about controlling or offsetting some of these going forward, particularly ahead of the UAW negotiations that you know and what could be labor cost inflation among other factors?","James Hackett","Yes, one thing, Tim, can I sneak something in? Do you know John Murphy and I have something in common? I just had a brand new baby granddaughter and I guess John Just had a new baby girl. So, John, we want to send out a hooray for that in hope every mom and baby are doing well. So, I mean, let's go back to her.","Tim Stone","That's great.","Aileen Smith","Thank you very much. I appreciate that.","Tim Stone","Congratulations. So, on the structural costs in North America, auto overall, it was go good auto overall so EBIT increased in 19% a year-over-year up from 60%. The first time and over three years or two consecutive quarters of a year-over-year growth and profit. And that's driven by structural costs. The commentary that I'd want to leave you with is structural costs are down ex-pension and OPEB overall. So as far as how that plays out for the rest of the year, again, that's factored into our, is one of the many inputs into our guidance.","Aileen Smith","Okay. That's helpful. And then second question on the year-over-year China walk. As you think about the outlook for the rest of the year and particularly into 2020? Do you view positive contribution from volume mix, pricing costs and everything else is being sustainable, particularly in the face of a tough industry backdrop or one of these factors or others going to be a bigger driver of profitability improvement?","Tim Stone","Yes. So, this is something that we want to kind of emphasize. We want to talk about color on China. So, Joe maybe you can feel that one.","Joseph Hinrichs","Sure. Thanks. So clearly, we're glad to see the progress we saw in the first half of the year financially, especially on our consolidated results. Do you think about China in the last couple months? We have very aggressive sell down of the stage five emissions vehicles, especially in June. So, I think you start \u2013 I know you'll see some of the payback in the second half of the year, especially starting in July for some of that.","So, we're watching what's happening in the industry there. Tim mentioned earlier that we were the lowest level of our dealer inventories in 18 months. So, we're feeling really good about where we are both with our stage five, stage six transition and dealer inventory overwhelmed and we're starting to see an improvement in dealer profitability.","So, we're pleased with that. Our focus in territory products are building momentum. We still have a way to go, but they're building momentum and we have other products coming as Tim referred to especially escape it later in the year. Remember that year-over-year we'll have \u2013 we should we at this present state, we have lower tariffs than we had in the second half of 2018 because of the import duties going into China or 15%, which they were 40% in the second half of last year.","So right now, that's the best positive year-over-year. I think we're all watching what's happening in the China industry I won't go too much into it because I think we're going to see how things settle down after the last couple months. So, the stage five, stage six transition, but we do expect some payback to that in the second half of the year.","James Hackett","Thanks Joe.","Aileen Smith","Great, that's very helpful. Thanks for the question.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. David?","David Tamberrino","Yes. I've got to keep picking at this point on structural costs. It was a positive tailwind about $300 million in the first quarter. Now you've got a negative in the second quarter was negative in North America and negative in Europe. Really want to unpack that and understand what the positive was, ex-pension in OPEB, and if you expect it to be repeatable, do you expect to see that grow sequentially as we progressed through the year after you've taken restructuring actions? That is my first question.","James Hackett","Tim, go ahead.","Tim Stone","Yes. So again, as it relates to what's going to happen for the remainder of the year is factored into our guidance. I'll go back to the contract and structural costs, x pension of OPEB were flat, sorry, down in auto overall. So, what you're seeing there is us continue to execute on our fitness initiatives and the redesign and starting to see the early benefits from that in the overall EBIT results and in structural costs as well across the business.","David Tamberrino","But you can't share the magnitude that it was down x pension OPEB and there was no incremental color on Europe taking a step backwards from the benefits you saw in 1Q?","Tim Stone","No, not at this point. I mean if you look at the fact that we continue to announce additional redesign actions in Europe. For example, Bridgend and then we continue to execute on our redesign initiatives and as those play out, over time, you'll see the benefits flow through the P&L.","David Tamberrino","Okay. So then asking that restructuring question, I guess you've made some announcements more recently, you finished the consultation process with your partners within Europe. When do you anticipate the ability to provide some color as to the potential cost savings that you should be seeing as a result of those actions?","Tim Stone","Yes, the cost savings that we're expecting from the redesign and restructuring actions are factored in the guidance for 2019 and as we go forward and give guidance for 2020, you'll see that reflected there. But we're moving as swiftly as practical to execute on all of the redesign initiatives that we have in front of us.","As we talked about, we have had $1.2 billion in the quarter, $1.7 billion year-to-date in charges. You still have a way to go. The 2019 outlook is for $3 billion to $3.5 billion and then similarly from a cash standpoint. But those redesigns and restructuring initiatives are also factored into the European long-term target of 6%.","David Tamberrino","Okay. So, nothing to share today on the recent actions on annualized cost savings.","Tim Stone","Not at this stage.","James Hackett","David, this is Jim. I would just \u2013 again, in my tour, I just was there and it came away where Europe is performing in terms of this restructuring really well. We've actually been speeding it up. So, I want to make sure there's confidence that that work is happening and proceeding well.","David Tamberrino","Okay. Thanks for that Jim. Thanks for taking our questions.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod?","Rod Lache","Hi everybody. I wanted to just ask again about this just the regional performance. It doesn't sound like you want to talk too much about this with any specificity, but it seems logical that Europe and Asia improvements should continue your-over-year and what you're guiding to is a decline in North America related to launches. But can you help us frame this international improvement.","There've been a number of announcements that you've made and you continue to work through this restructuring. How much of the cost improvement that you're looking at in China and in Europe? Are we already seeing reflected as a run rate in the Q2 numbers? And maybe at a high level, could you talk a little bit about what you still have ahead of you?","Tim Stone","This is Tim. Let me start with what we've been seeing as you said. So, in Europe, we saw an improvement of $126 million in the quarter that's year-over-year. And that's the first year-over-year improvement we've seen in two years. That's the reflection of the redesign initiatives and it's focused on the customer, in commercial vehicles, passenger vehicle, and imports from portfolio standpoint. So, a positive $53 million profit in Europe and that's driven by the market factors and commercial vehicles and structural cost declines, extension.","In China, again, loss of negative $155 million, but the EBIT improve to $328 million year-over-year. And that's compared with Q1 and momentum of $22 million improvement. So, going from $22 million to $328 million, and as Joe mentioned earlier, the dealer health is much improved. The best has been from an inventory perspective in 18 months.","And China results are driven by Lincoln volume, the structural costs improvements, and a favorable exchange. So, pleased with what we're seeing in Europe and China. From a guidance perspective looking forward, we expect $7 billion to $7.5 billion and the EPS to be driven by \u2013 led by the North America, Europe and China, with structural costs and a market factors in the key drivers.","Rod Lache","Okay. But there is some additional savings\u2026?","Joseph Hinrichs","Rod, this is Joe. I just want to add \u2013 Rod, I kind of just add, jump in here just on the Europe piece specifically. There's been a significant number of announcements made this year and a lot of work by the team. A lot of that cost comes out over the preceding quarters, because we announced a 12,000 salary hourly agency positions that are going to be gone by the 20, but a number of those are still to happen. So that savings isn't in yet.","And a lot of the plant restructurings, including some shift reduction, and other things that we have going on. It doesn't happen yet. So, I think you will see this play out over the next several quarters. Just to remind you though, as I said earlier, the third quarter in Europe typically the lowest quarter because of the shutdowns that we have in our plants. So, I just want to remind everybody that we're making very good progress on the structural costs in Europe, but we do have some seasonality to keep an even mind.","Rod Lache","Okay. That's helpful. And just switching gears, my second question is just, if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the market for full sized pickups, is from a volume perspective, things look fine from a share perspective, RAM is inching into the fleet market quite a bit, any kind of high level thoughts about what the prospects are for that market from your perspective?","James Hackett","Yes, sure. Well, we're very proud of the first half performance in our F-Series trucks, strong mix as you noted, strong net pricing, and really for the first six months of the year, very pleased with the results. One thing we are seeing in the market is \u2013 the market will down a little bit in the first half a year on retail overall is up on commercial. And that's actually helping on the F-Series side where we're so strong.","And you've just seen recent examples of how strong our truck products are in the marketplace. I mean, just today on the J.D. Power, a pure result came out and unprecedented event, we won all three trucks segments, Ranger, F-150, Super Duty won their segments and appeal.","And that's against newer trucks, in the case of F-150. So, you can imagine how proud our team is of that. We have the lowest instead of spending the highest ADP as you know. This but our truck brands on F-Series continues to hold up very well and we're very pleased with our results and the trucks market itself was in terms have been growing. We're watching it very carefully. We were main competitive, but we also watch very carefully and maintain our discipline as we have always done. But actually, you're seeing our business hold up pretty nicely with all those considerations to take into account.","Rod Lache","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, your line is open.","Adam Jonas","Everybody, good evening. First, my first question is on European CO2. I think I heard you right, you said that you're going to make the CO2 emission standards without buying any credits and paying any penalties. But my understanding is that those penalties start kicking in 2020 when you need to get to 95 grams and you're not going to have a BEV on sale. So, I just want to confirm, do you think you're going to get to 95 grams without BEVs?","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, Adam, this is Joe. Thanks for the question.","Adam Jonas","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph Hinrichs","Getting a lot of attention, so you're right. The regulations in Europe are not new to us. We've been planning for this really since 2013. And we have built the cost of this into our compliance into our business plans. We'll do it with electrification and improvements to our ICE powertrains. They're both important parts of the compliance plan.","As we said, we don't anticipate incurring fines or purchasing credits, assuming consumer demands there for the new products. I wouldn't assume that we won't have a BEV in the marketplace. We said electrification and improvement to ICE powertrains are part of that. But we feel very confident in our compliance plans and we've been planning for this for quite some time.","Adam Jonas","Okay. I mean, it's just a big statement. I think you're around 120, you get to 95 and maybe you can import some of the non-MEB, BEVs, but I imagine that would be pretty small volumes. So, it just stands out as we can take it offline. It stands out as a really big gap to cross in such short time that's more observation.","James Hackett","Yes. I appreciate the challenge, but I want you to know we're planning to make it.","Adam Jonas","Okay. The second question \u2013 thanks Jim. So, second question is maybe for \u2013 I don't know if Dave McClelland or Joe and you could take this on the Ford Credit side. If I asked you, obviously money and supply of money and availability of credits historically still pretty strong, maybe not as strong as it's ever been, but still in the strong category.","I'm wondering if you see anything, have I push you anything that you're seeing incrementally that might be a yellow light or a flickering green light? In terms of credit quality at the margin or anything on the funding side or consumer behavior delinquency side at all? Obviously, there's some natural seasoning and cyclicality, but I just wanted to know if there's anything that you thought was a little somebody's taking a look closer look at? Thanks.","Joseph Hinrichs","This is David. It sounds like he's asking about PD ratings of our customers and then what's the sources...","David McClelland","Sure. So, Adam, this is David. Tim mentioned in his introduction that the current environment looked pretty healthy and if I think about your question and looks at our portfolio or look at the originations. The strength of what we're seeing coming through the door is still really strong or average vehicles nearly 750. And we're not seeing any change in the higher risk.","A mix of business we're sitting at 5% that hasn't moved. In fact, generally subprime placements are lower quarter-over-quarter. There's no increase in term our average term 65 months and the industry 69. We're not seeing any growth in nearly four months. So, at origination, I don't see any flickering solid degree.","And then if you look at the performance of the portfolio, the portfolio continues to perform well. In fact, quarter-over-quarter our loss ratios have improved 60-day delinquency is done, repossession rate is done. And then even if I look at our leases, we've seen better than expected performance at auction.","We not at constant mix think that the used vehicle prices only be down 3%. So, as Tim said, it's healthy I think yes, to use your terminology it's solidly green.","Adam Jonas","Great David. Thank you very much.","James Hackett","Thanks Adam.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Colin, your line is open.","Colin Langan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just to start up, I mean, if you look at the guidance for global redesign costs, you're trending well below the full-year target, the outlook. Does that imply that there's still more major step coming through the year and given the size of these targets, does that mean something is going to be coming over the next few months? Any color there on how much more actions we should be expecting?","James Hackett","Yes. It's Jim. Colin, so the way we're monitoring this is, we took on the structure, the management structure, what we called the bureaucracy. So, we had four key goals in that. I'll just report to everyone; we exceeded every one of them. And this quarter was heavier in terms of impact of the cost of that than the first. There were more implications with people. And then in the restructuring, Tim, I'll let you talk about the flows there.","Tim Stone","Great. Thanks Jim. So, as I mentioned earlier, we had $1.2 billion in charges in the second quarter and then from a year-to-date standpoint, it's $1.7 billion in charges. And we're saying $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the full-year. So, it's certainly implies you have quite a way to go yet for the rest of the year.","Further detail on that, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate this time if you haven't made the decision on the ideas that we have for further redesign. But that's against the total backdrop of $11 billion over the next several years, all of which will provide us with opportunity over time to fundamentally continue to improve the underlying business and our cash generation growth opportunities and so forth.","And then from a cash standpoint, we have had $0.2 billion in cash this quarter and so far, year-to-date $0.4 billion and we're expecting $1.5 billion to $2 billion for the year now. Last quarter, we thought it may be closer to $2.5 billion. So, it has some deferral of $0.5 billion to $1 billion into 2020. But as you said, there is ways to go yet and lots of opportunity ahead to continue to redesign the business for the future.","Colin Langan","Got it. And in the quarter, commodity costs have really come down quite dramatically and I know your contracts are lagged, but looking into the second half, I mean is that going to be a tailwind and are you factoring in a tailwind to your guidance or any color there on the commodity?","Tim Stone","So, on the commodity front, we were at $0.2 billion adverse to the first half, but beyond what we've seen thus far as it relates to macro trends or expectations is factored into the guidance. So, there's no further commentary I'd offer for the back half of the year.","Colin Langan","Okay. Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","James Hackett","You bet.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan?","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's great to see on Slide 40 in the appendix, so many EBIT drivers of the consolidated operations in China being positive year-over-year in 2Q amidst a tough industry. With that said, given the relative size of the consolidated and the non-consolidated operations in China, it would seem the biggest opportunity for improvement is probably in the JVs, which were roughly flat year-over-year in 2Q.","Can you give us some indication of what is happening within that relatively placid $4 million change in EBIT or equity income? I imagine material volume declines may be offset by cost. And then I think you have downplayed expectations for much improvement in the JVs this year given the obvious industry headwinds and that the improvement will instead come from the consolidated ops, but going forward how much of a driver do you think improving JV income could be and when might we start to see some evidence of that?","James Hackett","I think that's an excellent question and I want you know it's something we talk about. Joe?","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes. Sure. So, thanks for the question. There is no question that in order for us to achieve the results, we're looking for over time in China our joint ventures, especially the Changan Ford joint ventures needs to improve its performance. I'd say that we have a lot of work to do.","You referenced the consolidated operations \u2013 improvements in the second quarter and first half of the year. And part of it is the volume losses that we've seen and the due to sales, but also managing the inventory down to the lowest level in 18 months. We feel good about that.","But going forward, we've just rebuilt the marketing and sales organization over the last several months with some very good hires and some very good restructuring. We're getting very strong participation with our joint venture partner, especially Changan and the rework we're doing with our marketing sales organization and the dealer relations.","It's going to take some time to rebuild all of that, but I would say that we're on a path that we've seen over the last couple of months, we saw stability in our sales really for the first time in about 18 months or so. We have a lot of work to do. Part of it will be cost, of course. We have right-sized at least the manning part of our manufacturing. There's a lot more work to do, given the lower volumes on the overall manufacturing footprint.","But the biggest opportunity for us is to rebuild the dealer profitability, the dealer engagement and the marketing sales organization in the joint venture and what to see \u2013 how long that takes, but we are making some good progress, but it's going to take some more time, and so \u2013 then of course the new products.","Remember that, we said that we're going to localize five more vehicles starting in 2019 that will help the joint venture, because the number of those products like Explore, Lincoln, Corsair are built in the joint venture. So, some of that localization will really help the joint venture and of course the new product launches we have over the next 18 months will help in the JV as well. So that's clearly our number one focus.","James Hackett","And I would just add, it's not something we talk about a lot from this table, but there was a lot of turmoil and turbulence in the leadership in China for Ford. We had somebody that resigned for personal reasons, we replaced that. And then we had another change. And so, I want to tell you with my tour, that Joe and I, we really feel good about the management team that's in place there and a lot of momentum starting to build with them and because how long it's been there?","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes. I think starting this in November.","James Hackett","November.","Joseph Hinrichs","So, not even* close to a year and really starting to getting some momentum there.","James Hackett","Yes. So, I just want to make sure that you guys hear that.","James Hackett","So, with the operator, I think it's time for us to wrap up. If it's okay, I'll go ahead and close with a few thoughts. I just want to say that our second quarter results demonstrate that this global redesign of Ford is driving positive shifts in our business and may emphasize today that the news in Europe is better and the redesign that we took with the bureaucratic structure of the company is \u2013 we met all the goals there. So, there is a lot of good news in this year of execution regarding that.","Thus, we are improving our fitness and that was a goal to make us more competitive. We are driving a winning portfolio. The logic, as you know, to move out of the sedans and the products like Ranger are paying off and we see ourselves fortifying strengths and improving mix and there's a really strong commitment as Adam asked us to expand that electric vehicle portfolio quickly. And, lastly, the trajectory of the company is improving. We believe \u2013 and strong in terms of growth, cash flow and profitability.","So, let me thank you for your attention this evening, and I'll turn it back to the operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Ford Motor Company second quarter earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-answer-session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Ian. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets; Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President of Global Operations; and Brian Schaff, CFO of Ford Credit.","Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled earlier this year, which we now call Creating Tomorrow, Together. Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then we'll open the call for questions. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.","Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com.","Today's discussions include forward looking statements about our expectations for future performance.

Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Lynn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'll briefly cover three topics before I turn it over to Bob for more detail and then we'll take your questions. First, let me provide an overview of third quarter results and our 2018 guidance, which remains unchanged. And then second, I'd like to share with you specific detail on the progress we're making against our strategy to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then third, I want to provide a look ahead at a number of upcoming touch points we'll have with investors and provide an update on our midterm guidance. So let's get started.","If you would, please turn to slide 2. Starting with the quarter, top line grew 3% in the face of significant global sector-wide headwinds and our company EBIT margin was sequentially unchanged, despite substantially lower volume. Our North America performance was strong with an EBIT margin of nearly 9%. And I have to say that the North American leadership team has done a great job optimizing every opportunity to improve growth and returns. And now, we're heading into a really busy and exciting period of product renewal, which you'll hear more about.","I believe North America results demonstrate the early evidence that our fitness actions and commitment to focus on higher return opportunities are now taking hold and this is driving a more resilient business model. Within North America results this quarter, we achieved a $1 billion mix improvement from our strong product line focus, including more F-150s and more Super Duties that had record transaction prices.","And additionally, the F-Series share of the full-size pickup segment increased in the quarter and Ford continued to be the number one best-selling brand in the U.S. We also remain the number one selling brand for commercial vehicles in Europe. In fact, we gained commercial vehicle share, reaching our highest quarterly share in over 25 years. In addition, we delivered record year to-date sales of Ranger in Asia Pacific.","I'm delighted that our earlier proclamations that we can find that right winning portfolio has this positive news in the quarter. Our future work on our portfolio is directed at making this even better. In addition, Ford Credit quarterly results were the best since 2011. We delivered positive company operating cash flow and we generated earnings per share of $0.29. Our balance sheet and available liquidity remain at healthy levels. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. In the quarter, we had over $23 billion of company cash and our target balance of $20 billion with liquidity over $34 billion.","Well, turning to the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of a range of $1.30 to $1.50 and positive cash flow, albeit lower than 2017.","So now let's go to page 3. This framework, which we have shown before, illustrates our plan for creating value for our stakeholders. At the highest level, the obvious strength of our F-Series trucks and our Transit family of commercial vehicles has positively driven margin in recent years. When I look back at these successes, there's not much I would have wanted to change. But it's clear these strengths probably masked weaknesses in the fitness of our overall business and also shrouded poor design elements of other areas of the business where we destroyed value.","To be a great company, my message to everyone is, we have to attack this opportunity. In answer to the question, what have we again been working on this past year? We've developed and implemented a plan to redesign the company to dramatically improve the fitness of the overall business, address those areas of weakness I just pointed out and prepare Ford to win in a fast-changing future. Our mission is to build on our traditional strengths, while capitalizing on the sweeping changes brought about by propulsion technology, shared mobility and artificial intelligence that are all ushering in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world.","Now this transformation is predicated on the best and highest use of our capital across four growth drivers. Now earlier, I mentioned the efforts on creating and bringing to market a winning portfolio, so let me start with that. At a high level, we plan to fortify and grow our leading position in trucks, our leading position in commercial vehicles and performance vehicles such as the Mustang. Despite our heritage in SUVs, we know we're not the leader in this space, but we certainly are a solid player. Customers consistently rave about products like the Ford Explorer and the new Lincoln Navigator. This is a multibillion dollar opportunity and we're moving with urgency to leverage our SUV expertise and brand image to become a global leader in utilities.","This drives clear choices, like our decision to phase out sedans over time in North America. Not only are customers increasingly migrating to different silhouettes, but also because of their lack of profitability, these traditional sedans destroy value. And we can reallocate that capital to higher return opportunities. This decision means new entries in the utilities, trucks and white space vehicles with new silhouettes that will be more attractive to customers, while delivering higher returns.","Last week, my team and I hosted almost 4,000 North American Ford dealers in Las Vegas and we showed them how our lineup of nameplates will grow in the next five years versus where we are now. Overall by 2020, we expect 75% of our lineup in the U.S. to be new or refreshed. In fact, I hope you saw the new Built Ford Proud ad campaign we launched this past weekend to support this product push.","To deliver this fresher, more vibrant lineup around the world, it's not enough just to reallocate capital to higher return opportunities, though. We also have to improve in two key areas, engineering efficiency and product line management. And both of these will deliver huge benefits downstream. You have heard Hau Thai-Tang, our executive over product development explain how we're moving to five flexible global architectures that will give us the ability to deliver more product faster and with that less capital.","We believe that we can reduce the time it takes from sketch to showroom by 20%, while improving capital efficiency by an additional 20%. In addition, we have implemented new product line management teams. These are agile cross-functional teams; they're responsible for product lines from end to end, including P&L. This brings us much closer to our customers and their wants and needs. We have established clear lines of responsibility for every product line with the mandate to deliver appropriate level of returns.","The next area of focus is propulsion and we use that term not to confuse you, but because we're going to offer our dealers a portfolio of powertrains to give our customers a variety of options. We have the internal combustion engine; we have hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric. And, yes, we are redeploying capital and increasing investment in electrification, and I'm even more excited about the strategic view that we've developed here. We're going to electrify our most popular nameplates like the F-150, Explorer, Mustang and Transit.","We'll leverage hybrids to deliver fuel economy and performance, similar to the way we employed EcoBoost so successfully in the past decade. For example, we currently offer hybrids on three of our U.S. nameplates. And by 2022, we'll have \u2013 offer hybrids or plug-in hybrid powertrains or both on 12 nameplates.","We're developing a suite of fully-electric vehicles that aspire to have an impact like other exceptional nameplates you associate with Ford. An example is the performance utility vehicle coming in 2020 that has received early reporting from the press, and yes, we will also offer fully-electric commercial vehicles. In fact, further on electrification, we'll leverage partnerships with Zotye and JMC in China and Mahindra in India to deliver affordable electric vehicles at scale. Well, as you know, our customers have an intimate trust in Ford Motor Company and we are confirming to them with all this kind of news that Ford is committed as a company to meet the Paris Accord for CO2 and we love the challenge of doing it in a way that excites them, helps them get their work done, while supporting strong returns for Ford.","We are making real strides in autonomous vehicles and are in a far better competitive position than we were only a year ago. In August, we formed our standalone Autonomous Vehicles LLC. As expected and intended, we're receiving significant interest from potential partners and financial investors. And due to the trust our customers have in the Blue Oval, we are singularly focused on developing a profitable business model, gated by safety. Look for an event we have planned in Miami early next month to share much more about our self-driving system and business model innovation related to autonomy.","And then with Mobility. When we refer to Mobility in our discussions, I want to be very clear: Mobility is all about wrapping software and services in new offerings to our customers. We already made a financial commitment to build our Transportation Mobility Cloud. This is an open platform through which Ford and its partners can deliver a myriad of products and services that will drive higher margins and recurring revenue streams that enable greater functionality and productivity for our customers.","For example, yesterday, Ford Commercial Solutions announced a partnership with Avis to connect more than 35,000 Ford vehicles in the Avis fleet. These vehicles will allow Avis customers to manage their entire rental experience through the Avis mobile app. Additionally, these Ford vehicles will provide valuable telemetry data in real time, including odometer, fuel level and vehicle condition updates, allowing Avis fleet to quickly process information to prepare vehicles for customers. No longer will you have to report your fuel when you turn your car in.","Now, having provided that overview, I want to emphasize that we've had an extremely productive quarter in terms of putting building blocks in place to support that strategy. Let me share some key highlights here. In the U.S., our product offensive started in earnest with the launch of the Edge and the Edge ST. And just this past Monday, Joe Hinrichs and I celebrated the start of production for the new Ranger pickup in the United States, which will be on sale early next year. This all-new Focus is off to a strong start in Europe. And in China, we introduced the Territory SUV, which will be key to reaching new customers in second-tier Chinese cities.","In terms of autonomy, we just announced our second test city in the U.S., which is Washington D.C. And this will allow us to accelerate and build on the work we are already doing in Miami.","I was also part of an announcement where we are teaming up with Uber and Lyft to support a concept called Shared Streets. This is a platform designed to leverage data to improve urban mobility. The datasets pledged by all three of us will provide the public and private sectors with new tools to reduce congestion and emissions, while improving the efficiency of city streets, making it easier and safer for everyone to get around.","Let me add that our performance in China clearly has been disappointing. I can assure you the leadership of the company has swarmed the issue and we identified what is required for a turnaround plan. Importantly, you read yesterday that we named a new CEO of Ford China. I'm excited about the hire of Mr. Anning Chen, whose background, believe it or not, includes a stint at Ford more than a decade ago. Anning's appointment allows us to reorganize our AP region so that China is now a standalone business, reporting directly to Jim Farley to ensure that we improve speed, execution and local expertise.","No doubt you've read about the fact that we've recently kicked off a redesign of our global salaried workforce. This is a new approach and it will improve costs. But that's only a secondary benefit. The sustainable fitness targets that I put out there \u2013 ensure that we recognize that our organization must be more agile, accountable, flatter and faster. This is important to the kind of company we're trying to become. This kind of fundamental change, especially in how we work and what we work on, cannot be solely designed from the executive suite and executed top down. The goals here are to flatten the organization and increase managers' span of control.","We've already had success at Ford when we've given people this type of approach and the chance to redesign their teams and how they work. This isn't a new experiment. Quietly, the North American team, for example, has set up energy rooms where cross-functional teams focus on specific product opportunities. We're smiling because there's no private offices, no endless PowerPoint, no faceless emails and no long meetings. It's been a revelation to see how fast they have moved to improve the business, evidenced by the strong margins you're seeing that North American has delivered the past two quarters. And yes to the question, we are racing to replicate this globally over the next few months and we plan to provide an update on the efficiencies we're getting from this in future calls.","The transformation I've just shared with you is but one of a fraction of what we as a team have imagined and we clearly are executing. For example, we previously told you that our marketing function needed an overhaul to become more fit, effective and modern, especially in terms of leveraging Big Data and technology. Well, we've taken action. Earlier this month, we announced key changes to bolster our in-house capability and we moved to a new agency model that will yield more creativity and substantial efficiencies. So we're addressing real issues. We are moving quickly to redesign the business in support of our stated strategy.","With that progress, I know that you want to hear more about how we'll implement the $11 billion restructuring plan, which we highlighted in the second quarter, as well at that time, we talked about ongoing discussions with various strategic partners such as the one with VW and the partnership with Mahindra. These are big pieces of the picture that I'm trying to paint and we're fully committed to sharing detail as soon as we can. But I can't allow us to get ahead of the process. I assure you that the need to get our stakeholders up to speed is the priority for me and the entire company.","But I've committed to you that we'll have several touch points with you in the coming weeks and months to give more specific detail of areas of important progress in AVs, the extensive fitness plans that we're now implementing and progress on our strategic partnerships.","So before I turn it over to Bob, let me touch on our medium-term targets. There are adjustments here given the dynamics of the environment and I want you to pay close attention. We know that the underlying earnings power of the company is at least at an 8% EBIT margin or better with a high-teen return on invested capital. I mean, we know this because 150% of our EBIT is already coming from products generating mid-teen margins, with an ROIC above 40%. We've been transparent about this.","In April, on a call like this, we said we believe we could hit an 8% EBIT margin and a high-teen ROIC by 2020. And at the time, that was assuming reasonable economic conditions. We also said that our improved fitness would drive a more resilient business model at all points of the cycle, which I want to confirm we continue to stand by. Well, the news today is that the current external environment has driven higher costs and uncertainty for the entire sector. And as we said last quarter, we had an unexpected deterioration in our business in both Europe and China. As a result of these factors, our current forecast shows we will not reach our EBIT margin and ROIC targets by 2020.","However, I tell you as I told the board, we're not standing still. We're attacking everything that is in our control. We're working with urgency to re-design our business to operate more profitably. Our fitness initiatives are tracking as planned, our restructuring and strategic partnering initiatives are progressing and our reallocation of capital toward a winning portfolio of products and services is beginning to deliver results. Our progress on these fronts gives us even more confidence that we are building a more resilient and vibrant high-performing company capable over time of attaining EBIT margins of 8% or better, with an ROIC in the high teens.","So at this point, I'll turn it over to Bob, and I'll be back to you in a moment to answer questions. Bob?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start my comments on slide 6, pointing out a few items from the company key metrics. So first, we reported mixed results on the top line, with company revenue higher than a year ago, driven by strong product mix in North America. Wholesale volume, on the other hand, was down 10%, and this was largely due to our joint ventures in China and Turkey. Market share also was lower. This was driven by lower share in China, although we had share declines across all regions. Company [Company EPS came in at $0.29] and this reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of about 11%. Finally, net income was $1 billion [down $600 million from a year ago].","Now to put the quarter into context against recent performance, you can see on slide 7 that revenue was lower than in the past three quarters due, mainly, to lower volume. Now, some of this is seasonal, reflecting the normal summer plant shutdowns that occur in Europe and North America. Company EBIT and EBIT margin were essentially flat from the second quarter despite the lower volume, and our positive company operating cash flow was substantially higher than the second quarter and a year ago.","Now turning to slide 8, we see the absolute results for our company across our reporting elements. Company EBIT was driven by Auto and Ford Credit results, with losses as expected in Mobility and Corporate Other. The Mobility loss was split about equally between investments in mobility services and our Autonomous Vehicle business. The increased loss from a year ago also was driven about equally by higher investments in both those areas of our Mobility segment.","The Corporate Other loss consists of costs for corporate governance, mark-to-market adjustments of marketable securities and interest income. The year-over-year increase in the loss was due to higher governance costs and unfavorable fair market valuation adjustments to our marketable securities.","The details of our Automotive segment, which are shown on slide 9, highlight our performance in North America, where we generated a healthy EBIT of $2 billion, which is higher than a year ago despite lower volume and higher commodity costs. This was enabled by strongly positive mix, as our portfolio continues to shift more to trucks, utilities and vans. As a result, and as Jim mentioned, EBIT margin reached nearly 9%, which compares to an average first-half margin of 7.6%.","While we continue to see a combined loss in our Auto operations outside North America, the loss slightly improved from the second quarter despite lower volume. This includes adjustments to dealer inventories in China that now have us positioned right where we want to be in terms of days supply.","In South America, the ongoing recovery in Brazil slowed, due predominantly to external headwinds, including an 18% currency depreciation compared to a year ago and increasing inflation, including higher commodity prices. In Argentina, the peso lost 45% of its value compared to a year ago and annual inflation is running at 34%. Our team has responded with substantial price increases, resistance of inflation recovery by suppliers, and continued reduction in structural costs. We also continue to progress our plans to fundamentally transform our longer-term operating model in the region.","Turning to Europe, we saw favorable market factors from a year ago related to new products, such as EcoSport, Fiesta and Transit Custom. Our Commercial business continue to be strong as well, delivering a record market share as Jim noted. EBIT, however, deteriorated from the year ago largely due to unfavorable external factors affecting performance in Turkey and Russia, combined with launch-related cost from the new Focus. Our team is focused on accelerating actions to improve our near-term performance, while we continue to put in place the plans to substantially to redesign our future business in Europe.","In Asia Pacific, the markets outside China remained profitable although lower than a year ago, generating a 9% EBIT margin, as in the second quarter, the EBIT loss in Asia Pacific was driven by China reflecting the loss for consolidated China operations, as well as at our China joint ventures. The losses were driven by the same factors as in the prior quarter, which is lower volume and lower net pricing.","Compared to our second quarter, however, we reduced the loss in China by over $100 million, or about 20%. We've made very good progress in addressing the underlying issues with more work to do. We're focused intensely on our sales turnaround plan for China and we're now just at the beginning of a strong product launch cadence, starting with the all-new Territory SUV, the all-new Focus and the new Escort.","All of these models will make significant contributions to reinvigorating our sales growth in the first quarter next year. We also expect to benefit as we move forward from the added focus of transitioning China to a standalone business unit within Ford, led by a strong Chinese leader with deep local knowledge and proven, extensive operating experience.","We also intend to strengthen over time our position in emerging markets, enabled in part by the creation of a business unit largely focused on how to win in these challenging and growing markets.","Let's turn now to slide 10, Ford Credit key metrics. Ford Credit was an outstanding performer in the quarter, generating an EBT of $678 million, which was the best quarter in over seven years. This was driven by favorable volume and mix and favorable lease residuals. We saw our auction values rise 5% from prior year at constant mix and we now expect auction values for the full year to improve on average 3% at constant mix. We're very encouraged that U.S. consumer credit metrics remain healthy and in addition Ford Credit's balance sheet remains strong, with managed leverage remaining within the targeted range of 8:1 to 9:1.","Slide 11 reminds us of the strength and stability of Ford's balance sheet, featuring cash and liquidity levels in excess of our targets, and global-funded pension plans that remain fully funded. Finally, we're reaffirming our guidance for full-year company-adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.50 per share.","So in addition to what Jim and I covered in the call, we have provided supplemental material in the earnings deck with more details and insights on the business.","So with that, what I'd like to do is to turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening, guys. Jim, just in your comments and the way you're discussing everything, all the actions you're taking at the company, it kind of feels like the restructuring actions that you're talking about, $11 billion non-cash, $7 billion cash will be over a multiyear period and maybe more of a rolling process as opposed to what some of us in the industry are used to as sort of a big-bang outline of a plan and massive charters upfront. Is that possibly a correct characterization and we're going to learn about this along the way? Because $7 billion and $11 billion over a three-to-five-year period in the auto industry can get washed out in the total to some degree. I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about this, if this is more of an ongoing rolling program as opposed to a big-bang one.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I think if I could have some license to think of the language a little differently, let me set this up for Bob, which is the way Bob and I think about this is I've come into the company trying to assess the design of the business kind of at an underlying level. Design for, as you know, John, reduced capital, higher margins, but there's other things, clock speed. We're talking about things moving faster. And when you think about that, I sit in your shoes and you say, hey, when will we know this? At what rate are you making these things happen? What I remind everybody of is we first have to find the areas that need the attention. We're through that. We then have to design the solutions for them. We're through a lot of that, but not all of it. And then we have to put them in place and perform.","So if you read any hesitancy from me, it's not that we don't know where we're going or that we don't know how to do it, it's that it's a massive undertaking that we have to have very thoughtfully orchestrated. Because my experience in doing this is the worst thing we could do is disrupt our business and we aren't going to do that. So now, the accounting of it and things like that, I'm going to turn it to Bob and let him \u2013 give your opinion on that.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I just want to supplement what Jim said. I think that's a perfect way of thinking about the way you expressed it, John. I'm very thankful for the question. When you think about the business and even if you look at the quarter, we have a strong North America, can be and should be stronger, but it's now gaining momentum. We have a strong Commercial business in Europe despite the loss that we had in the quarter. We talked about a big part of geography in terms of the market outside of China and Asia Pacific, a 9% margin. I didn't talk about MENA, but there we had I think a 7% or 8% margin. A small market, but it's 1.3 billion consumers and it is going to grow dramatically over the next 10 years and we're already starting to see the ability to be profitable there.","So it's the rest of the business, right? And that business has got to be fundamentally redesigned. The restructuring is an output of that or a result of it. It's not a restructuring play, it's a redesign play. The result is the consequence of this restructuring and it will unfold. There will be, I presume, spikes. There'll be like a big thing that comes in this region at a certain point in time and then maybe it's a bit quiet for a while then something else big as we get to that next chapter of what's going to be an unfolding story. So I think that's a perfect way to think about it, which also I hope \u2013 I know it's frustrating, but I hope it helps investors understand why one can't sort of go to the last page of the book and look at the ending. It's got to sort of unfold. And that's \u2013 and we'll share everything with you as we can and as things are announced.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And, John, just to confirm too, you know that at the point where you're examining these kinds of options, if there was expedience options or more big bang ways of doing things, yeah, I was open to all kinds of ideas like that. That's what we've already plowed through. And so your understanding tonight should be just the way Bob and I are describing it.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to be clear, the timeframe is around five years in sort of what you're thinking here as far as what you know right now? Is that about right?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I mean, our business planning period is five years. There will be a lot that is completed in five years, but frankly, I think there'll be some elements that go on a bit beyond that. Let me just give you a good example. We may have made recent investments in new products that a normal cycle would be to run for five years. As long as those products are generating positive cash flow and sort of an incremental basis, we'll run them out. So we're not going to short cycle them at the expense of being able to demonstrate how strong we are in taking action. We want to generate cash. And so the consequences then of that running out and not redeploying capital in that particular location or plant or segment could result then in something that takes place outside the period.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And, John, it wouldn't be fair to say it takes a full five years, right? So part of the reason we're going to have a gathering where Joe Hinrichs takes you through a deeper understanding of the fitness actions is that you can see the range of things in terms of \u2013 some of them are, what I call, the now-near-far kind of clock. Some of them are now. Some of them are actually impacting now. I think we're trying to be really clear that North America, some of its results are from many of the fitness actions that we put in place a year ago. But you're also right that some are going to take longer because they're more complicated design challenges.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a follow up on this. I mean, we're two years away from where you talking about hitting 8% EBIT and high teens return on invested capital. Obviously, market dynamics have changed dramatically more recently, so understandable. But just curious, what kind of market dynamics you need to hit those numbers? I mean, are we looking at sort of \u2013 is this sort of a mid-cycle thought process? I mean, just really trying to understand what you're thinking about there, because it is a big change.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","I think it's really more around timing. We had expected to hit those types of numbers in our five-year planning period. Back earlier in the year, we saw the opportunity to do that earlier through the impact of the fitness actions. But subsequent to that, we've seen more bad news on commodities, some related to policy, some not. We've seen issues on exchange. We've seen South America take another dip and so forth. So, there's \u2013 Turkey is another one, Russia. So, there are other issues.","And then, frankly, what we saw happen in Europe and in China that was unrelated to externals, we expect and are addressing them very aggressively. But as you kind of flow that through to 2020, that could still have some sort of negative impact versus what we had expected back in April. Trust for that not to happen, but based on looking at the numbers today, that's where we are and we've just got to disclose what we see and that's where we are. But certainly, we're not backing off and we certainly see the ability to achieve the 8% margin and the mid-teen ROIC in the years ahead.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Those targets are still there.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And this is the tough kind of leadership question. We have to keep our foot on the throat of our performance, so we are doing that. All of us are really happy actually about the momentum we're building as we adjust that target. Isn't that ironic? But we think it's important as we get a better handle on our business that we share with you that we need to change the timeframe on that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just one last quick one on market dynamics. Net price in North America, negative $318 million, a little bit surprising to the downside. Obviously, mix is a huge, more than positive offset. Just curious what you're seeing in the dynamics in the North American market because some of the data we're getting externally is kind of positive and negative and it's kind of a little bit unclear to understand exactly what's going on there.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","I think that's a fair question. Let me give that to Jim Farley.","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Certainly, in the utility and car markets, we're seeing more pressure because of availability, but it's really encouraging to see Ford's performance in full-size truck. Our transaction price is up more than the market. Our share is up. It's never been a more competitive segment. Ford's lead continues to grow. And we've had meaningful product investment, new diesel, Raptor is being well-received, new powertrains, so that all helped.","I think the opportunity for us is, as we refresh those utilities next year, we really accelerate our opportunity for pricing and mix. These are high-volume products for us with enormous car parks and we're going off older vehicles to brand-new vehicles. I think we'll have the freshest utility lineup in the U.S. here pretty soon.","So as far as the background market, I think it's \u2013 we're really in a bit of a different situation given the freshness of our products, so great opportunity for us.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim, that's the Escape and the Explorer next year, is that correct?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Among others. We actually have more Lincoln. We have quite a few and of course, we have 13 million pickup truck owners in the U.S. and we're about to launch a great new Ranger, which is a brand-new nameplate, so it's not just utilities, it's also pickup.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to follow on some of the longer-term planning and some of the market dynamics that you didn't anticipate that caused to take that down, have you similarly built in some contingencies around potential variation, your assumptions for the North America market or does that also assume that we remain roughly around the current levels?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Joe. I'm going to let Bob add to this, but in my text, remember I made reference to resiliency more than once. Because one of the things we hope to convince you of is that the design of the business has more resiliency in the downturn. So it's my expectation that you wouldn't be modeling that the way you used to. But Bob, how would you...","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I guess from a couple of standpoints. Joe, one is, and this has been our view for quite a long period of time, is that we do expect industry to decline over the next number of years, I mean, still be strong absent a recession, but to decline in part due to affordability from all these increasing transaction prices and ultimately the effect of rising interest rates on monthly payments. We also have not assumed that there is any material change in the level of commodity prices that we're seeing, and that's hitting North America more than any other business unit. And that includes the bubble that we presently have in place that's a result of some of the policy decisions that have been made. So that's not assumed to back off. So all those could be opportunities if that weren't the case.","And then of course we do normal modeling, both variable and central cases around other scenarios that affect each of our regions and as well as North America. So if there's something else that you had in mind, but that is sort of the present thinking around those assumptions.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And then the second question is, not to get too semantic, but I think there's a lot of investor concerns and questions over this, on Slide 11 when you say committed to the regular dividend through the cycle, is that at current levels? Or just to continue to pay a dividend through the cycle?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","At current levels.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","The regular dividend.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thanks.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And we want to emphasize that we don't know how we've lost control of the way that's been projected, but we've been consistent saying that we plan to pay the regular dividend in this five-year plan.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Actually just to follow up on that, there's also questions about your credit rating. How important is it to maintain investment grade in your view? Because I imagine the dividends and all this cash restructuring, I think of many that are (41:04) getting downgraded, how critical is it?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, it's important. I mean, we have been there before, don't want to go back. But the impact is largely on, firstly, Ford Credit. We have to fund them to the tune of over $40 billion a year. And of course some of that is unsecured, some of it's securitized. So it impacts the size of the market that we have available for that funding and obviously the cost of it. Ultimately Ford Credit is going to pass that cost along to Automotive, so at the end of the day it sits in Automotive in terms of the impact. But it's important. I think it's an important thing. It's not around the balance sheet. It's not around the fact that we pay a dividend. It's around the operating performance of the business. It's very, very clear in talking with the rating agencies that even if we stop paying the dividend, that doesn't address the operating performance.","So we're extremely focused, going back to what Jim talked about around the EBIT margin, return on invested capital, we are extremely focused on getting this business back on to a stronger operating performance track, because that is the issue that the rating agencies are expressing concern around. Obviously it relates to cash flow generation at the end of the day, but that is what we've got to focus on, is that issue. It's not a dividend issue; it's an operating performance issue.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just to follow up on the question on the 2020 target, why not just push the targets out? I mean, there's no \u2013 unless I misread it, there's no new target date. But any color on why the decision not to just to actually put it back to where it originally was?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, we haven't \u2013 not done that, I mean we're just simply saying it's not going to be in 2020. Since we had put that marker out there and based on what's happened since then, we're compelled to share with you that we don't see, at the moment, a way to get there. So we're simply saying, not in 2020. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, certainly we're trying to get there as soon as we can. But I'm not going to put a timeframe on it because I don't want to have to come back again and change it.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just lastly on China, any sense to when that stabilizes? And any idea when it gets back to a profit? How should we think of that inflection? Thanks.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Again, I'll turn this to Jim Farley, because Jim has been making a trip there almost every three weeks and you've heard about the news in the organization. I've been talking to the partner. While we've been fixing Ford's problems, there's a lot that's been going on in China. And Jim, you might share what you're seeing the last three months in China at large.","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Sure. Well, first of all, this is such an important and urgent work by the team. The good news is we've addressed the error states we had, which is great. The stocks are down to 45 days. Dealers are profitable again and our sell-down units for these new products, the three that Bob mentioned were in fantastic shape. So we \u2013 I think we are in really good foundation for the launch of these new products that come basically, as Bob said, in the first quarter. And these are high volume products for us.","Anning is a very experienced operations leader. And we feel that the accelerated costs, addressing the cost in the business is really essential for our profit turnaround in China. He has deep experience in purchasing, engineering and these are going to be keys to our turnaround in China for profit. The other one is profit line management, which has really yielded so much benefits here in North America. With these new launches, a launch mix in rates, series, feature content, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive better margins in China. So as far as the Ford team is concerned, this is all hands on deck, as Jim mentioned, and we are working urgently and as a team, as you can imagine.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Want to talk about industry sales?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, industry, as you know in the third quarter was down about 10% in China. To be honest, that's a bit expected because the previous two years, there was a purchase incentive boost to the industry, which was eliminated this year. We saw a pretty big hangover in the first quarter. Industry demand came back, but it has not really recovered to last year's level in the third quarter. As Bob said, there's a lot of speculation about incentives or not. Look, our turnaround in China is really up to us. It's about our new products and our cost performance. But we definitely see a weaker market there. Some of it is external. Some of it is internal, like the purchase tax I mentioned. But for us, the opportunity is within our control.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Thank you very much.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Colin.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the earlier color in China, too, but wanted to ask on Lincoln in China specifically and on branding more generally. Relative to these tariffs that you're having to pay 40% now, where are you in terms of the localization of Lincoln in China? Can that at all be accelerated?","And then the more general branding question is, previously I think it was seen that Lincoln would benefit in China from being associated with like the limousines used historically by American presidents, et cetera, by its American branding. Just curious how you think American car brands are being perceived in China currently with some of the headlines this year. I see Chevrolet and Cadillac seem to be doing all right, so maybe there hasn't been too much change, but just wanted to check in to see if you're detecting anything at the margin.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, the good news is \u2013 great question \u2013 good news is we have not seen any sentiment change at the consumer level. In fact, Lincoln is up about 3% year over year for us, despite having to take pricing. So we see continued very strong demand. We watch the favorability of both the Ford and the Lincoln brand monthly and we have not seen any change in the favorability of the brand as of yet. And this is a very important question about localization of Lincoln. We haven't been specific about the model. But one of the keys to our profit improvement plan for China will be accelerating our localization. We've already announced a Ford-modeled Explorer as well as a Lincoln model and that's very key to our progress.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. And then I thought I'd ask too on Europe and WLTP, what has been the impact to your position there? How are you positioned relative to the other automakers in regards to that transition? And then just more generally in Europe; on the last call ,you talked about how maybe there hadn't been as much of a profit improvement from some of the recent launches over there. Just wanted to follow up to see if that was still the case and what your current plan might be to improve the profit in Europe short of the better contribution margin from new models, et cetera.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Well, WLTP has been a really large effect in Europe. As you know, it's had a pretty big industry effect. The great news is that Ford planned this very thoughtfully. We had no capacity issues, very little in our transition to 6.2. We're already through that transition. So Joe's team did a fantastic job and we don't really see any hiccups in our business due to that. But I know it \u2013 obviously it has a big impact on the industry as a whole. We're seeing \u2013 we're kind of entering the second month of a hangover for the sell-down of 6.1, but we're through that now as a team. As far as Europe is concerned, Bob mentioned it, we have such a gem in our LCV business, continues to get stronger actually for us. Our share goes up. Even if the UK, our leading market is down, we continue to make more progress.","The opportunity for us in Europe is twofold for our profit turnaround. The first is costs in every part of our business and the team is really \u2013 continues to accelerate that work and we're working with all of our stakeholders on that. The other one is addressing our mix deficit on our passenger cars. We just have been under-representing the utilities, as Jim said, globally, but especially in Europe. But that all changes as we launch a new generation of utilities in Europe and even add nameplates next year and beyond. So I think the mix effect and cost will be key.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just very lastly, on mix in North America, looks like there's some very impressive gains there. Can you elaborate on the drivers? I think I heard SUVs. Anything else? Speak to the sustainability of that. And I just wanted to check too because the line item there is called mix\/other. What the other bit might entail and its sustainability?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, it's almost nothing. It's almost all product mix. And about 60% of it is that we're selling \u2013 as a percent of our total sales, we're selling more F-Series, more Navigators, more Expeditions, more higher margin products. And about 40% is that we're selling less of cars, but also the Escape. And I think the Escape one is an interesting one. We're going to launch a new Escape next year. And Jim might want to comment on it. We're actually taking conscious actions, decisions to kind of pull back a bit on volume because we're trying, not trying, but we're protecting, if you will, residual values and protecting the nameplate brand as we prepare for the launch of the new one. So as a result, less of those, so it's benefited us to the tune of favorable mix overall. Do you want to comment on that? And it's a great example of like the work we're doing around the product rooms.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","We believe as the utility business in the U.S. becomes a lot more competitive, given all the nameplates have been launched, Bob said we really feel like there's two big bets for Ford. The first is differentiation, where we're going to expand the number of nameplates into more differentiated, like authentic off-roaders or really fantastic on-road urban crossovers. But the other one is to address our total cost of ownership. We feel that for models like Escape, for them to continue to be great profit opportunities for the company, the residual value, the fuel economy performance of the vehicle, these are critical metrics for this leadership team.","And as Bob said, we are actually taking some short-term share decisions on Escape to protect the transition to the new vehicle as well as protect our residual value to minimize our variable marketing spend. And that's another reason why we've had this mix effect.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, great. Got a couple of questions here. I think we'll start with 2018 guidance. You held the $1.30 to $1.50, but you brought your tax rate down from 13% to 10%. I think that implies a couple of hundred million dollars of EBIT where your guidance got lowered. It looks like that might just be South America instead of improving just being flat, but wondering if there's any other buckets that we should be looking at for that implied EBIT guidance reduction.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","We haven't adjusted our EBIT guidance reduction, our guidance. We had a guidance on EPS and that is still within the range of $1.30 to $1.50. We've not provided any guidance on EBIT. So it is incorrect to assume that there's a reduction.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Follow up on that later. Jim, on the fitness plans that you've outlined, it's about $25.5 billion (53:10), I know it's over a long period of time. But I'm just wondering how much, if any, has accrued to the bottom line so far in this quarter?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","You're asking the question of in the five-year plan, what has happened in one quarter?","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Well, I'm asking to see if there's been any traction with those cost savings initiatives dropping to the bottom line just yet?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm trying to get at how precise you want that to be. So this is where I guess I was a minute ago, David, that we're seeing definite benefits now in our business. We said these were back-end-loaded because of the description I gave you a moment ago when I was reminding you how these processes get identified, to be reengineered, to be put in place, to realize value, kind of those four steps. So more value comes in the future. But it is happening and I've cited for you in North America is where I'm seeing early benefits. There's a concept that we've called yield management, which is one of the 19 that we're seeing real-time benefits there.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","But nothing quantifiable?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, it's been \u2013 for the year it's several hundred million dollars. I wouldn't be more specific than that.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just lastly for me, since you've outlined the modular architectures, I'm curious how much CapEx has been already spent on that transition, how long that's been contemplated within the organization and if there's any incremental spend that needs to be done in order to get you there and transition the portfolio?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Again, David, I'm sorry, but let me see if I can reframe that. So you realize the refreshing \u2013 the freshening that we just have done that we're just launching, the \u2013 kind of the capital that we have spent there, tied to the new products is one thing. And then this concept of these architectures, all the new things that are coming after this most recent refreshing. And so we have, in the five-year plan, definite capital improvements. I think I mentioned that in the text.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","You did. I'm asking because other OEMs have discussed developing modular architectures and it's taken multiple years for them to get to that and deploy it. So the question really is how much of that has already been done or established and behind us versus going forward and needs to be spent while you're launching those products?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, well, let me tag team with Joe here because, remember as part of his executive role, he helped put this new architecture in. Joe, what's your sense of...?","Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, the way I would describe it is we're at the peak of our capital and we've acknowledged that in our previous discussions. We're going to see the benefits over the next several years as the new product programs that we're launching today get the full benefit of the architecture and module work. So you're accurate in saying \u2013 in thinking that we'll get more benefit as the years progress, but we are starting to see engineering savings in the near term. On a capital basis, the capital reuse work we're doing and with the module architecture work combined will save a significant amount of capital over the next several years.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, the only thing I would add and Joe can tell me if I'm wrong \u2013 but I think, David, conceptually, some of these things were piloted with our C2 platform, which is the new platform that underpins the Focus, the new Escape that comes and so forth. So a lot of it was piloted on that. That's already starting to go into our plants. So I think the learnings from that have just been further developed. So unlike some competitors who had huge changeover costs associated with going to a different approach, we don't see that happening inside Ford. And in fact, as Joe mentioned, we expect to see efficiencies moving forward.","Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.","That's exactly right. We're timing it to the introduction of the new products. So we're doing this in a timely manner. But that product freshening that Jim Farley and Jim Hackett both talked about, it times nicely with the execution of all these initiatives.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. That's helpful. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks for the questions.","Operator","And I believe we have time for one last question. Our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good evening. Maybe just one more on the 2018 guidance for Bob. Is there any bias in terms of the range on the EPS or kind of the factors that would cause to be at the low versus the higher end of that? And then maybe just to confirm, do you expect Q4 to still have positive operating cash flow?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","So I'm not providing anything other than saying that we're very comfortable with the range that we've provided and expect the business to come in within that range at the end of the year. In terms of cash flow, I'm not providing any guidance on cash flow, other than for the full year, which should still be consistent with the guidance we've provided all throughout the year, which is positive, but down from last year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then on North America, I mean, looks like if I back out some of the recent recalls and some of the issues in Q2, you're running comfortably above 9% and you talked about the product cycle you have coming in the next couple of years. I guess, what will prevent North America from running even above the 10% that you previously talked about in the next couple of years?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, North America should. I mean, that's one of the things that Kumar and the team are working on with their Return to 10 initiatives. I mean, at this point in the cycle, it should. But if you think about the headwinds that Ford has around commodities, it's about $1.5 billion this year and the vast, vast majority of it sits in North America. So that alone is worth quite a bit of margin, if you will. So I think if anything, you've raised a point around some of the increases we've seen recently in warranty costs.","You think about that, you think about the commodities, we're investing in EVs, which of course has an impact, we're not selling them yet, all those things and to see North America starting to pick up a pace in terms of its margin, it's 9% or near 9% in the quarter. It's very, very encouraging because they really should be operating at that type of 10%-plus level at this point in time. They understand that and that's what they're working to achieve.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. That's all I had.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Itay.","Operator","That concludes the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you very much. Just want to confirm quickly that we're moving with urgency to execute against this strategy. We are pleased with signs of our success. These are early signs, including strong results as we just talked about, with the EBIT margin in North America of almost 9%. We're very, very happy with the strong balance sheet with over $34 billion in liquidity and we're making great progress on the product portfolio, I can't emphasize that enough. The dealers last week with lots of applause supported that. The redesign of the business includes these strategic partnerships with VW and Mahindra. They're all on track.","And finally, we look forward to sharing more about this global redesign of the company. We are going to be coming to you more frequently, including we're going to talk about these strategic partnerships in the near future. Thanks for your coverage and we look forward to our next call.","Operator","This does conclude the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Ford Motor Company. Please proceed, sir.","George Sharp","Thank you, Mark and good morning. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our first quarter 2015 financial results.","Copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s investor and media websites. Presenting today are Mark Fields, President and CEO and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings. Finally, any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck. Our Form 10-Q is planned to be released this afternoon.","With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mark Fields.","Mark Fields","Okay. Thanks, George and good morning, everybody. So, why don\u2019t we just get ready to the first slide? As you can see here, our plan for profitable growth and of course our focus as a business continue to deliver and they remain unchanged. And it starts with accelerating the pace of progress of our ONE Ford plan, while at the same time delivering product excellence and driving innovation in every part of our business.","Going on to Slide 2, you can see that the first quarter was a good start to the year in which our results will grow progressively stronger as we launch the new products and we continue to build momentum. And while wholesales were about unchanged due to major product launches and the revenue was down mainly because of the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on our international operations, we grew our global market share and achieved profitability in four of our six business units. We are updating our guidance for the year for some of our business units and we now expect North America\u2019s operating margin to be stronger than previously expected and that the loss in South America will be greater, but still an improvement from last year due to the deteriorating external conditions that we see there. We are also reconfirming that 2015 will be a breakthrough year for Ford, including company pre-tax guidance of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion with automotive revenue, our operating margin and operating related cash flow to be higher than 2014.","On Slide 3, as we talk about our plan to deliver profitable growth, you can see that we delivered in the first quarter, from several new Ford and Lincoln products and new plants and facilities to being named the only automaker on the list of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies and growing our dividend, we are very pleased with our progress.","So, with that, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Bob and then he will take us through the details. So, Bob, why don\u2019t you take away?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Mark and good morning everybody. Let\u2019s start at the top on Slide 4. Our first quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units, which was down 21,000 units from a year ago and the revenue was $33.9 billion, which was down $2 billion. Our pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion, $24 million better than a year ago and after-tax earnings per share at $0.23 or $0.02 lower. Net income attributable to Ford was $924 million that was $65 million lower than a year ago, more than explained by a higher operating tax rate this quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $500 million. It was lower than a year ago due to less favorable working capital changes and higher net spending. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $19.5 billion, exceeding debt by $6.1 billion.","Our first quarter operating effective tax rate was 34% compared to 26% a year ago. The increase is mainly the geographic mix of our regional results. We expect our second quarter rate to be about 34% as well. And for the full year, we now expect our rate to be about equal to or higher than our 2014 rate of 26%. This outlook continues to assume extension of U.S. research credit legislations in the fourth quarter.","And as you can see on Slide 5 both of our sectors automotive and financial services contributed to our first quarter pre-tax profit and both improved compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2014.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6, where you can see the key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business. Stepping back first and looking at the full year, we expect to achieve strong top line growth as we leverage a growing global industry, as well as improve our global market share on the strength of our 24 product launches last year and the 15 we have planned for 2015. We also have more capacity coming online in Asia-Pacific in the second half that will drive incremental volume and revenue. We also expect improvements to the bottom line, specifically higher automotive operating margin and strong growth in automotive pre-tax profit driven by North America and Asia-Pacific with improved results in Europe and South America as well. We continue to expect most of the company improvement to occur in the second half.","Focusing now on the first quarter, we estimate that global industry SAAR shown on the lower left was 87.5 million units, that was up 1% from a year ago. And as already noted we grew our global market share to 7%. Wholesale volume was down slightly from a year ago due to the effects of major product launches, which contributed to lower dealer stock increases and constrained our share growth. Our revenue was down 6% due to the unfavorable exchange effects of the strong U.S. dollar on international operations, as well as a lower volume. We are very pleased that our operating margin improved, which at 3.6%, was up two-tenths of a percentage point and that our automotive pre-tax profit of $936 million was essentially unchanged from a year ago.","As shown on Slide 7, our unchanged automotive pre-tax profit was the result of higher net pricing, favorable exchange and favorable mix. Higher cost and lower volume were offsets. The strong net pricing mainly reflects new products in North and South America as well as partial recovery in South America of the adverse operating effects of the region\u2019s weaker currencies and high local inflation. The non-repeat of unfavorable balance sheet exchange effects last year, primarily in Venezuela and Argentina, explains most of the favorable exchange. The good news on mix came from North America, primarily Super Duty, and in Europe, primarily Transit and Mondeo. The higher costs are driven principally by three factors: first, the effects of new products launched since the first quarter a year ago; secondly, new plants in Asia-Pacific launched over the past year or to be launched later this year; and finally, investments for future new products and capacity to support our growth beyond 2015. North America was the major driver of the lower volume due to product launch effects. As shown below the chart, automotive pre-tax profit improved over fourth quarter 2014 because of lower cost and favorable exchange.","Slide 8 shows automotive pre-tax results by business unit, along with other automotive, which is mainly net interest expense. Previously, we have guided that we expected automotive net interest expense to be equal to or higher than last year\u2019s expense of $583 million. We now expect full year expense to be about $650 million, including the impact of the external debt of our Russia operation, Ford Sollers, which was fully consolidated as of March 31, along with incremental funding in Brazil. Before we move on to the business units, just a reminder here on Slide 9, we said back in January that we expect results in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half due to the timing of our product and capacity launches. And as shown here, this is still the case.","Now, what I would like to do is to take you through each of the automotive business units, starting with North America on Slide 10. We expect North America to have a very strong year in 2015 with substantial top line growth, higher pre-tax profit and an improved operating margin. This is based on continued robust industry sales, our strong product lineup, including products launched last year and planned for this year, our continued discipline in matching production with demand and a lean cost structure.","In the quarter, wholesale volume and revenue were down 5% and 2% from a year ago respectively. The lower wholesale volume reflects launch related declines of about 40% for F-150 and over 50% for Edge. All other vehicles were actually up 7%. The declines for F-150 and Edge resulted in lower U.S. market share, which was down six-tenths of a percentage point to 14.7%, as well as lower stock increases this year than in 2014. Higher industry sales reflecting the U.S. SAAR of 17.1 million units were a partial offset. Our lower revenue in North America was driven by the lower wholesale volume, as well as the adverse effects on our revenue in Canada and Mexico of the strong U.S. dollar. This was offset largely by higher net pricing and favorable mix. North America operating margin was 6.7%, down six-tenths of a percentage point from last year and pre-tax profit was $1.3 billion, which was down $160 million.","Let\u2019s now go to Slide 11 for a closer look at the factors behind the lower profit. As shown on this slide, lower volume for F-150 and Edge due to their launches explains North America\u2019s lower pre-tax profit in the first quarter. All other factors essentially offset one another. We expect results in North America to improve substantially over the balance of the year as we benefit from a full supply of F-150 and Edge, as well as other new products we have yet to launch including Explorer and Lincoln MKX. As shown below the chart, North America pre-tax profit declined compared with fourth quarter due to higher costs and lower volume. In terms of the full year guidance, we continue to expect North America to be strongly profitable this year at a level that will exceed last year\u2019s results. Today, we are increasing our operating margin guidance from 8% to 9% to 8.5% to 9.5%. This reflects our strong confidence in the F-150 and our positive view of the product\u2019s impact on our business now that the launch is successfully behind us. We also expect the recently launched Mustang, Transit and Edge to continue to perform strongly, and we are very excited about the upcoming launches of the Explorer and the MKX.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and talk about South America. The business environment in South America has deteriorated beyond our expectations with negative GDP growth, continued high inflation, further currency weakness across the region. The industry pricing environment is also difficult, particularly in Brazil with actions taken to-date generally lagging the combined adverse effects of the weaker currencies and high local inflation. Our strategy of replacing legacy products with ONE Ford products is bearing fruit. The new Ka is improving our market share in the region, which at 9.7% was up a strong 1.1 percentage points. In Brazil, EcoSport and Fusion continue to lead their segments. And as a result of the success of the F-series and Cargo, Ford led the light and semi-light truck segments in the first quarter. As we continue to sustain a strong product lineup, our team in South America also is focused on finding other revenue opportunities, reducing cost, continuing to match production to real demand and increasing local content to mitigate further the adverse effects of the weak local currencies.","In the first quarter, our wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 3% and 20% respectively. The lower volume resulted from 1.1 million unit decline in industry SAAR, reflecting the impact of Brazil\u2019s weaker economy and Argentina import restrictions. Our revenue decline resulted from the weaker currencies and unfavorable volume and mix. Operating margin was a negative 12.5% with significant improvement from a year ago, while pre-tax loss was $189 million that was an improvement of $321 million.","As we show on Slide 13, South America\u2019s profit improvement was due to favorable exchange, most of which reflects the non-repeat of last year\u2019s unfavorable balance sheet exchange effects of $310 million in Venezuela. Although volume was effectively unchanged, we are very proud that our team was able to offset the effective lower industry volume by growing our market share as shown on this chart in the colored box for volume and mix. As you can see below the chart, the first quarter loss was about the same as in fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, we continue to expect our pre-tax loss to improve from 2014, but the loss now will be greater than what we had expected due to the more difficult external environment.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 and we will talk about Europe where we are continuing to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. We confirmed earlier this month our commitment to the Russian market, where we agreed to certain changes with our partner, Sollers that will allow both parties to continue to support the Ford Sollers joint venture in the near-term, while providing a platform for future growth in this very important market. As a result of these changes, we consolidated our Russian operations as of March 31. This had no effect on first quarter earnings. In the quarter, our Europe 20 market share improved two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.2%. The success of our full line of transit vehicles and continued strong performance of our Ranger compact pickup contributed to a 2.8 percentage point improvement in our commercial vehicle share to 13.3%. In fact, Ford was the leading commercial brand in Europe 20 in the first quarter.","Our Europe wholesale volume improved 2% from the year ago, while revenue declined 11%. The higher volume resulted from 1.2 million unit increase in the Europe 20 SAAR, which was 15.7 million units as well as from Ford\u2019s higher market share. This was offset largely by the non-repeat of last year\u2019s dealer stock increase. The strong U.S. dollar explains our lower revenue. Europe\u2019s operating margin was a negative 2.7%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and the pre-tax loss was $185 million, which was unchanged. Although results were about the same as last year, you can see on Slide 15 that there was a lot of variability among the factors. Higher industry share and favorable mix were offset partially by the non-repeat of last year\u2019s stock increase.","The lower net pricing was driven in part by the aging of selected vehicle lines, but a portion also resulted from higher incentive activity in the UK and Switzerland. This was driven in part by a more competitive activity that was triggered by a stronger pound, sterling and Swiss franc versus the euro that made sales in these two markets more attractive. In total, costs were about flat including the impact of lower discount rates on pension expense. As shown below the chart, first quarter pre-tax results improved from fourth quarter 2014 due to favorable market factors, lower cost and favorable exchange. For the full year, we continue to expect Europe\u2019s pre-tax loss to improve from 2014, including the consolidation of Ford Sollers.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 and review Middle East and Africa, where we are focused on building our distribution capability, expanding our ONE Ford product offering tailored to the needs of the markets in the region and leveraging our global low-cost sourcing hubs. Our wholesale volume and revenue declined 8% from a year ago. The lower volume was the result of unfavorable changes in dealer stocks, while the lower revenue reflects the lower volume as well as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating margin was 7.5% that was 2.8 percentage points higher than a year ago and pre-tax profit was $79 million, an improvement of $25 million. This was driven by favorable exchange. For the full year, we now expect Middle East and Africa to deliver about breakeven results, which is an improvement from our prior guidance of a loss somewhat larger than 2014.","Alright, let\u2019s now go to Slide 17 and we will talk about Asia Pacific. We are continuing our strategy in this region to invest for growth in incremental capacity, new products and of course Lincoln in China. We expect Asia Pacific to have a strong year with the top and bottom line results improving substantially in the second half versus the first half due to added capacity and new products to be launched from the middle of the year, notably the three row Edge, the all-new Taurus, Figo, the all-new Everest, the refreshed Ranger and the all-new Lincoln MKX. As shown on the left, our first quarter wholesale volume was up 5% compared with a year ago, while our net revenue which excludes our China JVs declined 14%. Our China wholesale volume, which isn\u2019t shown, was up 10% in the quarter. This reflects in part strong market reception to the all-new Escort, as well as Lincoln, which is off to an encouraging start with several of our China dealers already among the brand\u2019s highest volume dealers globally.","Our higher volume in the region was driven by a favorable change in dealer stocks, including recovery of stocks to targeted levels. We estimate first quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, which is unchanged from a year ago although we did see signs of slowing growth in China during the quarter. Our first quarter market share for the region at 3.4% and our China market share at 4.5% were both equal to first quarter records set last year. The lower revenue was a result of the lower volume from our consolidated operations as well as weaker currencies. Operating margin was 4.5%, which was down 6.6 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax profit was $103 million, down $188 million. Our China joint ventures contributed $360 million to pre-tax profit this quarter, reflecting our equity share of their after-tax earnings.","On Slide 18, you can see that the decline in Asia-Pacific\u2019s first quarter pre-tax profit is explained primarily by higher structural cost. This reflects costs related to our plans to introduce 18 new vehicles this year and to bring online new capacity with four new plans. We will see the volume and revenue benefits of these investments in the second half. For the full year, we continue to expect Asia-Pacific pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014 with the improvements occurring in the second half consistent with the launch timing of new capacity and products.","Let\u2019s now discuss Ford Credit on Slide 19. Ford Credit is a strategic asset that provides world class financial services to our dealers and customers and is an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy that maintains a strong balance sheet that provides solid profits and distributions to Ford. In the first quarter, Ford Credit continues to demonstrate solid growth supporting Ford, including the launch of operations in India. Origination practices continue to be consistent and cost remained well-controlled and in line with expectations.","In the quarter, Ford Credit\u2019s pre-tax profit was largely unchanged from a year ago. Favorable volume and mix primarily reflects higher consumer finance receivables globally and an increase in leasing in North America. Lower portfolio pricing drove the lower financing margin and the higher credit losses primarily reflect the non-repeat of reserve releases that occurred in the first quarter last year. As shown below the chart, favorable lease residual performance due to higher auction values in North America contributed to the higher pre-tax profit compared with fourth quarter 2014.","For the full year, we continue to expect Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014 year end managed receivables to range from $123 billion to $128 billion and distributions to be about $250 million. We now expect managed leverage to be at the upper end of our range of 8 to 9 to 1 in the near term, because of the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar.","Next on Slide 20 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $19.5 billion. That was a decrease of $2.2 billion from the end of the fourth quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive $500 million driven by our automotive pre-tax profit. In the first quarter, we had higher than normal levels of non-operating related cash outflows associated with separation payments, the one-time payment from us is the interest in AAI, which is our former joint venture assembly plant in Michigan, debt repayments and pension contributions. For the balance of the year, AAI will not repeat and quarterly cash outflows related to separation and debt payments and pension contributions will be on average much lower. Debt repayments in the quarter totaled $600 million and we made pension contributions of $800 million to our funded pension plans. We continue to expect contributions to funded plans for the full year to total $1.1 billion. We also made dividend payments of $600 million during the quarter.","Slide 21 shows that our automotive debt was $13.4 billion at the end of the quarter, $400 million lower than fourth quarter. We had maturities in Europe and Asia-Pacific and continued to pay down U.S. Department of Energy loans. These reductions were offset partially by the consolidation of Ford Sollers external debt. We ended the quarter with net cash of $6.1 billion and automotive liquidity of $30.2 billion. Although not yet included in our total liquidity, we are in the process of amending and extending our corporate revolving credit facility. The facility, which is presently $12.2 billion, is expected to grow to $13.4 billion. The increase in the facility will be almost entirely allocated to Ford Credit to support its growth and liquidity plans.","And with that, this concludes our review of the financial details of our first quarter earnings. So, I would like to turn it back to Mark. He is going to take us to our outlook for the 2015 business environment, as well as our planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark?","Mark Fields","Okay, thanks a lot, Bob. So, let\u2019s start on Slide 22 with our view of the business environment and we do expect this year to be a year of growth globally with GDP expanding in about the 3% range. And this will be driven by the U.S., China, although at levels lower than in years past and improved growth in the euro area, in particular, with the UK continuing to perform at a higher level versus the rest of the continent. The main areas of concern continue to be in South America, which as Bob mentioned continues to face difficulties and also Russia. We also expect the strong U.S. dollar and the weak commodity prices, including oil to continue throughout the balance of the year. So, all-in-all, we see conditions as still being supportive of modest growth in the global auto industry in 2015.","So, let\u2019s turn to our total company guidance, which you can see on Slide 23. And as both Bob and I have said, we do expect this year to be a very strong one for Ford Motor Company. In terms of industry sales outlook, we are raising our guidance for Europe 20, while we are trimming it back a bit in China. And industry sales here in the U.S. still look to be on track to be between 17 million and 17.5 million units. All of our other financial guidance at the company level remains on track to what we said back in January. And we said we were going to see growth in automotive revenue compared with 2014, a higher automotive operating margin, higher positive operating cash flow, equal to higher results at Ford Credit, and a company pre-tax profit of between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion. So, we feel good about our first quarter results and believe that they have us on track for the breakthrough year that we expect 2015 to be.","And then, just to sum up on Slide 24, our plan and our priorities as a company remain unchanged and we remain on track to deliver our near and long-term objectives that we have laid out. And across Ford, we are accelerating the pace of our ONE Ford plan. We are delivering product excellence with passion and we are driving innovation into every part of our business. And all of this is supported by a day-in and day-out relentless execution on the operational fundamentals of our business. And I think nothing brings this to life better than the achievement by the Ford team in successfully launching the all-new F-150. And as we sit here today, the launches of our Dearborn and Kansas City plants are complete and we will reach full production during the balance of the second quarter. And earlier this month, the all-new F-150 SuperCrew, the SuperCab and the Regular Cab, all earned the U.S. government\u2019s highest possible crash safety rating. And I think that adds to the F-150 strengths as the toughest, smartest and most capable F-150 that we have ever produced. And on top of that achievement, outside experts also project that the F-150 residual values will be higher than not only our outgoing model, but also well above those of our highest volume competitors.","Looking at customer reception, well, I have to tell you the customer reception to the product has been simply outstanding. And it\u2019s now clear that the bottom line contribution to our business from F-150 will be even stronger than we had originally expected. So, I think successes like this give us confidence in our five long-term objectives, which include being in the top five in global sales, creating a better balance of profitability and sales around the world, achieving 8% plus operating margins, being in the top quartile in total shareholder returns, and importantly, remain highly regarded by all of our stakeholders.","So, we have the right strategic framework. I think we have the right proven operating process. And of course, I think we have the right team to deliver this, because Ford is a growth company in a global growing industry. And we are a proven innovator. In a period and a time here in the industry we are seeing rapid technological advancement than we have ever seen before. And we are operating the business for today, but also we are pushing ourselves to think and act and disrupt like a startup company anticipating customers\u2019 wants and needs 10 and 15 years down the road. And both are absolutely core to our plan for profitable growth.","So, with that, why don\u2019t we open up the phone line for your questions? So, George?","George Sharp","Thanks Mark. Now, we will open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. As usual, we will begin with questions from the investment community then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this framework please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Mark, can we have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning guys and thanks for the new press release format, it\u2019s actually incredibly helpful.","Mark Fields","Thanks, John.","John Murphy","First question, just on North America, if we think about what\u2019s going on in the first half, it\u2019s understandable that margins are a bit depressed and it\u2019s certainly understandable that the bounce backup in the second half of the year, but it looks like the second half would be somewhere in the ballpark of 11% plus or minus, is there anything that\u2019s happening in the second half of the year other than these two launches that abnormal that would inflate these margins, I am just trying to understand which part of the year is more representative of what we should be thinking about for margins going forward in North America?","Mark Fields","Well, I think as you think about is there anything abnormal, no. I think as we talked about in the first quarter you heard Bob\u2019s comments around the \u2013 their wholesale reductions that we have seen in F-Series and Edge. And as we get into the second half of the year, I think we are seeing great, really good acceptance to our new products, not only F-150, but Mustang, Transit. The Edge is still very early days, but it\u2019s off to a great start and we have the Explorer coming. So I think barring any kind of external shock, if you will to the economy, what you will see us is running at kind of regular production rates. And John, to put that into perspective on margin, as we mentioned it\u2019s very clear now that we are through the launch, mostly through the launch of the F-150 with a little bit of the acceleration, the final acceleration curve in the balance of the second quarter. It\u2019s clear we are seeing higher revenues. We are seeing likely a richer mix, lower cost. And I think that\u2019s than we originally expected as we launched last year. So we are growing the top line, which is allowing us to grow the bottom line. And if you look at the first quarter, if we ran at the kind of regular production rates, so if F-Series and Edge, we would have seen a margin of 10% or a bit above in the \u2013 in North America, so I think that\u2019s our expectation as going forward. And that\u2019s why we raised the overall guidance for the business unit.","Bob Shanks","And John what we also are seeing is the launch effects are largely in the first quarter, somewhat in the second quarter. There is not as much of an effect of launches in the second half of the year, which maybe is a little bit unusual. But that\u2019s what you are seeing occur this year. We actually have a similar effect that\u2019s taking place in the case of Asia Pacific where we have had a lot of costs in place right now to support the plants that we will be opening around mid-year, which will bring with them new product and new volume, new revenue, new capacity. So a very similar story in both markets in terms of the second half versus first half.","John Murphy","Okay. And then if I can just ask a second question around Europe, I am just curious as you look at the commitment to Russia, it\u2019s different than what you are seeing from one of your other big competitors out there. And I am just curious what you are seeing in Russia that you think is different, is it a function of the potential growth in the market, your relationship with Sollers, product cadence, I am just trying to understand what\u2019s different there. And also, as we think about that and in Europe in total, it looks like your second half should be better in Europe, much better than it does in the first half. And the first half looks like it\u2019s running pretty well as well, so I am just trying to understand the cadence in Europe as well?","Mark Fields","Well, John I will take the question on Russia and Bob may be you can take the question on general Europe. But essentially, what we see in Russia is it\u2019s a big and important market. Even at its reduced rate right now, it still is going to be one of the bigger markets in Europe. And we still hold the view that when the market stabilizes and ultimately recovers that this could be the \u2013 one of the biggest, if not the biggest market in Europe. And it\u2019s important for us to be there. At the same time, we have been making a lot of progress on our presence there, obviously the joint venture with Sollers and we have invested as you know over the last couple of years where by the time we get to the balance of this year we are going to have a full lineup of vehicles that are localized for Russian customers.","And although the market is difficult right now, everybody knows how difficult it is, I think we have done a good job in localizing our products. As we closed last year, we were probably about 40% localized and obviously, that's going to increase going forward. 99% of our sales in Russia are for vehicles that are actually produced in Russia. So when we look at the market environment, when we look at what we have done in terms of our product portfolio, in terms of localization. And to your point John, I think we have a very good working relationship with Ford Sollers, where we are both very dedicated to making sure that this business not only develops and succeeds. I think we are going to be very well positioned for future growth in Russia when we start seeing stabilization and ultimate growth. And that will have not only benefits for Russia, but also benefits for our European business. Bob, do you want to just talk about Europe?","Bob Shanks","Yes, in terms, I know what you might expect in Europe. Normally, John the second half is worse than the first half and that\u2019s largely around the flat that you have got the plant shutdowns in the third quarter for about a month and then you have got the usual seasonal effect on the costs in the fourth quarter. I think this year, it could be mitigated just a little bit because we do have a number of significant products that are in the process of being launched or we will launch in the balance of the year and that will include the S-MAX, the Galaxy, the C-MAX, the Grand C-MAX are coming onboard. We have also got, I think the Mustang comes later this year, small volume Edge I think launch towards the end of the year. So it might be a little bit different. But I think you are probably going to see probably a little bit of worst performance in the second half versus the first half and that\u2019s just normal seasonal results there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on Europe, can you help us quantify the impact of the Stollers consolidation when we think about it quarter-over-quarter on a pre-tax basis what kind of headwind will that be?","Bob Shanks","When you think about the Russian operations, the effects that we have been reporting all along up until I think the second \u2013 after the second quarter of last year when we wrote off the equity in Sollers, it isn\u2019t just the Ford-Sollers JV, but we ship components there, we ship parts there, we are incurring engineering expense on behalf of Ford-Sollers for which we were receiving royalties. So now that we are fully consolidating, of course all of that just becomes intercompany, if you will. So while there will be some impact, I don\u2019t think it probably is going to be quite as great as you might thing because there was a lot of effect that was already in our consolidated operations before we picked up the JV. So you will just be picking up sort of the end market JV results.","We do expect and I think we have talked about this already, Colin that we will have a greater drag on the business this year from total Russian operations than what we saw last year. But the good news is, I think with the change in terms of how we are going to work together, we are going to be able to move very quickly. Now, we have got a lot of new products that are coming. I think the last one is Fiesta, which is going to be a significant product for the marketplace. It\u2019s really encouraging that some aspects of what have been very variable factors, like the ruble, at least for the moment appear to have somewhat stabilized and actually are settling at a rate that\u2019s quite a bit better than what it was at the beginning of the year, which will help. So I think overall, we still feel like we are pretty much on track with what we had expected at the beginning of the year and already continuing in terms of our guidance for the European loss.","Colin Langan","And my second question, any color on South America in terms of how we should think about the cadence throughout rest of the year, any reason to think things are going to get worse or is this if you \u2013 is Q1 actually a more difficult start?","Mark Fields","Well, again it\u2019s a great question, Colin on what the crystal ball looks like. I think from our standpoint as you know we are changing the guidance based on the deterioration that we have seen in the external environment. And I think we are just going to stay focused on the things that we can control. And obviously, that\u2019s continuing to put fresh products into the marketplace. Bob mentioned some of the market share gains that we have had. We are also in that very important market. The team is energized around as you can imagine further reducing costs, looking at more localization, looking at optimizing our footprint, those types of things. So as we go through the balance of the year, we will deal with the external environment. But stepping back, we do expect South America, it\u2019s an important and attractive market as it has been in the previous decade. And we do expect it to be a positive contributor to our profits in the future, but the timing to the profitability to be quite honest is going to be based again on the stabilization of the market, but also ultimately some improvement in the external environment.","Colin Langan","Alright, thank you very much.","Mark Fields","Thanks, Colin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Please proceed.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, good morning everybody.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","Wanted to drill down a little bit on your net pricing in the North America on Slide 11, we saw some real encouraging sign on the gross pricing front with both pricing incentives netting $650 million or so, but a lot of it seems to be offset by your material, excluding commodity. So, was there anything specific in the material performance this quarter or would you expect essentially material to become essentially a large headwind as a result of the new product that\u2019s coming out?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Emmanuel. Yes, that\u2019s a really good question. I am looking at Slide 11 here in front of me. And for those of you that have the slides if you could refer to that, because I think if you look at that picture and you just imagine on the volume and mix, which is pretty flat here, you imagine that being very, very strong. I mean, that\u2019s what the year is going to look like. You are going to have a lot of strong positive growth on the top line mix as well. You are going to have very strong net pricing around the new product, but you are going to have higher cost, both contribution cost and structural cost and that\u2019s what we talked about at the beginning of the year. That\u2019s exactly the picture that we painted for North America, but that\u2019s going to yield the very strong margins that Mark referred to in the balance of the year, which is going to give us that 8.5% to 9.5%. So, given a 6%, 7% in the quarter, that\u2019s sort of \u2013 you can back into what that means for the balance of the year. We are going to have very strong margins, but that\u2019s the picture of what the business will look like.","Emmanuel Rosner","And just to clarify this, so right now, the pricing in material sort of like offset each other. So, I understand obviously, the pricing will become a larger benefit as your volumes ramp up. Would it still be \u2013 would you still expect it to be offset by increasing materials or are saying that materials increases is the magnitude that we are seeing this quarter, but pricing is upside?","Bob Shanks","Well, I think you will see stronger pricing, but I think what you have to look at is the pricing and the volume together as well as the mix. It\u2019s not just one or the other, it\u2019s those two, the first two bars there, which is volume, mix and pricing, you have to think about them all together, because the product is going to drive volume, the product is going to drive better mix. And then of course we are also going to get the pricing. So, all of those things together are going to drive the top line. And then the partial offset to that is going to be both the investments that we are making in the business on the structural or the fixed side and then of course the contribution cost, which is driven by the product cost that we are putting in.","Emmanuel Rosner","Okay, that\u2019s very clear. One last one on China, you are mentioning slowing gross that you saw during the quarter, was that a comment about the industry or about Ford specifically? And then coming with the slowing growth, are you seeing some pricing pressure as well?","Mark Fields","Well, when you look at, you step back and you look at our performance in the first quarter, the industry was up about 3% and we were up a little over 9%, so almost triple that, but as you step back and look at the economy and we were just there obviously last week for the Shanghai Motor Show and spent the balance of the week there, we expect the economy, as we mentioned earlier, to be growing in about the 7% range. But you are seeing it obviously down from previous years, because you are seeing less demand for exports, but you are also seeing the shift from economy that has relied on growth through industry and investment to one that\u2019s shifting towards more service oriented and consumer led economy. So, I think that\u2019s having some ramifications in there. And as you can expect, you are seeing a different play out in different regions around the country. For example, in Chongqing, where our headquarters is, I think the GDP growth there was about 10% last quarter and obviously less than other regions. We are seeing the industry as you saw from our guidance. We kept it down a bit. So, we expect some modest growth, but we are seeing signs of some slower growth. And you are seeing it in B and C segments, some of the smaller segments, as it gets more competitive there. And then also, we are seeing a bit of shift as customers look at small SUVs.","The pricing, to your point, actually, pricing has \u2013 net pricing has been negative for a number of years in the marketplace. We have baked that into our plan. And our pricing has been less negative because of the products that we have been introducing. So, our first quarter performance is encouraging for us as we stand back. I mentioned our share was even with the year ago, which was a record. It was actually up a bit from the fourth quarter as we have introduced products like the Escort. We have seen in general the Western OEMs in the first quarter as a group their share drop. We have held our share. Our new Escort is doing well. We have moved up in the passenger car rankings from number eight to number five in the quarter. And even, not forgetting our JMC business, which is our commercial business that they have had their best share ever and it was up significantly from last year.","So, regardless of the industry situation we are seeing, I think we are well positioned in terms of whatever the market throws at us, because new products like the Edge and Everest, which are in the SUV category, which is an important growing category. Even in the C segment, which as I mentioned, is getting more competitive, the best kind of elixir for that is having fresh product. And we have introduced our Escort. Our new Focus is coming around mid-year. And of course, other products, like our Focus SD and the products that are launching now and going into new segments, like the Taurus, which will be coming in later this year, which is an important segment there. So overall, stepping back, it is slowing. We are seeing more pricing pressure in some segments. But I think we have a lot of confidence in our future there, because I think we have a strong product portfolio. We are expanding our manufacturing presence. Obviously, we are growing our jobs in the country due to our growth. We are marrying that to expanding our distribution network and we are growing our market share.","And we also have a very good working relationship with our partner. So as we step back and we look at the year, we do expect a strong year. Second quarter, as Bob mentioned earlier, we have launched a number of our plants, like in India in our Hangzhou plant, we have \u2013 we really won\u2019t significantly start producing product out of that until the second half. So, you may see a business in Asia-Pacific that\u2019s about breakeven for the second quarter, but I think we are well-positioned for the balance of the year, but we will watch the market closely and we will follow our process, which if we see the market slowing down, we will match production to demand and take appropriate actions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up, first of all, on the Asia-Pacific question. You had obviously some cost headwinds in China and India as you have had in the earnings growth with China equity earnings up like 2% on volume, that\u2019s up 10%. Could you just give us a sense of the magnitude of the headwinds that go away in China and India as you look out for the back half? And a question on pricing trajectory there, there has obviously been some mix commentary from some of the Germans. What\u2019s the \u2013 at a high level maybe an industry level, what do you see as the trajectory of price deflation there compared to prior years?","Bob Shanks","Well, I will take a shot. And if Mark wants to supplement, he can. I want to go back and use the same approach I did on North America, because it\u2019s simple and I think it portrays what we are seeing. If you look at Slide 18 which is the Asia-Pacific slide, what is really unusual when you look at this slide versus what we have seen in prior quarters is you normally would see a really big positive bar on volume and mix. And you can see it\u2019s actually flat. So, we have seen negative net pricing as Mark said for quite a period of time. As particularly China matures, there is increasing productivity, competition intensifies, prices have been declining.","And as you said, we have modeled that into our future plans. And so it\u2019s consistent with what you are seeing here in the quarter. We have been putting cost in the business and that\u2019s to support our growing business, not only for current quarter, current year, but forward years as well. And in this particular quarter, you are seeing a little bit of bad news on exchange, but really not material. So really, what\u2019s missing Rod is the volume and mix, because we essentially were sort of flat for the quarter. And what we do think is going to change materially in the second half of the year with the new capacity coming on stream and the new products we would expect to see a very strong contribution in the volume and mix category. I think pricing will be helped by the new products, but I think some of the effects of the slowing industry that Mark talked about, plus the natural negative trend of pricing, particularly in China, probably is still going to be a play. And you will continue to see cost coming in the business as we move through the year. Although, I think it will start to mitigate when we get into the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis.","Mark Fields","And I would just add, Rod as you look at the industry, I think some of the pricing pressure will be maybe more concentrated as I have mentioned in some of the small cars, B and C cars, because we are seeing a bit of the same phenomenon in China as we are in other parts of the world, this migration from passenger vehicles to small and medium-sized SUVs. So I think you will see it may be more pronounced in those segments. But again, as Bob mentioned the best thing to do is, make sure you have fresh product in that environment which we will and we will deal with that. And also stepping back, as you know the Chinese government is very conscious of the economic performance of the country. And I think they will be looking at that and hopefully implement measures that if they see a significant slowing, they will maybe take some actions. But nonetheless, I think that\u2019s kind of the area you might see some of the more pricing pressure.","Rod Lache","And just to clarify, Bob are you suggesting that basically, the cost inflation is going to be similar going forward, but you are going to see the volume benefit associated with that, is that essentially what you are saying?","Bob Shanks","Yes.","Rod Lache","Okay. And then in Europe also a question on pricing, were you expecting pricing to be kind of in this ballpark, do you think that moderates as the market begins to improve and can you just refresh us kind of the bridge to breakeven from here?","Bob Shanks","I am sorry, you are referring to?","Rod Lache","The European\u2026","Bob Shanks","The European, yes. Well, let me talk about Asia Pacific first. I just want to underscore something that Mark said earlier, which is we do expect that we could see something around the breakeven in Asia Pacific in the second quarter. And that\u2019s really because, as we look and get closer to the launches of those plants and the products, their launch costs will start to become even more material than what they have been. So that will probably be the story around the second quarter. But when you get into the third and fourth quarter, you are exactly right. We are going to see our expectations are that you are going to see very strong top line growth that you are not seeing in this particular quarter because of the factors that we just mentioned.","When you get to Europe, Europe is a challenging market. We have made a lot of progress with our transformation plan. I think the share improvement is very, very encouraging. And we are doing that with healthy share. We actually are under indexing in the short cycle segments rental and the demo sales. We are getting this the hard way. We are getting \u2013 with retail we are getting especially with commercial vehicles. I mentioned the number 2.8 points up, number one brand in Europe and not that long ago, we were what, number seven or something. I mean the improvement has been dramatic and the profitability of those segments is helpful as well.","But we do have the impact of Russia. We talked about that being a material impact in terms of an absolute loss. We certainly are working very hard to improve that as we go forward. In the case of overall Europe, we are going to have to do more. While we are seeing the improvement in share in the particular quarter, we are talking about we have that impact on the stocks. I don\u2019t want to pass that by because that was a little unusual. We usually will grow stocks in the quarter because we are preparing for the spring selling season and then you have got the plants shutdown in the third quarter. We did not do that this quarter because we ended last year a little bit heavy on stocks. We have got ourselves in a really good position in terms of days supply we are at targeted levels as of the end of the quarter. But we did that by not building stocks if you will, in the quarter. So I want to make sure that you kind of pay attention to that when you look at that callout box on the variance slide for Europe because that was about $144 million.","So that was a bit unusual. But as we go forward, we are going to have to continue to work the top line. We are going to have to continue to drive for greater share. We are going to have to work on the pricing. One thing I do want to underscore again in the quarter, that negative pricing you have to kind of look at the exchange good news because it was somewhat related in part because of the what went on in Switzerland and the UK and the strength of those currencies relative to the euro. But it\u2019s really around cost, we are going to have to take more costs out of the business and work on Russia in order for the business to continue to march towards profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnson","Yes. Good morning.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","Brian Johnson","I want to return to North America, but talk more about the dynamics in the car market and how those might have progressed over the year and actually since you gave the Investor Day update, kind of specifically, you eliminated a shift for small or mid car where \u2013 for small car, where are small and mid-cars shaping up both in terms of volume and in terms of pricing environment and maybe as well as fleet dynamics versus what you thought and within your 50 basis point margin increase, are you actually contemplating a headwind from cars versus what you might have thought in the fall offset perhaps by the F-150?","Mark Fields","Well, I think if you step back and you look at the car market, the highest level when you look at the industry, Brian you can see that the industry has \u2013 on a percentage basis has increased on trucks and decreased on passenger vehicles. And we have seen that pronounced obviously, in the C-car segment. And the C-car segment last year this quarter was about 20% of the industry. It\u2019s now about 18.5%. So it\u2019s down. Our share of Focus is about flat within that. But because of that reduction, that\u2019s why we took the shift off. And so on the car side as \u2013 and we talked about in this back in January. We saw that shift and we expected and we factored into our plan a more aggressive, if you will environment on that, particularly given our competitors in terms of some of the products that they ship into the country here. And I think we will see it continue to be competitive going forward. The good news for us is as we see that shift into trucks and utilities, that\u2019s the benefit for us because of our profitability on those vehicles.","Brian Johnson","Okay. And I guess somewhat related, you mentioned kind of the Asians in the content, we had an announcement from Toyota prior - over the last \u2013 prior to New York auto show that they would be rolling out ADAS at about a $300 mass market price point, $500 mid and large car price point. How does that kind of affect your thinking, vis-\u00e0-vis, A, kind of when you might bring ADAS into the U.S. aggressively versus just Europe where it\u2019s now rewarded by NCAP and kind of be how that factors into your option mix and pricing on the option mix?","Mark Fields","Well, stepping back as you know, we have been a leader in a lot of the technologies in the semi-autonomous technologies as well as the safety technologies, which are really propagated throughout our vehicle lineup depending upon the vehicle. And so I think we have been a leader in that regard. Clearly, we have seen some announcements from some of our competitors, namely you did mention Toyota in terms of price points. Obviously, as you know, we always look at our vehicle lines. We also do a lot of analysis on our competitiveness. So we will factor that in into our plans going forward. But stepping back, we have had a big commitment to technology and smart technology and delivering it in a way that provides value for customers, but also makes it available to millions of folks. So you will continue to see us do on that going forward.","Brian Johnson","And do you think the pace of that\u2019s increasing versus maybe where you would have been late last summer, early fall?","Mark Fields","Well, the pace has gone very fast, but I think we factored that in. When you look at our, for example, the type of technology, ADAS or otherwise that we have even on our vehicles like our Focus, I mean we have been anticipating that. But clearly, customers are saying that\u2019s very important to them. And I think that was just reiterated in our recent survey last week I read \u2013 I can\u2019t remember who did it. That said the most \u2013 technology, the most important to customers are around safety and around collision avoidance and things of that nature. And we have factored that in and have been implementing that.","Brian Johnson","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli","Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Mark Fields","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli","Just two big picture question maybe starting off with Europe, I think you alluded to it a little bit before, but as we think about an eventual path to the breakeven in profitability, any updated thoughts about what you would view in terms of market conditions mainly a breakeven point in terms of volume to kind of help us model that out a little bit better over the next couple of years?","Mark Fields","Well, not really, I mean, I think one of the things that\u2019s going to be important in terms of getting to breakeven and ultimately profitability in Europe is the \u2013 not only the industry size, which clearly the larger the better. We have seen some growth, but obviously, we would like to see more, but it\u2019s the pricing environment as well. That\u2019s so important. As Bob mentioned, when you look at the pricing environment in Europe, we have had a specific strategy to improve our channel mix, which I think we have made a lot of coverage. And as Bob mentioned, we actually over-index versus the competitors on retails and fleet business versus the daily rental and self registrations, but it\u2019s still a market where in any given day, the industry discounts 20% or more across their vehicle lineup. And I think from our standpoint, our strategy is, as we mentioned earlier, is bringing out compelling product, working that channel mix so that we get the growth, but that it\u2019s profitable growth. And what we saw even in the last month or two, as Bob mentioned in the UK, we have seen some of our competitors really take advantage of the strong pound in the case of Switzerland, the strong franc, and get very competitive. And we are not going to do that. We are going to manage for margin and for profit.","Itay Michaeli","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe in a similar tone around the consolidated Asia operations, it looks like you are probably running a couple $100 million loss there. That of course should improve second half of the year with the volume ramp in India. And of course, you have the exit of Australia in the next couple of years. Anything else you can do to kind of improve results there? And maybe a timeline to get that region back to profitability kind of what has to happen there?","Bob Shanks","Yes, I think on that one if you look at the quarter and the change year-over-year, the thing that\u2019s interesting, we forget when we show the JV profitability, there is a bigger China profitability. So, I will tell you the joint ventures. And we have talked about this on our Investor Day or rather Ford University day, we have got the Lincoln business, which is fully consolidated. We are incurring engineering inside Ford that is only paid for years later through royalty rates once the products are in production. We have got central staff costs, if you will, for our operations and so forth. And of course, if I didn\u2019t mention it because I am forgetting, it could be a Lincoln of the investments for Lincoln. So, when you look at all of those costs outside of the joint ventures inside China, those are actually the biggest factor in terms of the change year-over-year and profitability outside the joint ventures. Those costs are actually up and a lot of that is driven by the investments for Lincoln, but also for the imported Ford vehicles that go into the market. Many of those are in balance out as we think are ready for transition to new products. And so there is an effect on that.","So, that\u2019s actually, Itay, having the biggest effect year-over-year outside the JVs. Australia is down a little bit, but that\u2019s mostly related to the Australian dollar. Going ahead, we have had a really long-term view around India and around ASEAN, particularly Thailand. We are investing in these operations to expand our position domestically, but we are also positioning these vehicles or these markets to be global export hubs. So, I would expect once these operations and this is I am talking now publicly 2 or 3 years down the road, particularly if you bring in Thailand, it\u2019s going to be several years before we get these things to the point where they are really humming both in terms of domestic contribution, but also the export contribution as well. We have got \u2013 so I would look at that as more medium term. I agree with you on Australia. Once we get past the closure of the plant in October of 2016, we should see a significant turnaround there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Mark Fields","Hello.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi, thanks for taking my question. What\u2019s your latest thinking relative to commodities for the full year? I think it was called out on Slide 7 as a $39 million positive. I think it\u2019s pretty small in the context of your business. Should we expect it to turn more material as the year progresses?","Bob Shanks","Yes, we think it will improve as the year progresses and probably have a bigger impact in second half than in the first half.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, great. And then just my second question on the North America profit bridge, can you help us think about the higher cost in the quarter contribution and structural? How much of them are temporary versus permanent? So, for example, relative for material ex-commodity, I think that\u2019s more permanent right, the higher content and the cars, but then in the structural bucket that some of the manufacturing engineering headwinds relate more to launch costs that then subside? And advertising too was that primarily F-150 and then we can expect it to settle some?","Bob Shanks","Well, I think you will continue to see increases in our structural cost, because while these launch costs will go away or these advertising or sales promotion costs will go away for these particular products, we will have new ones coming along as well. But it is true in the quarter we do have some substantial launch cost and we are starting to see advertising sales promotion expense pickup for the new products as well, but I think it\u2019s probably unfair to say that, that\u2019s one-time cost.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Spak","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to tie together some of the things you talked about as we think further out in North America. So, clearly, price mix is going to be strong here. You talked about some of the costs, either temporary or otherwise, this year. And then you also mentioned you are considering that you are going to have to add content going forward to remain competitive at what seems like could be increasingly difficult to price for? So, I guess I am just wondering if we think about your longer term target, it seems like there does have to be another built-in cost offset? And how do we think about that? I mean, are you targeting a certain amount of basis points over a year in terms of just general or other material savings? I mean, how do we get comfort that add someone more pressures enter the system the margins are sustainable?","Bob Shanks","Well, we do have specific targets around North America to make an operating margin of 9 to \u2013 8 \u2013 I am sorry, I forgot, 8% to 10%.","Mark Fields","8% to 10%.","Bob Shanks","I prefer the higher number.","Mark Fields","I know.","Bob Shanks","8% to 10%. And I think this year we are looking very good in terms of that range. As we go forward, I think the biggest concern we have is around regulatory costs are coming at us, because consumers have shown that they are not willing to pay for that. So, we are going to have to really put a lot of focus on the cost side of the business. We do generate good cost reductions and working with our supply base. We are going to have to generate, I think incremental efficiencies, both looking at structural cost. And there is a lot of opportunities I think in that area for us going forward. But the other thing that I would expect to have, because I have seen over the course of my career is you will see a lot of these new technologies, you will see efficiencies going down the technology curve. As volume increases, it becomes more \u2013 the volumes increase across the industry and we just \u2013 the industry finds ways to produce these types of technologies to lower cost. If you go back to the 80s and think about how expensive ABS was and when we are looking at times when competitors were starting to spread them our standard across vehicles and we are having our hard text to help out, because how expensive they were, we don\u2019t even think about that today, because the costs are so low, that\u2019s occurred over time. So, I think that will be another factor, Joe, that will come to play across the whole industry, not just for us.","Mark Fields","And Joe, one more factor is, as we work on the cost side, we shouldn\u2019t forget obviously the revenue side, that\u2019s just having compelling product. I mean, when you look at vehicles like our Mustang vehicles, like the Transit, what we are reporting out on F-150. When you can have a compelling product either from a functional or a design standpoint, you can get good revenue for that. So, we have to work both. We have to work the top line and we have to work the cost to make sure that we have a business that is earning more than appropriate return for us.","Joe Spak","Okay. And then you mentioned the strong residual values on the F-150, which we noticed as well. Is there any stat you can give us on maybe \u2013 I know it\u2019s early, but maybe sort of leasing mix or penetration on the new truck versus what it\u2019s been historically? And then I guess, while we are on the topic of residuals, any \u2013 are you starting to mark residual values on leases broadly a little bit lower as maybe like things like used volumes start to pickup over the coming years?","Mark Fields","No, just in the first part of your question, it\u2019s really too early to tell, too early days on the question you are asking around leasing and percentages and by region etcetera, but we will provide more color on that as we get more into the launch.","Bob Shanks","Yes, the only thing I would add on that is that F-150 tends not to be a heavy leased vehicle. So, that\u2019s really not such a factor in terms of the sales of F-150. But we are seeing good auction values. That was actually one of the favorable things that we talked about in our results today. So, I think the team has done a really, really good job of managing our leasing portfolio. We are very careful and cautious in terms of the concentration of lease, both geographically by vehicle line, by series. So we have learned a lot of lessons over the last number of years and we have got a lot of data analytics behind our leasing strategies to make sure that we don\u2019t go too deep in any particular part of the business to put those values at risk.","Operator","At this time we will be taking question from the media. [Operator Instructions] Your first question from the media comes from John Stoll from Wall Street Journal. Please proceed. John Stoll from Wall Street Journal, please proceed.","John Stoll","Hey guys, sorry about that. The press release was good. A quick question on costs and I know that there has been a lot of emphasis on this already, but just that kind of demo down a bit more. So when you look at the cost increase in North America ex-material in the first quarter, I am just trying to understand that very simply, the run rate versus what you can price for and then Bob you had mentioned regulatory costs, how much of this cannot be absorbed in pricing and is just, you guys have to eat it and how much of this can be and will be absorbed by the consumer in this environment and how long will the consumer be willing to basically pay more and at what point do you see a bit more pressure on pricing in the future?","Bob Shanks","Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as what you are portraying it. And I do understand what you are talking about. I don\u2019t think you can separate the investments you make and delivering and providing customers really strong product, which is what Mark talked about, in terms of what that gives you with volume, what it gives you in terms of mix, as well as the opportunity to price for it. You really have to look at the all those factors together, John. And I know you know that, but you have to look at them altogether and understanding are you getting the appropriate sort of total revenue for that particular investment against those costs that you have put in as well. And I think, as you will see going forward in the year, in North America you are going to see a cost increase, it\u2019s what we have talked about. And we do expect that going forward in the subsequent quarters, but you are going to see very, very strong top line growth both in terms of what\u2019s driven by volume, what\u2019s coming from mix and also what\u2019s coming from of that pricing. So you really got to look at all of them together to understand whether or not you have got a good equation. And with the margins that we are talking about, it\u2019s very, very clear that the North American business, the balance of all of those things together is actually giving us a very, very strong business.","John Stoll","And how much of the pricing power that you have right now is related to the cadence that you guys have been on, I mean just the investments in product over product and the changeover, how much of this is just organic and kind of secular environment where nobody else is really, I mean not many of your competitors are being extremely reckless on incentives right now the atmosphere is actually pretty tight, so how much of this is industry and how much of this is Ford specific. And again, what is the sustainably of that \u2013 of those trends?","Bob Shanks","Yes. It\u2019s actually a combination of both. This is not all strictly equipment related pricing. You are also seeing what we would call pure pricing that\u2019s occurring. And of course we are very observant and careful about where we are standing competitively. We have seen continued discipline as you said in the overall industry. We are seeing price increases coming from a number of our other competitors. So the overall environment, I think is a very healthy one. I think in general, competitors are doing a reasonably good job of matching their production to demand and that certainly is providing an overall lift, I think, for the entire industry.","Mark Fields","And then to your point \u2013 John, to your point about what is our plan going forward I mean our plan going forward as you know is to keep our product pipeline full. And as Bob mentioned, a good portion of the pricing is based on the new product also that we have out there. And by any third party external studies that\u2019s done on the industry, you can see that we plan on keeping that product pipeline absolutely full and that will be a big element in allowing us to price appropriately going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin from Associated Press.","Dee-Ann Durbin","Hi, thanks for taking the call. GM said last week the strong dollar cost it about almost $2 billion in revenue in the first quarter they weren\u2019t the only ones talking about it, Facebook has been talking about it, Pepsi, does Ford have any sort of similar calculation on the impact of the dollar in the quarter?","Bob Shanks","Yes. Dee-Ann that\u2019s a good question, we had a decline in our revenue of $2 billion in the quarter, 70% of that was directly related to exchange. I think the thing that\u2019s very interesting though is while that did impact the top line, because it\u2019s simply translation of the strong dollar against the overseas operations revenue. When you look at the bottom line, we are actually seeing good news on exchange in the company. And a lot of that is around is non-repeat of the balance sheet effects that we saw last year in South America, but even as you strip that out, the effect of exchange on the bottom line in terms of profitability is pretty muted. ","Dee-Ann Durbin","Great, thank you.","Operator","I would now like to hand you over to George Sharp for closing remarks.","George Sharp","Okay, thanks, everyone.

My name is Dorothy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ted Cannis, Director of Investor Relations with Ford Motor Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks very much, Dorothy. Good morning and welcome everybody to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2017 earnings review. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are John Lawler, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President, Corporate Treasurer and CFO of Ford Smart Mobility; and Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.","The results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix. Today's discussion also includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. As you know, actual results may vary. As a reminder, copies of the Ford and Ford Credit's second quarter earnings presentations and press releases are available on Ford's investor and media websites.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Ted, and thank you for joining our call today. You know, success for me today is to start my first call as CEO of Ford Motor Company to assert two important points as a baseline. The first; Ford is a fantastic company with not only an incredible history, but I think a very bright future. And you know, I've had time leading another business in another industry, and during that time, I often traveled to Silicon Valley. It was so frequent that I did learn and understand the culture there. In fact, it's steeped into my thinking, optimism, innovation and questioning the status quo.","Out there, being a young company is cool. And in this realm, a company that is 114 days old is a hot item. But what I also learned from all these experiences is that a company that has lasted 114 years is rare, and it doesn't get there by luck, decree, or sticking with the status quo, rather in the face of the facts that fewer than one in five startups succeed, a company that has persisted 114 years, well it had to remake itself many times.","When war engulfed the world or when gasoline was 100 times more expensive than when the industry started or when a pickup truck was reimagined to yield one of the largest collective gasoline savings in the car inventory park today. In this way, Ford Motor Company is a jewel in the eyes of those who study long-lived businesses. In the eyes of our customers, who've seen us evolve, trust us and they love the Ford brand.","The second point starts with the humble underpinning that Ford can be a much better company. We have an opportunity to be extraordinary in the way we relate to and deliver value to our customers. And in this way, we can deliver much more value of course to our shareholders.","And I'd like to briefly update you on how we're approaching the work in the first 100 days. In some of the earliest thinking, as we develop our compelling strategy and plan, and you'll hear a reference that we're going to be coming back to you in the fall with more details on that strategy and plan.","Now with the slides, you'll see graphics here that support my comments, and I'm sure you're familiar with the fortify, transform, and grow strategic framework that was articulated over the past 12 months or so, and that's on the right side of the slide.","What we're doing as a team in my first 100 days is unpacking that on the right with fresh eyes, and we focused on a few early priorities. Let me identify those for you. Initially, we evaluated how to maximize revenue opportunities. As you hear, there is a leveling in the business. So by utilizing data modeling, we identified sweet spots between volume, mix, and price to help deliver higher transaction prices in an increasingly competitive market.","We're also evaluating and improving the fitness of the company. Now I've been talking about this concept of fitness, and of course, it includes cost, but it really involves taking a much deeper system or holistic view of all parts of the business to ensure that we're really as fit as we need to be to compete and win, and win, I want to emphasize that. We're also evaluating capital deployment opportunities, something I've heard from many of you, and we know, we're going to be quicker and more purposeful with our decisions on where to play, and how to win and that will affect the capital decisions.","We're also renewing our focus on innovation. This is something that I humbly bring in this job. This is something I care a great deal about. One of the things that I did subtly was I elevated the Chief Technology Officer position reporting to me. This was to reassert our leadership in critical technologies. And we're building a more robust mobility business under Marcy Klevorn, who also has responsibility for as Chief Information Officer, the computing in our business and we have a unique opportunity to merge the mobility and computing for future digital services.","We're transforming the culture and we're creating an environment to win. This is going to be hard to describe without you following me around every day. But it starts with the renewed recognition that we're in an incredibly competitive industry. And the competition just doesn't relax because we're thinking through a problem, opportunity or because we had a management change, it's relentless.","We have a talented team here at Ford and we believe we can be really competitive, a team that we're working on empowering and re-energizing to grow our business. So, that work in those five points is well underway in that 100 days, and I look forward to sharing more, as I said with you later this year about detailed plans to make Ford even stronger and more innovative, not only built to weather the business cycles, but to win in future growth areas.","Okay. Well, turning to the second quarter. I do believe we delivered a solid performance. I'm really proud of our team with all the change we went through, they did it. But it needs to be said no one here is satisfied. We know and I want to emphasize this, we all know we have a lot of work to do. And our entire team is focused on these areas of growing revenue, improving fitness, optimizing the capital deployment and innovation in all parts of the business, and having the spirit of an environment to win. In order to improve the top and bottom lines, we're going to be focusing on these things in the quarters ahead.","On the next slide, I'll share a few highlights from the quarter, if you happened just to be gone during the last quarter and you didn't know what was going on at Ford. Some exciting things here are F-Series, including the Super Duty continue to perform extremely well, and we look forward to the refreshed F-150 going on sale this fall. This is our product that is so successful. We're going to be building on momentum here.","The quarter, we also had sales success in China in a number of areas, including the best ever June sales for Ford Motor Company and the best ever June and quarterly sales for the Lincoln brand. This quarter in Europe, well, we launched the All-New Fiesta, this is an important model for us in the region, a very popular vehicle. All the early reviews have been great.","We're also making important strides in quality. We improved significantly to become, listen to this, the number 2 ranked non-premium brand in this year's J.D. Power Initial Quality Study. It's our best result in the 31-year history of the company. I was really proud to hear about that, receive that as I walked into my job and credit is due to all the hardworking folks at Ford for that accomplishment.","This quarter, we also made a decision. It was in the news that we would source the next-gen Ford Focus for the North American market from China initially. This decision meets the preservation of capital and it's going to deliver significant savings.","At the same time, we were proud to announce further investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant. This is going to build the new Expedition and Lincoln Navigator later this year, both very important new entries for us in large SUV segment, would urge all of you to take a ride in those. I think you're going to be really surprised.","But now, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Shanks. He is going to take you through the second quarter financials and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions today. Thank you again.","Bob?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're going to start on slide 6 and I'll just cover very briefly other headlines and then we're going to start diving through the results for the balance of the presentation. So as you can see here, the company did grow in the quarter. Our adjusted pre-tax profit combined with a low effective tax rate generated an adjusted earnings per share that was $0.56, that was up 8% from a year ago. We did generate another quarter of Automotive operating cash flow on the positive side, and we did generate a margin of 5.9% on the Automotive business.","Let's turn now to slide 7 and look at the key financial summary and I just want to highlight several things here, to bring out a bit more texture in terms of what happened. So, starting and focusing only on the second quarter at the top in terms of wholesales, we generated 1.7 million units in the quarter. That was down 43,000 units. 55,000 of that was Europe and within that, almost all of that was the Fiesta and we'll talk about the impact of that when we get to the European section.","The revenue increase was four-tenths, only one-tenth of that was on the Automotive side of the business, the balance was in Financial Services. Going down further to special items pre-tax, $248 million charge. That was related to write-offs that we took associated with the decision to deploy capital away from small cars and specifically the next-generation Focus in both North and South America and as you know, we have announced that we're going to put the next-generation Focus for North America primarily in China with some derivatives also to come later from Europe.","Further down from there, you can see the provision from income taxes, $209 million. You can see that's nearly $700 million better than the prior year. Within that, there is $421 million of good news that comes from distributions that we've taken from overseas that bring with them foreign tax credits that we've realized on the balance sheet.","And what I'll say right now is that for the full year, we expect to have additional actions that we'll be taking in the same space, different types of actions, in the different parts of the business, but with the same effect that will generate a tax rate for the full year of about 15%. This result was a 10.2% effective tax rate in the quarter.","Because of that, and then combined with the company pre-tax result of $2.5 billion, which was down about 16%, we were still able to generate an improvement on net, you can see at $2 billion that was up $72 million from a year ago. Adjusted EPS, I touched on, and then further down the page you see liquidity, which is continuing to be strong, and we'll talk more about that later.","Okay, let's go to the next slide, slide 8, and here what I'd like to do is, just briefly talk about where the profits were earned. So, on the far left, you can see the total company adjusted pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion. $2.2 billion of that was generated by the Automotive segment. We had very strong results in Financial Services, $600 million, and then in All Other that's primarily our treasury-related activities, think of that as net interest expense and portfolio gains and losses, and then there is a very small piece of that that's related to the Ford Smart Mobility LLC.","When you look below the chart, you can see that the decline in the Automotive segment drove the decline in the overall business. We had a very nice improvement in the Financial Services, and a small decline in All Other that was largely around the treasury-related activities.","Let's move on to slide 9, and here what we're going to do is start looking at the Automotive segment only. So, on the far left is the $2.2 billion of profit that we generated in that segment, and then you can see right beside that the North American result. So, effectively every dollar that we earned in the Automotive segment was earned in North America.","When you look to the right of that, you can see the ups and downs of the other regions. They all net to breakeven. But I would highlight within that we did generate our ninth consecutive quarterly profit in Europe and we had a good result in Asia Pacific. If you look below the chart, declines in North America and Europe on a year-over-year basis is what drove the decline in the segment. All the other regions improved.","Now, let's move further into the Automotive segment and focus on our key metrics and we'll just go right across the page. You can see the top line and the first two metrics there, the wholesales I've touched on, down 3%, the revenue, basically flat as I mentioned. SAAR is not shown on the page, but the SAAR for the global industry is estimated at about 93.2 million units, that was up 4% and that was driven by increases in the industries of Asia Pacific, Europe and South America.","Market share, 7.4%, was down a tenth and that was driven by declines in North America, Europe and Middle East and Africa with the other regions going in the positive direction. And then, you can see the margin was down and the pre-tax results was down as well.","Let's go to the next slide and let's look at what was behind the decline in profitability, $641 million. Basically, it was three factors; it was higher commodity cost and we talked about that in the first quarter call. You can see here in the second quarter, an impact of $387 million with that mainly being steel, although we did have increases across the other commodities.","If you take that combined with the first quarter we're at a roughly $600 million of increase, we're looking at about $1.2 billion for the full year. So, we expect to have about the same amount of headwind in the second half on a year-over-year basis that we've seen here in the first quarter.","Second factor is exchange. You can see $154 million, most of that around Europe. That is more than explained by weakness in the pound sterling and then also weakness in Asia Pacific related to the Chinese renminbi. And then the third factor, just to refresh your memory, this time a year ago, we were telling you about a gain on the sale of an entity called OEConnection, that generated a profit improvement of $150 million, obviously this year on a year-over-year basis is not occurring.","So, those three factors explain what happened. Don't want to leave the page though without highlighting the fact that our market factors were positive over $200 million and within that, when you look at the callout box on volume and mix, look at the very, very strong mix that we generated. Most of that being mix among in terms of products, but also some very good performance in terms of series mix and options, which is the strategy that the team has been deploying for some time now to drive the mixes of each of our individual products into the higher series and it's proving to be quite successful. And we did generate an improvement in net pricing for the segment and the year as well.","Let's move on now to the regions, and we'll start, first, as always with North America and these are the key factors. Starting from the left, wholesales were down, just a little bit above 8,000 units, 1%. The revenue up 3%, that was driven by the mix. If we look at the SAAR, the SAAR for the region at 21 million units was down 0.5 million units. That was fully explained by a decline in the U.S. The U.S. came in at 17 million SAAR and again that was down 500,000 units. Market share was down one-tenth. That was explained by the U.S., and that was explained by lower fleet and that was explained by cars. If we move over to margin, you can see we had a strong margin of 9%, but that was down from last year and then a profit of $2.2 billion, down 19%.","If we move to the next slide and look at what was behind the $0.5 billion decline in profitability, very similar to the Automotive segment, but I would call out just the two factors; one, the higher commodity cost. Most of the company's commodity cost decline occurred here. And then, of course, the non-repeat of the gain on the sale of the OEConnection LLC majority stake that we had. I do want to highlight the engineering. You can see the engineering here is up $126 million. That was the increase for the segment as well and that was largely explained by the investments that we're making in strengthening our utility lineup and also a bit of the investment in our AVs.","Again, I want to highlight the market factors. We had favorable mix, 217 million units, most of that was driven by Super Duty, so that was both the mix among effect as well as very strong derivatives performance within the Super Duty. And then, you can see we did have higher pricing as well in the quarter.","Okay. Let's go on to slide 14. Here what I'd like to underscore, again, some of the metrics we've been sharing with you that demonstrate the disciplined approach we're taking to the business here in the United States, but I just want to note that this is the same approach we take to our business everywhere in the world, not just the U.S., but we'll use the U.S. to highlight the effect of that.","So, you can see around transaction prices, our transaction prices in the quarter driven by strong mix, particularly Super Duty, F-Series, Raptor is in that as well, five times what the industry saw in terms of an increase. If you look to the right, incentive as a percent of vehicle price over the last number of months. You can see that we've been around no increase and in fact two of the three months it was a decline, which drove a small decline for the quarter and that compares with an increase for the industry. And on the lower left, we ended the quarter at 79 days of gross supply for the U.S. That was only up one day, but for the full year, our take on our stock levels are that they're in very, very good shape overall.","Okay. Let's move now to South America. And here again, third quarter in a row, we're seeing improvement on a year-over-year basis in the key metrics in right across the board. And I think the thing that was very encouraging here is the SAAR for the region at 4.2 million units was up six-tenths. Half of that was Brazil. Finally, we've gotten to a quarter, where Brazil is up on a year-over-year basis. Now, a lot of that was direct sales, but the other economic metrics we're looking at in terms of PMI, inflation, exchange is stabilizing.","All of that is looking more favorable, although, of course, all of us are watching very closely the political developments there. Looking at wholesales, wholesales were up 12%, revenue up 18%. We had very strong performance by the Ka. And that was evidenced in the market share, which was up by five-tenths of a point, and again completely driven by the Ka. Margin improved and you can see the pre-tax loss reduced by $80 million.","Go to the next slide, which is slide 16, and look at what was behind that improvement in the loss. And you can see it's entirely driven by favorable market factors, both the volume. And you can see that a lot of it was around the pricing. The good news for me was around the cost. Because we're starting to see a much mitigated level of inflation, the efforts that the team have been making in terms of reducing cost is now more clearly flowing through.","And you can see here that despite the fact that we still have some inflationary pressures, our costs were flat in the quarter, a little bit of bad news on exchange, but even that was much less than what it has been. So, feeling much, much better about the direction of the business now in South America, and certainly the work the team has done over the last several years to really thrift out, reduce, lean the business, I think, with the top line now starting to come back, a lot of that's going to flow right through.","If you go to the following slide in terms of Europe, in Europe, all the key metrics are lower and I'll explain what's behind that. I've already talked to the wholesales. The revenue is down largely because of the volume. The SAAR was actually up, 20.7 million, across the region. That was up nine-tenths. Within that, the UK was down, so we are now finally seeing what we had expected to see from the effect of pricing and other effects across the economy, a slowdown in the UK industry. So, that was down two-tenths of a point of SAAR.","On the other hand, in Russia, similar to Brazil, really excited to see this market starting to come back now in terms of some of the external metrics. The SAAR was up two-tenths as well on a year-over-year basis. When we look at share, the share was down two-tenths of a point that was more than explained by Fiesta. So that's another one of these Fiesta launch effects that I'll talk about shortly.","Within that, our commercial vehicles performed very, very well. We once again on a brand basis were the number one selling commercial vehicle brand and we grew share in the quarter in addition. When you look at margin and pre-tax results, both of them down sharply. And if you go to the next page, we'll talk about what's behind that.","So this \u2013 I'm on slide 18. So we were down about $380 million. Almost literally half of that is related across a number of these factors due to Brexit. The biggest impact is exchange, so a much bigger effect than actually what's shown in the singular bar there, directly related to Brexit. We also saw the industry decline, which is buried within the \u2013 in fact the industry \u2013 as I mentioned to you, the industry was up, but you can see the industry dollars is down. That's the effect of the UK, because it's a high margin market.","Then we had, of course, an offset in terms of pricing. So, that's buried within that small improvement of net pricing. We did also see launch effects of the all-new Fiesta and that's spread across a number of these factors. So again, for those of you that don't know, Fiesta is our biggest selling product in Europe. This is an all-new product. We are just in the launch phase. The initial reaction from the media has been extremely strong on the product. So, very excited to get this to the market and give the customers the opportunity to enjoy it.","The third factor is commodity cost. And you can see that in the callout box for contribution cost of about $70 million. So, those three factors fully explain the decline. When you look at the rest of the business, the other item I'd like to highlight is, once again, we had the year-over-year improvement in Russia.","In terms of what we expect for the rest of the year, we expect Europe to remain profitable, although, it's going to be below the levels of 2016. And it's basically the same story we've been talking about. We think that the profits will be down about $500 million, $600 million \u2013 about $600 million related to Brexit. That probably is about the decline that we'll see in total for the business. In addition, you will see some headwinds from higher commodity cost, which will offset probably in other parts of the business.","Okay. Let's go to the following slide, which is slide 19 and now we turn to Middle East and Africa. And just to refresh your memory, we've been talking here about declining industries, declining performance for us in the Middle East. A lot of this due to external factors related to geopolitical issues and lower price of oil. That is continuing, although maybe some signs of it starting to mitigate when we look at some of the external economic factors.","When you look at wholesales, down pretty sharply, 37%. Revenue was down because of the volume. The industry was down about 12% in the markets where we participate. You can see that our share was down 1.2 points. That was almost fully explained by the Middle East, where we are still working through some performance issues. And go to the right of that, you can see the margin down. Yet for the first time now for a while, we're starting to see the loss reduce and it improved from $65 million a year ago to $53 million this quarter.","When we turn to the following slide, it's a small improvement, but to me the thing that's interesting and exciting about this is how we got there. When you look at the cost factors, the team continues to do a really good job in the face of a lot of difficulties on the top line to generate cost savings. The exchange is moving in our direction as well, that's around South Africa and euro. If you go to the far left though, you'll see the impact of volume and it's across all elements in the business, industry, share, stock adjustments, in line with that.","So, a lot of work ahead of us on that, but we still continue to expect the Middle East and Africa to improve this year compared to 2016 due to lower cost, favorable exchange and lower volume. And a lot of that \u2013 in fact, all of that improvement is going to take place in the second half of the year. So, I expect to see better results on a year-over-year basis in the second half of the year than what we've seen in the first half.","When you get to the following slide on Asia Pacific, the last of our Automotive business units, a lot of positive stories here. Wholesales up 24,000 units or 7%. That's all explained by China. Circling back to the first quarter, we talked about some issues that we had in China in the first quarter and we were down.","We talked about improving in the quarter in China and the team succeeded in that regard. They've revised the go-to-market strategy. I think we still have more work ahead of us, frankly, but we did generate an improvement year-over-year in terms of sales in China in the quarter, but more work ahead of us. And you can see some of that here in the wholesales to support that.","Revenue was up in our consolidated activities. Interestingly that includes some of the activities inside China, including Lincoln because those are consolidated. In terms of SAAR, the SAAR was at 43.7 million units. That was up 2.3 million. Of that, China was 1.9 million. So the industry's recovered from the first quarter and is growing quite nicely now. When we look at market share, we were up one-tenth, and that was driven by JMC along with Lincoln in China. It was all China that drove the market share.","Margin recovered nicely to about 4% and pre-tax results at $143 million, an improvement of $150 million from a year ago. On the lower right of the slide, I'll spend a second on this. So, this is, as we usually report, our China JV net income. So it's equity after tax, what we get, was $195 million. The margin was 10.7%. Both of those were down, so let's talk about the profit. I'll explain it through the profits. The profits were down, that we get, about $100 million.","The majority of that is due to lower investment incentives that we received in China. Most of that is due to just the timing of incentives this year versus the timing of incentives last year. For the full year, we expect incentives to be a bit lower, but much less than what we're seeing in the quarter. So you need to think about this as not something that you multiply four times. We also had some headwinds related to the exchange that I mentioned earlier.","Go to the following slide and we'll look at the improvement of $150 million and what was behind that. So you can see it was driven by favorable volume. We also had favorable mix in the quarter. It was offset in part by the negative net pricing in China that we continue to see. But then we had favorable cost performance. I've talked about the exchange, and then within the other, that is more than explained by the timing and the lower level of investment incentives in the quarter that I referenced just a bit earlier.","If we think about the full year, we expect Asia Pacific to improve. That's no change from prior guidance, and that will be driven by favorable volume and mix and lower cost. We still expect, on a full year basis, industry pricing to be negative and we also expect to see unfavorable exchange due to the renminbi flow-through as well.","Okay, that's it for Automotive. Let's move now to Ford Credit. Where \u2013 we've got some really great performance to talk about and you can see it here on this slide, the business grew $8 billion in terms of managed receivables and that was driven largely by retail financing globally. And then, the pre-tax result was up 55% at $619 million. We'll talk in a second about what was behind that, but it was pretty broad-based, when you look at what drove the improvement.","If you look at some of the portfolio metrics on this particular slide, very strong. Average placement FICO over 740, consistent more or less where it had been. The delinquencies remain in a very, very good place and the loss\/receivables ratio, while it's up, is certainly well within our expectations from where we are at this point in the cycle. So, overall, very robust portfolio performance combined with great bottom line performance and growth.","If you turn to the next slide, on slide 24, this is what's behind it. You can see most of the factors are green and positive. We had favorable volume and mix, that's the growth that we talked about, the margin was favorable. Credit loss reserve was good. We actually did increase the reserve for credit losses in the quarter. We just increased it much less so than last year.","Lease residuals are flat. I think that's a victory. That's been one of the biggest headwinds of the business now for quite a number of quarters, but as it has been written about by many of you and others in the media, we are seeing less of a downward draft on auction values than what we had expected, and certainly that's reflected here. We still expect our auction values or residual values to fall on an average basis by about 6%. But if you go back to what I said in the first quarter, I said about 6%, that was a round down to 6%. This quarter, it's a round up to 6%. So even within that number, we're seeing some improvement.","Then we go to the far right, you can see other and we had a $90 million improvement in our derivatives and this was based on favorable interest rate movements.","If you go to the following slide and look at some of our financing trends. Again this continues, I think a similar story what we've talked about in the quarter, we're seeing leasing pull back a bit and you can see that we came down, as did the industry. To the far right, on the upper part of the chart, you can see what I was talking about. In the quarter, we had a seasonal \u2013 seasonally or a sequential increase for the second quarter in a row in terms of average auction values. And on a year-over-year basis down only about 4.5%; again that is less than what we had expected or more than what \u2013 less than what we had expected.","If you go to the lower left, in terms of severity, that's looking very healthy and we talked about the LTR. So, overall, what we're seeing is strong credit quality, strong business environment and healthy consumer credit conditions and that's reflected in really great results for Ford Credit.","Let's move on now to cash flow. Looking at the Automotive segment. So, in the middle of the page, you can see the $1.3 billion that we generated. The one thing I'd highlight is the negative impact of changes in working capital that was primarily in payables, a lot of that associated with the launch of the Fiesta in Europe. So we had much lower production in the last 45 days of the quarter related to that. We also had some inventory holds in other parts of our business for various reasons, which have subsequently unwound. But, at the end of the quarter, that had an impact. The only other things I would highlight is that we're still on track to our guidance for capital spending, pension contributions and also full year shareholder distributions.","Moving on to slide 27, the balance sheet metrics, the only thing I'd comment here, we can take questions later, is everything is in great shape, the balance sheet remains strong, Ford Credit well capitalized, a lot of good liquidity there. And in terms of pensions, we still expect by the time we get to the end of the year, it's not reflected here, but based on what we're seeing in terms of the key metrics that drive our pension funding obligation status, we expect it to improve from where it had been at the end of 2016.","Moving on to more of an outlook discussion, looking at GDP and industry planning assumptions, GDP is unchanged in the second column from what we guided previously, but on the right hand side, industry is up a bit on the global basis. We have taken the U.S. down, a couple of 100,000 units from prior guidance to 17.5 million. That's really driven primarily by lower fleet sales. Brazil up a tenth, Europe up a couple of tenths, and China down a couple of tenths. So, some small movements up or down, but probably the one that's most noteworthy to you is the U.S., a little bit softer than what we had expected, but that's driven by fleet sales.","Now, let's spend a little bit of time on guidance, because we're making a couple of changes here. So, as you guys all know that we have historically provided an adjusted pre-tax profit outlook for the company, we've then separately provided a tax rate. So, we're going to be moving from this point forward to a methodology, which is used by others and it's understood very well by you and the Street to use an adjusted EPS and so you see that in the first column.","So, our guidance for the year is of $1.65 to $1.85. To the right of that, importantly, is the tax rate that I referred to earlier. Now, to help you understand how to think about the guidance, if you take the last quarter guidance and you put it on the same basis, it would be $1.58, that was the about $9 billion, 30% tax rate. So, clearly the range is higher, but it's driven by the tax rate. So to help you further, if you were to take the top end of that range, that's effectively about the $9 billion, it's a little bit less than in absolutes since then $9 billion, but that's effectively about the $9 billion.","And then beneath that, think about that as our view of potential risks, as we think about market factors or cost performance over the balance of the year. So it's not necessarily something that we see happening, but as we look at history from this point forward, and we think about the environment that we're in, we're providing for various outcomes on both market factors and cost performance that takes us to the lower end of the range.","The other thing I would highlight is the tax rate. And then the other thing that may be helpful to you, as we think about the second half of the year, we do expect the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, that's based on seasonal factors, historical experience, but this year also related to the launch of the Expedition and the Navigator. Those will be going through effectively launch the entire quarter, don't expect to see any wholesales until the beginning of the fourth quarter.","And then in terms of 2018, we've provided a view on 2018. Ever since Investor Day back in September, we've continued to share that with you at other events. We're not doing that today, because of the reassessment that Jim has us working on, and we'll share more on the business later this year as he said earlier.","And then on slide 30, this is our full year guidance puts and takes. It's been updated and reflects our latest thinking. So if you have any questions on that, we can take that later. And then finally, on slide 31, our view of the key takeaways. So a solid quarter, certainly a lot of excitement here as we progress our 100-day review. The second one is around all the metrics we've shared, Ford Credit, strong results, the balance sheet in great shape, continuing to run the business in a very healthy way and then of course the guidance update that we just talked about.","So with that, Ted, I think we're ready to move into Q&A.","Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Co.","So with that, we'd like to turn it over to questions for the team here.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. First question is really on tax. You touched on the drivers of the significant reduction in tax rate this year. Firstly, is there anything you can say more about the change from 30% to 15%, which is pretty big? And secondly, does the lower tax rate this year have the potential to impact future years? And thirdly, is the change more to book taxes, or will there also be an improvement to cash taxes and if so, how material could that benefit be?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. Thanks, Ryan. It's a good question. So, in terms of tax, think about the effect that we're talking about is being 2017, I would think when we get into 2018 we'll move back to a more normal tax rate of around 30%. Obviously, we'll update you on that when we provide the guidance for next year. But, I would see that as something that we're doing this year.","So, the other way to think about what's happening, the tax team, who as I said, has just done a great job, they had line of sight to the actions that we're talking about affecting 2017 that we'd be taking in some of the years ahead of us. But, frankly, in anticipation of potential corporate tax reform and again no idea when that happens, but also not knowing what it is, the team recommended that we take these actions that we had planned to do perhaps later in our planning period and pull them into this year, which is what we are doing.","And I'm not going to get into specifics of the one action that we took in the quarter, as I said there will be others in the second half of the year, but effectively they're bringing distributions back to the U.S. Those distributions are bringing with them foreign tax credits which we're then recognizing on the balance sheet.","So, in terms of the impact on cash taxes, this is a book tax effect, would not expect it to have any near-term impact on cash taxes, but certainly at some point in the future it will, so this is real in terms of both profit and cash, but the cash impact will be later.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just lastly for me, I thought to ask on Ford Credit, obviously very strong in the quarter. When you first got it to $1.5 billion for full year 2017 in November last year in the absence of knowing anything better, I just sort of assumed $750 million in the first half, $750 million in the back half, you've done $1.1 billion to-date. Can you say anything about the cadence of Ford Credit profits this year in order to help us maybe gauge, how much better than $1.5 billion could the division be tracking for the full year?","And then just sticking with Ford Credit, the lease residuals, those tracking better, does that do anything to change your previously communicated outlook that prices would continue to fall through 2019 or some of the actions you're doing on rental cars or something else maybe helping you rethink that?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. So in terms of cadence, we're not providing a specific number in terms of profit for the year. It will be better. Second half will be lower than the first half. So, I certainly wouldn't take $1.1 billion times 2. That is not happening. But it will be better than the $1.5 billion. And to the question that you had around, how are we thinking about \u2013 and let's not talk about auction values but more residual values as a percent of sales price, because we actually expect over time that those will rise and we want to kind of focus on the percentage, if you will, residual values as a percent of that. But we are still expecting, as I said, it's about 6% year-over-year, which would suggest a pretty sharper decline later this year in order to land in that spot. So, we'll have to wait and see if that happens. Frankly, the team just gave me a report yesterday, the latest weekly report, and things are still holding up well.","So, we haven't seen the signs yet of anything happening. We've certainly heard that we can expect to see some declines coming from the next ALG update. So we'll have to work our way through that. But that's what we're kind of providing for in that guidance. In terms of looking at 2018 and 2019, nothing has changed in terms of our expectations. We're still expecting that residual values as a percent of vehicle price will be declining and we're building that into all of the new business that we're writing.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Just want to get underneath the kind of puts and takes and revisions to the outlook. It looks like with the tax credit benefit, you will be taking that it appears that the midpoint of pre-tax seems to be as mentioned coming down from the roughly $9 billion that you talked about. Can you, A, confirm that and, B, with the regions performing a little bit better this quarter, where is that op and with certainly Ford Credit now poised to contribute more? Where do you sense that operating weakness is likely to come from?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. So, first of all, you shouldn't assume that our own point of view in terms of where the business is at the midpoint. But you are right. I mean you can calculate and figure out what the midpoint is and it would be further below the prior guidance of $9 billion and just a bit below which is where the top end is. But, please don't assume that's necessarily where we are in terms of our own single point estimate.","But to the point you are raising, we are looking at the business both in terms of market factors and cost performance. We are trying to provide some recognition of the fact that we don't have control over everything and so there's two I would highlight. One is the commodity cost, which as I said, will be up based on what we think right now about $1.2 billion on a year-over-year basis. By the way, they were favorable last year by $900 million, so you can see how they can swing. The exchange is another factor that obviously will be what it's going to be and then frankly, the other one is around warranty expense and the potential for recalls.","We don't forecast recalls. In fact we don't know, I personally don't know about recalls or others until the team has done the work and the data supports an action and then we move and we move very, very quickly. But as you are very well aware we have seen, some recalls that have had material financial impact over the last number of quarters, and so this provides us a little bit of space for that as well.","But I would add, Brian, that a couple of things since the first quarter guidance that has taken place, actually three things, very specifically that we've accommodated in this range, one is higher incentives across all regions of the world, not really large in any one region, but when you add them up, it's a factor. The second is higher warranty expense already in North America and that's related to coverages. So, not recalls, but coverages, normal 36 months, 36,000 miles that sort of thing. Also something, some related to our extended warranty that we provide on some of our components.","And then the last, which is an offset, which is what you raised is a favorable view of what Ford Credit is going to bring to the business. So those three together, in an absolute sense, will take you a bit lower than $9 billion, but contained within the upper end of the guidance. The rest of it is really a risk assessment.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And now a question for Jim. I know you're still in the midst of this 600-day fitness assessment, but one thing that jumps out at us is the gap in North American margins between Ford and GM, which is now running around 300 basis points. What's your observations of that? Ford still historically has traded at premium to GM, primarily thinking that the brand equity was stronger, that brands were better positioned. But to the extent that is, it's certainly not showing up in the margins in North America. So wondering, if you have some points of view on that and how just preliminary that might be addressed at the end of the 100 days?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I think, Brian, it fits the early comments I made about fitness that, that notion means, you're scanning for competitive improvements. People coming at you that you don't expect, as we start talking about the future, we'll be talking about competitors that are outside our industry. So that kind of thing gets my attention. I can understand that in ways with the SUV segment being so strong and our franchise being really strong in that same area, and this kind of perspective that you're bringing up is something that we talk about. So I can just confirm it's the kind of thing that doesn't go over the top of our head.","It's not something at all that I'm worried about addressing and I also have great optimism that when we talk to you about how we're going to address that, there is big opportunity there. Just for all the listeners and in regard here, we changed the organization on May 22. So, there were 19 direct reports in the last administration, I have 8 and I'm an executive team that, the speed in which they can address something like what you just talked about, there's a big improvement. You wouldn't know that based on the data which you are looking at right now, but that's the promise that hope to prove to you.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Hey, Brian, it's Bob. The only thing that I would add and again it's not to denigrate GM's performance because I think what they're doing is quite impressive I think. But we do have to and you guys recognize this as well and they do as well, there has been a lot of stock build. So, I think when you want to compare margins and that type of thing, you really have got to neutralize that effect on both sides.","And if you look at our business in the quarter, we actually had a stock decline in the quarter in the U.S., and in North America, we had a very small stock \u2013 favorable stock change. That was not the U.S. which is where high margins are. So that's the only caveat I would put as, on an apples to apples basis probably gap isn't quite as large as what you said.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just final question around capital, are you open to sort of bold moves around capital consumption ranging, whether it's from investing in product lines all the way to spinning out or joint venturing major parts of the business that consume big chunks of cash?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, I mean you called it bold, I think it's just part of the fitness cadence and discipline that I'm really trying to stress. I mean this is one of the most important things the leadership can do, is making choices in a way that really preserves capital, gets the kind of returns that you would expect, so of course all of that is in the air up for grabs.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Jim, I'd like to just ask a couple more questions about the things that you are assessing in the first 100 days. First of all, just on this innovation question, what do you think can change to accelerate the pace of innovation and the clock speed at a company like Ford and to make the company more competitive in terms of speed and risk-taking with some of the tech companies that you've had quite a bit of exposure to?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Rod, this is the area that I probably have the most confidence and I'm humble about what I'm about to say to you, because I have to prove it here. But surprisingly in a company like Ford, all the talent's here, all the capability is here, so I got to confirm that with you. It's what happened in business history, there was a little bit of a shift in terms of the way that you understand the nature of the way people use products. You marry that with really rigorous development processes and you have success.","And so, the inference is that that frontend part, the way we understand use, think about that as building more value in products, but there is also a reductive opportunity, there's stuff that people don't care about in vehicles that we shouldn't have there. And in the course of doing that, I want to confirm that this is one of the pleasant surprises I've had when I got closer to Ford from just being on the board, is they have mastery in key systems like the financial systems as an example. They have mastery in the ability to engineer product to market. The quality metrics that you're hearing about and there is an ongoing report of quality. There is definitely change there.","So, I want to leverage what got better over the last, say, seven or eight years in those areas and marry them with some of the innovation techniques that I won't go on about today, I want to share all of that, that I understand. And the way you walk away from that discussion is you realize that the people all of a sudden are saying, I like the Ford products better and they like them a lot now. They are really popular, Mustang and F-150, but I see opportunity in every area where we can be better.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, just to understand that a little bit better, is the management team and you specifically dissatisfied with what you see at this point in terms of the clock speed or the changes that you're seeing from an innovation perspective?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, this is a kind of question that could come up a few times a day. So, let me step back and tell you one of the first things we did going from 19 to 8, is we addressed the, what I call, the point of view ownership. Think of that as when you have a lot of things that are triangulating for attention and clarity. These are big decisions. But the simple notion that somebody owns that point of view is an empowering and freeing stance. So, we went through exercises together as a team to clear that up and we're already seeing the effect. So, we're speeding up decision-making. We're speeding up the way that choices are clarified. A neat consequence from that, that was a word that Alan used to use, wasn't it, neat.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Neat and cool.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Neat and cool. So, a neat consequence of that is we've been able to free up time on the executives' calendars. I just did the math last night. It's about 30 minutes a day that was taken off of their calendars that were corporate kind of requirements. So, when you work the hours these folks do and how hard they are working all over the world, that's found money. And then that translates in ways. The body language is now translating down to the teams that work for these folks.","So, again, if you're following me around, we got some early momentum here. It's too early to report in this quarterly call to you, but you asked the question, how do I see that infiltrating? And that is what you pick up in startup companies, in tech companies. They haven't grown to the size of Ford. So, they didn't have that kind of hierarchy that I inherited. So, they have some advantages in that regard that we don't have to cede that to anybody else. We can bring those in and that's what we've begun to do.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And just, lastly, a question on how you're thinking about capital allocation and the portfolio of businesses and products. One of the biggest paybacks that we've seen over time in the industry is actually when the industry exits segments that have been \u2013 the companies have been involved with maybe just \u2013 maybe based on tradition more than anything else. But they're obviously challenging segments and you can think about regions that have been challenging for many years and maybe so for a long time. Is this reassessment that you're looking at also that broad that you're questioning regions or segments, markets that Ford is currently in?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. And I don't want to dismiss your question with this response. I mean you've got to believe the capability of the folks running the company, including myself. Don't fall asleep on that question. I mean there's other forces that tend to put that in a vice and hold it. And that's what you are accurate about. You have to break that hold to say, what's causing us to hang in there. And every time, if you look back with me that we hung in a market was because we actually took actions to improve and maybe it didn't work.","So I think the new reality that I can kind of confirm to you is that we really have to ask ourselves what do we have to believe to get to the kind of returns that we expect and you expect. And if we can't answer that, then we can't be there. That's making the choice when you hear us talk about playing to win and where to play, that is what that code means, is that you are clarifying where you're going to put capital.","You've seen decisions from us already in the short 60-plus days that the new teams come together and the decision to put the Focus in China is an example of that. We saved a bunch of money doing that and there is other things like that that will be forthcoming.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Good morning, John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a first question here, Bob, on the guidance, and just doing some real dumb guy's math here. I mean it looks like, at the high end of the range which you're relatively more endorsing than the low end, you do about $4 billion in pre-tax in the second half of the year roughly. And your guidance range though does kind of imply a pre-tax range of almost $1 billion. So, that $1 billion is against that $4 billion in the second half of the year. I am just curious, I mean you kind of highlighted these three factors, but I mean is there something else going on or is it just a big recall maybe around Takata that you think might create incremental expense in the second half of the year because it's just a big relative range to that remainder of the year?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah. I agree with you. I think it is in part around some of the \u2013 if I go back and look at the last year-and-a-half in particular, we've had a number of material recalls that, again, for the reasons that I mentioned, don't know about them and then they happen, and not in the guidance because we didn't know about them. So, what we're trying to protect for is the possibility of something like that.","Again, nothing that obviously has been acted upon because otherwise by definition we would have done it. Takata is actually not relevant in that conversation, I think, at least from our point of view, because we actually have gone back to the government and indicated that there's no facts or circumstances that would support us in doing something. So, we are having that conversation with them. But it's really more around risk assessment of that, if something like that happening.","Also, just looking at a historical experience in terms of market factors, what could happen in terms of market factors from this point forward, commodities out there. They've started to actually get a little bit better from the first quarter, but that's a concern, exchange and other. So it's really more around risk assessment. That's the way I would think about it and not that there's something going on. There's something that we have in mind. I think it is fair to say that at the moment we're more towards the upper part of that range, but we're just trying to protect for the potentiality of something along the lines that you talked about occurring. That's it.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's very helpful.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","What I would expect when we get to the third quarter obviously the range will be a lot less. And we'll narrow it down and have a better feel for ultimately where we're coming out for obvious reasons, but this is where we are today.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a second question on your mix being positive $310 million in the quarter, I think you highlighted, goes far beyond just segment shift, but there is also a shift we see in vehicle lines as you are selling \u2013 up-selling the consumer. I'm just curious how much of that do you think is sticky over time, how much of that is very Ford specific? And are you getting into a higher set of customers that are willing to pay you sort of mass market, luxury sort of premium kind of prices that will stick around for a while?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, this is something that we've had a lot of success in North America. It's a big part of the story here both around product mix, but also the derivative mix. Stephen Odell and then Jim Farley in Europe made that a central part of the transformation plan there and that's been extremely successful. And Jim's still pushing the team there, but everywhere around the world for the dollars to be mined from that approach.","So, I wouldn't say \u2013 and I should mention also China. We've also picked up over time a lot of good news there from bringing in the Edge, the Taurus. We're taking the same derivative strategy in China too. So, it's not just a single market that we're taking that approach because we know it works and successful and customers actually love those types of products.","What I would say though just to condition you, when we look at the first half, we've picked up quite a bit of good news on mix on a year-over-year basis, about $700 million. I don't see that happening in the second half. And the second half is probably a bit flat to even maybe slightly negative. And that's because on some of the big contributors of the more recent improvements and particularly Super Duty we start lapping ourselves, in terms of when the product came in and the derivatives in the high \u2013 the high derivatives at the beginning of the launch, et cetera.","I think Fiesta will give us an opportunity in Europe. So I think that's one that we should look out for, because I would expect that to follow. But I do believe if we take it out longer than just the half, certainly Jim's view is that, there is gold to be mined in the hills and he is going to keep pushing us.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And I would add, Bob, that coming in new, when I was on the board, we got to tour that plant, that was building the new F-150 with the aluminum underpinnings. And when you drive that vehicle and you know, it's handling characteristics, and I made reference to its contribution in this last year to MPG improvement.","It is the significant factor that's improved our goal, our march towards a cycle plan more than any other vehicle in anybody's inventory. But where I want to go is, when I drove that car, that vehicle for the first time, and the kind of feeling I had, I believe the word spreads in this kind of industry, and here we have a product that's now starting to be understood and very popular. And then, as I mentioned in my comments, the refresh is coming, and as Bob's conditioning you, we know we've sold a lot of these vehicles, but we believe there's still a lot to be had, and that's what's helping that transaction price go up.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And maybe just \u2013 I apologize, maybe just a follow-up on that. I mean the Expedition and Navigator launching next year. I mean, if you make up some ground on GM and Ford, that might be a $1 billion or $2 billion opportunity. I mean, is that also \u2013 I mean off the back of the F-150 platform, and similarly fuel efficient, is there a real big opportunity here when the Expedition and Navigator launch next year or actually really hit dealerships next year?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, we definitely see the Expedition and Navigator as an opportunity both in terms of volume and certainly in terms of price, transaction price, mix and so forth. That's a really big opportunity. That's why I wanted to make sure that you understood. Even the old one was quite profitable, right?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","So, I wanted to make sure that when I was talking about the third quarter, you understood, we're basically not wholesaling hardly any of those old or new in the quarter, and then we'll start filling the pipeline in the fourth quarter and then of course it really will pick off and take off in 2018.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And this is why I talk about the handling of those vehicles in my early comments. You're going to have to drive one to feel what I'm talking about, but there's a definite marked improvement, I think competitively. It's going to be really interesting how they react to that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Looking forward to it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and thank you for taking our questions. First, I want to just stick with the U.S. market. I think you brought down your assumptions from around 17.8 million to 17.5 million total SAAR, so about 17.2 million light. Wondering how you feel about the market going forward from 2017 into 2018 and 2019? Are we in a plateau mode in the 17 million, should it grind lower into the 16 million? That's kind of point one.","And then on the back of that, Jim, as you think about North America cycle peaking and coming down, what type of levers do you expect to pull to maintain profitability? Are you going to be quick to pull out production, is it incentives, do you drive back more sales to the daily rental channel? How are you thinking about navigating what looks like a cycle peak and decline from there last year and at least in North America?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay, Dave. Let me take those and see if then Jim would like to comment. So in terms of industry, we don't have it in this deck, but we had indicated in our prior guidance, and I think it was 17.7 million, the prior guidance, that we would see a further decline in 2018. So I think the way to think about it \u2013 I know we're all kind of struggling with this to figure it out, because I see what you guys are forecasting too.","Our view is that what, however, you wanted to describe it, an eroding plateau, I've seen that, or however you want to characterize it, very strong sales, we don't see anything in terms of the economy, the health of the consumer, housing, oil, the oil production is back up and that's had an impact on trucks for example, that would suggest that over the next two \u2013 let's say two years, that there's any kind of significant collapse or dramatic change. We do think it's going to decline. We think it will be a soft gradual decline.","What we're seeing this year seem to be more on the retail side, probably, or fleet side related to what's happening with auction values, a lot of that with rental, but that seems to be the effect this year, we'll have to just wait and see when we go into the next two years or so, what does happen.","That's our view and what we'll do is, as we always do, we update this monthly and we'll share it with you kind of real time, as we have the chance to get together. But that's our view, it's declining, but it's still going to be very strong.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","In North America, Bob, the belief is, David, that all the work we're doing for new products, these are going to be forthcoming, so there's an improvement in the mix of products because of what we're inventing. We see opportunities, as I mentioned a minute ago, in the F-Series with the refresh. You've already acknowledged the Expedition and the Navigator, Transit as well. This is a product that has very high share and has a big advantage in terms of people love what it can do and so we're investing there as well, so think of the North American product mix isn't sitting still.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","The other thing that I would add in terms of things that we would think about as the industry softens a bit. To me, there is no better time than to follow the principles of a disciplined approach to the business. You have got to be even more disciplined. You've got to be anticipating a bit more where the industry is going, where you see changes. You got to act superfast. And if anything what, and I know this is Jim Farley's mindset and Joe as well.","The other thing that we should do, you don't wait for it to happen. You've got to start kind of leaning yourself down in the areas that you know will be affected by the downturn on the way towards what will be downturn, so for example stocks. We do have targets on stocks. But can we grind that a little bit lower than the target stocks, and can we kind of glide our way down a bit, so that when the sharper downturn occurs that we're in better shape once it starts.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And in earlier calls, Bob, I remember you were establishing that we were managing the days in inventory. Let's be candid, the world thought, oh, there's something amiss here, but as this quarter now and the industry plays out, we're real happy with our position right now in the inventories. We were managing that very well.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. I think that was clear. And on the go-forward, as we think about new company kind of three pillars of autos that's changing; mobility, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, should we be expecting or naturally do we expect spend to continue to increase from here on all three of those? I mean is that the way that we're \u2013 or you're going to be approaching the business and somewhat expediting, some of the things that were going on at Ford Smart Mobility at a total company level and getting further into that electric vehicle platforms that were going to come out for 2020, further into the autonomous vehicle development, further into mobility?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, are you \u2013 when you are asking the question, Joe, are you thinking about incremental, are you asking me the question, can we get our total fitness to absorb \u2013 oh, excuse me, David, sorry.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, it's a mixture of both, right, because the spend, seems like it should increase to bring forward the clock speed if you will or pull forward some of this...","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But then against the backdrop of a declining North America market, how should we think about overall spend?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, so, I'm going to let Bob tell you the way we're planning that in the current numbers. But I'll just give you the way my body language is. I want to question that you have to sit here and hear us say that, the core business as we knew it, all the spending there is as fit as it needed to be and everything new has to be incremental. I haven't bought that yet.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","And the only thing I would add, David, is that, this year, we expect in terms of CapEx, and we use that as the surrogate for what do you spend, because there is engineering and other things, but CapEx of about $7 billion. When you look at our 10-Q, which will come out later today, we had guided over the next five years to \u2013 previously to $8 billion to $9 billion. I think we're going to take that down to about $8 billion.","So, I at the moment, would see us kind of moving up to that level, after this year, not necessarily all next year, but we'll have to wait and see where that pans out, but it's certainly, that's about the level that we see the business running in terms of CapEx. And one other thing that's kind of interesting in that regard, a lot of the things that we'll do in some of the mobility spaces, digital services are not capital intensive, so we have to remember that. Also, if you think about the actions that we took around the Focus for North America, we freed up $1 billion, so part of this is finding smarter ways, which is what Jim was talking on to deploy and allocate our capital, not just spend more.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And finally just in China, can you just talk to what you're seeing from a price down perspective, has it accelerated since the first quarter update? And exiting the second quarter, how do you feel your inventories are, given slower sales pace that we saw at least in the second quarter?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","The overall industry pricing accelerated in the second quarter, which I think we had expected. I think we're still on track towards, I want to say, 5% for the full year. And that seems to be pretty much in line with what we're experiencing ourselves. So, I think that's \u2013 that seems to be the path that we are on.","We took a lot of actions in the second quarter to get our stocks in shape, because of the issues \u2013 the sales performance issues and also the lower industry that we talked about in the first quarter of the year. So, I think we are in pretty good shape right now. And then going back to the earlier question that we had \u2013 that you gave us around what do you do, I mean, Jim has been really fast with Joe as soon as we see sales miss or anything in the external environment that suggests that we need to take out stock we're doing it ASAP.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for the time. A question for Jim. So one of the things you've mentioned is looking at capital. It's come up a couple of times, and making sure that's used efficiently. So along those lines, and as the industry migrates more towards xEV technology, well, first, do you have a sense of how much of your current PP&E is related to internal combustion engines? And I guess more importantly, what percent of that equipment do you think is flexible enough to be repurposed? And as you make new capital decisions, are those purchases being made with a certain level of flexibility in mind?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","I would say yes, yes, yes. I mean, I don't know that I'm going to tell you some of the internal strategic things about that, but remember, Ford's ability to produce an ICE engine and the kind of engineering to bring that to the level of quality that I think is world class is the same kind of talent that will allow us to bring these new Powertrains. And they themselves can carry the day I believe in the future with robust designs and better business models and better digital services. I mean, there is more to the quest for profit than just what's it cost us to build the vehicle.","As we can stare at other competitors that are doing this and I am not worried about the embedded cost, let me just state this for the record, I am not worried about the sunk cost or the fixed cost we have in the old historical technologies, frustrating us about thinking of the future. It really doesn't matter. I mean, we're going to do what we got to do to make the company really successful and meet the kind of requirements that we have to meet and win the way you hear me talking about. And I don't think about how many factories I have building gasoline engines. Now, I know that if I flip that, that you can ask \u2013 you're asking a really smart question, which is, can you leverage capabilities at Ford? And absolutely, we can. That's something that you will expect.","And you'll go what's an example right now? Just think of the early investment we made in Chariot, that's a Transit platform that we know a lot about, as we build the ride-hailing and ride-sharing service ideas, and we're learning about users in those kinds of experiences that can backward integrate in the way people just experience the Transit when they're not sharing it. So, there's lots of synergies in the future back to what we've already understood about our business.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. Look forward to hearing more about those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just maybe shifting gears to South America, it does look, it looked like you've narrowed your losses a bit year-to-date on plan with your guidance. But I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a better view of how you are thinking about the second half in South America. Where your breakeven levels there are? And what the path there is to get back to profitability for Ford in that region?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Itay. Good morning. The path is really going to be around what I touched on, when we were going through the section, which is the recovery of the industry firstly and the consumers. So, when we look at the second half of the year, we expect to see substantially better results on a year-over-year basis than what we saw in the first half of the year. And much of that's going to be driven on the back of the industry, a little bit of mix, but also some pricing without too much impact of exchange based on how we see the market right now. And cost being very, very well controlled with some inflation getting through, but very well controlled.","As we move forward, I think and as momentum continues in the economic recovery, again the leverage effect, I think it's going to really flow through quite quickly. And then what the team also is working on of course is product. We need to make sure that we've got a very robust and exciting product portfolio and in fact later this year, we're going to be launching the EcoSport, the mid-cycle change on that which has been a very successful product there. And we'll also have coming a mid-cycle change on the Ka, which is in the highest volume segment in the region. So, those are the things that I think we're going to have to build on for product portfolio and bring more customers into the showrooms from that point of view and our team is working on that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Jim. As you go through your 100-day review, can you talk a little bit more about the revenue opportunities that you are looking at? And also, maybe how Ford's investments in Big Data kind of play into some of the opportunities both within revenue and fitness that you described on slide 3?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, you led me to that answer in the knowledgeable way that our GDIA helps us \u2013 this is an important thing that was invested in that's really been worth its value. So it helps us understand demand in a lot more granular way, it helps us understand pricing, it's going to help us understand pricing even better. So, right now, we're looking as I mentioned in my comments, the relationship between mix and pricing is where the revenue opportunities are. That's probably as much as I want to share about it, because it's competitive, but there is opportunity there.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","And maybe I can just give you an example of what Jim was talking about, Itay. For example, GDIA for quite some time \u2013 we're probably most progressed in the U.S. in terms of their ability to help guide us in terms of how we play volume versus mix versus incentives versus types of incentives, the effectiveness of the marketing, the fixed marketing, the advertising sales promotion, so we've got tremendously strong data and starting to move to the point where we can actually understand individual customers, not just the broader market, but individual customers.","But one of the good examples and this plays a bit to what we've seen unfold across the industry, but perhaps more so at Ford, which is around the cars. As we've looked at the data, and we've looked at our own data and we've looked at the competitors, there's just not much elasticity on the cars. So, we can put more variable on that. It's not going to do anything other than we spend more variable. So, that has enabled us to kind of pull back a bit. And in fact I think in the second quarter, we pulled back on our incentives in an absolute sense, much less than increase for the industry on cars, if I remember correctly.","And we've been able to take those funds, and we have been able to allocate them to other segments and specific vehicle lines combined with an aligned advertising sales promotion approach, but also Tier 2 marketing by the dealers and Tier 3, to be very aligned and very powerful around where we know the most elasticity is, and really drive hard. So, that I think has saved us incentives and it's probably given us some off the mix effect that we've had, it's also I think given us a clear view about the real underlying strength of the car business in general, but ours specifically.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much for all that detail.","Operator","Thank you. We will take one more analyst and then we will switch to the news media. Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge Research.","Derek J. Glynn - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. Jim, in your view, can the success of emerging opportunities be complementary to the success of the core business or is this inversely related? And similarly, recognizing it's still early days since the investment in Argo AI, what are your views on the strategic vision for that entity and the role it could play going forward? Thanks.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, the important secret in this, Derek, is that humans are in both of those models. People use the products in the historic understanding of our industry and that's our target obviously in the future. Even though and I am being a little facetious, but even though there is robots in the future, right, as you're targeting about with Argo AI, so the robots are only going to be as effective as how they serve the humans. This is a distinct position that I am taking and I think there's going to be a difference in the way Ford thinks about it.","So, Bill Ford and I had a really intimate discussion about this when I started in the board. Then later, which is \u2013 the history of the company is evolving itself over this long-lived life and not thinking about that it's in a regressive way unable to leave the last phase to the new. I mean, we just got to do what we have to do to win and be successful in the future.","What tends to happen, you are hearing me preach here a little bit, is we over-romanticize that future. We over-dramatize. Bill Gates used to say you overestimate the arrival and you underestimate the impact of these technologies. So, we have to get ready for how disruptive they are, but they probably aren't as soon as everybody is writing about them. We're ready though, we're going to be ready.","And so, Argo was an investment in that area. John Casesa, our Head of Strategy, helped put this together and it was a really innovative idea, because to get that kind of talent inside Ford, the configuration of the entity in Pittsburgh allows us to have them be us and them be them. They can be both together. It probably wasn't known as deeply as you can read about today, is the deep learning ,is a phase of artificial intelligence that's recent. It's only three years really in its awareness. And deep learning is kind of the special pixie dust the way these things are going to really perform. The ability to do that is what we're targeting with Argo AI to bring that capability into Ford. There's very few firms in the world creating what we're talking about that have this capability.","And so, that promise is something that we have to come and show you, but it's situating us really well to be ahead in that game eventually. We're not there yet. I wouldn't say we're number one, but we're at the top of the people working on this technology. As we go into the media discussions, someone is going to ask me to calibrate that, but you just \u2013 you got to trust the way machine learning has evolved. There are differences. There is kind of elite kind of players in it and then others that are kind of good at it. We're going to be in that elite level with this capability.","Derek J. Glynn - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. That's very helpful.","Operator","We will now take questions from the news media. Your first question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin with The Associated Press.","Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press","Thank you for taking the call. Bob, a quick one. What's the update on the buyout offers? Are you getting what you need and if you don't get what you need, do you then consider layoffs? And, Jim, another quick one. Just your take on Ford stock price and what it's going to take to move the needle to kind of get past the cycle fears that investors just can't seem to get over? Thanks.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Okay. Thanks, Dee-Ann. So, on the first one, based on the latest that I have seen, it's progressing well. I think they have until sometime later this month, someone's saying today. Today? To self-select. So we'll have to see what the final numbers are, but I've been told it's going well. Just for the analysts on the call, we will reflect any separation cost associated with that in the third quarter as a special item. Don't know what that number is, but we'll report it in the third quarter.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And regarding, Dee-Ann, the share price, there is no CEO in the world that doesn't understand that that currency is not only how they are compensated, their teams are compensated, but is the scorecard for how well things are going. But the way I think about that, it's a consequence. It's not a leading indicator. So this share price today does not reflect the team's activities that I believe we're going to embrace and deliver to you. So that has to happen with dispatch and more importantly what Bob and I talk about, Bill and I talk about is reliability where you expect things from us and that we build trust in the way we create value. I've been in the business, been around CEOs that have that kind of command and so I long for that and that's my pitch that the share price over time is going to reflect what we're able to get done and we plan on getting a lot done.","Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Snavely with Detroit Free Press.","Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question here. I'm wondering, as the industry goes through this very big trend of car sales declining, as SUV, crossover, and pickup sales increase, if your review of capital allocation \u2013 I mean, if you're looking at car lines and if there are cars in the U.S. get risk of being eliminated as you add SUV models?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I'm looking to Bob because \u2013 and as I came into the job, I knew we were in the middle of that. So I want to confirm we do. That is one of the leadership responsibilities. And there's been some decisions that have been in the air, so to speak, but I'm going to let you...","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. I think, Brent, what you're talking about is consumers are moving away from passenger cars into utilities and trucks. They've been doing that for quite a long time. They've been doing that not just here, but in all the major markets of the world. And there is no sign that trend is going to continue. So we will be responding to what the customers want. That's around the \u2013 the guidance we have already provided is around investing more in utilities and investing more in trucks.","But in some markets and for some reasons, cars will continue to be important. We're just going to be very thoughtful about the amount of investment that we make there and make sure that it gives us an appropriate return. So I think two examples that demonstrate that is the decision around the Focus, so we will still provide a Focus to customers in North America. But we're going to do that in a way that's very capital efficient and saved us $1 billion versus what we had expected. And we'll do so in a way that gives us a better return than what we would have done if we've just continued on the path that we had been on.","And we're going to look at all the individual vehicle lines with a very critical lens as we go forward, because we've got to make a return on that investment. Another example is in Europe, the B-MAX. The B-MAX is a small multi-utility vehicle in a segment that's declining and we're going to be discontinuing that. That's going to be replaced by the EcoSport to be built in the Craiova plant, which is going to be much higher volume and it's exactly what consumers want. It's a very big growing segment. So we're going to do that type of activity right across the portfolio everywhere in the world in response to what consumers want and our desire to get an appropriate return.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And, Brent, to add, you know the utility mix in the company is high. That continues and we're adding, of course, the Ranger and the Bronco coming. There is other ideas that are coming in that category. For those who wonder, are you worried about over time that as fuel, let's say, starts to shift again or there is a different conscience about utilities, that's why Ford's investment in these aluminum understructures was so prescient. That's why our ability to put hybrid and other kind of Powertrains is going to be really important. And so let's just make an investment in this category that's been very profitable for us and future proof it a little bit because of the way we're thinking about their performance over time.","Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press, Inc.","Is there any way you can speed up getting Ranger and Bronco to the market and EcoSport or is that schedule sort of baked in at this point?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, you've to come and help me twist arms. I'd take it as soon as I can. But the rigor of getting this done right, I think, is the thing I'll lean into. We got to do it the right way. So it's getting all the attention that it deserves to get here at the right price, right time kind of equation.","Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christiaan Hetzner with Automotive News.","Christiaan Hetzner - Automotive News","Yes. Many thanks for taking my question. I need just one to ask really quickly. What your views were about Europe in particular, in terms of the number of brands competing, the complexity in the market, the role of diesel, upcoming CO2 emissions targets and, of course, Brexit. How do you view the region? Is it something that over the long-term remains attractive for you? And, secondly, very quickly about the Fiesta launch. How important is the Brexit effect in that, given that that is the most important market \u2013 the most important car in that market for Ford? Thank you.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, let me start and then I'll give it to Bob to add precision, because this is something I think about a lot. I think, every \u2013 by the way, every CEO that competes in Europe in all industries have stepped back. The industry that I was in before this had similar kinds of challenge to compete there. What's top of mind for me is how strong the Ford brand is there. So when you witness other things that have happened in our industry, the Ford brand is highly regarded. I've learned the Mustang, for example, I think, last year, Joe was number one sales in Europe, I mean \u2013 and that was a decision by us to take that to market and look how well it did.","So, there is reinforcement over and over again. Jim Farley, who just came to head up all the markets for us, was just in-charge of that for the last three years. And we're able to make that profitable. And we can \u2013 now Brexit was a twist in that. I don't think any of us saw that I mean, if you were thinking of predictive kind of exercises, the kind of things we're going right now. We did not sit as a management team and say, hey, Brexit's going to happen and therefore your footprint's going to be under pressure.","But we're business people. So, we're accepting that and we're deliberately now thinking about how to play to win there. But I want you to know, we're in Europe. I mean, Ford can be really successful there. We've got great response to the Fiesta. I'll let Bob tell you about that. And so, I'm bullish on it, but that we've got to address the issues that come from Brexit. And the mobility play, as it had all this promise, and it means lots of things to different people has a real attraction in Europe. There's some things there that we see them as early adopters of that we're trying to leverage. So, I want to leave the message that Europe is a place we're going to be.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","So, the only thing I would add is that we do see opportunity for the Fiesta as I touched on earlier. It's our highest volume product. It's the fabulous product that we're bringing to the market. And clearly, it's going to give us an opportunity in 2018 and in the latter part of this year. I think a couple of other points to think about, I mean PSA and even our own performance has demonstrated that one can make profits in Europe, now what we have to do is make better returns in Europe and certainly we're very focused on that, although to be frank, probably the type of return that you get in Europe, won't be what it is in the United States because of the structure of the market and competitiveness, the products and so forth. But we do believe that we can get an appropriate return in Europe. The other point I would make is around Russia. There is Europe and there is Russia, and Russia clearly, we believe has the opportunity to first grow, to potentially be the largest individual market within Europe but also to give us very good returns. Although recognizing that will be more cyclical than probably the underlying European business itself. So we still feel a lot of excitement about Europe. We're very committed to Europe. We think we can get the appropriate returns in Europe. We are all in and we are working to improve the business in response to the curveball that Jim just mentioned around Brexit.","Christiaan Hetzner - Automotive News","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DeBord with Business Insider.","Matthew DeBord - Business Insider","Good morning. Two quick questions for Jim. First is Jim, if you could just give us possibly a specific example the Ford product in which you're applying some of the systemic design thinking that you spoke of earlier in the call?","And then second question is about Silicon Valley, if you think Silicon Valley is in trouble, as far as the transportation and mobility initiatives go and might need victory at this point, might need the traditional car business to show it the way to bring some kind of value monetize some of these opportunities?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes. And, Matthew, let me take the first one first. The AV is a perfect candidate for the techniques that you hear me talk about and for all kinds of reasons, just a highlight for you because we can look back with perfect hindsight and say, who were the leaders in the computer industry Commodore, Atari, Digital, at the time when I was young and PCs were starting to come out, IBM came later. And all four of them weren't going to win and most of what the history will show us was the use evolution of the science happened too late. So I'm trying to bring the discipline that says this technology is coming really fast and we've got to make it people centered very early if in our way of winning, so.","So let's use that, the leverage of that is as I look at your second question, I don't \u2013 I would never -- it would be arrogant for me to say the valley is in trouble in any kind of regard, kind of work that's created out there and value for shareholders. But I think you've heard me say a few times, I don't think we have to cede the future of the transportation to them, in ways that Ford isn't here. I just don't believe that. And I've been saying this in meetings I have had with analyst and press that they may need us more than we need them, because the export of software is not as difficult as the export of the vehicle constructs that we've learned.","These vehicles have to protect people, save lives and have to perform in extreme conditions. And so, that stuff, we have a lot of awareness about. The concern that anyone would have is we, are we, were we asleep at the switch that we didn't understand them coming; of course, we do. In fact, there is Ford people that have been recruited into some of those businesses. So I'd like the \u2013 I'd like the challenge of trying to prove to everybody that this technique I'm talking about our capabilities married together, make us a really good player in the future.","Matthew DeBord - Business Insider","All right. Sure. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Jim Hackett for closing remarks.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Jason. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's first quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO, and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are: Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President, Global Operations, Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets: and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit.","Jim will begin with a brief review of the quarter, and then cover a review of our strategy and updated financial targets.

Company EBIT and EPS are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.","Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Lynn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us.","Our goal today is to provide an update on fitness, share with you our strategic approach to creating value, and detail our updated performance targets. I said last October that the transformation of Ford had to start with getting the business fit. In fact, this preceded the ever-important strategic questions. We are improving our speed, decision-making, and execution. And today, we're ready to dimension this for you.","I'm really proud of the work of our team and even more excited about the value we believe these actions will create for our stakeholders. Simply put, the items I want to detail for you are at the center of our value creation efforts.","One, through our fitness and strategy work, we have gained clarity on where we need to focus. And this includes answering questions on what do we do with the businesses not earning their cost of capital and identifying which underlying processes need to be modernized.","Two, we have also gained clarity on our vehicle portfolio and where we want to play. And in parallel, we'll leverage a suite of propulsion systems. Think of these as the internal combustion system, hybrids, and battery electric vehicles, to give customers what they want regardless of fuel prices.","And three, I'm also pleased to share that our work to support our vision for smart vehicles in a smart world is starting to gel and showing the potential to create long-term value. I will share more today on this emergent work.","Okay, next I would like to briefly review our first quarter results, so please turn to page 2. And looking at the quarter, we delivered a solid company EBIT and year-over-year improvement in company operating cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with $38 billion in liquidity.","We also made several important acquisitions. We purchased Autonomic, which is already leading development of our transportation mobility cloud. And we acquired TransLoc, a provider of transit system software for cities. Both acquisitions are critical to advancing our mobility strategy. In the quarter, we also strengthened our collaboration with Mahindra Group, and we're working to jointly develop new SUVs and electric vehicles for customers in India and emerging markets.","And in this quarter, we've also been building momentum from a product perspective. We made investments in manufacturing to meet the surging demand in North America for our new Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition. These trucks are selling extremely well. We also introduced the EcoSport in the fast-growing sub-compact SUV segment. We reinforced our leadership in trucks and SUVs with the launch of the first-ever Ranger Raptor in Asia Pacific. This is a high-performance pickup unique to just Ford Motor Company.","We established our first proving ground for our autonomous vehicle business. This is through a collaboration with Miami-Dade County in Florida and partners such as Domino's and Postmates. With them, we launched a series of pilot programs to build a business that moves goods efficiently and profitably in those congested urban areas. I'm proud to tell you that we're on track together with Argo AI to deliver a commercial-grade self-driving vehicle at scale in 2021 for the movement of people and the movement of goods.","And finally, in the UK, we expanded our footprint in mobility and launched our Chariot commuter shuttle services in London. This marks Chariot's first expansion outside the U.S.","We'll now please turn to page 3, and let's dive into the highlights of our fitness and its impact on our overall business. Over our plan period, which covers 2019 through 2022, we're telling you today that we've identified $11.5 billion of cumulative cost and efficiency opportunities. This is incremental to the $14 billion in reduced material and engineering costs we outlined last October. We've also identified opportunities to reduce the capital intensity of our business model by a cumulative $5 billion over that same timeframe in 2019 through 2022.","By applying just the results of our fitness review over our plan period, we have some great news. We now expect our EBIT margin and our return on invested capital to bottom out this year in 2018. We also expect to meet our 8% EBIT target in 2020. This is a full two years earlier than our previous target of 2022. And we're going to achieve a return on invested capital in the high teens now by 2020.","This reduction in capital intensity means that we now expect our annual CapEx spend to peak this year at $7.5 billion and then decline. By 2022, we expect to deliver balanced CapEx spend and depreciation and amortization. They'll be aligned with each other. These targets do assume continued healthy economic conditions. Now, if there is a down cycle, we believe a more fit Ford will drive a more resilient business model.","Okay, turn to slide 4. Following the work of the past 11 months, we can now give you a more clear view of how we plan to improve our returns. We believe this reflects a profound refocus of our business. In this chart, we used our actual 2017 EBIT results to plot the parts of our business based on margins and return, so let me take your eyes to the green bubble in the northeast corner. This represents the areas of our business that deliver 8%-plus EBIT and 10%-plus ROIC. This part of our business alone generates $14 billion of profit, an operating margin of 16%, and a return on invested capital of 40%. This is a tremendous business, and we have a lot to work with in this category.","Now, if you apply even modest valuation assumptions to this portion of our business, there's about a 50% upside to our current stock price. However, three parts of our business dilute our overall returns. The yellow bubble reflects marginally profitable areas that don't return the cost of capital. They're lower margin and they don't return the cost of capital. The low-performing areas that have neither the right margin or the returns are shown on the bottom left in the red. And investments we're making in the new products for future growth are depicted by the gray circle in the middle. They're just getting started.","So here's the key point. We're going to feed the healthy part of our business and deal decisively with the areas that destroy value, where we can raise the returns of certain underperforming parts of our business via the fitness initiative you hear us talk about or an alternative business model, we will, and then we'll disposition the rest.","Okay, turn to page 5, and I want to take a deeper look now at fitness. As I mentioned, we identified $11.5 billion of cost and efficiency opportunities that will drive improved EBIT margin, and we expect to capture about one-third of this by 2020.","There are some good examples of where this will come from. In marketing and sales, we've identified three key areas. On the fixed marketing side, we can better improve our digital capabilities and improve our return on investment on media. In addition, via regionalization and personalization, we can better optimize our yield management in our incentives program.","Within engineering, we're moving to five flexible architectures that underpin our vehicles, with a modular catalog strategy covering 70% of the value of the vehicle. These changes will reduce the time from sketch to production by 20% and deliver significant new cost savings. Also, it will contribute to complexity reduction in orderable configurations. This will deliver savings throughout the enterprise, from the supply base to manufacturing and to our dealers.","In manufacturing, we're redesigning our freight network using big data, and we developed much more aggressive labor targets for our next-generation vehicles.","If you will, turn to page 6. Our fitness work has also allowed us to reduce the capital intensity of our business by $5 billion over our plan horizon, 2019 to 2022. We had expected to invest $34 billion, and that's now dropped to $29 billion. For example, we've identified opportunities to drive capital reduction through reuse of equipment and tools in our plants as well as additional benefits from the move to the common modules that I mentioned earlier.","To put this all together, I want to share with you the framework on page 7 that we're using to drive a more competitive, higher return, and resilient business. Our industry is undergoing a complete redesign of what we think of as the historic transportation system and the role of automakers and everyone else in that system. This redesign will reshape how our customers live, work, and move, how business is transacted, how cities are managed, how urban congestion and pollution are controlled. At Ford, we want to do more than compete in this new world. We intend to lead its design.","Enabling human progress through freedom of movement has always been central to our mission, and it's the reason we have been successful for 115 years. We'll remain true to our heritage as we transform our business model to capitalize on the trends I just described: by making smart choices; by building smart vehicles that integrate the best technology; and by providing customers with the most trusted mobility platform and services in the industry. We are on an incredibly exciting journey to redefine the automotive industry. And as we said, it starts with making these smart choices.","One of those is our first choice to have a winning portfolio. As I mentioned, we will focus on products and markets where we know we can win. Let me share a specific example. By 2020, almost 90% of our Ford portfolio in North America will be trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles, including, of course, their electrified versions. Given declining customer demand and product profitability, we will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America. Over the next few years, our Ford car portfolio in North America will transition to two vehicles, our best-selling Mustang and an exciting all-new Focus Active crossover coming out next year.","A second choice is a full commitment to new propulsion, including adding hybrid electrics to high-volume profitable vehicles like the F-150, the Mustang, the Explorer, and the new Bronco. Our battery electric vehicle rollout starts in 2020 with a performance utility, and we will have 16 battery electric vehicles by 2022. In our endeavor to make electric vehicles more desirable, we'll deliver vehicles with the capability, performance, and interior design that customers need and want, without the traditional fuel economy penalty they used to see.","Our third choice is autonomous technology. We're going to develop a profitable autonomous vehicle service that offers the most trusted and human-centered ride-hailing and goods delivery experience. Our partners at Argo AI have assembled an incredible collection of talent and expertise. I can't really exaggerate that. This is a great group of people, and we're working hand in hand with them to build a great AV business model.","Our final choice is the mobility experience. This is about creating and scaling our mobility platform and services that will drive a new what we're calling sticky revenue and profit streams for us. We see ourselves not just as a provider of mobile solutions, but also as an orchestrator of digital connections, from vehicle to street to business to home. That's going to be an exciting proposition.","It's all enabled by fitness, as I said. We're starting here and talking about four components. The first is the improved operating leverage. The second is the adaptive business model, as evidenced by our Mahindra agreements. That's plural. There's more than one, be it build, partner, or buy to generate the highest returns. And the third is improved capital efficiency. The fourth is our bedrock, a strong balance sheet. We work hard to maintain that.","So before I turn it over to Bob, I want to emphasize so there's no question. We're committed to taking the appropriate actions to drive profitable growth and maximize the returns of our business over the long term. We do have a bias towards urgent action. We aren't just exploring partnerships. We've now done them. We aren't just talking about ideas, but we've made decisions.","We're going to host an analyst meeting in New York in September, where we'll walk you through more details on our strategy. September 26 is when we're scheduling that. In the coming months, though, you'll see more announcements about the specific actions we're taking to transform Ford.","So let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Shanks. Bob?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.","I don't plan today to talk to specific slides. Instead, I'm going to share some details of our first quarter results and our perspective on them, talk to our company guidance for the full year, and provide additional texture on selected elements of the business that are consistent with our full-year outlook.","As Jim mentioned, first quarter results were solid. They were in line with our expectations and consistent with our outlook for the full year. Company revenue at $42 billion was up 7%, driven by higher volume from consolidated operations, favorable exchange-related effects, and higher net pricing. Revenue was up across all parts of the business except Middle East and Africa, where it was flat, with Europe delivering the greatest increase. And this was due to exchange and higher pricing on new products and to recover Brexit-related effects, with incentives folding flat year over year.","Wholesale volumes at 1.7 million units were up (sic) [down] 2%, driven by lower volume at our unconsolidated China joint ventures. Volumes at consolidated operations were up about 3%. Industry SAARs were up globally and in each region, with the largest growth coming from Asia-Pacific, and that was mainly China. Ford's global market share was 6.5%. That was down 60 basis points year over year, with declines in each region. This reflects mainly lower market shares in China, the U.S., and the UK.","Company EBIT was $2.2 billion, down $335 million from last year. This was driven by Automotive, which delivered an EBIT of $1.7 billion, down $443 million. Now Automotive's lower EBIT was caused by commodity cost increases of about $480 million, along with adverse exchange effects of about $240 million. These effects were offset partially by higher net pricing, particularly in Europe, and higher volumes and favorable stock changes in North America. The North America stock changes reflect pipeline fill for the newly launched EcoSport and a stock build for Focus. The Focus build is to support sales after production concludes at Michigan assembly, as we begin the transition of the facility for production of Ranger.","Importantly, total cost excluding commodities was about flat compared to last year. The increase in commodity cost was largely metals-driven, in part by the market's reaction to potential increases in U.S. tariffs. Nearly one-half of our full-year exposure to commodity price changes is locked in as of quarter end due to fixed contracts for hedges that we have in place.","In Automotive, North America was the largest EBIT contributor, earning $1.9 billion, down $195 million. EBIT margin was 7.8%, which was down 1.1 points. The year-over-year declines were more than explained by higher commodity costs. Market factors, the combination of volume, mix, and net pricing, were positive, and total cost was flat excluding commodities. For the full year, we're guiding to lower EBIT in North America due to higher commodity cost and higher spending-related expense to support growth.","We are committed to returning North America EBIT margin to the 10% level it achieved on average from 2012 to 2016 through fitness and making smart choices to play where we can win. In addition to reallocating capital to strengthen our SUV and truck portfolio, as Jim described, 51% of North America's portfolio on a volume-weighted basis will be new or significantly refreshed from the beginning of last year through 2019. The benefits of fitness actions will start to lift margins in North America next year.","Outside North America in the Automotive segment, results were a combined loss of $203 million, with each region incurring a loss except Europe. The combined loss was $248 million worse than a year ago, more than explained by Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific's loss of $119 million was driven by a loss in Ford China. While we earned China equity income of $138 million, this was more than offset by engineering costs incurred by Ford for future products, including for newly localized entries, including Lincoln and next-generation Explorer, as well as a loss for Lincoln as we continue to establish and grow the brand and the network.","The China loss was offset partially by a profit in the rest of Asia-Pacific. This includes a substantial improvement in India, although it still incurred a small loss. This improvement, of course, was achieved without the benefit we expect to see in the future from collaborating with Mahindra. We also benefited in the quarter from record first quarter sales in the Asia-Pacific markets outside of China.","We expect to incur a loss in Asia-Pacific again in the second quarter, with profits returning in the second half as we begin to launch 16 new products. For the full year, EBIT will be lower, driven by our first half performance, with the run rate of the business strengthening through the fourth quarter.","Now, as we announced in December, an aggressive product growth plan gets underway in Asia-Pacific later this year with the new Escort and the all-new Focus, resulting in 69% of the region's volume being all new or significantly refreshed from the beginning of 2017 through 2019. This is part of our announced plan to bring 50 new vehicles to China by 2025, including eight all-new SUVs and at least 15 electrified vehicles from Ford and Lincoln. In addition, of course, the new Zotye Ford JV will launch an all-new range of affordable all-electric vehicles.","Now turning to Europe, we earned an EBIT of $119 million, which was $90 million lower than a year ago. We delivered strong net pricing increases in the quarter, but this was more than offset by lower volume and unfavorable mix, adverse exchange due to sterling, and higher commodity cost. The adverse volume and mix were due mainly to a weaker industry and lower Ford market share in the UK as well as lower demand for diesel passenger vehicle derivatives in the region. For the full year, we expect EBIT in Europe to improve from 2017 levels due to a heavy mix of new products, which should drive strongly higher net pricing. From the end of last year through 2019, Europe will benefit from an 88% volume-weighted mix of all new or significantly new products.","Now, at our Mobility segment, we incurred a loss of $102 million, which was driven by autonomous vehicle development cost. Results benefited from a one-time gain on investments in smart mobility of about $58 million. The quarterly loss was $38 million worse than last year, more than explained by increased investment in autonomy. Now, if you adjust for the one-time gain, the quarterly loss would have been $160 million. This would be a reasonably good quarterly run rate this year for the Mobility segment, with about half of the projected full-year loss due to investments in smart mobility, and the remainder for AV development.","Turning to Ford Credit, we saw a very strong quarter, with Ford Credit earning $641 million, $160 million higher than a year ago. The improvement was broad-based, including growth in receivables globally. In the quarter, Ford Credit's portfolio remained robust, with healthy U.S. consumer credit metrics, including an improved loss-to-receivables ratio. Auction values improved versus a year ago by about 1% at constant mix. We now expect full-year average auction values to decline just 1% to 2%.","At the end of the quarter, Ford Credit's managed leverage was 8.4, in line with our target of 8:1 to 9:1. For the foreseeable future, we plan to maintain Ford Credit's managed receivable levels at about the same level as at the end of the quarter. Our focus is to maintain a strong risk profile for Ford and Ford Credit, balancing receivables, funding requirements, liquidity, profitability, and distributions. This will allow us to continue supporting auto sales while preserving capacity for future Mobility initiatives. It also will enable relatively consistent distributions to Ford approximately equal to Ford Credit's annual net income.","For the full year, we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be flat to lower than last year as we continue to plan for lower financing margins due to rising interest rates. And while we expect auction values to trend better than our initial expectations, as I just noted, we do expect them to be down slightly year-over-year.","Now turning to the company's EBIT margin, we delivered 5.2%, which was down 1.2 percentage points from a year ago. And that reflected the performance in Asia Pacific, North America, and Europe. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.43. That was up $0.03, driven by a lower adjusted effective tax rate. The adjusted effective tax rate was 9%, which includes a $235 million benefit for capital loss carryforwards.","Net income was $1.7 billion, $144 million or 9% higher than a year ago, more than explained by a lower effective tax rate. Company operating cash flow came in at $3 billion, which was up $1 billion from a year ago due to higher distributions from Ford Credit.","Ford's balance sheet, as Jim mentioned, remains strong, with cash and marketable securities totaling $27.6 billion and ample liquidity of more than $38 billion.","Now looking at the full year, our company guidance reflects company revenue to be up modestly, company adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.70, company operating cash flow to be positive and about the same as a year ago, pension contributions of about $0.5 billion, capital spending of about $7.5 billion, and an adjusted effective tax rate of about 15%. As Jim mentioned, we expect 2018 to be the trough for company EBIT, EBIT margin, and ROIC, and the peak for capital spending.","So, with that, let's now turn it back to the operator who will get us started on our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And your first question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, everybody. Hey, Jim, first question is a Ford question. You made reference to potential disposition of underperforming businesses. Could this potentially entail exiting a geographic region?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, the short answer is we'll restructure as necessary and we'll be decisive. The decisions have lots of implications for stakeholders, so we're not ready to talk specifics at this time.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, but it sounds like it's on the table, all options on table.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, I want to affirm that.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Jim, my follow-up question is a bit more macro but relates to Ford indirectly. I'll let others ask about restructuring. What is your position, Jim, on raising the U.S. federal gas tax if the proceeds went to funding improvements in U.S. transport infrastructure?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","That's a creative idea. And the way I've been thinking about the transportation system in the future is that, if we cut and paste the old system as we do the kinds of things we're talking about to modernize our infrastructure, we're not going to make the progress that we really need to deal with the congestion and capacity issues in big cities. So we definitely have to in the future think about a model where we're using this cloud structure and these smart vehicles to improve that. I haven't really thought about how we fund that totally, but what we can see in the models that we're talking about with this cloud structure is there's revenue for cities in a model like that.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","And your next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, everybody.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Hi, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I wanted to also probe your comment about raising the profitability that you mentioned on slide 4. There were three buckets, the fitness improvements, alternatives, business models, and the dispositions. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the alternatives might be, when we might see those deals, how long it would take to get savings from those? And maybe \u2013 I know you're not really talking about whether these are regions or anything specific. But how big could these actions be? Are we talking about alternatives and dispositions for businesses that are a few billion in revenue, or are you reassessing tens of billions of revenue?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","I'm going to ask Bob to help with the way that we're planning this. But I would just want to I guess emphasize, Rod, that the way you think about these low performing businesses, it's been easy to identify what's wrong and what we need to do about it. And I think the hand-wringing may be that has been around in our business is gone. We're starting to understand what we need to do in making clear decisions there. So the detail in terms of the construction, I'm going to let Bob.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, let me start. The first thing I guess I'd want to focus on is actually the upper right. So I just want to reemphasize that the capital allocation process here is to generate incremental capital for the parts of business where we're already strong and we know we can be even stronger and more profitable, generating even higher returns. So that's the ultimate objective.","If you go to the lower left, Rod, the way I would think about \u2013 let me just give you some specific examples. The first thing I want to say is this is a snapshot in time, so it's not necessarily a view of the businesses over a longer period of time, and I'll give you a couple examples. So in there is most of the Lincoln brand. As you know, that only launched in China 2.5 years ago or so. It's grown dramatically. It has a great reputation. It's getting price points consistent with the Germans in the segments in which we compete. But we're importing everything, so of course \u2013 and we're growing the business from scratch.","So I've already mentioned to you that we're going to localize the first Lincoln product, but imagine the transformation of the business model, able to get out from underneath these 25% duties, the long freight journey that it takes over there and the expense and so forth, and how that can start to change how that business model looks.","The second example I'd give, we've talked about \u2013 within that category is also small cars and essentially most of our MTV (33:04) type products. So we've already talked about what we're going to do in North America, so that's pretty straightforward. That's just we're not going to invest where it doesn't make sense.","But a second example is the partnership with Mahindra. So is there a way in which we can participate, in this case India, where actually cars, although increasingly SUVs or crossovers, are a big part of the business, but do so in a way that builds on someone who's already very successful. Some of that may involve different segments because they're a really strong player in SUVs, but they're just really successful in general. As you heard us say, we're already improving. Imagine where we might be able to go through a deeper, closer partnership with Mahindra.","And then of course, there's always fitness. Fitness is going to raise all boats. Some areas of that category would benefit from that. So it's a combination of all those things, but everything going back to the earlier response that Jim gave, everything, every tool in our toolkit is on the table in terms of addressing that part of our business.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you elaborate on the timing on when you would expect to disclose some of these alternative plans or deals or dispositions? And maybe just as a follow-on, restructurings of structurally challenged businesses or plants and things like that could be pretty costly in this industry. At this point, do you see all of this being accomplished with the $28 billion of cash that you have, the cash flow? Any elaboration on, aside from just framing what the savings target is, what is this going to cost?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","To your first question, and I don't want to be trite. I don't intend to be at all, but Jim did mention, there are lots of ramifications and implications from the types of things that we ultimately will do in this range of options that we have. And so what we will do is we will share with you when we can the decisions that we've made, so you can understand in a progressive manner the progress that we're making in addressing that and moving the business forward.","In terms of restructuring, the first thing I would say is we do expect to continue to generate positive cash flow moving forward. So it may be pulling out as we restructure, if in fact, that's what we have to do at various points in time in various parts of the business, but it's coming in at the same time from the upper right, if you will. That's on this chart, so it's not a zero-sum game.","The other thing that I would expect is that addressing this will take \u2013 it's not as if it's all done tomorrow at one time. There will be some element of time. Just go back and look at the North American restructuring, which was the last really significant one. But even the one that we did in Europe in 2011, 2012, 2013, that was over a period of time. That's just the way it works out. So I think that we certainly want to move fast and will do so, but that's what it takes. So I think the element of time probably helps us there as well.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","But again, Rod, the confidence I'd like to get across tonight is decisions aren't in pause or dwell, so the planning is the work.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Langan of UBS.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Hello, Colin.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Hi, how are you? Just to follow up on the comments about cars and cutting the majority of cars in the U.S., just thinking about there in that red bubble on slide 5 where they're losing money today or any color on how large those losses are? And any color on how should we expect \u2013 are you going to close capacity? Do you expect to fill that void with all SUVs, any broad color there?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","So, Colin, let me have Jim Farley talk about the portfolio implications, and then Joe Hinrichs will talk about the industrial system that supports the same (37:19). Jim?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Sure, so thanks for the question. How we think about our lineup in North America especially is that we are developing incremental nameplates we don't have today and shifting the allocation of the capital portfolio to utility body styles, and there will be a variety, a growing variety, of those products.","To give you a flavor, we'll have more authentic off-roaders, building our Built Ford Tough background like Bronco and other new nameplates we don't sell today. We will refresh our entire lineup of traditional crossovers and SUVs that everyone knows, like Explorer and Escape. And then we're going to be introducing and taking capital and redeploying it for also new silhouettes, products that give customers the utility benefits without the penalty of fuel economy. And they will be performance and active executed, so they'll be very emotional.","So what you'll see is a whole portfolio of vehicles that will be much higher performing in terms of returns, much better for our brands, so a stronger business, and we will have a very diverse passenger car business. It just won't be traditional silhouetted sedans that tend to be commoditized.","Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.","So thanks, Jim. When you look at the manufacturing question, very quickly, we have a plan. We have a very high utilization rate in our North American manufacturing plants today, and we have a plan to utilize those plants and we have a product for Hermosillo to replace when the Fusion balances out. And as we've mentioned previously, the value electric SUV we're launching in 2020 also will be built in Mexico. So we have a really great plan with all the products that Jim talked about to leverage our manufacturing capacity moving forward.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it, and just last question. Your original guidance was $1.6 billion in commodity and FX, I think it was $700 million in Q1. Is it on pace, or did the steel tariffs unravel some of that, any broad color there if that's still the right number?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","I'm going to let Bob clear that up.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Based on where we are today, Colin, it looks like $1.5 billion year over year for the full year. So we had about $0.5 billion in the first quarter. So if you think about it on a year-over-year basis, progressively as we move forward, it starts to moderate a bit, which you might expect because we've now had two years \u2013 it will be two years of pretty sharp increases. So that's our outlook right now","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","So the tariffs and cost of steel price increase were incorporated in your original number?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","No, the tariffs are not assumed in the $1.5 billion. We'll have to wait and see if that happens. But we do believe that in the case of steel that it has essentially already been priced in by the market.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's not bad. Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Hello, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question. Hi. Maybe just another one on where you selectively compete. Clearly you made a strategic bet on Russia, or rather stuck with Russia when it was going through a very rough patch due to its long-term potential. Obviously, markets like China, nobody's going to question, given the tremendous long-term potential. And India I think falls in that the category. And thinking about South America, how do you assess the current tradeoff there in terms of the losses you're currently making relative to \u2013 or maybe even the losses that you could make at this point in the cycle after implementing various different fitness initiatives? How do you weigh that against your assessment of that region's long-term automotive potential?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","I just want to, Ryan, make sure you know. Russia has been good for us. We actually \u2013 things have improved there. I don't want it to be left that we're stuck there. I think it's been aware to play, and I'm happy with that. I think I'm going to let Jim talk about the balance of the question around South America.","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","So if you think of our business units, North America's story is all about returning to 10%. And China's story, as you said, is all about growth. We have all these great new products. South America and Europe are improving businesses, but we are looking at our strategic plan. And so what I think is important to say at this point for South America is we have made very significant and promising progress on our strategic plan there. And we're approaching the task with the highest sense of urgency. We have a lot of teams deployed, and they're working on a comprehensive review of the business. Obviously, we have a lot of stakeholders. So we'll have more to share, more details to share at a later date. Our business is improving. We're launching new products. In fact, Cama\u00e7ari is totally maxed out right now. But we think we know that much further, more fundamental actions are required in South America.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, that's very helpful, and then just a last question for me. Can you maybe give a couple-year walk in Asia-Pacific? Obviously, we can dissect it from your slide deck. But what has been the primary contributing factor to the softer earnings there? Relative to I think 4Q a few years ago \u2013 and there's a one-timer in there \u2013 you made over $400 million. You made nearly $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Maybe just how much of it do you see as cyclical or temporal in nature that you see a light at the end of the tunnel? For example, you're launching a lot of new products, versus is there something else, something you feel like you need to target the higher end of the market or more selectively target? Or you tell me, how do you turn that region around?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","I'm going to let Bob give you some of the detail. I think you got near it toward the end of your question when you think of the age of the product. There's a whole refresh that's starting in China. But, Bob, why don't you fill in?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","And then maybe if Jim has something to add afterwards. So if you go back and look at what happened, I want to start first with outside of China, because we were very challenged outside China. If you go back two or three years ago, we've seen a complete turnaround of that business through a lot of work and effort. So that is a positive story.","What we've seen is weakness inside China, and I think it's around a number of different things. One is the strength of the indigenous brands certainly had an impact I think on most players in the market as they became more mature, more developed and offered a tremendous number of new products that are very attractive.","We obviously were not able to keep our portfolio as fresh as it needed to be in that environment. We also saw a downward negative pricing in part \u2013 in fact, in large part, driven by the indigenous brands coming up, and that certainly affected the portfolio. We had a lot of cost reductions that we achieved in our China JVs to offset a portion of that. But then incrementally, what we saw when the Chinese government revised its policy on the renminbi, it has over time depreciated versus an appreciation trend that it had been on. And that had an impact on the business particularly given the imported elements as well as just the fact we have a very high net revenue exposure to the business.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Jim, you might talk about what's coming in China with the new vehicles. I think that's worth highlighting.","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","So where we are right now in the first half of this year, we're at the absolute trough of our product cycle in China. And over the next 24 months, we completely revitalized the lineup. As I said, it's a growth story. And it's not just all products. It's very specific products, especially utilities. In fact, today at the Beijing Auto Show, we showed the new Escort and also our brand-new Focus, which is a really high-volume product. But we're going to fill in the entire lineup of SUVs on the higher end from there. So we're really excited about the opportunity that that new launches gives us. We're also localizing Lincoln, which is a really important part of our \u2013 as well Explorer, a really important part of leveraging our profitability improvement.","I also want to highlight, though, that the fitness exercises are very live for our China team. Today we launched the National Distribution Service division. That's a really important thing. We have a complex business with imported products, different divisions, and different manufacturers there. We've now gone to one company to market, distribute all of that product. It's going to be a lot more efficient, a lot more effective. And we also named our leaders for that business today, which are really experienced local team members.","So I think even how we go to market is going to be more efficient and much more sophisticated with this all-new lineup. And of course, we have Zotye (46:50) right around the corner. That's a big bet for us to compete in the very value-priced BEV business, which no doubt China will be the largest electrified market in the world. So I think we're really well positioned over the next couple of years for growth and profit improvement in China.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful color, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening, guys, just a first question for you, Jim. As you're going through this process of reassessing the business, and it seems like you're coming to a formulation on your thought process here. As you think about scale in the business, there seems like there's a shift in the way we all have thought about this traditionally, and some folks are backing away from pure economies of scale in their thought process in the way of thinking about structuring their businesses. Both theoretically and practically, how do you think about it as you're assessing the business? There's a lot of things that are tricky on transfer pricing that it's difficult to allocate cost correctly. So it's both a theoretical and practical exercise that's difficult to figure out. So how are you thinking about that? And is 6.5 million units something, plus or minus, you need to stick to, or could you go a lot smaller?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, let me start with the theoretical position that you asked about. So the way I think about it, the way we are thinking about it, our whole team, is that, to be a global company, you've got to have platform advantages, otherwise you don't get any scale. And so we do see platforms in the future still continuing.","I think probably as we're updating our thinking about One Ford, we realize that the parallel interest and emphasis that I'm bringing about user-centered insights is that we can add to these platforms in regions region-specific characteristics of vehicles. And just that little nuance can make a big difference in the way you achieve scale, but you get share. And if we were just exporting purely vehicles that were made for North America all around the world, I'm not sure that we would be confident in that as the go-forward strategy. The good news about that is we don't disappoint any customers with a move like that. We just have to prove that we're great at building platforms that can have scale.","I think the second part of it is that, if that doesn't happen, then we've got to make the decisions that you're inferring we have to make. And so that's what I meant by we're not hammering about that. We really tell ourselves what we have to believe is that we're going to get our cost of capital out to continue.","The third thing is that the nature of the technology and the role that it's playing clearly in the Western markets, in Europe and North America, is going to be important, as important \u2013 more important than China based on what my visits have exposed. Their desire to have electrification is well published, but their commitment to autonomy is going to be huge. And the reason is, as you've heard me talk often about this, is the only way we can get these cities in shape is to have the system be much more choreographed to work together. It's not just the random person in a vehicle driving at any time of day expecting no friction in the way they're getting around or goods being delivered in the center of London where the commercial vehicle only has 10% of the cube being used in the truck. This is all taking up space and reducing the problem. So the technology is going to help us. I believe that there's scale in that kind of thinking as well. It's a difficult thing to design that to work, and I think Ford's going to be able to do that.","Let me point out, by the way, that we're one of the very few companies that actually have the autonomous team and the vehicles teams working in tandem. There are a lot of suppliers for autonomy out there and there are a lot of OEMs, but we're only one of a handful of companies that are actually doing the work together, which we think's going to be an advantage.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful, and maybe a more near-term practical question. Raws sound like they're becoming a bigger issue. There's some inflation. Who knows what's going to exactly happen with tariffs and inflation in the future? But is there any possibility that you share more of this with suppliers? Prior to the downturn, the majority of raws were on the balance sheet or on in the purview of the suppliers, and you guys took them on in the downturn. So is there any way to maybe shift the balance of power back on raws, maybe hold on to steel, but give everything else back to the suppliers?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Let me just \u2013 we ought to make the comment about the tariffs and the structure, which is that I've been able to talk to people, let's just say, in the world that are in leadership positions in government and say that what we crave as business people are certainty and equilibrium. So trade can thrive in a world where that's not in question. And so we have, like everyone, we're dealing with the sudden news, and I think we've done a great job internally of dealing with that.","But let me also take you to \u2013 we're not going to be victims in this kind of thing. So what we're doing with building this modular architecture that underpins the vehicles helps us in addition to the last question about scale and the implications that you just asked about with suppliers. But let me ask Joe to comment on the history. I wasn't here in terms of what happened in the past and what might happen in the future. Joe?","Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, Jim, thanks. First of all, over time, as Bob has highlighted on a number of calls, our raw material costs follow the curves in the market, so we have some ups and downs based on where we are in the cycle. But as you know, we negotiate our steel contracts on a quarterly basis. We spread them out so we can average things out and don't have so much risk.","As far as the supply base goes, they're Tier 2s et cetera. Most of the time, they're bearing that risk. And there are occasions where we will direct-source and will be a part of the Tier 2 sourcing of raw materials. But there is some, obviously, some of the risk and reward that goes in the supply base. I'd just remind everybody that we've gotten a good balance of the upside when the commodity markets were going the other direction. So I don't see us changing our strategy dramatically with the supply base. When it comes to raw materials, we both manage the risk and reward together.","But as Jim was saying, when you look at the architecture strategy and the lessons that we've learned on One Ford and the way Jim described it, there's value globally in using flexible architectures, and we've talked about our five that we're going to use. Where we've learned is really the modules within the vehicle need flexibility to be able to offer differentiation for the regional markets. And scale of the supply base occurs on the scale of the manufacturing plant locally, not on a global basis. So for example, if you have a corner module, the demand, the costs, and attributes may be different in China than they are in the U.S., but it may be the same vehicle architecture, but the module that we're going to use may be different for Asia than it is for the United States. Whereas in the past, a lot of our global platform vehicles were global across their modules as well as the platform architecture.","So that's a very important nuance. Maybe it's not a nuance, but it's a very important part of our new strategy, which is to offer a catalog of modules for each of the regions to pick from for their vehicles, but still take advantage of the five core architectures that we'll use globally. So we can get the advantage of the engineering skill, the platform level, and take advantage of the local scale from the supply base and the country-specific attributes in the region.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just real quick on Ford Motor Credit, the flattening out of the managed receivables, does that mean that you guys are really looking at just generating cash flow out of Ford Motor Credit and keeping their earnings relatively consistent and flat with where they are right now, or is there something else going on?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","We're really happy with the Credit performance. Bob, you might talk about the capital structure.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","It's not an issue with Ford Credit at all. It's extraordinarily healthy and does what it does at the highest level, as J.D. Power has indicated. It's really more around managing the overall risk profile for Ford because as Ford Credit has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger, it does, even though it itself is in fantastic shape, just the nature of the business is that it represents a higher level of risk to Ford. So we want to better manage that. So that's the reason primarily that we're going to cap them at least for the foreseeable future.","The benefit, and certainly that wasn't the driver, the benefit of doing that is they don't have to take the profits, the cash they generate, and then reinvest in its own growth. So as a result of that, they're able to take the profitability and the cash it generates and return it back to Ford. It certainly helps us. We also have a mind towards making sure that we do set some capacity aside at Ford Credit to support the role that it might have in the world in terms of mobility opportunities. So that's another factor that's behind that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question for the evening comes from David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Hi, David.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, how are you doing this evening?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Good.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Wonderful, just a follow-up question on the modular architectures and platforms that you're talking about. Is this very similar to what VW and ultimately GM have gone down the path of? Because if I'm not mistaken, there was some significant CapEx spend in development ahead of those platforms. So I just want to marry that up with maybe net incremental savings that you're looking at over this 2019-2022 period and how much of that CapEx and spend has already been baked in through 2017 and your 2018 spend.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yes, let me sneak this in before I hand it to Joe, David, is that \u2013 and we'll directly get at that, is the thing that I \u2013 where I came from, the way I was raised is the nature of interpreting these customer demands and important user insights and the translating of that is what started to differentiate the world-class companies from those that were just trying to get more cost efficiency. The genius in this is using these architectures and giving customers exactly what they want in special ways. So I want to make sure as you're looking for this financial information that it doesn't get stated that we're running to one end of the spectrum here. The balance here is really important. But, Joe, do you want to address?","Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.","Sure. Thanks, David. First off, as what we started with, we see savings coming from this initiative over the next several years and significant savings, both in the engineering spend, but also in, as was highlighted, the capital expenditures related to that. Importantly, that time reduction is not just about money, but it's also getting to market faster. One of the learnings that we have in looking back over the last several years is Jim Farley and the Markets teams have great ideas for products, and we need to be able to bring those to market faster. So a very important part of this architecture and modular strategy is to be able to execute programs more quickly.","So are there lessons learned from our competitors? Sure, we do benchmarking all the time, and we have learned things from our competitors. But this is a unique solution for Ford, but you will see common elements across the industry because we all learn from each other and we do a lot of analysis of each other. But I want to highlight, this time element is very important. If you think of the discussions we've had around the portfolio age in the United States and China, for example, we can help avoid those situations, those curves of hills, if you will, and valleys, by being able to execute prior programs more quickly and by reducing the cost, so therefore we can afford to do more. And that is a big part of the benefit of this initiative.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. As if I could just follow up on one more thing, as you think about the long-term strategy here, and you obviously had some announcements for China today in going into a one-distribution channel, how do you think your relationships with your JV partners could change over time, given the more relaxed stance to JV ownership trends that at least the regulators in China are opening up at this point?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks for that question. Jim?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Sure. We have our two JV partners. We're entering a third now. We're looking for approval for Zotye. We don't see yet. It's early days, but we have don't see those clanging. They're very important. We have a huge job to do to grow the business and improve our profitability in China. And we will absolutely drive change in that business, but we don't see a fundamental change in our JV structure.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then finally, because you are launching all this new product in China, I'm just curious. What type of new technologies are being adopted and placed into those vehicles that's going to compete with some of the local brands that have very quickly put in incremental ADAS features and have really accelerated their product timelines to almost refreshing a new vehicle every year in order to capture incremental market share?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","That's a terrific question. So all of our China products will be connected. It's a very important part of our strategy as a company, and there's no place more important than China. We also are working with Alibaba on connectivity and in-car experience. It would be good to get Marcy's input as well. But I think we're really learning from that customer base world leadership in infotainment.","And I think the last thing I want to mention is we've made a commitment companywide, including China, and I think it's very important for our China strategy, for Co-Pilot 360. It's a whole \u2013 I think absolutely the most comprehensive ADAS assisted driving suite in the business. And that is going to be a big part of our technology story in China.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Marcy, do you want to add something about the connectivity and the potential? I guess let's think of China broadly.","Marcy Klevorn - Ford Motor Co.","Sure. So we're actively talking to partners in China. Actually, my team and myself are going out next week. Stay tuned to hear more about some potential things that will happen there. And we are working closely with Jim and Joe's team on the in-vehicle experience and making sure we understand the local needs so we can deliver the best services possible and also working to launch our transportation mobility cloud in China as well. So we've got a lot going on, and it will all come together soon.","Operator","Thank you, and that concludes today's Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Hackett.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, everyone. I want to just summarize a couple things just to remind you that in Ford's cadence, we picked this time in the fall to have a meeting with our investors. That's not a target for some restructuring or something like that. It's just the way we plan our calendar to come back to you. And we give you more detail then. It's going to be an exciting meeting.","I also want you to know that, as we've said, we're committed to taking appropriate and decisive action to drive profitable growth. We need to maximize the returns of our business over the long term. We're going to be fit across the entire business. I can't understate how well this has been going as we've launched this. We've identified significant cost and efficiency opportunities, as well as you're hearing the opportunity to reduce capital intensity in our business. The cycle that we're launching we didn't want to disrupt. So it's really all the things that are happening after the launches over the next year that were able to start having an impact. And we're allocating capital to our high-performing business. And we're committed, as we've stated to Rob's question, to either fix or disposition the rest.","And finally, we have a great team. I'm really happy. They're energized. They're acting with this sense of urgency and commitment. We're working really well together. And just to state it simply, we're excited about the future here at Ford Motor Company. So thanks for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call.

Thank you.","George Sharp","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I'd like to thank you for spending time with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our first quarter financial results. Presenting today are Alan Mulally, our President and CEO of Ford; and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also in attendance are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Now before we begin, I'd like to cover a few items. Copies of today's press release and the presentation slides that we will be using have been posted on Ford's investor and media website for your reference. The financial results discussed today are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our form 10-Q that will be filed next month. The financial results presented are on a GAAP basis and in some cases, on a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.","Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance.

Mulally","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our first quarter business performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our plans.","Let's start by turning to Slide 3. For the first quarter of 2012, we delivered our 11th consecutive quarterly pretax operating profit and generated positive Automotive operating-related cash flow, although wholesale volume and total company revenue were slightly lower than a year ago due to the results in Europe. Ford North America achieved its highest operating profit since at least 2000, and Ford Credit remains solidly profitable. South America was profitable as well, but Europe and Asia-Pacific and Africa incurred losses. Today, we are also reconfirming that the total company full year pretax operating profit is expected to be about the same as in 2011, and we are announcing new actions to further de-risk our pension obligations. And we have -- and as we have done consistently over the past few years, we continued in the quarter to invest for future growth and stronger product lineup around the world. As a result, we remain on track to achieve our mid-decade outlook.","Let's look more closely now to the financial highlights for the quarter. Slide 4 summarizes our first quarter business results compared with a year ago.","Wholesale volume was about 1.4 million units, down 45,000 units or 3% from a year ago. Revenue was about $32 billion, a decline of $700 million or about 2%. Pretax operating profit, excluding special items, was $2.3 billion, $544 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.39 per share, $0.08 lower than last year's earnings per share, adjusted for the tax valuation allowance release. Net income attributable to Ford, including the unfavorable pretax special items of $255 million, was $1.4 billion or $0.35 per share, a $1.2 billion decrease from a year ago. And about half of that decrease in net income reflects higher tax expense related to the valuation allowance released in the fourth quarter of 2011, with the balance explained by lower operating results and increased special charges.","Automotive operating-related cash flow was $900 million, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive performance. We ended the quarter with $23 billion of Automotive gross cash and with Automotive gross cash exceeding debt by $9.3 billion. This is a net cash improvement of $4.6 billion compared with a year ago.","Overall, we had a strong start to the year, reflecting the continued success of our ONE Ford plan.","There are a number of other business highlights in the quarter as shown on Slide 5. First, we continued our strong cadence of global new product introductions and concept reveals, starting with the EcoSport in India and Brazil, followed by the Fusion and the Lincoln MKZ Concept in the U.S. In Europe, we also introduced the B-MAX, the Fiesta ST, the Kuga and Tourneo Custom Concept. In March, our CFMA joint venture opened a second assembly plant in Chongqing, increasing our passenger car capacity in China by 1\/3. We delivered our 4 millionth SYNC system in the U.S. and announced that the new B-MAX will be the first product in Europe to offer SYNC.","We paid our first quarterly dividend since 2006 and also declared a dividend for the second quarter. We also took additional steps to improve our liquidity by completing an amendment, an extension of our revolving credit facility, resulting in $9 billion committed until November of 2015.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Bob Shanks, who will take us through more details of our financial results. Bob?","Robert L. Shanks","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone.","Let's start with Slide 7, which shows our financial results compared with a year ago. As Alan mentioned, pretax operating profit was $2.3 billion, and net income attributable to Ford was $1.4 billion. Pretax special items totaled a negative $255 million, $194 million worse than a year ago, reflecting primarily buyouts of hourly employees in the U.S. in line with the recent UAW agreement. As Alan noted, the increase in the provision for income taxes is more than explained by the effect of the release of our tax valuation allowance in 2011. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect our full year operating effective tax rate for 2012 to be similar to that in 2011.","Let's now turn on Slide 8 to our pretax results by sector. Total company first quarter pretax profit of $2.3 billion consisted of $1.8 billion for the Automotive sector and $456 million for the financial services sector. As shown in the memo, total company pretax operating profit was $544 million lower than last year, with both sectors contributing to the decline. Compared with fourth quarter 2011, total company pretax profit improved about $1.2 billion, more than explained by stronger Automotive results.","Slide 9 highlights the key market factors and financial metrics for our total Automotive business. First quarter wholesale volume, revenue and pretax operating profit decreased from last year. Operating margin was 6.4%, down 1.3 percentage points from a year ago, with the decrease attributed to our Automotive operations outside North America.","Slide 10 summarizes the decrease in total Automotive first quarter pretax profit from 2011 by causal factor. The decline of about $300 million reflects higher cost across our regions and unfavorable exchange. This is offset partially by higher net pricing and lower net interest expense. As shown in the memo, pretax profit improved about $1.2 billion compared with the fourth quarter, more than explained by a seasonal reduction in total cost. More details on the quarter-to-quarter change are included in Appendix 6.","Slide 11 shows first quarter pretax results for each of our Automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. As mentioned earlier, our Automotive pretax operating profit of $1.8 billion was led by North America. South America was also profitable, but Europe and Asia Pacific Africa incurred losses, generally in line with recent guidance, although Europe's loss is somewhat smaller than we had expected. The loss in Other Automotives mainly reflects net interest expense. It's $143 million better than a year ago, reflecting lower interest expense related to our 2011 debt-reduction actions and the non-recurrence of market valuation losses associated with our investment in Mazda. We expect full year net interest to be slightly higher than last year, reflecting primarily lower interest income.","Let's turn now on Slide 12 to our Automotive business in North America. First quarter wholesale volume and revenue were higher than a year ago, improving 6% and 4%, respectively. Pretax operating profit was the highest since at least 2000, when we started reflecting North America as a separate business unit. The last time we achieved a similar quarterly profit was first quarter 2004, when wholesale volume was over 1 million units, more than 50% higher than in this quarter. In addition, our volume at that time had a significantly higher mix of trucks.","Operating margin in the first quarter at 11.5% also was very strong and significantly higher than a year ago. U.S. industry SAAR increased from 13.4 million to 14.9 million units, but our U.S. total market share at 15.2% was lower than a year ago.","Slide 13 shows the $300 million improvement in first quarter North America pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The improvement is driven by favorable volume and mix, mainly U.S.; industry that was higher; higher net pricing; lower contribution cost; and lower compensation, which is reflected in Other. A partial offset is other costs, reflecting mainly higher structural costs. As shown in the memo, pretax profit improved by $1.2 billion over the fourth quarter, more than explained by a seasonal decline in costs. Unfavorable market factors, mainly lower wholesale volume, are partial offsets. We expect North America to achieve significantly higher full year pretax profit and operating margin compared with 2011, which will be the key enabler for the company to achieve about the same level of pretax profit this year as compared to last year.","Slide 14 shows our U.S. market share. U.S. total market share in the first quarter at 15.2% was 0.8 percentage point lower than the same period last year, explained primarily by lower share in the daily rental and government fleet segments. The share was down 1.1 percentage points from the fourth quarter primarily due to adverse market segmentation.","Our retail share of the U.S. retail industry estimated at 13.8% was up 0.4 point from a year ago, more than explained by share gains on Focus, Explorer and F-Series. Our share was down 0.5 point from fourth quarter, fully explained by adverse market segmentation.","Let's turn now to South America on Slide 15. Both first quarter wholesale volume and revenue increased by 4% from a year ago. On the other hand, pretax profit and operating margin both declined. South America industry SAAR was up marginally over last year, while our share at 9.4% was down 0.1 point.","Slide 16 shows the $156 million decrease in first quarter South America pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The lower profit is more than explained by higher cost, primarily contribution cost, and unfavorable exchange. Although net pricing is favorable, we were not able to offset exchange and economic factors to the same degree as we have in the past. As shown in the memo, pretax profit decreased by $54 million compared with fourth quarter, more than explained by unfavorable volume and mix and exchange.","We continue to expect South America to generate solid profitability this year, although it will be lower than in 2011. Three new global products will be launched in South America this year, with the impact positively affecting results primarily in the second half. We're facing some uncertainty in the region, including a new trade agreement between Brazil and Mexico limiting vehicle imports to Brazil, the details and impact of which we're still sorting out. We'll update you on this throughout the year as appropriate.","Slide 17 covers Ford of Europe. First quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined by 14% and 17%, respectively, reflecting primarily lower industry sales and production adjustments to maintain dealer stocks at appropriate levels. Pretax results were lower than a year ago but somewhat better than our most recent guidance, and operating margin was lower as well. Industry SAAR for the 19 markets we track in Europe was 1.8 million units or 11% lower than a year ago. Our market share at 8.5% was unchanged.","Slide 18 shows the $442 million decline in first quarter pretax results for Europe compared with 2011 by causal factor. The decline is explained primarily by lower industry volumes, lower demand for parts and accessories and actions to reduce stocks consistent with industry levels. Contribution and pension-related cost increases are offset partially by reductions and other structural costs.","As we look ahead to the full year, we continue to expect Europe to incur a loss ranging from $500 million to $600 million. Our European operations will benefit from the launches of the new B-MAX, Transit and Kuga products, in addition to completion of our stock-reduction actions and continued cost reductions. These actions will positively affect results primarily in the second half.","Now let's turn to Asia Pacific Africa on Slide 19. Wholesale volumes were lower than a year ago due to the production launch of the global Focus in China. Revenue, which excludes our unconsolidated joint ventures in China, increased by 10%, reflecting primarily higher net pricing for new products. Pretax results and operating margin were lower than a year ago. Industry SAAR increased from 32.2 million to 32.8 million units mainly because of stronger industry in Japan. Our share at 2.3% declined 0.2 percentage point, reflecting primarily from adverse market mix as well as lower share for Figo and Ranger.","Slide 20 shows the $128 million decrease in first quarter Asia Pacific Africa pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. Results were affected adversely by higher costs associated with continued investment for future growth that precede the benefit of new products across the region. This was exacerbated to some extent by a slower-than-planned launch for the global Ranger pickup from our facilities in Thailand and South Africa. As shown in the memo, the Asia Pacific Africa's pretax results are about the same as fourth quarter. Despite this first quarter loss, we continue to expect Asia Pacific Africa to be profitable for the full year, with increasing volumes as the Ranger launch progresses, new capacity comes online in China and Thailand and other new product launches occur over the balance of the year.","Slide 21 covers 2012 first and second quarter production. In the first quarter, total company production was 1.4 million units, 46,000 units lower than a year ago. This is largely in line with our prior guidance. We expect second quarter total company production to be about 1.5 million units, down 24,000 units from a year ago, more than explained by the lower industry demand in Europe. This outlook is consistent with our disciplined strategy to match our production with consumer demand. Compared with fourth quarter, second quarter production is up 70,000 units.","Turning now to Slide 22 on our Automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. We ended the quarter with $23 billion in Automotive gross cash, an increase of $100 million from the end of last year. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $909 million, reflecting pretax profits of $1.8 billion, which was partially offset by capital spending during the quarter that exceeded depreciation and amortization by $200 million and an adverse timing differences of $600 million associated primarily with the seasonal impact of vehicle financing receivables. Our cash flow before changes in debt and pension contributions was $900 million as well, including receipts from financial services of $300 million. Net debt inflows in the quarter totaled $0.5 billion. We also made payments of $1.1 billion to our worldwide funded pension plans, in line with our previously disclosed long-term strategy to de-risk our funded pension plans. Of this, $0.5 billion reflects discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plans.","Slide 23 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the first quarter. Automotive debt was $13.7 billion at the end of the quarter compared with $13.1 billion at 2011 year-end. The change reflects primarily the continued drawdown of the Department of Energy Loans, which will continue through the third quarter, as well as our renminbi-based debt issuance in Hong Kong. This is consistent with our plan to achieve debt levels of approximately $10 billion by mid-decade.","We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.3 billion and strong Automotive liquidity of $32.9 billion. Our liquidity includes the recently announced amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility, which resulted in $9 billion of commitments being extended to November 2015 and $300 million of commitments remaining until November 2013.","Turning now to Ford Credit. Slide 24 shows the $261 million decrease in first quarter pretax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. In line with our expectations, the results are explained primarily by fewer lease terminations, which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain, as well as lower financing margin and lower credit loss reserve reductions. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pretax profit decreased by $54 million from the fourth quarter, more than explained by lower financing margin. Consistent with prior guidance, Ford Credit expects to be solidly profitable for 2012 full year but at lower level than last year, reflecting primarily the same factors impacting our quarterly results. We project full year profits of about $1.5 billion.","Ford Credit expects to pay total distributions this year of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion, and at year end, we anticipate managed receivables to be in the range of $85 billion to $95 billion.","Turning now to slide 25, we'd like to share with you an important update of our pension de-risking strategy. In January, we announced a long-term strategy to de-risk our global funded pension plans. This strategy, expected to be completed by mid-decade, will reduce balance sheet and cash flow volatility and improve the overall risk profile of the company. Today, we're announcing the next step in our strategy, specifically voluntary lump-sum pension payout options to eligible salaried U.S. retirees and former salaried employees that, if accepted, would settle our pension obligations to them. We believe this is the first time a program of this type and magnitude has been done with an ongoing pension plan. Offers will be made to about 90,000 individuals. This program provides participants with the onetime choice of electing to receive a lump-sum settlement of the remaining pension obligation. Individual offers will be made over time to accommodate the size and complexity of this program, and we would expect to complete the process sometime next year. Because of the voluntary and unprecedented nature of this program, the participation level and therefore, the impact on our future pension obligation is difficult to predict. In terms of financial impact in the company, we expect minimal impact on operating income. We expect to incur noncash special item charges, reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses. There will be no impact to company cash as payments will be funded from plan assets, and we do not expect planned company contributions to our funded plans to be affected. If the program progresses, we'll provide updates as part of our quarterly reporting.","And with that, Alan will now cover business environment and our 2012 planning assumptions.","Alan R. Mulally","Thank you, Bob. Slide 27 provides an overview of the business environment. Overall, we expect global growth to continue at a 3% pace during 2012. Economic growth in the U.S. is expected to be in the range of 2% to 3%. In Europe, however, we expect weak conditions, with some markets doing better than others as fiscal austerity programs are implemented. Several major emerging markets, such as China, Brazil, India, Indonesia and Thailand, are now in cycles of policy easing to support economic growth.","We expect commodity prices to increase modestly in 2012 and to trend upward over the longer term given global demand. Given the prospect of global economic growth, we expect global Automotive sales to total about 80 million units in 2012 compared with about 76 million units in 2011. In light of the dynamic external environment, however, sales could range from 75 million to 85 million units.","Slide 28 summarizes our first quarter status and our planning assumptions and key operational metrics in 2012. We expect full year industry volume to range from 14.5 million to 15 million units in the U.S. and about 14 million units in Europe. We expect full year market share in the U.S. to be lower than 2011 as planned capacity increases will lag demand. Share in Europe should be about the same as last year. The outlook for quality is mixed. As we now expect performance in the U.S. to be about the same as a year ago, the other regions are expected to improve. Compared with 2011, we expect Automotive pretax operating profit to improve; Ford Credit to be solidly profitable, earning pretax operating profit of about $1.5 billion; total company pretax operating profit, excluding special items, to be about equal; Automotive structural costs to increase by less than $2 billion as we support higher volumes, new product launches and our growth plans; and Automotive operating margin to improve. Capital spending should range from $5.5 billion to $6 billion.","For the full year, we will deliver strong Automotive-related cash flow. Although not shown on the slide, we continue to expect commodity cost increases for 2012 to have a nonmaterial impact on the company. We are off to a good start for 2012, and we expect this to be a solid year in financial performance, consistent with our glide path to our mid-decade outlook. In contrast to the past couple of years, we do expect our total company pretax profit for the second half to be slightly higher than the first half due to the cadence of our many product launches and capacity actions.","Finally, Slide 27 summarizes our ONE Ford plan. We remain focused on delivering this plan, which is unchanged. Our team delivered a solid performance during the first quarter, with particularly strong results in North America. We remain focused on making continued progress in delivering great products, investing for global growth, building a strong business and providing profitable growth for all Ford stakeholders.","The external environment is looking somewhat better in North America and remains encouraging for many emerging markets. Europe, on the other hand, is a major challenge, and there are issues to address in South America.","We have both challenges and opportunities ahead of us as we proceed towards our mid-decade goals. A key opportunity is accelerating the realization of the full potential of the global scale and operating margin benefits inherent in our ONE Ford plan. We are also focused on sustaining and improving our already very strong operation in North America; strengthening and growing our profitable South American operation in the face of increased competition and trade and other regional issues; responding to the near-term environment in Europe, while working to deliver sustainable and appropriate returns in this very important market through continued investment in great products, strengthening our Ford brand and improving our cost structure; executing our growth and profit plan for Asia-Pacific, including the launch of 8 plants over the next several years that will support volume representing about 1\/3 of our global sales by the end of the decade compared to about 15% today; and finally, continuing the strong performance of our strategic asset, Ford Credit. We will continue our laser-like focus on strengthening the Ford brand around the world and continue the journey of making Lincoln a world class luxury brand. We are going further to achieve the full potential of our ONE Ford plan, including the achievement of our mid-decade outlook. Now we will be pleased to take your questions.","George Sharp","Thanks, Alan. Now we'll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We'll begin with questions from the investment community, then take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Susan, can we have the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold from Jefferies.","Peter Nesvold","So I was hoping we could start with the 11.5% operating margin in North America, which was certainly significantly better than what I was anticipating even for the next year or 2. And you still talked about North America getting -- or Automotive profit getting better in the back half versus the first half. When you think specifically by North America, is this sort of as good as it can get over the next year or 2, or do you see a continued upward trend from here?","Robert L. Shanks","This is Bob. Peter, thanks for the question. I mean, we\u2019d expect North America to be a significant contributor to the total company pretax results this year, which we mentioned is going to drive it. It's going to be up significantly year-over-year. The margin will be up significantly year-over-year. This is a fantastic results in the quarter. But you know, our quarters vary quite a bit. We'll see very, very strong year-over-year, and we expect North America to continue to perform well in the future and still on track to achieve margins of 8% to 10% by mid-decade. So fantastic results by the team, and we expect that engine that's pulling the company ahead to keep on pushing us along.","Alan R. Mulally","And also, Peter, as we noted, we expect Asia-Pacific operating profit to be positive for the year, also including South America.","Peter Nesvold","Okay. But just to be clear, I mean, as the SAAR gradually grinds higher over the next couple of years, your market share gains or your market share stabilizes to past levels, you're expanding capacity. There's no reason to anticipate that you wouldn't get further operating leverage from current levels, correct? In North America, specifically?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, as you see more volume coming onstream, I mean, obviously, there's going to be the opportunities for leverage, but you'll also have to add in capacity, which North America is doing this year to the tune of about 400,000 units. We also are going to be investing in additional products. We're going to see segmentation shifts away from trucks and larger vehicles to small over time. And as you know, we've also guided that we expect commodity costs to continue to increase on a trend basis over the period. So there will be some headwinds, but there's no doubt that the North American business is very, very strong. We expect it to stay very strong, and we think it provides even more opportunity for us in the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from Itay Michaeli, Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on structural cost. I think you had about a $300 million impact in Q1 globally. Is that a good run rate to think about going forward? If it would be, it sounds like maybe you would only be up about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion on the year. I just wanted to get a sense of the cadence of structural costs in 2012.","Robert L. Shanks","Yes, Itay, this is Bob. It's a good question. As you'll recall that we've guided the full year to be somewhat less than $2 billion, and we think we're still on track to that. Most of that is to support higher volume and to support investments in growth, both for this year and in the forward years. It's going to be pretty much across all the business units. I think it's pretty light this quarter in terms of what we're seeing because we've got a lot of product launches coming, capacity launches coming, continued investment in engineering for products that will come beyond this year. So I think we're still comfortable with the guidance that we've given, so you'll see increases in the quarters coming ahead.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And quick follow-up on the pension de-risking. One, could you share the size of the salaried U.S. pension liability? And then two, would this also be a potential option down the road for the hourly U.S. pension liabilities?","Robert L. Shanks","Yes, this is a really significant step forward for us because it's really important that we improve the risk profile of the company, and we have announced some actions earlier this year to do that in terms of how we're going to manage the assets. But this is a huge step forward in terms of actually eliminating some of the obligation altogether. The total pension obligation we had globally was $74 billion at the end of last year. The U.S. pensions, both salaried and hourly and also some of the unqualified plans, the plans that we don't fund, about $49 billion, and this is about 1\/3 of our obligations. So it's a significant number. We don't know the take rates because this has never been done before by a company certainly of this size and certainly ongoing pension plans. So we don't know what the take rates are. We have assumptions, obviously, but we prefer not to share them now because we don't know how good they are. So what we'll do is we'll give you an update every single quarter as we come along and I\u2019ll let you know what the reaction is. But this is a big step forward, and we're very, very excited about it. I didn't answer your question, I'm sorry, on the hourly side. This is only for salaried. It's something that could be done with our hourly employees, but that would be subject to discussions with our UAW partners. And of course, those are private conversations, and we have nothing to say on that at this time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of things. First, just a follow-up on that pension question. I'm wondering, are the lump sums that you're offering, just qualitatively, are they less than the PBO, the way the PBO was reflected based on current discount rates? Or basically, do the ERISA rules kind of direct you to lump-sum values that are kind of similar to the way you guys are reflecting it?","Robert L. Shanks","We think that it's pretty much in line with what the obligations are, and we're driven by regulations in terms of the discount factor we'll use to take the future pension payments and bringing them back to a present value. So we think that they\u2019re relatively consistent with the obligations on our balance sheet.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And you made a comment, I think, in the release suggesting the second half will be better than the first half, and you said that again on the call. I'm wondering if embedded in that is an expectation of a little bit of weakening in the second quarter, just given that last year's full year was around $8.8 billion. You did $2.3 billion in Q1. Just related to that question, we did notice that your North American volume should be up sequentially, and there have been some reports of you guys taking advantage of shortened workweeks in Europe, which, I would presume, would help vis-a-vis your structural cost there.","Robert L. Shanks","That's a good question because as you know, over the last couple of years, the mix of first half profit to second half profit has been sort of 60-40, 63 -- or 65-35. We're not expecting that this year. We think we'll actually see a bit more of our profit in the second half than the first half. What's driving that? We're going to be adding capacity in North America, about 400,000 units. We also are bringing on capacity in Thailand with the launch of our second plant there. We're in the process of launching Chongqing 2 with the global Focus in China. So that's in launch mode, so most of the impact will be in the second half. And then we've got most of the impact of our product launches, which will benefit the company in the second half right around the world. So that's the good news, if you will. And then, of course, associated with all of that, and it goes back to the earlier question, you'll start to see more structural costs come along as we start to pick up the costs associated with all that, with the product launches, the capacity launches and the future investments that we're working on. So that's kind of what's happening second half to first half. I'd really prefer not to get into specific quarterly guidance because our quarters are pretty variable. But I think that's what we would expect to see for the balance of the year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But is there anything unusual? You're launching the Escape right now. Should we be thinking that there's some unusual seasonality to your costs? And my last question is just -- you made this comment about warranty and quality being similar on a year-over-year basis. There were some pretty significant one-timers. There was that dual-clutch transmission issue and the issue related to MyFord Touch last year. Are you trying -- are you suggesting that the costs would be similar to those, or are you trying not to just specifically speak to warranty?","Robert L. Shanks","No, what I'm talking about is specifically, it's around mostly structural cost. I think you're going to see the structural cost, recognizing, again, what we talked about in the earlier question regarding the structural costs that are going to be a little bit less than $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. You saw $300 million this quarter. So we've got quite a bit more ahead of this, and it's associated with the things we talked about, capacity launches, product launches and advertising sales promotion increases as we support those product launches. So not a lot of activity in that space in the first quarter. It's going to start to show up in the second, third and fourth. And I think that's what is really going to impact more the second quarter because, again, many of the things that we're talking about, the benefit will occur in the second half, not in the second quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the warranty issue? That was a significant cost last year, if I recall correctly. Are you suggesting that the cost levels are similar?","Robert L. Shanks","No, I'm not going to give a specific forecast on warranty, but we certainly don't expect that to be the drag on the business this year that it was last year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso, Credit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of items and a follow-up on the comment about the direction of margin in North America. Clearly, the mid-decade target is lower than where you're running. And you mentioned a few items, one of which was mix, so I'm wondering if you can give us an idea of what you think the rough car-truck mix for you will be by the middle of the decade. And then the other element that you didn't mention, but I'm wondering if this is going to be a headwind as well, is an increase in regulatory cost to meet fuel economy standards. Is there an expected increase in the burden that you'll have to bear versus what you can pass on to the consumer that also weighs on margin as we work toward mid-decade?","Robert L. Shanks","Okay, Chris, thank you. Another good question. I think your last point is a good point. Clearly, there is going to be more product costs associated with regulations going forward. And generally, maybe over time, we can recover much of that through pricing. But we certainly can't do it usually fully when you launch and incur that cost. So I think there will be a timing element associated with that as we move into the future. And so that probably is another good point in terms of a headwind that we'll face. But when you talk about the overall margin story for North America, it's already very, very good. Again, I wouldn't take one quarter, either good or bad, and say that's a trend for the year. You know how variable our business is. But it's still a fabulous result. And there's nothing funny or onetime in those results. Those are just solid operating results that are coming through in the quarter. As we do move ahead into the future, one of the things that will be an opportunity for North America, we do expect the housing market to come back and construction, and that drags along with it higher pickup sales. And so as that occurs, despite the fact we think, overall, there'll be a segmentation pressure on us, we do think that we'll benefit from that dynamic. So we feel pretty good about that.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Another follow-up on the comment about the pension buyout thing. Can you tell us what discount rate you're using to come up with the PV of the lump sums that you're offering?","Robert L. Shanks","No, we're not sharing that now. It's a regulatory number that we'll use. We have no discretion over that. And as you know, last year, the discount rate that we had in place with the U.S. was about 4.6% or so. So it's -- and it'll also be done person by person because it's done with actuarial data around each individual and how long they might be expected to live and that sort of thing. So it's actually not one rate. It'll be thousands of rates.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Interesting. Okay. And then just one last one on the resin topic. You mentioned in the report you don't expect any downtime. Can you just give a little color on whether or not you're finding new supply or whether you're using different materials, just some update on that?","Robert L. Shanks","Yes, it's mostly around -- I guess it's largely around the fact that we have alternative materials that we can use. And interestingly, there have been some materials that the team had already previously tested because we had been thinking about using them, but didn't, so that we actually had it on the shelf, materials that had been tested and validated. So that gave us a leg up in terms of being able to address the situation. So we feel like we're in good shape from that point of view, have not had any disruptions, don't expect any disruption, and we're not going to be having to do any mix managing, so we're pretty clean.","Operator","And your next question comes from Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just actually want to -- yet another question on the North American margin issue. I guess it seems that one of the things that was positive here was contribution costs, both sequentially and year-on-year. I guess materials, excluding commodities, were actually a benefit. Is there some seasonality to that? Because, I guess, commodities, you said, was going to be sort of net neutral. But just with the amount of content going into all the refreshes, one would've expected that materials, excluding commodities, would be negative, particularly as you accelerate some of these launches. So is that one of the things that might have helped this quarter that might be more of a headwind as we go into subsequent quarters?","Robert L. Shanks","That's another good point because again, because there was not too much in the quarter related to new product, we didn't see a lot of product costs on a year-over-year basis. And we've got a lot of new products coming over the next several months, as you pointed out, and that will be an additional headwind as we go through the year for North America. So that will be one of the things that the business will have to overcome. I mean, it's good because we'll also pick up better pricing and it will help us on volume and so forth. But from a cost perspective, you're right. That will be something that you'll see more of as we go through the year. And Patrick, we don't think the North American margin is an issue. We think it's fantastic.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, I just meant that it was getting a lot of attention.","Robert L. Shanks","And well-deserved attention, I might add.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, absolutely. One other question is, maybe could you just walk us a little bit through the plan for South America again? You went through it relatively quickly. What are the product launches there? Specifically, when do they expect it to roll on? And sequentially, maybe how do we think about the improvement you guys are expecting there?","Robert L. Shanks","In the case of South America, let me just step back. We've had 33 quarters of profitability. It's pretty light this quarter. Next quarter, maybe a bit light as well. But it's going to be stronger in the second half. So it's one of the factors that's going to drive the second half versus first half dynamic. And the thing that's happening in South America, it's a profitable region for everyone. It's a protected market, which is in part why it's profitable. The exchange rates have been very strong there, which have also made it more attractive to importers. And so there's just so much more focus from competitors on the region. There's been about 2 million units of capacity that have been announced, I think, for Brazil alone. And to put that in context, the industry in Brazil is 3.5 million to 3.7 million units, so tremendous pressure potentially coming in terms of supply versus demand. As a result of all of that, we're seeing pressure on prices. And we're also facing new trade issues because with all these imports that are coming in, you're finding Brazil and Argentina taking free-trade agreements and making them less free. And for us, that's an issue, in particular, with Mexico because we have been exporting for Mexico both the Fusion and the Fiesta and doing so quite profitably. So that's sort of the dynamic, and so what do we do about that? What we're going to be doing is we're going to be completely replacing the entire product lineup with legacy products, with global ONE Ford products, which are just going to take the lineup into a completely different place and then really have a major positive impact on the brand. And at the same time, we're working on strengthening the brand with really a good work with the dealers and with advertising and sales promotion initiatives that Jim Farley and the team are leading. So we're going to be working on the brand. We're going to be working on product, and we're also going to be working, as always, on cost. So with all of that, we think we're going to keep North -- rather, South America on track and expect to see them to be a very profitable part of the business going forward.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just one last one on that. I mean, you've run sort of above 10% operating margins on that. I guess in the new world, it's probably going to be hard to get back up to that, but still materially better than where you\u2019ve been in the last 2 quarters, I guess.","Robert L. Shanks","Well, I mean, I wouldn't call the last 2 quarters any indication of a trend on margins in South America. I think we'll see very good margins in South America going forward, but we're going to have to work through these sort of near-term issues. One of the things you had asked about, by the way, was product. We've got the EcoSport coming later this year. We've also -- we\u2019re just in the process of beginning to launch the Ranger, which is very important. And then we're going to be also having some other products that will be getting into the marketplace more on an import basis. But again, because of the factors I mentioned, the volumes will be relatively low, although profits, pretty good.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about Europe and how you expect to turn that around? Is there any sort of structural actions that you could take in terms of closing plants, or are they really just dependent upon the market recovery?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, as you know, Europe is a very big market. It's a very important market. It's got rich consumers. So we love Europe. And as you know, we've done restructuring there over really a decade. So as a result, we were profitable in 6 of the last years. So as we go into the situation that we're facing, we're going in with a business model that clearly isn't good enough to be profitable in the very, very low industry levels that we're seeing now but gives us a good platform from which to move forward. So what we're going to focus on is continuing to invest in product and even expanding our product lineup and thinking about ways that we can get more out of that product, including margins and segments and mixes and so forth. We're going to clearly work on the brand. I don't just mean revenue from that perspective but all aspects of the brand and strengthen that. And then what we clearly have to work on is cost structure. The cost structure we have would've given us a breakeven at sort of a low 15 million unit industry SAAR, which is a relatively low number for Europe, at least looking backwards. But looking forwards and with the economic environment, I think your expectations have to be a little bit dampened in terms of what the industry will be. So we clearly have a challenge in front of us to put together a business structure that will give us the ability to make the appropriate sustained returns from that region, and we're absolutely convinced that we can do that. It won't be an overnight story, but it's something that we'll attack piece by piece, and we'll put together a business model that's going to give us a successful business there.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what kind of cost actions can you take? I mean, I think aren\u2019t you at around 90% utilization currently there, or as of recently were kind of there.","Robert L. Shanks","Yes, last year, we were at 93% capacity utilization on a sort of a 2-shift straight-time basis. Now most of our plants there are on 3 shifts. So the real utilization wasn't as good as the number I quoted. And now with the actions that we see ahead of us are necessary because of the even lower industry. And just to give you an example of how low the industry is, it's the lowest -- the last -- this past quarter was the lowest industry that we've seen in Europe since 1995. So this is like looking at the U.S. back in '08, '09. It's a really, really tough environment. And the other thing that's kind of interesting is that we're not just seeing this on the new vehicle side, but we're seeing consumers who are coming in for service. They're not coming in as much and are not spending as much. So when you look at our results, about $100 million of the decline on a year-over-year basis was actually coming from parts and service, just from the factors I just mentioned. So we're going to have to work on all aspects of costs. It'll be contribution costs. It'll be the structural costs of the business. And we're going to work on revenues. It's not just a cost story. We have revenue opportunities there. So breakeven is both revenue and cost. We're going to work both of those things. We're not going to get into any details today of what we will be doing, but we know what to do and looking forward to putting that business model together that works.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of your Q1 retail market share in the U.S., you commented that there was adverse mix in the U.S. Do you think that's going to correct over the near term, or is that going to be a headwind for the remainder of the year?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, if you look at the last 2 years, there's been sort of this peak, if you will, in the first part of the year, in the spring, as the fuel prices went up and there was a big shift to the smaller vehicle segments. We're seeing the same thing this year. You'll have to wait and see if it comes back a bit, but that certainly has been the phenomenon of the past couple of years. The thing that we're facing, as Mark talked about in early April, though, is we're going to build everything we can build this year, and that includes the added capacity, and we're going to sell it all. So unfortunately, it's not quite enough to meet what the expected consumer demands, so it's going to show up in share. But certainly, it's going to affect our profitability or affect the strength of the business going forward because we're just capacity-constrained this year. So whatever the consumers want, we're ready to give it to them.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just to round out a couple of things in North America, I noticed freight was positive here. I'm just thinking about last year, when you did have to incur more freight because of the tragedy in Japan. Should that continue to be a benefit going forward and maybe even accelerate a little bit? And then also, given the capacity constraint, I mean, is it reasonable to assume you're going to focus more here on revenue realization?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, first of all, on freight, I wouldn't expect freight to be material one way or the other on a year-over-year basis in North America or across the business. But -- so I don't think it's going to be too much of a factor. When you look at -- I'm sorry, what was your second question?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just in terms of you being a little bit capacity-constrained.","Robert L. Shanks","Capacity-constrained. Well, I think we'll take advantage of opportunities that we have, but I think we have to be very careful about that. It looks like April's going to be a challenging month for us from a share perspective, and that's probably because we probably pulled back a little bit too much on incentives too quickly. Now if you look at third-party data, you can see that our transaction prices are way, way up versus last month on a year-over-year basis versus the industry average. So we're doing extremely well in pricing relative to the industry, but we're going to have to stay competitive because consumers have choices. So we'll get every dollar of revenue that we can, but we're going to stay competitive in the market.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one quick one. You did mention Europe was a pleasant surprise in the quarter. What was the biggest delta versus your guidance that's equal to or worse than the fourth quarter level? And what changed?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, I think the thing that's really interesting about Europe is I think there have been an expectation because we've seen that in the past in Europe, when the industry gets into challenges from sort of an industry volume perspective, is that there's tremendous discounting. And I think there had been worries and concerns from an industry perspective about what that might mean in terms of net pricing. So if you look at our results in Europe on a year-over-year basis, we were able to contain net pricing to pretty small $32 million, and that's without the benefit of any product actions, new product actions to help us. So I think that was -- we did actually a little better on pricing, and we were also able to do a little bit better on cost improvements than what we thought. The other thing that's kind of interesting in terms of our business in Europe is that we've been pulling back from the less profitable channels in Europe, so our share was unchanged as you've noted. But within that, it's actually healthier because we're doing better on the retail side, we're doing better on the sort of the commercial fleet side, and we're pulling back on the rental side, which is not healthy, and we're certainly trying not to participate to the degree that others do on the sort of the demonstration or self-registration. So the guys in the Europe are doing a pretty fabulous job of holding the line on pricing and are doing a great job of giving us healthy share.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question on cadence here, Bob, just to kind of round this out a little bit. As we look at this pattern this year, it's very atypical or very different than what we've seen historically. Is this the kind of pattern we should see going forward? And really, what I'm trying to understand is, is the first half somewhat more depressed because you're just going through this last big leg of product launches and in the second half, you get a little bit of relief, and that's what we should be modeling off of going forward? Or is this just a weird cadence year, and we should be thinking of this full year as somewhat normal and the cadence returns to normal going forward, and in aggregate, there was actually nothing that's unusual about this year?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, John, I don't know that I would ever say that there's anything normal at any time about the calendarization of results in the Automotive business because it's very much affected by external events, and it could be industry, it could be commodities, it could be -- you name it, competitive actions in terms of an individual company's results and then product launches and so forth. What you're seeing from us this year is you're seeing we don't have depressed results in the first half or will have. We think the results are actually going to be very good in the first half because the full year is good. We just think we're going to do a little bit better in the second than the first, and it's really driven around what I mentioned earlier, which is a lot more capacity coming onstream, not just in the U.S. but in Asia-Pacific, and just the cadence of the product launches. They're really heading more towards sort of second quarter late and then in the second half. And that's -- it's those 2 factors which are going to give us the big bounce in the second half relative to the first half. But the first half's going to be good, and second half is going to be a little bit better, and the full year is going to be very, very strong.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But as we think of the run rate going forward, it sounds like the second half would be a better litmus test for the company going forward as opposed to the first half of this year, based on what you're saying. That's my interpretation.","Robert L. Shanks","I'm not sure what you mean by a litmus test.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, it means as we think about the run rate and margins going forward, to think about where your earnings and cash flow can ultimately go, it sounds like you're a little bit heavy on launches in the second quarter. And that is a somewhat depressing results in the first half of the year, then as we get through the second half of the year, it'll be sort of more normal. You have this capacity coming on. You'll be able to sell those, on a run rate basis, those 400,000 more units in North America. So that second half would be more of a sort of a normal run rate as opposed to what's going on in the first half, which is still good but not sort of a normal run rate.","Robert L. Shanks","Well, I think the second half clearly is going to be a little bit better and will set us up well for 2013. I think you have to be a little careful when you talk about run rates because you've got one part of the business that's cooking on all cylinders, and we expect we'll continue to do so in North America. But in terms of our run rate, I mean, we need to improve in Europe. We need to improve in South America. Asia-Pacific is still losing money and is going to be a big profit contributor in the future. So I think you have to be a little cautious when you talk about run rate. It's going to be quite different by business unit.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Alan, just a question on the global platforms. I mean, we look at VW using MQB [ph] going forward and Toyota going to this TNGA platform. You've seen this platform consolidation for a lot of your competitors. In some ways, you can argue maybe more aggressive than what you're doing. In some cases, you could say maybe a little bit less aggressive. I'm just curious. As you look for this sort of this strive for these global platforms and commonization, where do you think you are versus the competitive set right now and where do you think you'll be over the next 1 to 2 years as you fully execute on leveraging your global platforms?","Alan R. Mulally","Well, sure, John. I think, as you know, it's a very important part of our strategy. And the kind of another neat result of our demonstration or proof point of the North America performance is the fact that they are leading on using the global platforms, too. And so if you look at the B-size, the C, the CD size, especially, and then add that worldwide to the Ranger size, T6 size, and also the commercial vans, that's nearly 80% of the volume worldwide. And most of those platforms with the top hats associated with them will be made in 3, 4, 5 locations around the world with the same building material and the same assembly sequence. So I think we feel really good about the strategy we adopted 5 years ago but also the progress that we have made because we are right there in the leading edge now based on the global platforms of getting the value and the synergy out of those global platforms. So we follow the competitors' strategies very closely. But I think we feel really good about where we are. One more thing, John, that's turned out to be more a benefit than we thought, that is with the powertrain options, the power of choice, whether the customer wants a diesel, a petrol, a hybrid, a plug-in hybrid and all electric, the fact that we have now -- that we are moving to electrifying the entire platform, having all those vehicles have the manufacturing flexibility made in the same plant, with 60%, 70% of the parts being the same and yet customized for the unique requirements around the world. Also, it's turned out to be even a more positive part of our strategy than we originally anticipated. So I think continue on the journey growing the production in Asia-Pacific and then bring, as Bob said, especially starting in the second half, bring in these local platforms, updating all the legacy ones in South America, bringing them to Europe and then leading with all of them being available in Asia-Pacific. I think we feel real good about the strategy going forward.","Operator","And we will now welcome questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tom Krisher from Associated Press.","Tom Krisher","I was wondering if you could tell me if you expect your tax rate to stay consistent around 32%, or will that fluctuate in future quarters?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we're not going to give any guidance on any particular quarter because it can go up and down a bit based on a lot of different things, for example, where do you actually earn your profit by specific legal entity all around the world, so it's pretty complex. But what we would expect for the full year is that the rate will be pretty similar to what it was last year. And that's sort of in the low 30% range, and I think that's what you'll see from us for 2012.","Tom Krisher","Okay, very good. Bob, you said this morning that you have these substitutes for PA12 and you didn't expect any production disruptions at all. But is there no doubt about that, or is it still possible that you'll run into things? And from a consumer perspective, do I need to worry that maybe you're putting these things on the cars before they're ready and you haven't vetted them enough?","Robert L. Shanks","We've had just a wonderful working together approach on this issue with our supply base, and the results speak for themselves because we think we're going to get through this without having any issues. If anything, my understanding, and you guys can correct me here, but my understanding is that the materials we're going to be using are very, very high-quality in terms of the properties that they possess. So they're very, very good materials. There are alternatives, obviously. So for the consumer, they're not going to have any issues in terms of safety or durability or anything of that sort. These are just alternatives, and so we're fortunate that they're available. As I mentioned in an earlier conversation with someone, some of them already had been tested and validated and were on the shelf, and so we were able to move even more quickly on those. So it's been very fortunate, but it's been just another example of the Ford team working together, in this case, not only with ourselves but with our supplier partners. And the outcome is fortunate.","Operator","And your next question comes from Keith Naughton from Bloomberg.","Keith Naughton","I noticed that the Automotive debt increased slightly to $13.7 billion from $13.1 billion at the end of last year, and I was just wondering if you could tell us why.","Robert L. Shanks","Yes, thanks for that question. This is the first time in some time that we've seen an increase in Automotive debt, but the first thing I want you to know is that we are completely on track towards achievement of our $10 billion guidance mid-decade. So this is really the result of 2 factors. One, that we still have additional drawdowns. I think it's 2 or 3 drawdowns that we're expecting for loans that we're getting from the Department of Energy associated with the advanced technologies. I think that will go up until September, so we still have some more to go. And those are great for us because it's supporting additional employment and additional products with very, very high fuel efficiency for the company and the country. So this is a really great opportunity for us, so we'll continue to drill that down and start to pay it back beginning in September. And then the other thing that was very exciting for us is we just recently had the opportunity to issue this, what we call the -- it's called the dim sum bond issuance, and so it's a Chinese renminbi currency-denominated bond in Hong Kong. So we tested that market. We found that it was very receptive to us. So we'll use that in the future, and it gives the opportunity for additional financing sources to support our business in China. So those things came in. It's good debt, if you will, but it doesn't at all get us off track towards our $10 billion target.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Isidore from CNN Money.","Chris Isidore","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your outlook for Europe. You're saying your outlook now is only about $14 million this year. How long do you think that those kind of depressed levels might last? Are we looking at several years before we're back more towards the $15 million -- end of the $14 million to $15 million planning range, or do you think that this is relatively -- are you working with the assumption that this is a relatively short-term decline?","Robert L. Shanks","Well we're starting from the point of view that we think the economic environment and the issues of Europe associated with the sovereign debt and addressing the sovereign debt issues are going to be around for quite some time. So we don't see this as a short-term situation. It has changed our point of view in terms of the strength of the overall market over time. We don't think, over the next 4 or 5 years, it's going to return back to the levels that we saw 4 or 5 years ago. We do think over time that we'll start to come back and there'll be some increase in volume but not, again, to the levels that we saw 3, 4 or 5 years ago. So we're factoring that into our own planning in terms of what we need to do to make our business profitable there.","Chris Isidore","So you're saying -- even $15 million might be out of -- I mean, $15 million is somewhat depressed there, too. I mean, are you saying even $15 million might be out of reach for a while?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we don't see that in the very near term.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin, The Associated.","Dee-Ann Durbin","You're expecting to lose U.S. share because you didn't predict how quickly sales were going to come back, and I'm just wondering what took you up there. What did you think wasn't going to happen that did, and how can you maybe improve your forecasting?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, I don't think we were tripped up. I think we were off by maybe a quarter or 2. We took a lot of actions going all the way back to the beginning of '06 in terms of taking out tremendous capacity in North America to get the business structure right. And of course, we had a point of view about when the market would start to come back and how we would match demand with our capacity. And so we have these plans in place to bring on the additional capacity. It looks like we're off by a quarter or 2 because it's coming back a little bit faster than we expected. But we'll be on track by the time we get to the end of the year, and in good shape, we expect to support our next year's demand.","Operator","And your next question is from Joann Muller, Forbes.","Joann Muller","I had 2 questions about North America. One, maybe following up on Dee-Ann's remarks. You talked about being capacity-constrained this year, and I wondered whether -- how much room there is for you to increase capacity with the existing facilities that you have in North America. Or will there be any kind of need to add factory capacity, reactivate plants that were closed, that kind of thing?","Robert L. Shanks","I'm so glad you asked that question because I forgot to say something in answering Dee-Ann. The other issue that we're facing for the capacity is that we've got all these product launches and then we've also got the capacity launches, so while the capacity is coming online and I was talking about sort of an ongoing rate of capacity we're adding, you actually have to launch the facility, whether it's a capacity increase, and then, of course, the products also, their launches associated with them. So that's one of the factors also that we're working to overcome in the second half of the year. There are additional things that we can do. We don't have all of our plants at 3-shift or 3-crew. In addition, next year, as you know, we're going to be turning the AAI into a full Ford facility. Right now, it's Mustang along with the Mazda6, so that will become a full Ford facility, so it gives us additional opportunities for capacity there. So we have a few more plants where we could add additional shifts, and we've also got AAI coming onstream as a full Ford facility next year.","Joann Muller","Okay. And then the other question was clarifying something that you said early on comparing the North American profit to -- I believe it was North America, and that's one of the clarifications. You're comparing the profit to 2000, and you talked about how the wholesales were about double at that time, and a lot of them were trucks. And so I'm trying to ascertain whether your point is that you are now able to achieve the same profit margin on a more car-balanced lineup and a lower lineup than you did before. Are we talking about margins, or are we talking about raw dollars here in the...","Robert L. Shanks","I","We're applying it in all accounts, right across the board. So what we were talking about was North America, and I was talking about 2004, in the first quarter, when we had our previous high mark in terms of profitability.","Joann Muller","2004, okay.","Robert L. Shanks","2004. So the point is that we're making $2.1 billion in this quarter. We made $2.1 billion in that quarter. We're making that same profit with substantially less volume and with a greater mix of cars and utilities and trucks. So it really underscores the much linear cost structure of North America. It also underscores our ability to make money on vehicles other than trucks.","Joann Muller","Okay. And what was the margin then? Do you know what the margin was?","Robert L. Shanks","I don't know off the top of my head, but it was much less than the 11.5% for this year.","Joann Muller","Right. If the volume was double, it would seem to be that way. Okay.","Robert L. Shanks","Someone just told me it was 9.2%. So quite a -- it was a good margin but not a great margin.","Operator","And now I'd like to hand back to George for closing remarks.","George Sharp","Okay. Well, thank you very much, Susan. That concludes today's presentation. Thanks to all of us -- all of you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Kanti and I'm your operator for today. ","At this time all participants are on listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.","George Sharp","Thank you Kanti and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you and thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our second quarter 2014 financial results. ","Now, presenting today are Mark Fields, who became President and CEO of Ford earlier this month, and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. ","Now, copies of this morning's press release and presentation slides are available on Ford's Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. ","Now any non-GAAP financial measure are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck, and final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Now finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. ","The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings. ","With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks George. I\u2019m really pleased to join you this morning and today we\u2019ll review our second quarter financial results, the details behind them and our outlook ahead. So let's get right into the first slide. ","Our strong results this quarter are due once again to the success of our ONE Ford plan, which remains unchanged. We are continuing to focus on all four elements of the plan. They have served us very well and will continue to be our focus going forward. ","We also plan to build on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. In many ways we are just starting to see the full benefits and strength of ONE Ford and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward. ","At the same time, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation. We are committed to building on the product strength today, with even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward. ","Now let's turn to slide two for a look at the second quarter. Overall, we delivered a strong quarter. We achieved our 20th consecutive profitable quarter and our best quarterly pretax profit since the second quarter of 2011. ","We also delivered positive automotive operating related cash flow and ended the quarter once again with strong liquidity. Although second quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 1% year-over-year, we achieved higher market share in Asia Pacific, driven by record share in China. ","All automotive business units contributed to the company's pretax profit, and all improved from a year ago, with the exception of South America. North America achieved record quarterly performance for pretax profit; Asia Pacific achieved a second quarter record; and Europe earned its first quarterly profit since the market dramatically declined three years ago. Ford Credit once again delivered solid results. ","As we\u2019ve said, this year is the most aggressive in our history for new product launches. We remain on track with our 23 global product launches. Our full-year outlook for the company pretax profit is unchanged, ranging from $7 billion to $8 billion. Our outlook for automotive revenue and operating margin also remains unchanged. ","Today, we are improving our outlook for automotive operating related cash flow to lower than a year ago, from substantially lower, due to the strong cash flow generated in the first half. As we look forward, we expect the payoff of our investments this year will be a strong product line up, with higher volumes, revenues and margins in 2015 and beyond. ","Let's turn to slide three to recap some of the quarter's other achievements. Both our Ford and Lincoln brands made strong improvements in the latest J.D. Power 2014 U.S. Initial Quality Study, with the F-150, Edge and Lincoln MKX ranking highest in their segments.","To support growth, we revealed several new products, including the all-new 2015 Edge, Focus ST and Escort in China. We also revealed a number of concepts, including the Ford Everest in China, the S-MAX Vignale in Europe, and the Ford Lightweight Concept, which showcases our commitment to light-weighting and advanced material innovation. ","In China we launched our Lincoln brand, including the reveal of the MKX concept. We also began North American production of Transit from our Kansas City plant, and the Lincoln MKC from Louisville. In Europe we increased production of Fiesta in Cologne to meet growing European demand. ","Ford Otosan, our joint venture in Turkey, began vehicle production from a new plant in Turkey. In China, we opened a new transmission plant with our joint venture partner, Changan Ford Automobile, and in Brazil, we launched a new engine plant. We reached agreement with the German Works Council to improve flexibility and efficiency at our Cologne plant, with the production of the next-generation Fiesta. ","Currently, we are implementing a previously announced share repurchase program for up to 116 million shares to offset an up to 3% dilutive effect of potential convertible debt conversions and stock-based compensation. ","Now, Bob Shanks will take us through the details of our second quarter results. Bob, you want to take it away?","Bob Shanks","Yes, thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Starting at the top on slide four, second quarter wholesale volume was 1.7 million units, down 17,000 units from a year ago; and revenue was $37.4 billion, down $500 million. Pretax profit was $2.6 billion, excluding special items, $44 million higher than a year ago. ","After-tax earnings per share at $0.40 were $0.05 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pretax special item charges was $1.3 billion, $78 million higher than a year ago. Earnings were $0.32 a share, up $0.02. ","Pretax special item charges were $481 million in the quarter. These include the impairment of our equity investment in the Ford Sollers joint venture in Russia, reflecting the present outlook for the business, including a weaker ruble, lower industry volume, and adverse industry segmentation changes that negatively impact sales of Focus. Also included in special item charges are separation related actions, primarily in Europe, to support our transformation plan. You can find details on these charges in appendix three. ","Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.6 billion, our 17th consecutive quarter of positive performance, and automotive gross cash was $25.8 billion, exceeding debt by $10.4 billion. Consistent with our most recent guidance, our second quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown was 44%, reflecting calendarization effects, including the impact of regional profits. ","We continue to expect our full-year operating effective tax rate to be about 35%, assuming retroactive extension of U.S. Research Credit Legislation in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter rate is expected to be about equal to our second quarter rate. ","In the first half, vehicle wholesales increased by 2% from a year ago, while company revenue was about flat. First-half pretax operating profit excluding special items was $4 billion, a decline of $721 million and net income was $2.3 billion, $544 million lower than a year ago. ","As shown on slide five, both our Automotive and Financial Services sectors contributed to the company's second quarter pretax profit. As shown in the memo, the year-over-year improvement in company second quarter pretax profit is more than explained by the automotive sector. As mentioned, all regions improved except South America. ","Compared with first quarter, company pretax profit was $1.2 billion higher, more than explained by automotive. The improvement over first quarter largely reflects non-recurrence of several significant adverse factors that we highlighted last quarter. ","The key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business in the second quarter are shown on slide six. As you can see on the far left and as already mentioned, wholesale volume decreased by 1% compared with a year ago, and automotive revenue decreased by 2%. The lower volume is more than explained by lower market share in all regions, except Asia Pacific. ","Global industry SAAR is estimated at 87.3 million units, up 3% from a year ago. Ford global market share is estimated at 7.5%, down two-tenths of a percentage point. Operating margin was 6.6%, up two-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and automotive pretax profit was $2.2 billion, up $66 million. ","As shown in the memo below the chart, first half volume was up 2% from a year ago, while automotive revenue was down 1%. Operating margin at 5% was down eight-tenths of a percentage point and total automotive pretax profit at $3.1 billion was down $658 million. ","Slide seven shows the factors that contributed to the $66 million improvement in second quarter automotive pretax profit. As you can see, lower cost and favorable market factors more than explain the improvement. Adverse exchange driven by South America was a partial offset.","As shown in the memo, pretax profit was $1.3 billion higher than first quarter, more than explained by favorable volume and mix and non-repeat of the significant adverse factors referenced earlier. ","Slide eight shows second quarter pretax results for each of our automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. North America and Asia Pacific were strongly profitable, with the former reporting a record quarterly profit and the latter a second quarter record. ","Middle East and Africa and Europe also were profitable, while South America reported at a loss. Other Automotive primarily reflects net interest expense. For the full year, we continue to expect net interest expense to be about $700 million. ","Now we\u2019ll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector, starting on slide nine with North America. North America's second quarter pretax profit continued to be driven by robust industry sales, our strong product line-up, continued discipline in matching production to demand and a lean cost structure, even as we continue to invest for future growth. ","North America's second quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 5% and 3%, respectively from a year ago. The volume decrease is explained by lower market share and an unfavorable change in dealer stocks, offset partially by higher industry sales. ","The U.S. industry SAAR of 16.9 million units in the second quarter was 1.2 million units higher than a year ago. Our U.S. market share deteriorated 1.2 percentage points to 15.3%, reflecting primarily a planned reduction in daily rental sales, lower F-Series share as we continue to balance share, transaction prices and stocks as we prepare for the new F-150; and lower Edge and Focus share. ","As shown in appendix seven, U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 12.9% in the second quarter, down eight-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago, explained primarily by lower F-Series, Edge and Focus. ","The decline in revenue is more than explained by the lower wholesale volume and a weaker Canadian dollar, offset partially by favorable mix. North America operating margin was 11.6%, up one percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was a record $2.4 billion, up $119 million. ","As shown in the memo below the chart, all first-half metrics declined from the year ago. The adverse first quarter impact of $500 million associated with changes in warranty reserves and weather related premium costs explains the majority of the lower profit and operating margin. ","On slide 10, we show the factors that contributed to North America's second quarter increase in pretax profit. The improvement is more than explained by lower cost and higher parts and accessory profit. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was higher than first quarter, more than explained by favorable market factors and non-recurrence of the significant adverse factors experienced in the first quarter. ","Turning to our full-year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pretax profit to be lower than 2013 and operating margin to range from 8% to 9%. Our guidance includes 13 weeks of production downtime this year for the launch of the new F-150, including the summer shutdown at our Dearborn and Kansas City plants. Three weeks occurred in the first quarter, and at the Dearborn plant, eight consecutive weeks are planned beginning in late August. The Kansas City summer shutdown in July and a few individual down days in the second half make up the remainder of the downtime. ","Now let's turn to slide 11 and review South America, where we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up and progressively replacing legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. We are also continuing to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth and lower industry volume in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries. ","In the second quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 22% and 30% respectively. The lower volume is primarily explained by an 800,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 6.1 million units. This includes the impact of the weakening economy in Brazil, import restrictions in Argentina, and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of U.S. dollars. ","South America market share at 8.8% was down three-tenths of a percent, more than explained by the model changeover of Ka and the phase-out of Fiesta Classic. The revenue decline is explained primarily by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange, offset partially by higher net pricing. ","Operating margin was negative 14%, down significantly from a year ago and pretax loss was $295 million, a deterioration of $446 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first half metrics deteriorated from a year ago. ","On slide 12 we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America's second quarter pretax results. All factors were unfavorable, with the exception of pricing, which did not fully offset the adverse effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation. As shown in the memo, pretax results improved compared with first quarter, more than explained by favorable exchange, mainly non-repeat of adverse balance sheet exchange effects in Venezuela and Argentina. ","For the full year we now expect South America to incur a larger loss than we previously guided. Although we continue to expect higher market share and positive net pricing in the second half, as we launch the all-new Ka Small Car, we now expect the rest of the year to be about breakeven to a loss due to lower than expected industry volumes and weaker currencies. The volatility in the region, including potential currency devaluations, adds uncertainty to our short-term projections. ","Let's turn now to Europe, beginning on slide 13, where we continue to implement our transformation plan, focused on product, brand and cost, and remain on track to achieve profitability in 2015. ","Europe's wholesale volume was about unchanged from a year ago, while revenue improved 10%. Europe 20 SAAR was 14.4 million units, up 700,000 units from a year ago. This was offset partially by industry declines in Russia and Turkey.","Europe 20\u2019s market share at 7.9% was down two-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago, reflecting primarily a reduction in rental and fleet share, as well as adverse industry segmentation in passenger car. Although not shown, our commercial vehicle share improved in the second quarter to 10.6%, up 0.5 percentage point from a year ago to our highest second quarter share since 1997. This was driven by our refreshed and expanded range of Transit products. ","As shown in appendix seven, passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 8.3% in the second quarter, down one-tenth of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by adverse industry segmentation. ","The increase in revenue mainly reflects higher volume in the Europe 20 markets and favorable exchange, offset partially by unfavorable mix. Europe's operating margin was two-tenths of a percent, an improvement of 4.4 percentage points from a year ago and pretax profit was $14 million, a $320 million improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first half metrics improved from a year ago. ","Slide 14 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's second quarter pretax results. The improvement is more than explained by lower cost and favorable exchange. Partial offsets include lower results and royalties from our joint ventures, primarily in Russia, along with lower parts and accessories profit. ","Restructuring costs were lower than a year ago, primarily due to a reserve release this quarter associated with our Cologne investment agreement and non-recurrence of a facility write-off in Genk last year. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results improved compared with first quarter, more than explained by lower cost and favorable market factors. ","We are very encouraged by Europe's first quarterly profit since 2011. This supports our unchanged full-year guidance for the region, which is for results to improve compared with 2013. ","Consistent with the normal seasonality of sales and production, we expect our second-half loss to be higher than the first half loss of $180 million. Projected lower second half wholesale volumes of about 100,000 units include the effect of summer shutdowns in the third quarter and year-end shutdowns in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we expect higher restructuring related cost in the second half, including non-repeat of this quarter's reserve release, and higher launch related costs with started production of the all-new Mondeo and the new Focus.","A final comment on Russia. The current environment clearly is difficult, but Russia remains a large and important market. We are working with our partner in Ford Sollers to develop actions to improve our business outlook going forward. ","Let's turn now to slide 15 and talk about Middle East and Africa, our newest business unit, which was created to better serve customers and expand in this fast-growing region. We are intensifying our focus and targeting opportunities for growth in small, midsize and large vehicle segments. ","In the second quarter, we wholesaled 49,000 vehicles in the region, 3,000 fewer than a year ago. Revenue was $1.1 billion, $100 million lower. The lower volume primarily reflects lower market share, driven by increased competitive pressures on Expedition in the Middle East. The lower revenue is explained by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange. ","Operating margin was 2%, up nine-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was $23 million, up $10 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, first half volume and revenue deteriorated from a year ago, but operating margin and pretax profit improved. ","Our full-year guidance for Middle East and Africa remains unchanged. We expect results to be about breakeven, with quarterly variability driven by factors such as the timing of production, the mix of vehicles, and long shipping time. ","Let's now review Asia Pacific on slide 16. Our strategy in Asia Pacific continues to be to grow aggressively with an expanding portfolio of ONE Ford products, with many factoring hubs in China, India and ASEAN. As shown on the left, second quarter wholesale volume was up 21% compared with a year ago, and net revenue which excludes our China joint ventures grew 9%. ","Our China wholesale volume, not shown, was up 26% in the quarter. Higher volume in the region primarily reflects higher market share and industry volume. We estimate second quarter SAAR for the region at 39.6 million units, up 2.2 million units from a year ago, fully explained by China. ","Our second quarter market share was a record 3.7%, four-tenths of a percentage point higher than a year ago. This was driven by China, where our market share improved three-tenths of a percentage point to a record 4.6%, reflecting continued strong sales of Mondeo, Fiesta and Kuga. ","Asia Pacific's higher revenue is explained primarily by the higher volume and favorable mix. Operating margin was 5.5%, up six-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was $159 million, up $29 million and a second quarter record. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first half metrics improved substantially from a year ago. ","Slide 17 shows that the improvement in Asia Pacific's second quarter pretax profit is more than explained by favorable volume and mix. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific's pretax results declined from first quarter, more than explained by higher costs. These cost increases include a higher warranty cost and continued investment in growth, including costs associated with fixed plants, one that opened in China during the quarter, and five plants still under construction in China and India. ","For the full year we continue to expect Asia Pacific to earn a higher pretax profit than a year ago. We expect full-year results will be strong for the region, with third and fourth quarter results down from the second quarter. ","Volume improvements will be more than offset by higher cost as we continue to invest for future growth, including the five plants still under construction in China and India, and the launch of Lincoln in China this fall. ","Let's turn now on slide 18 to Ford Credit, which is an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy. Ford Credit provides world class dealer and customer financial services, supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distribution to Ford. ","Ford Credit's lower pretax profit this quarter compared to a year ago is more than explained by a higher level of insurance losses from storm damage to dealer inventory in the quarter, which is included in other. ","As shown in the memo, pretax profit was lower compared with first quarter, again, more than explained by the insurance losses just mentioned. For the full year, we now expect Ford Credit pretax profit to be higher than 2013, improved from about equal to or higher. ","We also now expect year end managed receivables of $112 billion to $115 billion, up from our prior guidance of about $110 billion. Our guidance for Ford Credit managed leverage and distributions to its parent is unchanged. ","Next on slide 19 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $25.8 billion, an increase of $600 million from the end of the first quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $2.6 billion. Automotive profit and favorable timing and other differences were offset partially by higher net spending and unfavorable changes in working capital. ","During the quarter we contributed about $300 million to our global funded pension plans, down substantially from the last two years, due to recent improvements in the funded status of our plant. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $500 million and other items includes about $850 million related to the stock buyback program now underway. ","Slide 20 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.5 billion, $300 million lower than first quarter. We ended the quarter with net cash of $10.4 billion and automotive liquidity of $36.7 billion. We completed in the quarter our corporate credit facility amendment and maturity extensions. The facility is now $12.2 billion, of which $2 billion has been allocated to Ford Credit. ","This concludes our review of the financial details of our second quarter earnings. So now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark, who will take us through our outlook for the business environment, as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks a lot Bob. Slide 21 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% to 3% range, and global industry sales to be about 85 million to 90 million units. U.S. economic growth is now projected to be in the 2% range as a result of downward revisions to first quarter growth. We continue to expect improving conditions through the balance of this year and have seen economic indicators and industry sales recovering in the second quarter. ","In South America, Brazil continues to face inflationary pressures despite higher interest rates and weakening economic growth. The situation remains uncertain in Argentina and Venezuela. In Europe, an economic recovery is underway, with expected 2014 GDP growth of about 1% in the euro area and 2.5% to 3% in the U.K. Although not shown, the outlook for Russia is challenging and fluid, with weak GDP growth, inflationary pressures and a weaker currency. ","In Asia Pacific, China's economic growth is projected in the 7.5% range. Recent incoming data suggest the economy is stabilizing. Growth in India is expected to improve modestly at about 5% from last year, as high inflation and higher interest rates remain impediments to stronger growth. The recent general elections in India have generated positive sentiment and opportunities for better growth in the near term. ","Overall, despite challenges in emerging markets, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2014 and be supportive of our projection for higher global automotive industry volume this year. ","Slide 22 recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for our business unit, as well as for our net interest expense. In summary, full year guidance deteriorated for South America, improved for Ford Credit, and is unchanged for the other business units. ","Our company guidance for 2014 is detailed on slide 23. We now expect full year industry volume to range from 16.3 million to 16.8 million units in the U.S.; Europe 20 markets to range from 14.3 million to 14.8 million units; and China to be in the 23.3 million to 24.3 million unit range. ","In terms of our financial performance, we continue to expect automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013 and automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013. We now expect automotive operating related cash flow to be lower than 2013, improved from substantially lower. This includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion to support new or significantly refreshed products and capacity actions. ","We also now expect Ford Credit pretax profit to be higher than 2013, improved from about equal to higher than 2013. We continue to expect company pretax profit to be in the $7 billion to $8 billion range, in a period with an unprecedented number of global launches. ","Overall, 2014 will be a solid year for Ford Motor Company and a critical next step forward in implementing our ONE Ford plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all. The payoff from in the 2014 launches and investments will be a strong product lineup with higher volumes, revenues and margins in 2015 and beyond. ","In closing, our ONE Ford plan is built on compelling vision, a comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation, all leading to profitable growth around the world. We remain fully focused on continuing the success of our ONE Ford plan, in fact accelerating our pace of progress. ","We delivered strong results in the second quarter, and we remain on track in implementing our plan for the full year, including continued strength from North America, although down from recent years as we launch three times the number of products as last year; a loss in South America, as we adjust to a changed environment and continued risk in the region; successful execution of our transformation plan for Europe, as we progress towards profitability in 2015, even as we work through challenges primarily in Russia; establishing our Middle East and Africa business unit; continued strong growth and profitability in Asia Pacific; consistent, solid performance from our Ford Credit operations, and positive automotive operating-related cash flow. ","So now let's open it up to your questions. George.","George Sharp","Thanks Mark. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q-&-A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow us as many participants as possible within this time frame, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Kanti, can we have the first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay George. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of George Galliers from ISI. Please go ahead George.","George Galliers - ISI","Hello. Sorry, I\u2019m having telephone issues. I have two questions; the first was just on South American production. I notice you have it stepping up sequentially in Q3. Is this due to normal seasonality? It\u2019s just, when I look back at last year and also 2011, it looks like Q3 is down on Q2. So just wondering if you could elaborate on why you have production up in Q3 in that region. ","The second one is just with respect to the restructuring charges in Europe. Would you be able to give a breakout of how much is in relation to the reserve release and how much relates to the write-off?","Mark Fields","Thanks George. I\u2019ll take your first question and then Bob will take your second one. The step-up on production from the second quarter to third quarter in South America is due to the launch of our new K-A or Ka, which is a very important launch for us as it represents over 50% of the segment. ","That segment represents 50% of the industry in places like Brazil and the initial response we've gotten back since we have at least publicly shown it has been very encouraging, so we are looking forward to getting that into the marketplace and allowing that to help grow our business and also some pricing in the third quarter and the second half of this year in South America. Bob, you want to take the second one?","Bob Shanks","Yes, in terms of restructuring charges George, if you look at slide 14 to the far right, you can see on a year-over-year basis we had $178 million of good news from lower restructuring charges. So within that the reserve release which was related to the agreement that we made with the German Works Council was worth about $60 million, $65 million of good news, and that will be one time and won't repeat in the subsequent quarters. ","And then what we had a year ago was a reserve write-off of about $40 million to $45 million related to our facility at Genk, and so that\u2019s not repeating. So the two of those, you put them together, you get about $100 million of good news on a year-over-year basis within that $178 million. ","So we are still expecting to have about $250 million of restructuring costs for the full year and we still have obviously more of that in front of us than behind us. So that will be one of the factors that will drive the second half to be lower than the first half in terms of overall results. ","George Galliers - ISI","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we have the next question. It comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Yes, good morning, and congratulations again Mark on your first quarter and call. In North America you said pricing was going to be positive for the year. It looks like first half was $100 million positive. Do you expect more price in the second half or with some of the model changeovers, is this kind of going to be what we see for the year?","Bob Shanks","Yes Brian, I\u2019ll take that one. In the first half, if you go all the way back to December, if you remember when we had our initial guidance for the year, we actually thought that pricing would be adverse and in the first quarter we said it could be sort of flat to somewhat positive, and I think that\u2019s what we are seeing play out in the first half. That\u2019s consistent with what we expected at that time. ","When we get into the second half, I think we\u2019ll see more opportunities on pricing related to the new products, because as you very well know we\u2019ve got a number of new products coming. Now a lot of that volume, because there\u2019s a lot of (inaudible), actually the big effect is going to be in 2015. But there will be some benefit that we\u2019ll get from that into the second half, so I would think that would be a positive for us in the second half versus the first half.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","And also on North America, on the cost side, I mean we\u2019ve become accustomed to seeing cost pressures coming up, and this was a fairly good cost improvement. Is that kind of cost improvement going to be sustainable going forward or are there various one-off or timing differences we ought to be aware of as we think about the pace of structural and content cost through the year?","Bob Shanks","Well, I think in the case of overall cost, we usually do see a cost increase just typically in the second half versus first half. Some of that is seasonality; some of that is the fact that we are in a growth mode, so our CapEx will increase; we\u2019ll have launches that are going to hit the second half more than they did in the first half. ","On the product, the material cost piece, within that in the second quarter, pretty benign in terms of material costs on a year-over-year basis. I think that is just because we are in sort of the quiet period if you will. We haven't had a lot of big launches over the last year. We\u2019ve got the big launches ahead of us in the second half.","So, I think we\u2019ve benefited from the fact that the normal, very strong material cost reductions that we get from design changes and\/or from our work with our supplier partners, more of that is just flowing through in the quarter than what would probably be typical, and certainly more is flowing through than what you would see in the second half, because of the added product costs that will come. ","But again, with those product costs, that\u2019s new product, new features, new technologies, so we\u2019ll also get more pricing. So you have to kind of think about all that together.","Mark Fields","And just to add to that Brian on the structural cost, as Bob said, to put it into perspective, we are in growth mode. We can assure you that we\u2019re being very thoughtful about the structural costs that we put into the business. We spend a lot of time as a management team looking at the breakeven levels, so we don't get ahead of ourselves, if you will. But we are very focused on that, just as we are focused on driving the top line of the business.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we have the next question and it comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan - UBS","Thanks for taking my questions. Can you give me any color? Last quarter you mentioned that you thought the high end of your North America margin guidance of 8% to 9% was possible if you could get more pickup production out. How are you thinking about that currently?","Bob Shanks","Well, we're not saying it is not possible; but we are just staying with the overall guidance of 8% to 9%, because we\u2019ve got all these big launches coming ahead of us and what we\u2019d like to do is take a save and revisit that after we get through particularly the F-150 launch, which based on what we\u2019ve guided today in terms of down which is now just right at our doorstep. ","So we feel extremely good about the margins. You can look at that first half number; it\u2019s extremely strong. The launch of the F-150, and Mark can comment, is going well, as well as our other launches, so there is nothing at this point to be concerned about. So we feel good about it, but I think we\u2019ll just kind of update you if you will at the third quarter, once we get through the heart of the launch.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay, that makes sense. Can you also give some color on Asia Pacific? It was down quite a bit sequentially and you\u2019re guiding it down in the second half. I know you warned last quarter not to annualize the Q1 result, but what were the major factors when we think about it quarter-over-quarter. I think it\u2019s down about $130 million?","Bob Shanks","Yes, I mean, there's really two things to think about. Actually, I\u2019ll mention three. If you go to slide 17 and look below the chart, which gives you the quarter-to-quarter, we are still getting top-line growth; but within the contribution cost we had an increase in our warranty reserves, which largely explains that. So that would be, if you think about it, it should be one-time. ","In the other cost what you have got there is ongoing investments in growth. So as I mentioned, we have five plants still under construction and just take India for example. The Sanand facility that will open next year, we are already bringing hourly labor onboard. We are training them, so if you will, there\u2019s costs associated with that. Plus the other plants in China that there is no revenue for obviously, so that\u2019s a factor. ","We are already incurring cost as well for the Lincoln launch that will occur in the fall. So that's ahead of us as well, but also affecting the quarter and then if you go to the very far right Colin, look at Other. Within that we had a non-repeat of a favorable insurance adjustment in Thailand. I believe that's just not repeating, so that's sort of the factors that are affecting us. ","But just broadly, if you step back and go back to the comments around North America, I think the growth story is even of greater effect in Asia Pacific, and you can see that from the top line. We are investing and continuing to invest heavily and so that\u2019s bringing cost with it, but very strong revenue and growth that we are expecting in periods ahead.","Mark Fields","And just to add a little bit more context to your question around the Asia Pacific business and what\u2019s the trajectory, besides the financials and the comments that Bob just made, when you look across the region, nine out of our 12 markets in the second quarter actually grew their market share. So we are really pleased with the response to our ONE Ford products. ","And in China in particular, with the record market share, we are getting a lot of growth in the tier 4 through six cities, where there\u2019s a lot of growth and it's married to our network strategy. The consumers that we are attracting in China are younger, more educated and higher-income customers than the industry average and our retail sales, 70% to 90% of our retail sales come from either first time buyers or people buying an additional vehicle. So fundamentally, we think this positions us well for growth going forward.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay, all right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we have the next question and it comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you very much. So two questions for me. Number one is just following up on, I think it was Brian Johnson that asked the question on the slide 7, the materials excluding commodities benefit of $483 million. Obviously substantial tailwind there, and I get that you're going through a little bit of a quiet period before the launch of a lot of new product, but is that kind of reflective of just some of the purchasing efficiencies from global platforms that are kind of flowing through, all things equal or is there anything unusual that might have been a support to that this particular quarter? ","And then I had just a second question on Brazil. Can you guys maybe just with respect to your new guidance, maybe tease out how you are thinking about the commercial vehicle business that you have there, versus the light vehicle and how much each is kind of contributing to that sort of change in outlook if you will?","Bob Shanks","Why don't I take the first one and Mark, do you want to take the second one? Yes, I don't think there\u2019s anything unusual and one-time or anything of that sort in the quarter. I really do believe Patrick that it\u2019s really the fact that we\u2019ve got the strong efficiencies around material costs coming from the work with the supply base, as well as with the work in terms of design efficiencies. But it\u2019s just flowing more straight through to the bottom line than what you might expect in an ongoing quarter, because of just where we find ourselves with the launches, both behind us, but also the ones ahead of us. ","When you do look at the second half, as I mentioned, it clearly is going to be an adverse factor, at least based on what we\u2019re looking at today compared with the first half. But we also would expect to get some of that back within contribution costs from better performance in terms of warranty cost, particularly given what happened in the first quarter, but also maybe some improvements in freight and distribution as well, which in part was one of the issues with the added cost we had in the first quarter related to weather. ","So I think overall sort of a negative if you will in the second half versus first half on material, but a positive in some of the other factors. So I think they will more or less wash out when we look at North America second half to first half.","Mark Fields","And Patrick, on your second question around Brazil, when you stand back and look at the business, as we mentioned earlier, clearly we are continuing in implementing our ONE Ford plan where we are replacing all the legacy products, including some of our commercial vehicles, our cargo that we launched last year, which is actually doing very well in the marketplace. ","But the second half of the year in Brazil is really due to the economic slowdown that we\u2019ve seen and also to exchange volatility, and in some cases just dollar availability in places like Argentina and Venezuela. ","Specifically to the Brazil industry and your question around commercial vehicles, we are seeing the industry down overall, especially large and a big load of trucks where we don't specifically play. We are more in the medium truck segment of that right now. So the team is on top of this. We are looking at the business environment, understanding what do we need to do to improve the situation in a very changeable market, and we\u2019ll continue to work our process on that and maximize our results in a changeable environment.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, terrific. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we have the next question. It comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks everybody. Just one question for Mark and one question for Mike Seneski, if he\u2019s still on the call. So Mark, when you look into the meat of the F-150 changeover, given the really unprecedented nature of the material substitution at this scale, and I know Ford has tremendous experience with aluminum, but this is completely unprecedented at the scale you are attempting it. ","Would it be unreasonable to allow a little extra margin of safety for you to prioritize absolutely perfect top-quality initial production, body integrity, etc., for those first units, even if it means a slower ramp? Because your tone on the changeover, it sounds so confident that I can't help but be a little skeptical or are we really able to properly judge the changeover before we actually switch the full machinery on and start putting the scanners on the bodies coming off the line? That\u2019s my first question. ","And the second, Mike, I know that the mood has been kind of all systems go on credit for quite a while, but if I forced you to pick one market development on the credit side, and I'm not referring to Ford specifically, but just the overall market, if I force you to pick one development that concerned you the most, could you think of anything? What would it be? Thanks.","Mark Fields","Thanks Adam, thanks for the question and let me get to the first part on F-150. We are very excited about the F-150 launch and as you know, we are absolutely committed to delivering top quality in all of our vehicles and all of our launches. And I have to tell you, the innovative approaches that the team is taking to this launch are very, very comforting to us, and that we are going through the builds right now. I happened to drive a prototype last night. So the vehicles are coming together very well. ","But when you look at some of the things the teams have done to your point, to ensure quality, how we\u2019ve tested the tools out, literally online before they are actually installed in their body shop, the riveting process and adhesive process that this is going to use, we're actually using that on pilot production, so it\u2019s running on current production right now for over a year now, so the team has a lot of experience on that. ","So when you stand back, when you look at it from today's perspective, we feel confident that our development and try-out processes have positioned us well to be ready for an on-time launch with quality. ","So for the second question, Mike, you want to take that?","Mike Seneski","Yes Adam, I\u2019ll start by saying and you will see it on the fixed income call later. Our business continues to perform extraordinarily well. As you know, our standard line, our origination practices haven't changed, and we feel very good about the performance of our portfolio and what we are originating. ","The entire auto financing market, it really is a balance. You said pick one thing; I don't know what the one thing is. Leasing is pretty high. You are seeing extended terms grow, and you are seeing subprime grow. So with that, if there\u2019s big changes in variable marketing strategies, if there\u2019s big spikes in interest rates, those are the types of things that are going to create imbalances. The goal is to manage that and manage that within a construct that optimizes your risk appetite, and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re doing in Ford Credit.","Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley","Thanks Mike. Thanks Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks.","Operator","And we have the next question. It comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the Asia Pac build-out. I know you said costs will be a little bit higher; you've got a lot of plants coming on. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, I think that bleeds into \u201815. So should we expect those costs while they may ebb and flow per quarter, to persist for about another year?","Bob Shanks","Well, I think until we see an end of growth, and frankly we don't, we\u2019ll continue to find opportunities to invest in the business. So if you go back and look at the last number of years, we\u2019ve been consistently seeing an increase in structural costs, but going back to Mark's earlier comment, it\u2019s all been very well planned, very thought through, connected directly to revenue growth that we expect to get from that and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. ","Now what you\u2019re seeing is the balance between the costs and the revenue are starting to shift. So in the past it was costs and revenue ahead of us. Now you are starting to see some of that revenue come on stream. It\u2019s exceeding the cost, so we are starting to see the good, strong results and I think that change of balance will continue as we move forward. ","So I think you will see cost increases. Well, you definitely will see cost increases in the second half versus the first half which I already mentioned. For the reasons I mentioned, some seasonality, but also the continued investment. I would expect that would continue as we go into the forward years, as long as we find opportunities to grow the business, but the top line will grow more.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets","Right. And then just in Europe, everything seems a little bit better. I know you expressed some caution over Russia. Is it fair to say that even though the outlook is unchanged, maybe core or sort of Western Europe is a little bit better and Russia is maybe dragging that down a little bit?","Mark Fields","Well, overall when you look at our performance this year and our goal for profitability for 2015, at this point we don't see issues in Russia affecting our ability to reach profitability in 2015. ","Clearly when you look at Russia, the current environment is difficult. But it's a big, it's an important market, and it has the potential as you know to be the largest market in Europe over time, and the business environment right now as Bob mentioned earlier, it\u2019s very challenging and fluid. You got GDP that\u2019s slowing down, which is affecting the industry sales; the weak ruble; the segment shifts of consumers from cars to some of the SUVs and of course overlaid by the geopolitical issues. ","So we are working with our partners in Ford Sollers to improve the business outlook, take the appropriate actions. The team is on it, and the senior team is meeting very regularly on this and just using our process of always looking at that business environment and understanding what do we have to do to maximize or minimize impacts on the business.","Operator","We have the next question and it comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Mark Fields","Thanks Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","So, I think that the profit in Europe obviously stands out for investors today. It looked like a lot of the improvement in 2Q and so far for you there it relates really to the contribution and structural cost lines, I guess explained by lower restructuring cost and now restructuring savings. ","In some of our previous conversations though, I think you suggested that the turnaround in Europe also hinges upon stronger pricing, which we haven't seen a whole lot of yet. I believe you have the goal of pricing comparably in the market to a brand like Volkswagen, sort of similar to how you price as well or stronger than Toyota in the U.S. now. ","So is it fair that the improvement in Europe this year is still going to be more about the cost and restructuring side? When do we see the pricing benefits? Is that more of a 2015 thing? And maybe if you could just take a moment to walk us through your strategy to get better priced in Europe, talk a little bit about the product push and maybe some of these headlines that we are seeing about this Vignale branding? Thanks.","Bob Shanks","Yes, I think you\u2019re right. The overall transformation plan, which is very much on track was around the three things that I referenced earlier in the upfront comments, around the brand product and cost, and we are seeing progress in all those fronts. ","The brand favorability is improving. The team is doing a great job on the network and working with our dealers and their go-to-market strategies. In terms of product, we\u2019ve had quite a number of products that have launched successfully. ","We\u2019ve got more ahead of us and as part of that, if you remember our conversations on that, it\u2019s also to start to kind of if you will, pull the average of the portfolio higher in terms of overall mix and that will come from products that include imports from other parts of Ford, such as the next-generation Edge, the Mustang and other things that we\u2019ve got coming. The Vignale series that Mark touched on earlier, that\u2019s another part of our strategy to move sort of the center of gravity of the portfolio up. ","We\u2019ve sort of held our line this year, year-over-year in terms of pricing and that\u2019s an environment that still is very difficult in terms of where everyone is struggling to get that extra unit in a market that\u2019s still quite low, although it's improved from where it had been. And I think as you go forward, we expect as more of the new product gets out, we continue to work on all of these aspects of our brand and the overall business that we\u2019ll start to be able to see more of the improvement in the pricing area above the line, if you will. ","But I think we feel kind of good about where we are and we might see a little bit of improvement in the second half versus the first half as we get more of the new products out there, like the Mondeo, but yes, that\u2019s part of the plan and we feel pretty much on track with regard to it. Mark?","Mark Fields","Yes Ryan, just to put a couple more things to that, we are confident in the trajectory that we are on in Europe for the reasons Bob mentioned. In addition, our plan has always revolved around product, brand and cost and as you pointed out, the team is making very good progress on cost. ","As Bob mentioned, brand is doing well in terms of favorable opinion and on the product side, interestingly enough, when you look at our sales in the first half of this year, over 50% of our sales are on these new products that we\u2019ve introduced over the last year or so. So we think that bodes well. Our retail percent of the industry is higher as a percentage of our sales than the rest of the industry. ","So we\u2019re really pleased by the response from our European consumers, and with the products coming up, the Focus, the Mondeo, two very important, high-volume products and in some cases high-image products, followed by the Mustang, the Edge, and the Vignale series, we think positions us well for growth going forward and also buttressed by our commercial business, with our full revamp of the entire Transit lineup. ","We\u2019ve had the highest share in the first half of this year since 1997 I believe, and I think that will also bode well to allow the business to grow and allow us to achieve our profitability in 2015, which is obviously a very important goal for us.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Okay, great, thanks. Very helpful, and for my second and last question, on the really strong results in China, obviously great volume and share improvement; I\u2019m curious if you can give us a sense of the margins you earn there on your joint ventures. I think investors tried to claim some understanding by examining Changan\u2019s financials. ","Is there anything you can say on the margins now and also where you think that they can go? Is there any reason why you couldn't achieve the type of margins over time in that country, that say GM and Volkswagen currently earn? What are the gives and takes there? Maybe you don't have the luxury exposure, but presumably you've got a lot of SUV exposure, which is presumably high margin and I know you hope to grow Lincoln over time.","Bob Shanks","Yes. We haven't disclosed those types of details, but I will tell you Ryan that the margins that we\u2019re getting from our joint ventures in China are extremely healthy and I think we can aspire to the types of margins that you are seeing from other competitors there. ","The business is very well structured. We are managing extremely well supply and demand; if anything, we kind of struggle to keep up with the demand. As Mark and I both mentioned, the brand is very well regarded in the market, so it's just kind of positives all around. ","So I think margin is extremely healthy and I think they can potentially even be healthier as we continue to kind of fill out the portfolio. Again, improve the overall mix as we add higher priced vehicles. ","I should also mention that we\u2019ve also got a pretty healthy import business as well. Products such as the Explorer; the Edge is coming in, and of course Lincoln we have a lot of great expectations of, and that will clearly be a plus for the business.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Great, thanks. Congrats again.","Mark Fields","Thank you.","Operator","And we have the next question. It comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please proceed.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Good morning guys. ","Mark Fields","Hey John.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Just a first question on CapEx at $7.5 billion this year. That includes a lot of expansion o investment, particularly in China. I'm presuming some of that does level off a little bit as we get into \u201815 and \u201816. Do you think you could pull back on CapEx or do you think you might just level it out at these levels, even on a base of a larger business? I\u2019m just trying to understand the context of CapEx going forward, when we get through this big growth spurt.","Bob Shanks","Yes, I wouldn't assume that the CapEx level is off, because we\u2019ve got some really great and exciting growth plans for the business, so we\u2019ll continue to invest as long as we see those opportunities. ","One thing I just want to caution you on is that the investments in China are largely made by the joint ventures, which don't show up in our CapEx. That would be incremental if you will. We might have some more to say on this on Investor Day, which we sent out a notice on that for September 29, but yes, I wouldn\u2019t build into your models that the CapEx is going to be declining or flattening out.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Okay, and then just a second question. Traditionally, the Expedition and Navigator have come just about a year after the F-150 launch and off the same platform and I was just curious, as we think about this going forward, I\u2019m presuming the F-150 goes as well as you\u2019re expecting. ","That seems like that would come a year after and the benefits of the light-weighting and mass reduction that you are executing on the F-150 might be even more important on a large SUV, because on a large SUV with a 30 mpg or close to that, would resonate pretty big with consumers, to get a vehicle that large with that kind of mpg and hauling seven, eight kids around is something that a lot of people would like in this country. ","I\u2019m just curious if you can comment on that or there would be any reason that there will be a change in the platform strategy between the F-150 and the Expedition and Navigator.","Mark Fields","Thanks John. I\u2019m still getting my head around eight to nine kids that you're hauling around, but\u2026","John Murphy - Bank of America","Well yes, but that's not me. That's not \u2013 sorry.","Mark Fields","That being said, as you know we are just coming out with a major refresh in Expedition and Navigator and clearly we\u2019re very excited about bringing those products to our customers. Not at liberty to talk about our product plans going forward, but clearly as you look at our ONE Ford plan and our whole approach of looking at platforms, looking at trying to get reductions in those platforms to get scale efficiencies, to provide even greater value to our customers, is something that we are going to continue to execute as a company, and that\u2019s about all I can say at this point.","John Murphy - Bank of America","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","","Mark Fields","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And now we\u2019ll take questions from the media section. (Operator Instructions). And we have a question from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin from AP. Please go ahead. Please proceed.","Dee-Ann Durbin - AP","Good morning, Mark. Thanks for taking the call, and I\u2019ll stick with two kids too by the way. I\u2019m hearing a lot of Mulallyisms in your comments this morning, relentless implementation, compelling vision and it makes me wonder what we should be looking for in terms of your own mark on the company. What are we going to see in the remainder of this year and beyond that signals there\u2019s new leadership?","Mark Fields","Well, it's a great question Dee-Ann. I think just to put things in perspective, I had the opportunity to sit side-by-side with Alan for the last eight years in terms of developing the strategy and then the implementation of that. So the indication that there has to be a new strategy, because there\u2019s a new person sitting in the chair, I wouldn't necessarily assume that. ","My message to our team internally and now externally is one of continuity, but also acceleration of our plan, of our working together, the way we run the company, our product passion, bringing even more innovations to the marketplace and I think that message of continuity and acceleration resonates with our team, particularly in an environment where there is lots going on in the industry, lots going on around the world and we can stay very focused on those things that have brought us to this point as a company and provides us a great foundation to move the company forward. ","Dee-Ann Durbin - AP","Thank you. ","Mark Fields","Thanks Dee-Ann.","Operator","And we have the next question from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Please proceed.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Hi, good morning everybody. I think I\u2019m still part of the analyst group, not the media, but I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re taking my question, so thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you a little bit more specifically on the timing of the cost and benefits from the launch of the F-150. You gave a lot of good detail on when the downtime would be. ","Now the eight weeks seem to be falling nicely half-and-half between 3Q and 4Q, but then there\u2019s some summer shutdowns in the third quarter and then on the other hand in the fourth quarter there may be some production already of the new ones and high pricing. How do you think about between 3Q and 4Q, if there is any strong difference in terms of North American cost and profitability? ","Bob Shanks","I\u2019ll answer that and if Mark has anything to add, he will follow. But the way I guess I would think about it is third quarter is the launch quarter and I\u2019m talking about the new F-150, because remember, all the way through this, all the way through the third and fourth quarter, Kansas City is still producing the present F-150 until it gets to its own launch in the first half of next year.","So that continues apace, so we are able to continue to supply the dealers with that product, which transaction prices continue to be highest in the segment and we are just doing extremely well with that, even in the balance out, so that continues. ","In Dearborn, I would think of third quarter as launch, because we\u2019ve already mentioned that much of the quarter will be actually not producing anything as we transition to the new products and some of that continues in the early fourth. There will be units that will be released to dealers in the quarter and so that will be a benefit, but I would clearly think about the real impact of F-150 on the bottom line as being more of a \u201815 phenomenon than a \u201814 phenomenon, the new F-150. ","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Understood, and so any major differences in profitability between three and fourth quarter or are we just assuming from now on this is sort of like the launch and then the benefit is in 2015? ","Bob Shanks","There will be an impact in both quarters from the launch, but you\u2019ll have more of those down weeks I believe in the third quarter than you\u2019ll have in the fourth quarter. And clearly when we are down, we are not producing, so the profit effect would be a little bit greater in terms of the launch cost, launch effect in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. ","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Okay, now that's very clear. And then just back to Asia Pacific and I guess specifically China, you\u2019ve done a phenomenal job growing market share from what used to be about 3% or so a couple of years ago to now some 4.6% in the second quarter. ","At the same time, when we look at sort of like share growth, it\u2019s been really good, but it sort of like seems to be stabilizing around these levels. You did 4.6% this quarter; it was 4.5% last quarter; it was 4.3% just a year ago in the second quarter, and a lot of your new product has actually already come out in China. ","There is obviously much more production facility to come; but in terms of the introductions I see a lot of it has come in. Do you still expect a 6% market share that\u2019s sort of like the achievable goal in the near term? I think that used to be your 2015 goal, and if so, how did you get there? ","Bob Shanks","Well, we have more new products coming, so we are clearly not finished with the product. We have quite a bit more new product coming over the next few years and looking for additional opportunities. We have more capacity coming and the way I think about the share improvement and actually its I think a couple years ago; it might have been more in the 2%-ish range, and again that's 2% of a massive industry remember, so the absolutes in terms of the volumes are quite large. ","But I would go back to a comment Mark made in reference to something else. I would think about the share improvement as relentless implementation and execution. We are just going to just keep growing and growing and just hope to see that relentless coming through in our bottom line, as well as in our share improvement. ","So we are not trying to win in a burst. This is sort of a marathon, and we\u2019re going to just keep going forward and keep growing and leverage every opportunity that we can find. So we celebrate two or three-tenths; it's great. ","Operator","And we have a next question. It comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Hi everybody. ","Mark Fields","Hey Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Just to Murphy's question, if you got eight or nine kids, you might want to rename the vehicle from Expedition to Evacuation. ","Mark Fields","We already have a vehicle named Escape, so\u2026 ","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Yes, that's true. Well, when do we get the specs for the fuel economy on the new F-150 and when is the initial shipping release date to dealers? I know you guys tend to hold a bit of inventory initially as part of the quality process. And also on North America, are you still \u2013 I would imagine you are, but you did explicitly mention last quarter that you were expecting North American margins potentially to hit the upper end of the guidance. ","Mark Fields","Okay, when you look at the number of the questions, Rod we go to manufacturing launch in the fourth quarter, so you\u2019ll start to see some units show up at dealerships by the end of the year and we are very excited about making sure that we do that. ","From the second question around the fuel economy, as you saw yesterday, we announced the capability figures for the vehicle, which were very well received. We are working through our normal process on fuel economy, in terms of looking at the labels and making sure they get certified. So you\u2019ll see that in the next number of weeks as we close out on that process and follow that process with the EPA. ","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and just two other quickly. In Europe your contribution costs have been improving despite the new product. Can you just comment on the sustainability of that and in South America, the structural costs have been on the rise. What\u2019s the plan to address that aspect of the profit outlook? ","Bob Shanks","Yes, just two things. First of all, on the European question, I would expect us to start to see added product costs coming in there with the launch of the Mondeo and the Focus. So we\u2019ll continue to see good results in terms of our material cost reductions, but you will start to see, just as I talked about for North America, you\u2019ll start to see product costs start to come through there. ","In the case of South America, that\u2019s an interesting question. To some extent you do see in those numbers what you see in the other business units, which is the investments for growth as we continue to transition the portfolio to the global ONE Ford products, but a lot of this is the effect of high local inflation. You\u2019ve got inflation in a 50%, 60% range in Venezuela. What is it, Joe? 30%, 40% or something like that in Argentina; 6% in Brazil. ","So really when you're looking at South America, you have to look at that pricing number, which looks great. But you have to at the same time look within the cost increases, including material cost, because you see a lot of negative commodity cost coming through, because its dollar based and so in that particular region it comes through as a cost increase, because of the impact of the weaker currency. ","So there is that inflation effect and then you\u2019ve got the exchange effect. It\u2019s just they are all related to each other. And as I mentioned in the comments earlier, we aren't actually, even with the pricing, fully offsetting the effect of inflation through the income statement and adverse operating exchange. So you got to look at all those three together. ","Operator","And we have a next question and it comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Great, thanks, good morning. So first question on North America margins, in the next few quarters we clearly have some noise with the F-150 launch. But you did do a 9.5% margin in the first half, maybe even north of 10% excluding the warranty. Is the first half a good baseline for us to model for 2015 once you get through all the launches or are there some things going on this year versus next year that might not create that as a good baseline for modeling purposes? ","Bob Shanks","Itay, all I would say is what we\u2019ve said consistently for quite some time, is that we see the business in North America as capable of and targeting an 8% to 10% margin over time. And this year as you said, in the first half, 9.5%, but clearly we\u2019ve guided that for second for a number of different reasons, including seasonality will be lower, but still strong, but we see it at 8% to 9% and I think that is what I would assume as I\u2019m looking at the forward years. ","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Great. And then the second question, just a big picture on Asia Pacific. It looks like based on your guidance you\u2019ll probably maybe be at pretax profits of roughly $700 million, about double where you were last year. I know the mid-decade outlook is for that region to contribute very meaningfully. Maybe you can just help us with the overall glide path to kind of what roughly very meaningfully sort of means and then how should we think about that glide path over the next, let's say year or two? ","Bob Shanks","Yes, I think we\u2019ll take a save on that. Well, maybe that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll touch on at Investor Day, because I\u2019d like to keep the focus today on this year and the quarter. But clearly, what you said about where this business is going is how we are seeing it and how we are thinking about it, but I don't think I\u2019d get into it any further than that today. ","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Okay, great. We\u2019ll look forward to the September Investor Day. Thanks a lot. ","Bob Shanks","Okay, great. See you then. ","Operator","That was our last question. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks. ","George Sharp","Okay, terrific. Thanks everyone. That will wrap up today's presentation.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Mr. Sharp.","George Sharp","Thank you, Glenn, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time [Technical Difficulty] third quarter 2014 financial results.","Now presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, our Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Now copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on our Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Now any non-GAAP measure is reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck, and final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance, of course, actual results could be different.","The most significant factors that could affect our future results are summarized at the end of the presentation and detailed in our SEC filings.","With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks, George. Today we will review our third quarter financial results, the details behind them, and our outlook ahead. So let\u2019s get right into the first slide.","Our results this quarter are underpinned, once again by our ONE Ford plan which remains unchanged. We are continuing to focus on all four elements of our plan; they served us well and will continue to be our focus going forward. We also plan to build on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. In many ways we are just starting to see the full benefits and strength of ONE Ford and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward.","At the same time, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation. We are committed to building on the product strength today, with even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward.","So now let\u2019s turn to Slide 2 for a look at the third quarter. The third quarter was our 21st consecutive profitable quarter and we ended the period with strong liquidity. Automotive operating related cash flow however was negative due to unfavorable changes in the working capital, including product launch effects. Third quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined year-over-year by 3% and 2% respectively. Market share however was higher in Europe and our third quarter record in Asia Pacific, where we once again delivered a record share in China.","North America and Asia Pacific were profitable where pre-tax results were lower than a year ago for all of our automotive business units, except Middle East and Africa. Ford Credit delivered strong results that were better than a year ago. Company\u2019s pre-tax profit was in line with our expectation and consistent with the guidance we provided at the September Investor Day of company full year pre-tax profit of about $6 billion which we are reconfirming today. It was however, lower than a year ago. This is more than explained by three factors; lower volume, higher warranty costs, and adverse balance sheet exchange effects.","The lower volume was in North America, reflecting product launch effects and part shortages due to supplier issues, and in South America where industry sales declined due to the deteriorating external conditions. The higher warranty costs were mainly in North America, and were primarily due to recalls. And finally the adverse balance sheet exchange effects were largely in South America and accounted for about one-third of the regions lower profit.","Looking ahead, 12 of our 23 global product launches are now complete and the balance are continuing to progress, including the all new F-150. And these launches along with the 16 planned for 2015 are expected to result next year in higher revenue, improved operating margin, and a company pre-tax profit of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion.","So let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 to recap some of the quarter\u2019s other achievements. Other third quarter highlights include the start of production of several products, including the all-new 2015 Mustang, and the Lincoln MKZ, and MKC for China. We also announced the new C-MAX, brand C-MAX and S-MAX in Europe. We also announced that we\u2019re bringing 25 new vehicles to Middle East and Africa by 2016.","Seven Ford vehicles finished in the Top Three of their segment in the J.D. Power and Fuel Study with F-150 and super duty F-250 and F-350 ranking highest in their segments.","We hosted the industry\u2019s first App Developer Conference, and we were active in job creating including new jobs in Kansas City, Louisville, and Asia Pacific to support our growth initiatives. Finally, we completed our previously announced share repurchase program that reduced our diluted shares by about 3%.","So now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob who will take us through our financial results. Bob?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start at the top on Slide 4, third quarter wholesale volume was 1.5 million units, down 52,000 units from a year ago; and revenue was $34.9 billion, down $900 million. Pre-tax profit was $1.2 billion, excluding special items; $1.4 billion lower than a year ago.","After-tax earnings per share at $0.24 were $0.21 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges was $835 million, [Technical Difficulty] year ago. Earnings were $0.21 a share, down $0.10. Pre-tax special item charges were $160 million in the quarter reflecting separation related actions largely in Europe to support our transformation plan.","Automotive operating related cash flow was negative $700 million, and automotive gross cash was $22.8 billion, exceeding debt by $7.9 billion. Our third quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown was 31%, which is lower than our prior guidance. We continue to expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be about 35%, assuming retroactive extension of U.S. Research Credit Legislation in the fourth quarter.","In the first nine months period vehicle wholesales were up slightly from a year ago, while the company revenue decreased by 1%. First nine months pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $5.2 billion, a decline of $2.1 billion, and net income was $3.1 billion, $1 billion lower than a year ago.","As shown on Slide 5, both our Automotive and Financial Services sectors contributed to the company\u2019s third quarter pre-tax profit. As shown in the memo, company\u2019s third quarter pre-tax profit declined compared to the prior year and prior quarter, both more than explained by automotive.","The key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business in the third quarter are shown on Slide 6. As you can see on the far left, wholesale volume and revenue decreased by 3% compared with a year ago. The lower volume is more than explained by an unfavorable change in dealer stocks related to product launch effects and supplier part shortages as well as declining industry volume in South America. Higher industry volumes in other regions were a partial offset.","Global industry SAAR is estimated at 86.7 million units, up 3% from a year ago. And Ford\u2019s global market share is estimated at 7.4%, unchanged from a year ago. Operating margin was 2.5%, down 4.5 percentage points from a year ago, and automotive pre-tax profit was $686 million, down $1.5 billion.","As shown in the memo below the chart, first nine months volume was up slightly from a year ago, while automotive revenue was down 2%. Operating margin at 4.2% was down two percentage points. Total automotive pre-tax profit at $3.8 billion was down $2.2 billion. The lower results were driven by North and South America, all other business units included.","Slide 7 shows the factors that contributed to the $1.5 billion decline in third quarter automotive pre-tax profit. The lower profit is largely explained by higher warranty cost including recalls, mainly in North America, and lower volume in North and South America, as well as $166 million for the adverse balance sheet exchange effects, mainly in South America. All other factors largely offset each other.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion lower than second quarter, largely explained by lower volume, mainly in North America and Europe, as well as higher warranty cost in North America.","Slide 8 shows third quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. North America and Asia Pacific were profitable but the other business units reported losses. Other Automotive reflects net interest expense which we continue to expect to be about $700 million for the full year.","Now we\u2019ll look at each of our regions within the automotive sector, starting on Slide 9 with North America. North America\u2019s continue to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product line-up, continued discipline in matching production to demand, and a lean cost structure, but our third quarter results were affected adversely by higher warranty cost and lower volume.","North America third quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 8% and 6%, respectively. This decrease was explained primarily by product launch effects, including five weeks of downtime in the quarter at the Dearborn Truck Plant for the F-150 launch and supplier part shortages.","U.S. third quarter industry SAAR was 17.2 million units, 1.1 million units higher than a year ago. Our U.S. market share deteriorated eight-tenth of a percentage point to 14.1%, reflecting a planned reduction in daily rental sales, and lower F-150 share as we prepare for the new vehicle by continuing to balance share, transaction prices, and stocks.","As shown in appendix seven, our U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 13%, down two-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago. North America\u2019s decline in revenue is more than explained by the lower wholesale volume. North America operating margin was 7.1%, down 3.8 percentage points from last year, and pre-tax profit was a $1.4 billion, down $886 million. Excluding the higher warranty costs which were entirely associated with recalls, North Americas operating margin would have been 10.2%.","As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine month metrics declined from the year ago with lower warranty \u2013 our lower volume and higher warranty costs including recalls more than explaining the lower operating margin and pre-tax profit.","On Slide 10 we show the factors contributing to North America\u2019s lower third quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher warranty cost and lower [Technical Difficulty] like the recent restraint control module recall announced last month, as well as reserve changes related to the other field service actions. As mentioned previously, product launch effects and supplier part shortages drove the lower volume.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was lower than second quarter, more than explained by unfavorable volume mix and higher warranty costs.","Turning to full year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pre-tax profit to be lower than 2013, and operating margin to be at the low end of the 8% to 9% range.","Alright, now let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and review South America, where we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up, and have replaced legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. We\u2019re also working to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth, declining industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries.","In the third quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased from the year ago by 21% and 17% respectively. The lower volume was explained primarily by a 700,000 unit decline from last year\u2019s SAAR of 5.7 million units. This reflects the impact of the weakening economy in Brazil, import restrictions in Argentina, and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of U.S. dollars. Also contributing is a non-repeat of last year\u2019s stock build.","South America market share at 8.8% was down four-tenths of a percentage point, more than explained by the phase-out of Fiesta Classic. The revenue decline is more than explained by the lower volume and weaker currencies, higher pricing was a partial offset.","Operating margin was negative 7.3%, down significantly from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $170 million, a deterioration of $330 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine months metrics deteriorated from a year ago driven by the adverse change in external factors. The first nine month loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects.","On Slide 12 we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America\u2019s third quarter pre-tax results. The lower results were driven primarily by lower volume and adverse balance sheet exchange effects. As shown in the memo, pre-tax results improved compared with second quarter, more than explained by higher pricing and other effects associated with introduction of the new car in Brazil. Constant well received by media and initial reaction from customers is very encouraging. For the full year we continue to expect South America to incur a loss of about $1 billion.","Let\u2019s turn now to Europe, beginning on Slide 13, where we continue to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. Europe\u2019s wholesale volume and revenue improved from a year ago by 6% and 7% respectively. The higher volume reflects a 700,000 unit increase in Europe 20 SAAR to 14.5 million units, higher market share and lower dealer stock reductions than a year ago. Lower volumes in Russia and Turkey were partial offset.","The focus on our transformation plan on improved product and brand led to great progress in the third quarter. Our Europe 20 market share improved four-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4%, this reflects two factors; a 0.5 percentage point improvement in our regional passenger share of the five major European markets to 8.8%, including the effect of our expanded SUV line-up. And secondly, a two percentage point improvement in our commercial vehicles share to 13%, reflecting the success of our full line of new Transit vehicles and continued strong performance of the Ranger compact pickup. The increase in Europe\u2019s revenue is explained by the higher volume in the Europe 20 markets.","Europe\u2019s operating margin was negative 6.4%, down 3.6 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $439 million, a $257 million decline. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine month metrics improved from a year ago.","Slide 14 shows the factors that contributed to the decline in Europe\u2019s third quarter pre-tax results. The decline is more than explained by Russia, balance sheet exchange effects and other factors including lower component pricing and non-recurrence of prior year gains.","As shown in the memo below the chart, pre-tax results were lower than second quarter. This is more than explained by lower volume due to Europe\u2019s seasonal plant shutdowns for summer holidays, unfavorable exchange, and higher cost including non-recurrence of a restructuring related reserve released last quarter.","For the full year, we continue to expect a loss of $1.2 billion, an improvement compared with 2013.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 15 and review Middle East and Africa which is now its own geographic segment in order to facilitate better customer service, and further expand for its presence in this fast growing region. Middle East and Africa\u2019s wholesale volume and revenue improved from the year ago by 9% and 5% respectively.","Operating margin was negative 1.4%, one percentage point better than year ago, and pre-tax loss was $15 million, $10 million better. As shown in the memo below the chart, first nine months wholesale volume and revenue deteriorated slightly compared with year ago, while operating margin and profit both improved.","For the full year, we continue to expect Middle East and Africa results to be about [Technical Difficulty].","Right, let\u2019s now review Asia Pacific on Slide 16. Our strategy in Asia Pacific continues to be to invest for growth through both, new and expanded plants, new products, and the introduction of Lincoln in China. As shown on the left, third quarter wholesale volume was up 5% compared with a year ago, and net revenue which excludes our China joint ventures grew 3%. Our China wholesale volume, not shown, was up 10% in the quarter.","The higher volume in the region is more than explained by higher market share and industry volume. We estimate third quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, up 1.8 million units from a year ago, explained primarily by China.","Our market share at 3.6% was a record for the third quarter, and was two-tenths of a percentage point higher than a year ago. This was driven by China where our market share improved four-tenths of a percentage point to a record 4.7% reflecting continued strong sales across our vehicle line-up. Asia Pacific\u2019s higher revenue is more than explained by favorable mix.","Operating margin was 1.7%, down 2.9 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax profit was $44 million, down $72 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine month metrics improved from a year ago.","Slide 17 shows the decline in Asia Pacific\u2019s third quarter pre-tax profit. It\u2019s more than explained by higher structural cost and unfavorable exchange with favorable market factors being a partial offset. The higher structural cost reflects our continued investment in products and growth including five new plants that will come online over the next nine months, as well as the launch of Lincoln.","As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific pre-tax results declined from second quarter, with most factors unfavorable. For the full year we continue to expect Asia Pacific to earn a pre-tax profit of about $700 million, which is higher than a year ago.","Let\u2019s turn now on Slide 18 to Ford Credit, which is an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy. Ford Credit provides world class dealer and customer financial services, supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford.","Ford Credit\u2019s higher pre-tax profit this quarter compared with the year ago is more than explained by a higher volume, this reflects increases in nearly all financing products including non-consumer and consumer finance receivables globally, as well as leasing in North America.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than second quarter, explained primarily by a lower level of insurance losses in North America which is included in other. For the full year we continue to expect Ford Credit profits to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Our guidance for Ford Credit year end managed receivables and managed leverage also is unchanged. We now expect Ford Credits distributions to its parent to be about $400 million, up from our prior guidance of about $250 million. This increase is driven by higher net income at Ford Credit.","Next on Slide 19 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $22.8 billion, decreases of $3 billion from the end of the second quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was negative $700 million. This is more than explained by unfavorable changes in working capital including the effects of the five weeks of downtime in the quarter at the Dearborn Truck Plant as we transition to the new F-150 as well as supplied part shortages. In the fourth quarter we expect working capital changes to be positive.","During the quarter debt repayments and pension contributions totaled $600 million. And dividends paid were about $500 million while other items include about $1.1 billion related to the stock buyback program that we completed in the quarter.","Slide 20 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $14.9 billion, $500 million lower than second quarter. We ended the quarter with net cash at $7.9 billion and automotive liquidity of $33.6 billion. Earlier this week, we gave notice the holders of our 2016 convertible notes, determine a conversion rights and redeem outstanding notes. This action will reduce automotive debt by about $800 million in the fourth quarter with no significant impact on cash flow.","So this concludes our review of the financial details of our third quarter earnings. So now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark, who will take us through our outlook for the business environment, as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark?","Mark Fields","Thanks, Bob. Slide 21 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% range, with conditions in Europe and South America particular concern.","Global industry sales are expected to be about 87 million units. U.S. economic indicators and industry sales have remained steady through the third quarter, consistent with economic growth in the 3% range. In South America, Brazil is in recession with election related policy uncertainty. Negative growth also is expected in Argentina and Venezuela with ongoing policy and exchange risk.","In Europe, incoming data has weakened, with Euro area GDP growth projected to be less than 1% this year. Conditions in the U.K. however are more favorable with growth projected in the 3% range. Although not shown, the outlook for Russia is challenging and fluid, with very slow GDP growth, inflationary pressures and a weaker currency.","In Asia Pacific, China\u2019s economic growth [Technical Difficulty] range with the ongoing property market weakness reflected in our outlook for 2014. Consumer sentiment supports continued growth in vehicle sales but at a more modest pace in the second half.","With initial signs of improvement, growth in India is now projected to be in the 5% to 5.5% range. Challenges remain however with high inflation and interest rates as elements [ph] to stronger growth.","Overall, despite challenges in some key markets, we expect the global economy to grow in 2014 and be supportive of a projection for higher global industry volume this year.","Slide 22 recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for our business unit, as well as for automotive net interest expense. Full year guidance is unchanged for all business units and consistent with their Investor Day outlook.","Our company guidance for 2014 is detailed on Slide 23. We now expect full year industry volume of about 16.8 million units in the U.S., about 14.5 million units in the Europe 20 markets, and about 23.8 million units in China.","In terms of our financial performance, we continue to expect automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013, automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013. Automotive operating related cash flow to be lower than 2013, including capital spending of about $7.5 billion. Ford Credit pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion and company pre-tax profit of about $6 billion.","2014 is a critical next step in implementing our ONE Ford plan to deliver profitable growth for all, including strong growth and much improved financial results in 2015 and beyond. As we communicated at our Investor Day event, we expect 2015 company pre-tax profit to be in the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion range.","In closing, our ONE Ford plan is built on compelling vision, comprehensive strategy, and relentless implementation, all leading to profitable growth around the world. We are confident in the continued success of our ONE Ford plan, and in fact are accelerating our pace of progress.","The third quarter was challenging but we remain absolutely focused on implementing our plan as we work towards the end of the year, and this includes continued strength from North America, although down from recent years as we launched three times the number of products as last year; a loss in South America, as we respond to a changed environment and continued risk in the region; continued execution of our transformation plan for Europe, even as we work through challenges, primarily in Russia; establishing our Middle East and Africa business unit; continued strong growth and profitability in Asia Pacific; consistent solid performance from our Ford Credit operations, and positive automotive operating related cash flow.","So now let\u2019s open it up to your questions. So, George you want to lead us through that?","George Sharp","Thanks, Mark. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community and then we\u2019ll take questions from the media. Now as always, in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Glenn, can we have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Thanks for taking my question. One of the big concerns coming out of Investor Day was the profitability of the new F-150. And I was just wondering how we should be thinking about that because you seemed reluctant to be very committed about how profitable it will be but you also said it has [indiscernible] to customers yet. I mean should we be concerned about the content of being added or is the uncertainty really reflecting that it hasn\u2019t been delivered to customers so you don\u2019t have a good gauge of what the eventual pricing on the product is going to be?","Bob Shanks","Hey Colin, thank you very much for the question, obviously an area that continues to be on the mind of investors. We\u2019re not going to get into specific margins of profitability any particular vehicle line but everyone knows how profitable the F-150 is to the company and for the company, and we expect that to continue going forward. When we think about next year and the guidance that we gave for North America, the 8% to 9% [ph] and that triggered a lot of the questions. We need to remind ourselves that we don\u2019t get the both plants, Dearborn and Kansas City up and running until we get into the second quarter. So clearly, that impact has an effect on what we\u2019re seeing for the margins of the whole business unit.","If I go back and look at the present generation of the F-150, we saw margins improve over the course of that product cycle life. Must wait and see what happens with the new one, but we\u2019ve got lots of things planned on F-150 once you\u2019re going to see when we come out, I think that will be very exciting, consumers are going to respond positively to that. And we expect it to be a huge success for us and to contribute very significantly to the bottom line. So it\u2019s all I want to say on that. It\u2019s a great product and it\u2019s going to be very good for the business and we think even better as we go through the business planning period.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay. And I guess my second question, there was an article in the journal earlier this week talking about some potential issues that some of the [Technical Difficulty]. Can you give an update on how the launch is progressing if there is any sort of headwinds that are arising?","Mark Fields","Thanks, Colin. This is Mark. As you know, launches are a complex thing but we are absolutely on plan with the launch and it\u2019s progressing well. As you know, we\u2019ve had eight weeks of downtime for the changeover at our Dearborn Truck Plant that was completed. We now have started mass production and we are exactly where we expected to be at this point. The plant is up and running and I was actually down at the plant earlier this week, our employees, they are all trained, they are excited, they are energized. And we\u2019re confident that all of the preparations that have positioned us for a quality launch, and positioned just to had vehicles and dealerships with initial sales by the end of this year as we planned.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay, that sounds good. Thank you very much.","Mark Fields","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Galves with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. In the U.S. it looks to us like pricing on pickup trucks continues to be very strong and pricing on the car side or the super segments is a little bit weaker, is that your read of the situation as well, and is there any way you can give us some broad strokes on what drove the positive year-over-year pricing in North America by segment?","Mark Fields","I\u2019ll take that first part of that Daniel. Yes, I would characterize it as you mentioned, when you look at the truck and SUV side of the business, the pricing has been good. In our own case, even with the \u2013 lets choose F-150 as an example, our outgoing F-150, our transaction prices are up, our incentives levels are below and well below some of our competitors. When you look at the car side, if you look at what\u2019s happened with the segment shift, consumer preferences, they are moving more towards utility, and that is putting pressure on the car side of the business and I think you\u2019re seeing a number of competitors who have capacity there, getting more aggressive in the marketplace. And in our case, we\u2019re going to be balanced as we look at the marketplace in terms of the value and the incentives that we provide to our customers. I would characterize it as you mentioned it. Bob, you want to answer the second part?","Bob Shanks","Yes, when you look at \u2013 and I\u2019m on Slide 10 Daniel, but when you look at North America\u2019s pricing and just the pricing element, that\u2019s really near $40 million. The majority of that was actually on carryover vehicles, we did have some good news on some of the products we launched in the first half, it was mostly on carryover and it\u2019s a line-up with Mark \u2013 with Mark said, that was more than explained by positive pricing on trucks and utilities, we actually had negative pricing on cars. So I conclude consistent with the scenario that we outlined.","Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. And then just a follow up, do you expect those trends to continue, how does the pricing on trucks kind of manifest as the present F-150 and the new F-150 start to kind of be at dealer at the same time? And then on the daily rental side, can you tell us what part of the market share decline was due to daily rental and why are you deciding to decrease daily rental sales at this time?","Mark Fields","In the first part of your question, yes, we expect the trends as we see the pricing this year, to flow into next year, and that\u2019s part of the reason as we\u2019ve guided to North America as 8% to 9% margins next year and we \u2013 our view is we\u2019re going to continue to see a lot of competitiveness on the car side of the business, particularly with some of our competitors having some artificial advantages around currency and things of that nature. When you look at \u2013 even with regards to that, our whole strategy around investing in product excellence, we have a number of very strong products coming out on the car side as we get into next year, particular focus, the best-selling car in the world, our new one is coming, it will be in showrooms in the first part of next year.","On daily rental, as you\u2019ve seen a part of \u2013 when you look at the eight-tenths of market share deterioration in the quarter, half of that was due to \u2013 or four-tenths was due to the fact that we have throttled back on our sales to daily rental. And part of it is because it\u2019s important that we\u2019re in that market so consumers get experience with our products, but the margins are lower and you know our whole strategy of managing or maximizing our operating margins and profitability but we\u2019ll continue to take a very balanced approach as we look at daily rental. In the quarter, our daily rental sales were down about 32%, they only represented about 5% of our total sales, and that\u2019s down from about 7.5% the year earlier. So that\u2019s the balanced approach we\u2019re taking on this.","Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks very much.","Mark Fields","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Mark Fields","Good morning, John.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on appendix, Slide 12 where you have your 2015 guidance reiterated. As we think about that there is a long way to go to get through 2015, are you considering any major actions or what are the levers that you can pull to potentially influence this to the upside, to put up maybe better numbers than when you\u2019re looking at here?","Mark Fields","John I think we\u2019ve been a little ahead of ourselves here. We\u2019re still sitting very comfortably at the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion, we still have a lot of work to do to put that plan together for 2015, and we will be talking to you about that in more detail in January but I wouldn\u2019t go beyond that at this point. I will just focus today on [Technical Difficulty].","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, second question, you highlighted supplier part shortages in North America as a pressure on volume. I\u2019m just wondering is that something that\u2019s occurring in a short term or do you think there are some real capacity constraints in the supply base that might hamper volumes going forward?","Mark Fields","While we\u2019ve seen, we viewed it as short term in nature and obviously in some of the instances what we did to accommodate some of the suppliers that had some issues, we actually pulled forward some down weeks to allow couple of those suppliers to actually catch up. So we feel we\u2019ll be able to make up some of that production in the fourth quarter. As we go forward, we\u2019re going to continue to stay close with our supplier partners, it is a fact that the supplier community is running at or near full capacity, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to work together with our purchasing team and our suppliers to make sure that we keep the plants running. But for this quarter we thought there were some unique issues that we\u2019ve dealt with and have now resolved.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Mark Fields","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnston with Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnston \u2013 Barclays","Thank you. I have some questions Mark about the planning assumption that you probably have that \u2013 you got instruct [ph] which is where do you expect the price of gas to be say next year and then over the long term? What kind of assumptions around gas prices have gone so far into your product planning? And you mentioned this vis-\u00e0-vis Europe but I\u2019m wondering supplies to North America, with gas prices where they are, are you going to be able to recover some of the regulatory caf\u00e9 content costs?","Mark Fields","Thanks, Brian. Our view on gas prices, obviously what we\u2019re seeing is that the supply fundamental, or the supply growth fundamentals have outpaced the demand growth and we\u2019re seeing obviously the price of a barrel of oil actually go down. Our view continues to be that overtime the price of fuel will continue to rise, probably less so than we did in last year\u2019s business plan but nonetheless, still it\u2019s a non-renewable source and that\u2019s going to play a factor in there. Plus we also have to keep in mind that where we are in terms of the global economic situation right now and a number of the markets around the world, it\u2019s going to through some troubles right now and that\u2019s waning on the growth for the demand for oil.","Our view is it will continue to go up, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused on our product strategy; we\u2019re offering the very best fuel economy for our customers. And then when you think about the \u2013 your comment around the regulatory requirements about improved fuel economy, clearly in Europe we have seen some instances where you can price for that regulation that goes in, here in the U.S. our experience has been it\u2019s very tough to do that and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to stay very focused on what I would call the physical requirements of delivering those regulations at the most competitive cost.","Brian Johnston \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Would it be \u2013 do you think your ability to price if we were at $5, $6 a gallon, in the U.S. would be better and is that and they are all aware you\u2019re in on your 8% to 10% margin range?","Mark Fields","Yes, if you\u2019re dealing with $5 to $6 a gallon of oil, yes, I think the dynamics change very greatly in what you comprise.","Brian Johnston \u2013 Barclays","Okay, thanks.","Mark Fields","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everybody.","Mark Fields","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Couple of things, one is in the past you\u2019ve given us some data on material X commodities for North America, so hoping you can just provide that again. Our commodities such as aluminum kind of locked in on a longer term basis.","Mark Fields","Actually the biggest issue that we had in terms of high prices in the quarter was in South America because that\u2019s priced in dollars and with the weakening currencies that\u2019s been the biggest issue. In the quarter in North America we had about $115 million of higher cost associated with commodity prices and for the total company it was actually about $190 million to $200 million but again a lot of that in South America as well. So in terms of what we\u2019ve got locked in, I think it will probably now be the contracts or hedges, about 85% of our full year commitments are locked in.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then in South America extra balance sheet adjustments, you did like $60 million loss in the quarter, I know you guided to \u2013 in your Analyst Day a substantial loss but improved. For 2015 doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re looking for a lot of improvement versus the run rate right now. I was hoping you can elaborate on that. And also another clarification on your comment in the Analyst Day, there was a pie chart in your deck where you talked about calls on capital from 2014 to 2020. Debt and pensions was part of that, and if you look at your maturity schedule, pension contributions it looks like there is maybe $13 billion associated with that in 2020. And then next to that there was a sliver of the pie chart, looked like it was roughly two times the debt and pension which was shareholder actions. Is that a right way to kind of size that up, like roughly $13 billion for debt and pension and maybe $26 billion for shareholder actions as part of your plan?","Mark Fields","[Technical Difficulty]. As we look at the run rate in fourth quarter, clearly as part of our plan is to introduce our ONE Ford product so we do expect some top line growth particularly around the new Ka or car that we\u2019re introducing it to the marketplace. This segment is the biggest segment in Brazil, the product is off to a great start, we just launched it last month. We do expect to get some price recovery from inflation, we actually saw more of that in third quarter, in places like Brazil than we saw previously. We\u2019re going to continue to work on our structural cost as we go forward. So as we stand back and we look at South America for next year, we do accept some level of economic and industry growth but also the launch of the global products tailored to that market will help.","Bob Shanks","Yes, and in terms of your question on the pie chart \u2013 Rod, what we did say at the event is that in terms of pensions for 2015 and 2016 we\u2019re expecting contributions of about $1.5 billion here to our funded plans and that would get us to the plant where we believe, any aggregate might be different plan-by-plan but we would be fully funded. And then thereafter about $0.5 billion or so just for ongoing service cost and so forth. In terms of the debt, automotive debt, we said that by 2018 we\u2019ll be down to about $10 billion and that assumption assumes actually that we continue to pay that down a bit as things mature, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up, Neil is actually looking at what\u2019s the appropriate size of debt for the size of the company that we expect to be at that point in time but that is less than those numbers. And then the balance as you rightly said is much greater amount of capital allocated to shareholder distributions and what we\u2019ve said in the previous five years. I wouldn\u2019t put a number against that because it is further out and things can change, plus or minus, but based on our present assumptions that is certainly what we have in mind.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","The response went [ph] same time the Latin America question I think that Rod had asked. One follow up is, I just wanted a better understanding of what that balance sheet item was that was I think $109 million. Is that just kind of ongoing currency re-measurement or was that sort of a discrete item, similar to what happened in Venezuela in the first quarter just because that seems fairly lumpy and large.","Bob Shanks","Yes, it\u2019s actually very similar to what we saw in the first quarter except it wasn\u2019t of the same magnitude, and in fact, the thing it\u2019s interesting and you\u2019re seeing that, and many earnings reports in this period is the effect of the stronger dollar on a lot of various companies and surely that\u2019s what we saw. But just to give you a feel for what happened, we had a 62% devaluation and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 48% devaluation in the bolivar, 32% devaluation in the peso, about 8% in the Brazilian real. And it will threaten net assets, the value of those assets now in dollars given that the change in the currencies gave us the $109 million effect that we talked about. That is \u2013 as Mark said in his comments that\u2019s part of what we expect to see happening next year, currencies continuing to weaken, and then it will be one of the challenges that we face in South America as we \u2013 you will have the positive effects you talked about but you will continue to have high inflation, there is no sign that\u2019s going to go away, and you will have these depreciating currencies.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then, I guess your guidance for South America that you gave at the Analyst Day for next year, that did kind of contemplate like a further, sort of onetime sizeable re-measurement impact for the bolivar, that\u2019s correct, right?","Bob Shanks","It reflected \u2013 I guess I\u2019d say differently, it didn\u2019t assume some massive deval [ph], and clearly that\u2019s something I think we all have to keep an eye on because with what\u2019s happening to the U.S. dollar and the impact \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the oil rather, and what that could mean to the Venezuelan economy and their ability to differ what seems inevitable in terms of massive deval, that\u2019s something we have to watch. We have not assumed that for next year, perhaps we\u2019ve assumed just the continued weakening of currencies but if there were a significant onetime deval by the government that would certainly chang the equation in terms of what the impact would be.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, understood. And then my second question just on Asia, you guys did for one pretty clearly that the cadence in the first half would be lower than the second half, would not be carried forward because lot of those cost items. As a little bit sort of \u2013 those items were larger than I think some of us had modelled and just wanted to better get a sense of what the timeframe was for some of those \u2013 you have the launch of Lincoln, you have all these plants that are launching concurrently as you\u2019re adding capacity to end of the year. How should we think about the timeframe on which that elevated expense plays out?","Bob Shanks","I guess a general comment and maybe more specific on the quarter, in general if you go back to Investor Day and I think Dave Shak [ph] had a slide that showed capacity over the next five years and I think we\u2019ve got [Technical Difficulty] and then we show one bar that had greater than 2.7 that was undefined because we \u2013 as long as we continue to grow and we expect to do that we\u2019ll have to put in place capacity above in the arm that\u2019s even coming in right now. So I hope that happens, I hope we have to continue to invest in growth in the business because that would just be good for the business. What we\u2019ve thought going on the quarter that we\u2019ve got the five facilities that are under construction, I think all of them either have a full complement of the hourly workers for example in place, or at least nearly in the process of being trained. So we\u2019re carrying that cost, we\u2019ve begun some depreciation and amortization as everything is being capitalized but some of it has the building to have progressed.","And then in addition to those, we\u2019re adding a shift, we just added a shift at our plant in Thailand, there is another shift it\u2019s coming on this month in Chennai [ph], and because our capacity increase that we\u2019re planning at the end of this nine month period, actually one of our engine plants in China, so not all new facilities that certainly continue spending for capacity increases, and that\u2019s a play here as well. You mentioned Lincoln but that we\u2019ve been incurring those cost now for some quarters and continue to do so this quarter. And to put it on the context, if you take the $173 million that you can see there which almost all of it is structural cost. So 40% of that relates to what I just described, the Lincoln cost, as well as the cost associated with these plan.","Mark Fields","And just to add to put a perspective, the context of growth, we got a few questions on our September sales which were down two-tenths of percentage point in China and we have some questions around that. Just to put it into perspective, the September sales were \u2013 they were strong, they were steady, after a very strong comparison with 2013 and as Bob mentioned earlier, we had a record share in China in the quarter of 4.7%, and year-to-date our sales are up 26% versus an industry that\u2019s up somewhere around 8%. So as you look at the remainder of this year we expect to be a bit down in the month of October but you will start seeing it grow again. I would think of it as it\u2019s not a pause in our sales growth, it\u2019s more of a pit stop as we position ourselves for growth based on the points that Bob mentioned that are going to be coming online next year.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, understood. I mean it\u2019s a high class problem to have those kinds of growth opportunity. But I guess it does sound like fixed cost is at least for the balance next year, I mean you guys have given some color already but it sounds like it will continue at this pace of addition, at least for the next five quarters or so?","Mark Fields","Yes, and that\u2019s the only other thing I would add and I\u2019ve said it before, I would expect it to be lumpy, it\u2019s not going to be linear. At some quarter it will have more impact than others.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks a lot for the color guys.","Mark Fields","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, everybody, just two questions, first for Bob. Bob, General Motors showed a chart on their Investor Day saying that they are breakeven in the U.S. and a fixed market share was around 10 million or 11 million units. I\u2019m wondering if you made a similar calculation and whether you kind of confirm a similar order magnitude breakeven SAAR?","Bob Shanks","Yes, same order magnitude.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Now in that analysis can I ask what you\u2019ve assumed for price down or is that fixed too?","Bob Shanks","I don\u2019t understand the question.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Meaning when you won a simulation of going to 11 million U.S. SAAR, do you keep pricing at today\u2019s levels or do you cross pricing?","Bob Shanks","We change a number of factors, the pricing is not one of them.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Bob Shanks","In that case one of the things that was interesting I think when we saw the downturn and 8 or 9 months [ph] we saw the pricing go up.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right. Okay, Mark, next question for you. If you wanted \u2013 and this is a question about competitors product and I\u2019m sure \u2013 and we know that you guys have tested and torn apart and I would imagine you guys have all driven the Tesla Model S. I\u2019m just curious in your opinion, high level, if you wanted to Tesla Model S, in your opinion this Ford Motor Company have the engineering, resources, take and talent, particularly software talent to do that?","Mark Fields","To your question, yes, we have. We have driven the Model S, we have torn it down, we\u2019ve put it back together, we drove it again, we\u2019re very familiar with that product. And I think our product development team is very familiar with the approach they have taken. When we think about our products going forward, we have obviously a lot of experience as you know from a number of our electrified power trains and electrified vehicles that we have in the marketplace. And the answer is yes, I do believe with talent we have to continue to add and compliment that talent, absolutely. And part of that is the growth we\u2019re going to see in our Silicon Valley operations which is going to be growing significantly so that we can attract that talent to our company and compliment the already strong talent we have in those areas.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So then just as you are not there, you can\u2019t do it but you \u2013 is it intentioned to do something like that or is that just so niche that you want to focus on the more mainstream stuff for now and that kind of go forward strategy?","Mark Fields","I think it\u2019s very consistent with our product strategy, you know one of our fillers in our product strategy is from a technology standard, to have some more technology in our vehicles and you guys have seen them in a lot of the technology we have, we\u2019re going to build on that, we\u2019re going to make sure we have the talent to deliver it.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Definitely, thanks gentlemen.","Mark Fields","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up, a little bit on some of \u2013 I guess the question in the topic, one that Patrick brought up earlier with Asia Pacific, and then I guess specifically in the fourth quarter when you\u2019re sticking to about 700 for the year, you\u2019ve done about 500 this year, and it sounds like given the commentary you organized some more plans and you would expect there would be some continued headwinds. So I ask could you just give a little bit of color so what the offset is there that still would show a meaningful year-over-year gain.","Bob Shanks","Yes, we expect to have payable volume mix in the quarter.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And that\u2019s from new product?","Bob Shanks","Actually it\u2019s a new product but it\u2019s also \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the text [ph] that we\u2019re going to earlier, we\u2019re just continue to see strength across the entire line-up. So we expect that to continue in the quarter Joseph.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then, sorry if I have missed this, but the working capital drag in the third quarter was that mostly timing related? Should we expect that to reverse in fourth quarter?","Bob Shanks","Yes, we expect to have positive cash flow in the fourth \u2013 positive cash flow but positive working capital in the quarter and we do expect this to reverse. This is really the impact of the launch effects as well as the supplier shortage that Mark talked about earlier. So we expect that to reverse out in the first quarter.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Completely or\u2026","Bob Shanks","Largely.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Largely, okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Neil, I know that you provide some sensitivity in your 10-K impact of discount rates on the funded status of the pension plans on the PBO and the asset side. I was curious you\u2019ve given the recent decline in rates, whether you\u2019ve made any preliminary estimates of potential impact on yearend status, whether that\u2019s if you could share with us today? And then a related one [ph] maybe for Bob, could you comment on whether changes in interest rates are actuarial assumptions would be material enough to have any impact on your capital allocation strategy which I think calls for cycling pass pension contributions to make more room for return of capital to shareholders?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Ryan. I think from the standpoint of our de-risking strategy, the reduction in rates has been almost completely offset by returns. And so we\u2019re about 1 percentage point change in funding status since our year end position, so that\u2019s about $1 billion worse than we were at the end of 2013.","Neil Schloss","Yes, the only thing I would add to that Ryan is to me firstly the analysis that you did was actually very good and it was consistent with what we provided and the sensitivity that\u2019s we have seen better performance in terms of assets and so forth, and of course our contributions. But to me the thing that\u2019s really encouraging about what we\u2019re seeing with the big change of interest rates and particularly given the fact that in Germany where that\u2019s our most underfunded funding plan, we\u2019ve seen an incredibly big change in the discount rates that were still about $1 billion or so [ph] where we were at the end of last year. It just shows that the strategy is working and I just wonder if we\u2019re getting the full recognition of that from investors because the volatility that we would have had if you go back four five years ago compared to what we are today is much, much improved which was the whole plan of the strategy in the first place.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Great, thanks, very helpful update. And then, just \u2013 my last question. I think the 2Q call you\u2019re looking forward to, the EPA release that\u2019s mileage rating for the F-150 potentially within weeks. And would you have expected it by now particularly given that the vehicle will be gone on sale pretty soon. What might be holding that up? I know you\u2019ve said it will be the most efficient truck but is there anything more you\u2019re able to share with us today about just a magnitude of expected improvement? Thanks.","Mark Fields","We expect and we\u2019ve always expected the EPA labels to come probably sometime in the latter half of November. So there is no surprise for us there and we should have that then.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, looking forward to it. Thanks.","Mark Fields","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers with ISI Group. Please proceed.","George Galliers \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I had two questions. Firstly, as you highlighted the next [ph] margin, X warranty was still at a very high level despite the model changeover is going on and other cost running negative $170 million during the quarter. I was wondering if you could give some guidance on the cost cadence in terms of later stage engineering launch, any associative with the F-150 overcoming quarters, and to what extent you can quantify that? Then also just on China, you said that you expected sales to maybe be flat to down over coming months due to capacity constraints. At what point based on your planning assumptions for Chinese end market and your gains, do you see yourselves being able to supply to actually match demand or exceed demand in China? Under what point is that prices middle part of next year or is it later than that?","Mark Fields","Okay, why don\u2019t we take that first part of the question \u2013 as we mentioned we\u2019ll probably see our sales a bit down in the month of October, I think you will start seeing some small growth in November and I think you will start seeing some decent growth as we introduce [Technical Difficulty] next year. As we get into the latter half of next year I think we\u2019ll \u2013 as we bring on these plants with even more new products you will see an accelerated pace.","Bob Shanks","Okay. And then in terms of \u2013 George, your question about structural cost, and I think that was on North America, is that correct?","George Galliers \u2013 ISI Group","Yes, exactly.","Bob Shanks","As the case, it was actually a pretty light quarter for us in terms of structural cost, I would expect it to be much more of a stature in the fourth quarter and that is in parts we know we always have higher structural cost in the fourth quarter and part of that\u2019s related to what happened later in overhead inventory given the fact that we\u2019ve got production \u2013 the plant is down at the end of the year, so the cost \u2013 right cost come out of the balance sheet go into the income statement, so that would be a factor. But also we\u2019ve got all the launches ahead of it that we\u2019ve yet to complete. That usually brings with it higher advertising and sales promotion expenses research and market the products, and of course the depreciation and amortization we talked about. And then the other thing is that we\u2019re continuing to invest in terms of engineering in particular for products yet to come. We talked about all the launches we have next year, so we\u2019ll include that expense as well. So I would expect to see a much larger number on a year-over-year basis in the quarter and an increase quarter-to-quarter.","George Galliers \u2013 ISI Group","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Weston [ph] with Morningstar. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Two questions, one on South America, one on Russia. In South America, I guess I\u2019m just a little surprised if we see that the against [ph] Q4 is roughly breakeven to a small loss, are you expecting the market to bottom up there in fourth quarter? Are you cutting cost to get to that number or is it all a pricing inflation tailwind?","Bob Shanks","It\u2019s driven by the effect of the new car that we\u2019ve just introduced, really very partially benefited from that in the third quarter but we are approaching full production of both photo and the client door sales, we think that will be the big driver of the results in the quarter.","Mark Fields","In addition to also the new X Series we\u2019ve introduced back into the marketplace after a bit of a high AS, that will help us well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. And then in Russia, obviously with a very weak market there, are you seeing lot of your rational pricing from competitors and is the Sollers JV holding the line on pricing are also buying share?","Mark Fields","Overall we\u2019re seeing some very aggressive pricing, particularly from some of our Japanese competitors as they take advantage of their currency \u2013 it\u2019s Russia \u2013 their competitiveness. So we are seeing \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing hugely irrational but overall with the market being down, it\u2019s getting very competitive.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Mark Fields","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey with The Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","Good morning. I wanted to ask an overall question that related to how is the auto market doing globally. Mark, I think you mentioned that the worldwide economies are struggling a little bit but can you kind of give me a look at, maybe in the next year a little bit. Are we in kind of a soft patch globally or do you \u2013 and are you forecasting or getting a little more concerned that we might be heading into a more dangerous period or not?","Mark Fields","Well there is a lot of things going in the world but you\u2019re seeing our \u2013 in Investor Day, our view of growth over the business plan period and we expect this to be in our \u2013 we expect this to be a growth industry and we\u2019re a growth company in that growth industry. As we look at some of the various markets, you\u2019ve seen our guidance for next year and the industry here in the U.S. which is up from what our expectations are for this year. In Europe we expect very moderate growth but a little bit of growth there, same thing in China, and of course down in South America, that\u2019s probably the softest patches we see with a lot of the uncertainties that we\u2019ve talked about before. But overall standing back, putting in context where we are, it\u2019s a growth industry and we\u2019re a growth business within that industry.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 The Wall Street Journal","Okay, great. Thanks.","Mark Fields","Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Phil Udau [ph] with DNDC. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, Mark.","Mark Fields","Hey Phil, how are you doing?","Unidentified Analyst","Good. Quick question for you, the pricing strength that you\u2019re noticing with SUVs and with the F Series, you\u2019ve been in this industry a long time, relative to when you\u2019ve seen pricing power like this in the past, how does this stack up right now in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, in terms of the demand that\u2019s out there for SUVs and your ability to drive pricing?","Mark Fields","I think there are a couple of things. One is, when you look at just a fundamental demand, you look at the age of the park and it\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s the right term, it\u2019s quite mature by our view back in the 2005 timeframe, probably about high 30s, 40% of the products out there, cars, utilities and trucks were ten year\u2019s older, we think that\u2019s more like about 50% now and probably even skewed even higher on pickup trucks. So from a demand standpoint I think the replacement demand versus periods in the past is quite [Technical Difficulty] marry that against the production capacity that\u2019s out there in the industry. Many folks including ourselves are running a very high capacities I think, when you look at those two elements I think it bodes well for pricing in those segments that will remain pretty good and then probably the last piece of it is just the new products that are coming into the marketplace, and in particular are new products. I think we\u2019re heading into a good pricing environment where our new expedition, our new navigator, our new MKC will allow us to take advantage of a very good situation going forward. And that helps putting to context our guidance for next year.","Unidentified Analyst","Fantastic, thank you.","Mark Fields","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reynold [ph] with Automotive News. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, my question is just related to the gross automotive cash figure which I have, $22.8 billion in Q3, that\u2019s quite a steep drop from second quarter. And maybe you gave some of this but what were the components that drove that drop you could clarify again?","Mark Fields","Yes, Brad we\u2019re happy to help you. $1.1 billion of that was the conclusion of our share buyback program that we announced back in May, so that was the largest single piece. We had $0.5 billion of dividends, $300 million of pension contributions, our debt came down by $300 million and then of course we have the negative operating cash flow that we talked about earlier in the call which was driven largely by the negative change in working capital. So that\u2019s the $3 billion.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Oliver [ph] with Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning gentlemen. Mark, you have been very personally involved in all of these launches because you have so many, and I\u2019m just wondering the problem with some of the part shortages, could you give us some contacts as to whether that would have happened either way or has your planning, could it have been a lot worse if you hadn\u2019t had all of this extra planning or \u2013 give us a sense of how this fits in with your strategy.","Mark Fields","Just to clarify, the production or the part shortages that we have experienced actually were on current products, none on our new launches. So as I said our new launches are going according to plan and with the existing production, that\u2019s been really some of the issues that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve been able to resolve those issues, we\u2019ll be able to make some of that production up as we mentioned earlier in the quarter, not all of it but it\u2019s been on existing models, not the new launches.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then so do you feel that the extra planning you\u2019ve done then has avoided this kind of thing happening as you launch?","Mark Fields","Well we\u2019re staying very close with our supplier partners as we launch all these new products, and we\u2019ll continue to do so to make sure that we have successful launches.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Mark Fields","Thanks, Elisa [ph].","Operator","At this time ladies and gentlemen I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks.","George Sharp","Thank you, Glenn and thanks everybody out there.

Let\u2019s turn to the first slide.","Our Win Ford plan depicted here remains \u2013 are we picking up any noise?","George Sharp","I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from.","Alan Mulally","Sorry. We\u2019re picking up some interference here. On Slide 1, our ONE Ford plan depicted here remains the foundation for everything we do. Across the Ford Enterprise we continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitability at current demand and changing model mix, accelerate development of new products our customers want and value; finance our plans to improve our balance sheet and work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets.","A full family of great products, small, medium and large, cars, utilities and trucks that our customers want and value is central to our ONE Ford plan. This year more than 85% of our volume will be on nine global core platforms with examples of nameplates for each platform shown on Slide 2. The benefits from this are more products, faster product cadence and better profitability. Optimizing platform count lets us increased volume per platform, improve our engineering efficiencies and gain economies of scale for us and our suppliers. Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making in executing all elements of our plan.","Now on Slide 3 we\u2019d like to share with you a summary of our first quarter results. In the first quarter the company earning an operating profit of $2.1 billion, making it the 15th consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive as well and we ended the quarter with strong liquidity. The top line grew with year-over-year increase of 10% in both wholesale volume and total company revenue, including market share gains in both North America and Asia Pacific and Africa.","Among our business units North America achieved record quarterly performance for pre-tax profit since at least 2000 and Ford Credit\u2019s results were solid once again. Asia Pacific and Africa earned a small profit while Europe and South America incurred losses as anticipated. And in Europe we remain on track to meet the objectives that we established to transform our European business leading to profitability by mid-decade.","Finally, today we are reconfirming our full year guidance. Before turning to the financial details let\u2019s recap several other significant noteworthy achievements from the first quarter. As shown on Slide 4 we have launched a number of products around the globe. At the North American International Auto Show we revealed the Ford Atlas and the Lincoln MKC concepts, both of which were very well received.","Recently the Ford Focus was named the world\u2019s best-selling passenger car in 2012, with the Ford S-series pickup coming in third and the Ford Fiesta ranking as the best-selling sub-compact. In China our joint venture engine plan in Nanjing produced our 1 millionth made in China engine. In Asia Pacific and Africa our record first quarter retail results were 38% higher than the first quarter of 2012, largely driven by stronger industry and higher market share in China, but supported by retail sales growth in nearly all other Asia Pacific and Africa markets.","IN the U.S. we continue to add jobs, announcing an investment of $200 million and the addition of 450 jobs starting in 2014 as part of our plan to move EcoBoost engine production for North America to Cleveland from Valencia, Spain, consistent with our European transformation plan. And on the financial front we announced in January that we doubled the dividend.","Now Bob Shanks will take us through the details of our financial performance in the quarter. Bob?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, gentlemen, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start on Slide 5 with a summary of our business results for the first quarter in a comparison with the year ago period. First quarter wholesale volume was 1.5 million units, up 139,000 units from a year ago and revenue at $35.8 million was up $3.4 billion. As Alan mentioned, both of these topline metrics were up about 10% from the year ago period.","Pre-tax profit of $2.1 billion which excludes special items was $147 million lower than a year ago while after tax earnings per share at $0.41 were $0.02 higher. Net income attributable to Ford including unfavorable pre-tax special items of $23 million was $1.6 billion, $215 million better than a year ago. Earnings were $0.40 a share, up $0.05. You can find additional detail on the special items in Appendix 3.","Automotive operating related cash flow was $700 million, marking the twelfth consecutive quarter of positive performance. And automotive gross cash was $24.2 billion, exceeding debt by $8.2 billion. Our first quarter operating effective tax rate which isn\u2019t shown was 26%. Consistent with prior guidance we expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be similar to 201 which was 32%.","As shown on Slide 6, both of our sectors, Automotive and Financial Services, contributed to total company first quarter pre-tax profit of $2.1 billion. This was $147 million lower than a year ago as shown in the memo, more than explained by the Automotive sector. Compared with fourth quarter of 2012 total company pre-tax profit improved $465 million with both sectors contributing to the better results.","The key market factors and financial metrics for our total Automotive business are shown on Slide 7. First quarter wholesale volume and revenue were both approximately 10% higher than a year ago, driven by North America and Asia-Pacific, Africa. The higher volume reflects the impact of higher industry volumes and improved market share as well as favorable changes in dealer stocks. The growth in revenue was mainly driven by the higher volume and net pricing gains, offset partially by unfavorable exchange.","Automotive pre-tax profit was $1.6 billion and operating margin was 5.2%, both lower than a year ago due to Europe and South America. The $200 million decrease in total Automotive first quarter pre-tax profit compared with 2012 is explained by causal factor on Slide 8. The decline is more than explained by higher cost and unfavorable exchange.","The cost increase reflects mainly investments in higher volume, growth and new products for this year and the future as well as restructuring in Europe and higher pension and OPEB expense. The unfavorable exchange is primarily South America, mainly the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar.","And partly offsetting these effects are favorable market factors, higher volume and net pricing with each region contributing with the exception of Europe.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was $300 million higher than the fourth quarter, more than explained by lower cost in all regions except Europe. Unfavorable exchange, mainly in South America and Europe was a partial offset. You can find more details on the quarter-to-quarter change in Appendix 8.","Our first quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown on Slide 9. North America more than explains the automotive sector profit of $1.6 billion, while South America and Europe incurred losses. Asia Pacific Africa earned a small profit.","Other automotive reflects net interest expense offset partially by a favorable fair market value adjustment of our investment in Mazda.","For the full year we expect net interest expense to be in line with the first quarter run rate or $750 million to $800.","Now we\u2019ll look at each of the regions within the Automotive sector on Slide 10, starting with North America. As you can see in the first two graphs on the left, North America experienced very strong growth in the first quarter with wholesale volume up 17% from a year ago and revenue improving 20%. The volume improvement mainly reflects higher U.S. industry sales, increasing from a SAR of 14.5 million to 15.6 million units, favorable changes in dealers stocks and higher U.S. market share. The revenue change, primarily reflects the higher volume and net pricing gains.","North America pre-tax profit was $2.4 billion and as mentioned earlier was a record for any quarter and higher than a year ago due to favorable market factors.","Operating margin was 11%, the fourth time over the past 5 quarter has the margin exceeded 10%. This was lower, however, than a year ago, due mainly to our investments for new products and growth.","On Slide 11 we show in more detail the causal factors that drove the $300 million improvement in North America\u2019s first quarter pre-tax profit. As you can see the improvement was driven by higher volume and net pricing, offset partially by higher cost, mainly for new products and growth as well as higher pension and OPEB expense.","As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit increased by $500,000,000 compared with fourth quarter 2012, explained primarily by seasonal reduction in cost.","The company\u2019s total U.S. market share and retail share of the retail industry increased in the first quarter compared with the year ago period and the prior quarter as shown on Slide 12. Starting on the left our total market share was 15.9%, up 0.70 of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by strong sales of the all new Fusion and Escape. This share was up 0.60 of a point from fourth quarter 2012, more than explained by Fusion.","As shown on the right, our retail market share of the retail industry was 14%, an improvement of 0.20 of a percentage point from the same period last year as our all new Fusion and Escape did very well in their respective segments. We also benefited from favorable market segmentation of full size pickups. The retail share was up 0.40 of a percentage point from fourth quarter 2012, more than explained by Fusion.","Now turning to our full year guidance for North America, it remains unchanged. We expect higher pre-tax profit compared with 2012 and an operating margin of about 10%.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 13 and take a look at South America. First quarter wholesale volume were both down 4% compared with a year ago. Although the SAAR improved from 5.4 to 5.6 million units, Ford South America volume declined due to unfavorable changes in dealer stocks and lower market share. The market share decline from 9.4% to 9.1% was more than explained by lower availability of Fiesta.","South America\u2019s lower revenue reflects unfavorable exchange, net of higher pricing. Pre-tax results were a loss of $218 million and the operating margin was a negative 9.4%. The year-over-year declines in both metrics were more than explained by unfavorable exchange.","On Slide 14 we show more detail behind the $272 million decline in South America\u2019s first quarter pre-tax results. As mentioned, unfavorable exchange drove the decline mostly due to Venezuela including the substantial impact of the recent evaluation of the Bolivar. Weakness in the Argentinean Peso also had an unfavorable effect.","Net pricing was higher and mix was favorable but these factors were offset by higher costs. As shown in the memo, pre-tax results were $363 million lower than fourth quarter of 2012, explained primarily by unfavorable exchange.","Our full year guidance for South America is unchanged. We continue to expect results to be about break even. The external environment however is uncertain particularly in Venezuela and Argentina. So there is a risk this could adversely affect our ability to deliver full year breakeven results for the region. We\u2019ll keep you apprised of our status as the year progresses.","Let\u2019s turn now to Europe beginning on Slide 15. Starting on the left, first quarter wholesale volume declined 8% and revenue was down 7%. The volume decline reflects lower market share and industry volume as the SAAR declined from 14.2 million units a year ago to 13.3 million units this year. Favorable changes in dealer stocks were a partial offset.","The share decline from 8.5% to 7.7% reflecting mainly lack of availability of CD vehicles as well as our focus to improve retail market share and reduce daily rental and short cycle sales. And to that end, our retail share for the five major Western European markets, estimated at 8.4%, was 0.20 of a percentage point higher than a year ago while our shares of daily rental and short cycle sales were lower as intended.","The decline in Europe\u2019s revenue mainly reflects the lower volume. The pre-tax loss for Europe was $462 million and the operating margin was a negative 6.9%. Market factors, costs, including restructuring effects and exchange, all contributed to the declines from a year ago.","Slide 16 shows more detail by the causal factors that drove the $313 million decline in Europe\u2019s first quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago. Most factors were unfavorable. The largest single impact was higher structural costs. This mainly reflects restructuring related costs, principally accelerated depreciation for the facilities we plan to close and higher pension expense due to lower discount rates.","The memo on the right side of the graph shows the restructuring related costs included in the operating results. A reminder: separation related costs which were minimal this quarter will be captured in special items. As shown in the memo below the chart, results were $270 million better than fourth quarter 2012, reflecting primarily favorable market factors including higher net pricing. Unfavorable exchange was a partial offset.","Slide 17 shows our progress in delivering our European transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. Our unprecedented product acceleration is well under way. To date we\u2019ve introduce five new passenger vehicles including B-Max, Fiesta, Fiesta ST, Kuga and in an example of expanding our global portfolio to new markets, the Explorer in Russia.","The roll out of our completely re-designed and expanded commercial vehicle lineup is also underway with the introduction of Transit Custom and Tourneo Custom. These new vehicles are off to a strong sales start and beginning to help improve Ford\u2019s brand image. While we expect overall market share in Europe to remain flat in 2013 compared with last year. We are seeing growth, as mentioned earlier, in our retail market share which is critical to margins, residuals and brand health. In addition we\u2019re making good progress is quality and customer satisfaction and we remain on track to achieve our targets for the year.","We\u2019re also making progress in cost including our plan to restructure our manufacturing base. In that regard, discussions are progressing with the unions at our South Hampton assembly plant and Dagenham Stamping and Tiling operations as we move to close those plants by mid-year. Discussion are progressing at Genk as well where hourly employees have ratified a package of proposed separation benefits and our salaried employees have just reached agreement on a tentative benefits proposal subject to ratification. As the Genk information and consultation process moves forward, we have resumed normal vehicle production levels at the plant.","And finally, we did complete the planned reductions to our salaried and agency workforce in Europe that were initiated last year. So in summary, we are on track in delivering our European transformation plan. Now in terms of our full year guidance for Europe, it also remains unchanged. We continue to expect the loss of about $2 billion this year. The outlook for the business environment in Europe however continue to be uncertain.","While we still believe it\u2019s possible that economic and industry conditions will begin to stabilize later this year, recent economic indicators are mixed. But despite this challenging environment, we are progressing towards our goal of a profitable, growing Ford Europe by mid-decade.","Let\u2019s now review Asia-Pacific, Africa on Slide 18. As shown on the left, first quarter wholesale volume improved 30% compared with a year ago and net revenue, which excludes our China JVs, improved 13%. Our growth and volume reflects mainly higher market share as well as stronger industry sales which increased from a SAAR of 32.5 million to 34.5 million units.","First quarter market share in the region was 3%, a 30% improvement from a year ago and a first quarter record. And in China, which isn\u2019t shown, our market share improved more than a full percentage point to a first quarter record of 3.6%. Asia-Pacific, Africa\u2019s higher revenue reflects higher component sales to our China joint ventures and favorable mix.","Asia-Pacific, Africa pre-tax profit was $6 million and the operating margin was 0.20 of a percentage point. Both improved from the year ago period. This reflects mainly favorable market factors, higher royalties and improved subsidiary profits. The $101 million improvement from a year ago in Asia-Pacific, Africa\u2019s first quarter pre-tax results is explained by causal factor on Slide 19.","As we\u2019ve seen in past quarters, topline related factors, volume, mix and net pricing were favorable offset largely by higher costs as we continue to invest for further growth in the future. This quarter we also benefited from higher royalties in subsidiary profits along with higher sales of parts and services all included in other.","As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific, Africa pre-tax results were $33 million lower than fourth quarter of 2012, more than explained by unfavorable volume including the impact of the Chinese New Year.","Our full year guidance for Asia-Pacific, Africa remains the same. We continue to expect results to be about break even. While we expect to deliver strong growth in volume, share and revenue for the year, costs will continue to largely offset these positive effects as we invest in an expanded product line, seven new plants in China and India and people to implement our growth plan.","Turning now to Ford Credit, we turned $507 million in the quarter. Slide 20 shows the $55 million increase in first quarter pre-tax profit compared with a year ago by causal factor. The change is primarily explained by higher receivables and favorable residual performance, offset partially by lower credit loss reserve reductions. And as show in the memo, Ford Credit\u2019s pre-tax profit increased by $93 million compared with fourth quarter 2012.","For the full year, Ford Credit continues to expect pre-tax profits to be about equal to 2012. Year-end managed receivables of $95 to $105 billion and distributions to its parent of about $200 million.","Next on Slide 20 we\u2019ll review our Automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $24.2 billion, $100 million lower than year end 2012. Automotive related operating related cash flow was $700 million including favorable working capital, changes of $400 million. Our cash flow before financing related changes and dividends was $1.1 billion.","Net proceeds were $1 billion reflecting our $2 billion automotive debt issuance where we took advantage of favorable market conditions to issue low cost long term debt. This issuance was offset partially by the redemption of about $600 million of 7.5% callable debt as well as other debt repayments.","During the quarter we contributed $1.8 billion to our worldwide funded pension plans which included $1.2 billion of discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plans in line with our previously disclosed long term pension de-risking strategy. And finally, dividend spend in the quarter totaled about $400 million.","Now we\u2019ll summarize our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the first quarter which is captured on Slide 22. Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $16 billion, $1.7 billion higher than year end 2012. This increase is driven primarily by our $2 billion debt issuance and the consolidation of $0.5 billion of debt from our Romania operations offset partially by the redemption of debt I referenced earlier.","Proceeds from the debt issuance that were not used for reduction of higher cost debt are being used for pension contributions which will reduce our pension expense by a greater amount than the interest incurred on the debt. Net cash at the end of the quarter stood at $8.2 billion which was $1.8 billion lower than year end 2012. And finally, Automotive liquidity at the end of the quarter was $34.5 billion which was the same as at year end.","With that, Alan will now take us through our view of the 2013 global business environment as well as our key playing assumptions and metrics for the year.","Alan Mulally","Very good. Thank you, Bob. Summarized on Slide 23 is our view of the business environment going forward. Overall our outlook has not changed substantially. We project 2013 global GDP growth to be in the 2% to 3% range. Global industry sales are predicted to be in the 80 million to 85 million unit range. U.S. economic growth is expected to be in the 2% to 2.5% range with industry sales supported by continuing improvement in the housing sector and replacement demand as a result of the older age of the vehicles on the road.","In Brazil, fiscal and monetary policies support economic recovery. In Argentina and Venezuela there are escalated risk as both economies are in weak conditions with unclear economic policy direction. In Europe we expect weak conditions to continue especially in countries undergoing fiscal austerity programs. As noted earlier, it is possible that economic and industry conditions will begin to stabilize later this year. Recent policy decisions are positive steps but not yet enough to fully restore business and consumer confidence.","In Asia-Pacific and Africa, economic indicators point towards a modest recovery in China this year. Growth in India is below its full potential, partially due to high inflation and interest rates. Overall, despite challenges, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2013.","Our guidance for 2013 detailed here in Slide 24 is unchanged from January. We expect full year industry volume to range from 15 million to 16 million units in the United States, Europe to be in the 13 million to 13.5 million, consistent with guidance we provided verbally at the January earnings call. In China to range from 19.5 million to 21.5 million units. We project full year market share to increase compared with 2012 in the United States and China and to be about equal to last year in Europe. We are working to improve quality in all regions.","In terms of our financial performance, we expect total company pre-tax profit to be about equal to 2012, Automotive operating margin to be about equal to or lower than 2012 and Automotive operating related cash flow to be higher than 2012 including capital spending of about $7 billion to support aggressive product refresh rates, expansion of our portfolio in the absolute sense and across the region and capacity actions.","Overall we expect 2013 to be another strong year for the Ford Motor Company as we continue to work towards our mid-decade guidance. In closing, our One Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation. It includes serving customers in all markets with a full family of vehicles, small, medium and large, cars, utilities and trucks. They will each deliver the highest quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design and value while delivering profitable growth for all.","Our One Ford plan continues to deliver and we are absolutely focused on building great products, creating a stronger business and contributing to a better world. We delivered strong results in the first quarter and we continue to work our plan for the full year 2013 with continued strength in North America, delivery of global products into South America for product led growth in the remainder of the year even as we work to adjust to an uncertain economic environment in the region.","Continued execution of our transformation plan for Europe which is proceeding as plan as we work to return to profitability by mid-decade. Strong investment for long term success in Asia-Pacific and Africa which is already being in improved revenue and market share. And consistent results from our valued Ford Credit operations which deliver world class customer service and solid bottom line results.","This concludes our report of our first quarter results. Now we would be delighted to take your questions. George?","George Sharp","Thanks, Alan. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow as many questions as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief. Janita, can we please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question.","Alan Mulally","Good morning.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. First question on the pension contributions. Do you think there is the opportunity to potentially raise more debt and use that capital to contribute to the pension plan? Because it seems like you\u2019re getting a pretty good ARP there. Is that a strategy you could use for the rest of the contributions?","Alan Mulally","Well, John, thank you for the question. Well it\u2019s a strategy that we\u2019ve implemented and are executing. I think we\u2019re comfortable with the amount that we\u2019ve taken from the marketplace and don\u2019t have any plans to do anything further in that regard.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Second question on Ford Motor Credit. Pretty good start to the year in the first quarter. Just curious if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019re seeing as far as credit trends or anything else as far as originations that would lead you to believe that should deteriorate through the course of the year. Because your guidance seems to indicate the second, third and fourth quarter would be a lot lower than the first quarter. Just trying to understand what the thinking is there.","Mike Seneski","Hey, John. It\u2019s Mike Seneski. No, credit trends are continuing very well. The reason we\u2019re guiding more towards equal to last year is the residual performance, favorable residual performance we saw in the first quarter. We don\u2019t expect to continue and actually could in fact reverse throughout the year. But other than that we think volume and credit losses should offset each other and a slight increase in operating cost. So that\u2019s why we see about equal.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, on raw materials. It seems like it was headwind in most regions in the first quarter. And given the decline we saw last year and really sort of the maybe more aggressive declines in raw mats we\u2019ve seen as of late I was just curious when that could possible turn and become a bit of a tailwind. Because it seems like it\u2019s oddly a headwind and at some point should be a tailwind.","Bob Shanks","Yeah actually, John, it wasn\u2019t much of a factor at all in the quarter. I think we were only very slightly negative, maybe around $50 million for the total company including hedging effects. I think in terms of business units the one that was affected the most was in South America because of the inflation affects and there\u2019s an exchange piece that gets in there as well since a lot of the currencies are priced in dollars. But overall not much of a factor. You know spot rates indicate some downward pressure on commodities but our call for the full year is it\u2019s going to be relatively benign at this point.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And truly the last question. Just on the Fusion and Escape the launch the last year was a little bit bumpy towards the end of the year. It seems to be on track right now. Did you get the full benefit of those products really turning around and really ramping up very significantly in the first quarter? Or is that benefit really going to be more of a second and third quarter benefit in the margins in North America?","Alan Mulally","Well we had, we\u2019ve certainly had a lot of benefits because Fusion was up 26% in the quarter year-over-year and Escape was up 25%. And the other thing that\u2019s very exciting about that along with the other products in the super-segment is that was one of the bigger parts of our share increase in the quarter and that a lot of that took place on the coast and in the southeast, so it\u2019s just exactly what we wanted those products to deliver. I think as the quarter progressed we got better availability. Still very popular products but I that we\u2019ll continue to see strength as the year progresses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","Good morning.","Alan Mulally","Hi, Brian.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","I want to ask a bit more of a strategic question for \u2013 it\u2019s probably all three but maybe Alan and then Bob and Mark \u2013 as you look at North American margins a very simplistic analysis which I think as some investors often do is, look, your revenues were up. Apply a let\u2019s call it 20% incremental margin and your margins should have expanded; they actually contracted a bit. Now, I would point out very good margins overall.","Just when you kind of sit down and you look at budgets and you look at product programs how do you balance, well, we could maybe get to mid-teen margins with, okay, here\u2019s what we ought to be investing in, both product content right now as well as future product developments. What is that trade off and is there an explicit kind of margin constraint or margin feeling you build into those?","Alan Mulally","Okay, Brian, I\u2019ll take a shot first. Very, very good question, but first let\u2019s acknowledge fabulous results, fabulous margin, great consistency over a number of quarters so clearly running on all cylinders in North America which is presently the backbone of the results.","I think what you\u2019re seeing first of all is you\u2019re seeing strength of the brand, you\u2019re seeing strength of the products and the great refresh rates that we\u2019ve got and I already touched on some of the individual performance by vehicle line just a second ago. The pricing is holding up and the team is doing a very good job in terms of being very disciplined on that as well as on matching production to demand, and of course the great cost structure is continuing to bear fruit for us.","Now, what we saw in the first quarter, and we kind of touched on this a bit I think in the January earnings call is we are seeing costs go up at a rate that, in the first quarter...we\u2019re holding the margin down from I\u2019ll call it just a pure leverage effect flowing through. And it\u2019s really around the fact that particularly in the first quarter, remember we added the 400,000 units of annualized capacity of last year? Most of that happened after the first quarter; now we\u2019ve got all those shifts in place. We also are continuing to invest very heavily in engineering for new products and I also touched on the noncash kind of unique items that we were going to see effect the bottom line this year around OPB and pension and the asset impairment from 2008 as that ran off.","The other thing that you\u2019re seeing in the results in the quarter is we have about $300 million of bad news on mix in the quarter which is actually good because what it says is we\u2019re being successful in our strategy to sell more in terms of the smaller vehicles, smaller and medium size vehicles, again touched on the success that we\u2019re having there. So that along with the costs that I touched on which is largely for growth this year and in the future is what is keeping the margin at sort of that fantastic level of 11% in the quarter.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","And do you debate about whether you should dial back some of those investments that give more margin to shorter term?","Alan Mulally","Well, we clearly expect to continue to get a great margin going forward. We\u2019ve guided in our mid-decade outlook of just to an 8% to 10% margin which as I mentioned a number of times in the past is a very, very strong margin in the automotive business on a consistent basis. That\u2019s sort of a cycle average type of number. We\u2019re going to continue to invest because we believe we have great growth opportunities not only in places like Asia Pacific and some of the other growing markets of the world but here in North America and what I touched on was in the coast and in the southeast.","We under-index our share in that part of the country. And the type of products that I touched on earlier around the super segment are starting to bear fruit. A lot of the share growth that we actually saw in the quarter came from those regions as opposed to the sort of Great Lakes, central part of the country which has been our historical core strength. So that\u2019s all good and we think it\u2019s the right call to make to continue to invest in future growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Silver with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get some color on Europe. It looked like you downgraded the sales decrease to about negative 3.5% to 7% down 2013 versus 2012 which makes a lot of sense. But I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some color on what you would, what signs you see that would lead you to the higher end of that range because it seems like things have sort of accelerated in a worse direction.","The second thing on that is there was a stock build of $400 million favorable verse last year. I know it\u2019s difficult measuring these on a year-on-year basis but could you give us a sense of where you and your dealer inventory fits in Europe? And then maybe you articulated this but what was the value of the D&A impairment in the quarter?","Sean Ryan","This is Sean. Let me just give you a couple of responses then we\u2019ve got Steven Odell online and he can provide some of the additional color. First of all, the guidance that you see on the slide of 13 million to 13.5 million units is not a change in guidance.","In January at the earnings call the slide showed 13 million to 14 million but we\u2019d seen some indicators just before the call that caused us to make a verbal adjustment to that, that we actually shared with everyone on the call of lower end of 2013 to 2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re simply reflecting here. And we had a BofA conference that Joe Hendricks spoke to in New York in March and actually again reconfirmed the 13 million to 13.5 million. So that\u2019s not a change in our guidance at all. What was the next point?","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","In the context of that you had a stock build of $400 million, Bob. And I know it\u2019s tough to do comparing versus last year but just what\u2019s the sense of your stocks and your dealer stocks right now?","Bob Shanks","Yeah. Well, the dealer stocks \u2013 and Stephen can add \u2013 the dealer stocks are in great shape. We talked in the fourth quarter about doing a strategic stock reduction and we basically have gotten there with that. We\u2019re in a low 40 day supply range in terms of that. What you\u2019re actually seeing, we only had 13,000 units of stock change in the quarter. Last year we had a stock reduction of 20,000 units so it\u2019s the change in the change if you will that\u2019s generating the $400 million of the total company, I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were talking about Europe. Yeah. In the case of total companies that\u2019s what you were talking about.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","No, I was talking Europe.","Alan Mulally","Okay, yeah. So that\u2019s what happened. It\u2019s actually, it\u2019s a non-repeat of the stock reductions that we saw last year which we actually said in January would be one of the positive factors that you\u2019d see in our results this year and that\u2019s what\u2019s coming through.","Bob Shanks","Stephen, do you want to add anything else?","Stephen Odell","Just two quick comments. The industry in the first quarter ran of about 13.2, 13.3, so it was right in the middle of our guidance. And April, although not finished yet, is running at the same sort of level. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the full-year industry guidance.","And one important business factor coming out of the reduced dealer inventory \u2013 because the dealers are running about 40 days\u2019 supply, it differs by market \u2013 is that now we\u2019re actually getting dealers press us for units that we hold so, then as opposed to us pressing them, and that\u2019s a significant change in business operation and helpful in the regard of also performing better on retail penetration. We just added 8,000 units of Kuga production because the dealers want to sell more units, up to 100,000 units out of Valencia. So it was exactly the right thing to do from a business perspective but also from a long going operating perspective.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","Thank you very much. And then last thing\u2019s on that D&A impairment. What was the value of that in the quarter in Europe?","Alan Mulally","Yeah. If you go to the slide on Europe, which is, let me just find it here, go to Slide 16, Matt. And what you can see to the far right is we show the restructuring costs that we incurred in the quarter was $110 million. You can see structural costs were $83 million, the majority of that I think at around $80 million or so was the accelerated depreciation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everybody.","Alan Mulally","Morning.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Couple questions first of all on structural costs; they were up $900 million for the company this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations for the year and within North America, $500 million yet a very good 17% increase in wholesale volumes that covered that this quarter but the production comps obviously get a little bit tougher over the next few quarters because you had capacity expansions in the middle of last year? So maybe just some broad comments on what we should be expecting in terms of structural costs.","Alan Mulally","Thanks for that, Rod. Yeah, we mentioned in January that we expected the structural costs to be increasing at a rate that exceeded last year. We didn\u2019t provide any specific numbers, I\u2019m not going to do that today but you can already start to see it come through in the first quarter.","And when you look at the roughly $900 million increase on a company basis the way to think about that is we kind of break it down not by sort of areas of the business but sort of causal factors. About 30% of that is related to volume this year to support shifts over time sourcing work pattern changes and so forth.","About 40% I would call future growth and a lot of that is around the engineering expense that\u2019s going up as well as the investments in the branch or the advertising sales promotion which a part, by the way, is volume related directly.","And then you\u2019ve got about a quarter or so that is European restructuring and then some of these unique things we talked about in January around, in North America in particular, OPB, the asset impairment runoff and then Europe and North America on the pension side. So those are the factors and I think you\u2019ll see that pattern continue through the course of the year and we will see higher levels of cost increases as the business grows, as we respond to the needs of our business to support higher shares and higher industries and the expanded product line going forward.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and just two more things. In Europe it sounds like you\u2019re not assuming any material increase in the sales pace but could you just comment on whether you have any expectations for improving country mix or Ford share in the guidance you\u2019re providing? And then lastly just a question related to China. Are there royalties that are being received in some your other regions? I know that the China earnings specifically are not material because of the investment but are you receiving royalties in your other divisions that would be material to the other regions?","Alan Mulally","Yeah. In the case of Europe we came in at a 7.7% share in the quarter. We\u2019re guiding to a share that\u2019s flat for the full-year more or less which was 7.9% last year so we clearly expect to do better as we move forward in the balance of the year. And again, you didn\u2019t ask this question but I just have to underscore the good things that are going on in that number.","The team has delivered, as we said in the comments earlier, a retail share increase which as you know from following North America was a critical part of the turnaround of our business here. And to achieve that in the first quarter right out of the gate is just absolutely fantastic and particularly in the environment that we\u2019re in. And if you look at the pricing, pricing was basically flat, negative $23 million on the size of the business that is and by the way good news compared with the fourth quarter.","So doing very well there and being very disciplined to take down the share in those other segments. We didn\u2019t see a share increase in net fleet which we\u2019re targeting but that was because largely the Genk facility was not producing much during the quarter. So really, really good results there and we do expect as new products roll out and we get more availability of new products that we\u2019ll see better shares as the year progresses.","Maybe by quarter we\u2019ll be up and down a bit, I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re going to do better as we go forward. And on the royalties we are seeing royalties come through from the Chinese joint ventures. That\u2019s the major factor but we also see royalties coming from our joint ventures on autos in particular and smaller levels of royalties elsewhere, but China would be the major one and autos on it a bit and Russia as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies. Please proceed. Mr. Nesvold, your line is open.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","Sorry, had it on mute. Good morning. Perhaps a related question to Brian\u2019s question on operating leverage, a little bit about Rod is talking about on China. We look at APA, the revenues doubled in the last five years or so to $10 billion. The segment income is still roughly break even. I know the re-investment rate is very high in that region right now. Is there any way you can help us think through what that region looks like looking out two years, is it three years; at what point does the re-investment start to taper off and how should we think about what kind of earnings contributor that particular region could be looking at a few years from now.","Alan Mulally","Okay, thanks for the question, Peter. And the questions on leverage are completely understandable. On the question of APA, we have said previously that by mid-decade it\u2019s going to represent a really material portion of the overall company\u2019s profits. Because by then, we will \u2013 we have under construction right now seven plants as I mentioned; five in China and two in India. We\u2019ve got a lot of engineering underway that we\u2019re incurring the cost for today.","That\u2019s going to substantially expand our portfolio and the number of segments that we participate in across the region. So that\u2019s kind of where we find ourselves. We were very delicately balanced between that very strong growth and then the investments which will pay off in the next several years. But I think we\u2019ll start to see next year the region contribute more meaningfully. But certainly by mid-decade it\u2019s going to make a big difference in terms of the bottom line of the company.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","And then as a quick follow-up, can you just update on us where you are in localizing production in South America? Historically that was a region that could contribute as much as $1 billion in pre-tax. At what point do you think you\u2019ve localized enough that you can start to generate growth in that region outside of just the cycle. And is there any way of framing perhaps what level of production you\u2019ll have in that region versus past peak sales volumes so we could try to think through what kind of profit contributor that could be in a few years? Thank you.","Alan Mulally","Well most of the volume that\u2019s sold there is actually built because of the very high tariff barriers that they have in place in all the key markets. We are rolling out all new products, global products that will replace our legacy products. We\u2019re planning to increase our market coverage from 67% today to about 82% by 2015. So that will contribute not only to absolute growth but we think a strong relative position in the marketplace. What you\u2019re seeing this year is extremely challenging conditions in Venezuela which I think everyone is \u2013 understands. But we\u2019re also seeing issues in terms of the economy in Argentina.","So I think we\u2019re starting to move past \u2013 I mean the trade restrictions we have reacted to, putting the Fiesta, the refreshed Fiesta into Brazil. Actually we were planning to do that before those changes but that will clearly help us. But we\u2019re in \u2013 it\u2019s in progress of being launched right now. So I think we feel good about our plan for South America but we\u2019ve just got to work through these issues that we\u2019re suffering from in terms of exchange rates. You can\u2019t price for that much exchange overnight. And so, you\u2019re going to have to continue to work our way through that over the course of the year and beyond.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","Great. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you.","Alan Mulally","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, everybody.","Alan Mulally","Hi, Adam.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey. So Alan, I\u2019ve got to ask you about the Japanese yen. On January 29th on your 4Q call I asked about it when the yen was just over 90 and you mentioned that you felt there were conversations with the U.S. government on how to encourage the free market to set FX rates and you were kind of encouraged by that. I was curious now with it now pushing 100 how your thoughts have changed. Have you seen any signs of either behavior changing amongst your Japanese competitors or if that pace of discussion is intensifying?","Alan Mulally","Sure, Adam. Really important cell and I am still very much encouraged because since we talked the U.S. government has also continued that dialog with Japan. It\u2019s also included in the discussion about the Free Trade Agreement with the TPP and again, I\u2019m very encouraged to see just the conversation about letting the markets set the exchange rates, being part of those free trade agreements also. So clearly this affects everybody around the world and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to work this out to get back to real based trading.","With respect to the near term we haven\u2019t seen the effect of that yet in a big way but clearly that would put many people at very much of a disadvantage if that continues. So I\u2019m very encouraged that we\u2019re going to continue to work this between government-to-government.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, Alan. And Mike, I\u2019ve got just one follow up question for you about the CSPB, Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, where these rules went into enforcement on the 21st of March and is one of the largest automotive lenders here in the United States. Are you seeing any changes in how you\u2019re communicating and working with your dealers? Can you comment on the level of surveillance or any changes of the brackets in terms of the dealer markup and just comment broadly on the risks you think this could add to your business.","Mike Seneski","Okay, Adam. Well first, we\u2019re not subject to CSPB examination at this time because there is no larger market participant rule. Now that said, Ford Credit is absolutely committed to compliance. It\u2019s part of our culture. Our goals are all built around long term relationships with our customers so that they become repeat Ford customers in the future. All of our contract decisions are based on objective data. As it relates to dealer compensation the CSPB has stated that auto dealers provide a valuable service in helping customers with financing and they should be compensated for this. We agree and obviously we\u2019ll follow and watch as this develops in this space.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Interesting. That\u2019s fascinating, Mike. So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not subject to surveillance at this time but you could be, couldn\u2019t you?","Mike Seneski","We could be, and there is no larger market.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So if this were to continue where you\u2019re not subject to it but Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan, and everybody else is, then you\u2019re going to gain \u2013 potentially you could have a pretty significant market share opportunity as our understanding from the conference calls of your third-party financial services peers, this is a major, major issue for them.","Alan Mulally","We continue to follow the developments and obviously we will do whatever \u2013 we will follow whatever the legal rulings ultimately become because it is our goal to be compliant with all laws.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Love to follow-up with you after the call on this if possible?","Alan Mulally","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brigman with JP Morgan. Please, proceed.","Ryan Brigman \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi. Good morning. Thanks, for taking my question. Maybe just a little bit more on South America, obviously there was a lot of noise there this quarter with regards to currency. You\u2019ve already given some color on that. But it also looks like something, maybe somewhat material, running through the other, other lines. So perhaps you could just firstly shed some light on that?","And then secondly, your volume mix and your net pricing contribution there in 1Q was essentially offset by the higher contribution in other costs. And yet, your full-year breakeven guidance implies a $218 million rest-of-year profit. So something should be getting there in the remaining quarters of the year. What do you think it is that changes? Is it that your volume or your mix gets better or your pricing which already seems strong or is it more than maybe cost is less of a headwind? Thanks.","Alan Mulally","Hi. This is Mark. Great question. As Bob mentioned earlier, what we won\u2019t see in the rest of the year are assumption is the impact of the devaluation of the bol\u00edvar. But what\u2019s driving some better performance in the rest of the year is we\u2019re going to be launching our new Fiesta into the marketplace. And also, a little later this year, our new Focus so that will complement the performance our new EcoSport and Ranger and that will drive revenue and we expect some share performance. Secondly, the thing to keep in mind, in the first quarter volumes are usually the lowest. And the reason for that is you have the plant shutdowns for, particularly Carnaval in Brazil, which don\u2019t experience later in the year so those are the factors.","Ryan Brigman \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then maybe, just to finish with a more strategic question on Europe, one element of your restructuring plan there that differs from at least one of your rivals is that while you\u2019re also taking facility cost out, at the same time you plan to increase investments and structural spending in other areas to aggressively tackle that market which is think is always typically the right thing to do.","But of course we\u2019re all tempted to think that vehicle sales and production in Europe it\u2019s at this very abnormally low level and it\u2019s going to inevitably rebound. Registrations there just continue to slip further than expected, I\u2019m curious if you knew that the industry would not improve over the next several years, would that somehow cause to want to shift your strategy with regards to structural spending in the region?","Alan Mulally","Well that\u2019s a good hypothetical question and we\u2019ve run lots of scenarios internally as you might imagine. But our plan, our 50\/50 call is in fact that we\u2019ll see very modest growth in the industry and in economic conditions there. And on that basis as well as just what we know is helpful for the business which is to invest in product, regarding what the external conditions are that we\u2019ve got the right plan. Now as you said, that is a possibility, the scenario that you outlined.","And as you\u2019ve seen from us in many parts of the world and many parts of our business we will constantly look at the external environment and we will adapt as appropriate based on what is coming at us. But we think we\u2019ve got...so far the call we\u2019ve made for the year appears to be pretty good and as I said some of the indicators as we look further ahead suggest we could be bottoming out and perhaps this very modest improvement in the external environment we might see evidence of that later this year, early next year.","Ryan Brigman \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, thanks, guys, and congrats on the great North American results.","Alan Mulally","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin with Associated Press. Please proceed.","Dee-Ann Durbin \u2013 Associated Press","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about Lincoln. You were shipping Lincolns to Flat Rock during this quarter. I\u2019m assuming that, that is finished but I\u2019m curious if we\u2019re going to see any more expense for that and also are we going to see any additional expenses for a new marketing campaign now that the vehicles are actually on the ground?","Alan Mulally","Sure. Jim, you want to take that?","Unidentified Company Representative","Thanks for your question. The stock for Lincoln dealers on MKZ is still doing really nicely. Second half of April we started to get very normal levels of stock. The product MKZ especially is turning very well right now. We\u2019re really happy with the sales results. Obviously we have a few more weeks to close the month but I think you\u2019ll see in our sales results that the product is being extremely well received. The hybrid mix is much stronger than we thought. The sales on the coast are much stronger than we thought and we should have a really great story to tell at the end of the month.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Trudell with Bloomberg News. Please proceed.","Craig Trudell \u2013 Bloomberg News","Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. I had a question for Mr. Fields that I pulled up the conversation that you had with some of us after showing the Atlas concept in January. You were talking about the next generation F-Series, and you said that you\u2019re going to push, I think the words were, appropriate limits in all elements of the vehicle to maintain leadership there. Are we seeing in, within the engineering expense a push by Ford to spend on this to make sure that this vehicle remains a leader?","Alan Mulally","Thanks for the question. Overall, as you said, we\u2019re very proud of the fact that the F-Series remains a leader in the segment. And as you heard from Bob\u2019s comments earlier, when you look at some of the structural costs, a number of those structural costs were in the engineering area for new products. So clearly, as we work on our future products, including next generation F-Series, it\u2019s inherent in those numbers. And I think the key is making sure, as we manage that business, we manage it appropriately. And I think if you look at it this year, our stocks are in good shape, our transaction prices are up over $1,100, and we\u2019re at the top on transaction prices in the segment. So I think we\u2019re managing the business appropriately. And we\u2019ll do that to keep our leadership position for the current product and any future product going forward.","Craig Trudell \u2013 Bloomberg News","Great. And if I could have just one follow-up question, actually for Mr. Odell. I wonder about the pricing environment in Europe. You guys did pretty well on pricing in the first quarter it appears. I wonder what your outlook is for Ford specifically and for the industry, how the industry is performing from a pricing standpoint and how it might perform going forward?","Stephen Odell","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s pretty tough to predict other than, with industry levels running in the, between the 13 million and 13.5 million in capacity, considerably above that in the industry, we should expect, and indeed we are very competitive levels of spend. Just to confirm, although I\u2019ve seen something to the contrary, just to confirm, we are actually below industry average for volume manufacturers on the spend which is part of why you saw our net pricing being basically neutral in the down industry. And one of the ways that we can achieve that is by driving business towards the more profitable segments like retail business.","And we intentionally took down rental and demo business in the first quarter, about 20,000 units in total, which we elected not to pursue, partly through margin, but also because it, not doing so, allows us to richen our mix toward retail. And that\u2019s obviously helped by the new product deliveries coming through at a much accelerated pace. So my perspective would be, if the industry remains in that band width, to be as competitive as it currently is, but of course, it\u2019s very volatile so we\u2019ll remain competitive but we are selective in where we chose to do our business.","Craig Trudell \u2013 Bloomberg News","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle with the Detroit Free Press. Please, proceed.","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Good morning, gentlemen. I just wanted to ask you about there was talk about negative pricing due to the mix in the quarter. And I\u2019m wondering how that might track for the rest of the year and whether you think that higher incentives are potential on pickups or other vehicles going forward?","Bob Shanks","Alisa, its Bob. Let me just clarify one thing. Thanks, for the question. When I was talking about the mix effect being negative that is not pricing. That\u2019s just the fact that we sell more vehicles that have lower margins than, for example, an F Series so it gives us an average negative mix affect in that regard. But as I said, that\u2019s simply a reflection of the success that we\u2019ve had in selling those vehicles. So as we look ahead for the balance of the year, I think we would expect to continue on a year-over-year basis to see that adverse mix in North America which again think of it as a very positive because it just simply means we\u2019re being very successful with these new products in the smaller, medium-size segments.","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","And do you see incentives becoming a factor going forward especially in pickups?","Bob Shanks","Well as you look at our \u2013 we\u2019ve been very, very, very consistent. Our incentives don\u2019t kind of \u2013 they\u2019re not particularly volatile. We might be tactical in any given month on any particular product. But on average, our incentives month-to-month-to-month have been very, very consistent.","One thing that \u2013 it came up in earlier question that we\u2019re going to have to watch very closely is what happens competitively as the Japanese competitors are able to benefit from the weak Yen. We are starting, around the world not just in North America, very selectively and very early to see some signs that they\u2019re taking advantage of that. But it\u2019s a little bit too early to make any particular forecasts around that other than we need to really focus on costs because we know that that\u2019s going to be important regardless of however they chose to handle that.","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey with the Wall Street Journal. Please, proceed.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street Journal","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Quick question was on the \u2013 as your platforms go down \u2013 Alan mentioned that you\u2019re down to nine is going to produce 85% of your sales volume globally. And your margins continue to tick up. Is it possible to quantify how much that has contributed to your profitability in terms of reducing your platforms? Is there any way to quantify how much, like maybe over the past five years or even two or three years, how much more profitable each vehicle sale is because of your reduced platforms?","Alan Mulally","Well, I\u2019ll just give you my perspective then maybe others can chime in. We\u2019ve not quantified that externally. Clearly you can understand in the case of something like an engineering expense, it costs so much to engineer a vehicle, you can do that and then provide that vehicle to all four regions of the world and everyone is sharing in that engineering expense; clearly all parts of the business are benefiting.","The other thing that we benefit from this isn\u2019t just the cost side it\u2019s large emission. We actually can more rapidly and more realistically expand our offerings around the world to a degree that we never have been able to in the past. And an example will be Explorer that we started to build in Russia. Focus in China.","We actually wholesaled more in Focus in China in the first quarter than we did in Europe or North America. Who would have thought that just a couple of years ago? So we have so much greater ability to grow and expand the business because we can take this global portfolio and we can just pick and choose and decide where we want to place these products to take advantage of a particular market opportunity. Mark, do you have anything you want to add on that?","Bob Shanks","No, I think you covered it.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street Journal","And just real quick. This is going to sound like a silly question but Venezuela seems like such a small country yet it seems to be having such an out prized impact. Is that because of the Valencia plant being located there? Or can you explain why it has had such a significant impact on earnings?","Bob Shanks","Yeah, it has a significant impact. It is a very small part of the business. I think the industry\u2019s only about 180,000 units and I think last year we sold maybe 23,000 units. The issue is that the exchange rate is controlled by the government and it\u2019s artificially strong. So what they\u2019ve had a history of doing in past years is they kind of periodically will do an official one time evaluation. Our balance sheet, because we have difficulty in getting cash out, we get exposed if you will on the asset side relative to liabilities and then when they devalue, suddenly we\u2019ve got to sort of devalue that asset positive balance sheet and we take a hit when we do that.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street Journal","Okay. Thank you for that explanation.","Alan Mulally","I don\u2019t know if you understood that, but that\u2019s what makes it very, very tough in the marketplace. And more recently at this past evaluation there\u2019s actually a press run on all the manufacturers who hold back on pricing, so it\u2019s a very tough market and we\u2019re just going to have to work our way through that.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street Journal","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks for coming back. I had a couple of questions about seasonality in both North America and Europe and the progression throughout the year. Maybe in Europe first, I think typically you could have a stronger first half versus the back half because of downtime in Q3 and Q4. Should we expect a similar pattern this year? Or does the progression and the momentum that you\u2019ll have in new product launches counter-balance that? What should we expect in terms of the cadence throughout the year?","Alan Mulally","Well Chris, I understand why you\u2019re asking that question. I would too if I were in your shoes, but I really, really am reluctant to say anything that would be interpreted as a forecast of any particular quarter for any particular region. You\u2019re correct in looking at history that in general the first half will be better than the second half, and that has to do with the long vacations in the summer and that type of thing. But we\u2019re in kind of a different place in terms of the restructuring.","The restructuring, I think, will hopefully continue to build on the fabulous results that Steve and the team have delivered in the first quarter. We\u2019ve got a lot of new product that have yet to be fully reflected in the marketplace. It\u2019s possible that as we said earlier you could see a little bit of tilting upward, if you will, in terms of economic and industry conditions toward the latter part of the year. So I really would hesitate to make any forecasts on a quarterly basis for Europe in particular.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Those are all helpful points. Maybe similar without giving us the answer, some comments about North America; the different cost items that came in, is that stuff all relatively steady as you go throughout the year? I know pension expense usually is pretty consistent quarter to quarter, and I\u2019m guessing the changes in your D&A and so forth are pretty consistent quarter to quarter. Are there any expense items that are going to travel up or down relative to what they were in Q1?","Alan Mulally","Well I mean obviously engineering isn\u2019t flat by quarter, and then on a year-over-year basis, as I mentioned earlier, some of the things that are affecting us in the first quarter have started to come into play last year as those quarters progressed. Warranty is lumpy because we do have different periods where we kind of true up the reserves based on the maturity of the time and service for the vehicle lines, so that can be lumpy.","But in general those are probably the exceptions I think.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just the last item on pricing, maybe at a high level, your expectations for North America and Europe in terms of price, maybe focusing on your view of competition and your view of the current status of supply\/demand in the market?","Alan Mulally","Well, for total company we expect the year to offer positive pricing to the bottom line. We do think that North America will be a significant contributor to that, of course with the caveat that we\u2019ll have to continue to watch and monitor what happens here as the competitors that benefit from the weaker currencies do or don\u2019t take advantage of that, and it depends on how they do that. I think I the case of Europe, as Stephen pointed out, just doing a great job of holding the line, and I think as the year progresses, if we can come out the year having done that, I think that will be a great step forward for us, and I think we will see positive pricing in the other parts of Ford.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thank you. Good morning. So just wanted to ask the North America cost question a bit differently, Bob. Should the year-over-year comparisons, in terms of the cost headwind get a little bit easier for you in the back half of the year once you lap the capacity increases for next year, or is this sort of year-over-year headwind indicative of the rest of the year?","Bob Shanks","Well, again, I don\u2019t want to provide a quarterly forecast I think you\u2019ll see increases decay on a year-over-year basis for each quarter, and it probably will vary a little bit as we go forward for the total company, and again for some of the reasons I just mentioned. You know, the counterization of engineering. As those capacity increases came in, as we continue to make further investments for growth, not for this year but for forward years. So, I think it\u2019s. You can expect cost increases, but I think it\u2019ll vary by quarter.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great. And then two quick questions on Europe. One, the second quarter production schedule was a little bit stronger than what we would have thought. Could you talk a little bit about that. Is that some of the Kuga ramp impacting that number? I think you\u2019re calling for actually an increase year-over-year. And then, do you have a sense yet of, or can you provide the date for the Mondeo launch next year in Europe?","Bob Shanks","Yeah. Maybe Stephen can handle that.","Stephen Odell","Sure. Thank you. What you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter is in part, as you referenced, incremental Kuga production. Not only are we ramping up, but actually we\u2019re looking to ramp up at a faster pace to try and match demand. You\u2019re also seeing full production out of Genk since we reached the agreements that Bob alluded to earlier on. The plan has produced, actually pretty much on schedule every day, and our expectation is that will continue through the second quarter.","Alan Mulally","Monday.","Stephen Odell","Oh, I\u2019m sorry, Monday launch. We\u2019re looking at probably the fourth quarter of next year. Remember, that we still in the information and consultation period with the Belgium unions, and that would allow us to cease production in Belgium subject to agreement in September of next year, and obviously we\u2019d then have to run POP production in Valencia, so it would be some while after that period.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much, guys.","Alan Mulally","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Speth with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joe Speth \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning and thanks, everyone. Just maybe another way to ask North America. Given the current capacity you added and your current outlook for industry but also potentially some share gains, when do you envision approaching the level of utilization that you had early 2012 when you had to sort of think about adding some more capacity?","Alan Mulally","Well, we\u2019ll not fully utilizing our capacity right now and in some plants we are, but we\u2019re not overall in the system. So we still have a little bit of flexibility around that regard. Obviously if there\u2019s a need and we\u2019re able to use that capacity we\u2019ll do so but we wouldn\u2019t have anything to say about that now. I\u2019m sorry. Someone just reminded me, which I should mention. We have announced specifically the added shift coming onto Flat Rock for the Fusion. That will be in the second half of the year.","Joe Speth \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just, you touched on this a little bit but circling back to Europe you noted that pricing wasn\u2019t that much of a headwind but we have heard some horror stories on pricing out of there. So is that, that Europe pricing isn\u2019t necessarily getting worse? Are you maintaining some discipline or maybe you could just provide a little bit of color there. And then also on the mix factor in Europe. You said retail share gains, which I would think would be a positive mix for you unless it\u2019s being captured somewhere else, so is that a factor that can turn positive throughout the year if that trend continues?","Alan Mulally","Yeah. Stephen, do you want to handle that?","Stephen Odell","Yeah. We see the pricing outlook as I tried to answer earlier on as stable. It\u2019s obviously very competitive, more competitive than it\u2019s been probably ever but stable at that level unless something significant happens to spook the markets. As Bob said, could be that we see we reach the trough later in the year and then, or later this year early next year, and then we start to see a gradual return and that would obviously help pricing.","Joe Speth \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And on mix, we have adverse mix in Europe in the quarter, a lot of that around the lack of the availability of the CD vehicles to the extent that the market would demand, and as Stephen said that has now been addressed with the plant back up and producing as of the latter part of March. So for the full year we would expect the possibility of having positive mix effects in Europe.","Alan Mulally","And, Bob, if I can just add to that. Not only have we got Genk back up and producing, but we\u2019ve also effectively re-launched the current Mondeo with probably a stronger bias towards retail. It now meets certain benchmarks, below benchmarks on tax incentives for CO2 and more equipment at the same price, so completely agree with the comment.","Operator","This is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. George Sharp for any closing remarks.","George Sharp","Thank you. Thanks, everyone. That concludes today\u2019s presentation. We\u2019re really glad that you were able to join us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are on listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director of Ford, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Ted Cannis","Thank you very much, Emma, and good morning everyone. On behalf of the entire Ford Management Team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us today so we can provide you the additional details of our 2015 fourth quarter and full year financial results.","Copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slides are available on our Ford Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix to the slides. Today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect actual results are summarized at the end of this presentation and are detailed in our SEC filings.","So presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks our Chief Financial Officer and also participating are Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.","Mark over to you.","Mark Fields","Okay. Thanks Ted. And good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. I'm really pleased to review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall, last year on this call we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered. We achieved a record company full year pretax profit of $10.8 billion.","Looking at the business units, every business unit with the exception of South America was profitable. In Europe, we returned to profitability and we earned over $1.25 billion. That reflects the progress of our transformation plan. Asia Pacific had its best ever annual profit and of course North America and Ford Credit continue to deliver strong profitability for the company.","We also generated our highest volume in 10 years and the most revenue in 12 years and our automotive operating-related margin came in at 6.8% and that was the highest since at least the 1990s. And in automotive-related operating cash flow, we came in at $7.3 billion and that was the best that we generated since 2001.","We also at the same time grew our global market share and that's in large part due to the strength of our new products and a little bit of a sampling of that Explorer remained the best selling three-row SUV in the world. Mustang, which as you know we took global last year is the world's best selling sports car. F Series is America's best selling pickup for 39 straight years and the bestselling vehicle for 34 years in a row.","We're also again America's bestselling vehicle brand for the sixth straight years and in Europe, we became the number one commercial vehicle brand and that's the first time we've been able to achieve that in 18 years.","And turning to Lincoln, we delivered a second straight of U.S. sales growth and we also became the first luxury brand in China to top 10,000 sales in its first full year of operation.","And of course along with this strong performance, we rewarded our shareholders with distributions totaling $2.5 million during the year and also growing our regular dividend by 20%. And I strongly believe that these results once again demonstrate that our plan, our people and our process are delivering and they're creating value for our stakeholders.","Now, looking at the fourth quarter on the next slide, you can see it was another terrific quarter that helped contribute to our performance for the year. Our fourth quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion was nearly double a year ago.","Our net income came in at $1.9 billion and our automotive operated margin came in at 6.1% and that was up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Importantly, we also delivered strong topline growth with our wholesale volume and automotive revenue both up 12% and revenue was up 18% at constant exchange and we generated strong automotive operating-related cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter.","We were profitable in all business units, except South America, including a record profit in Asia Pacific, a fourth quarter record in North America and another solid quarter from our Ford Credit operations and in Europe we delivered our third consecutive profitable quarter.","So in sum, our profits improved, our market share improved and our margins improved delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders and we're also guiding to achieve equally strong or better results this year.","Now, turning to Slide 4, 2015 was also a year of progress from an operating point as well. We successfully completed the 16 global launches that we planned.","We improve quality and customer satisfaction around the world as we launched those products and we continue to invest for profitable growth in the future. And I believe of all our accomplishments, one of the most significant was delivering such strong results in the near term while expanding our business model for the future and we're growing and investing to be both an auto and a mobility company.","'","And what this means is we're strengthening and investing in core business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing, financing and servicing great cars, trucks, SUVs and electrified vehicles.","But also at the same time, we're aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility with the most recent announcement of SYNC Connect and our plan to have the largest autonomous vehicle test fleet in the industry.","And we're also working to transform the automotive customer experience with the introduction of FordPass. And as we do all of this, we're going to stay absolutely focused on accelerating the pace of progress of our One Ford Plan, delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of the business.","So with that I'll, turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the financial results.","Bob Shanks","Thanks Mark. What I'd like to do is to start on Slide 5, which is our key financial summary. And the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth columns.","Those are the year-over-years for the fourth quarter and the full year and what you'll see is everything is positive. So whether it's the growth factor, it's the operating results or the net income factors, cash liquidity, everything better than in 2015, whether the quarter or the full year.","Now certainly we should recognize that, and we\u2019ll talk about it later in the presentation that we\u2019re seeing strong improvement from across most parts of the business, in fact all parts of the business in terms of the full year and we should recognize too that we\u2019re benefitting from the big bet that we made on the F-150.","We had the launch effects of that in 2014 and including in the fourth quarter and that was a big bet for the company and it's paying off for us. It\u2019s certainly resonating with customers. It\u2019s good for the environment and certainly as I said we\u2019re reaping the rewards of that.","Since I\u2019m going to touch on most of these things in the subsequent comments and slides, I just want to highlight three things that I won't come back to later.","The first down the page under operating results, let\u2019s look at our earnings per share and operating basis, you can see that we came in at $0.58, which is up 93% from a year ago and $1.93 which is up 44%.","Go down a bit further and look at the after-tax results, net income you can see we came in at the quarter at $1.9 billion that was up very sharply from a year ago and $7.4 billion for the full year up $6.1 billion.","If you go up just a couple lines from there you can see the special items pre-tax charges in the quarter, we have $714 million that was almost completely explained by the re-measurement losses on our pension and OPEB plans.","Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 6, I\u2019ve got three slides for the full year I\u2019d like to touch on those first and then we\u2019ll get into more details of the quarter. These are the absolutes of the quarter and you can see the record of $10.8 million and then as you glance across the segments, you can see everything that\u2019s profitable in terms of the business units with the exception of South America.","And if you look at the operations outside of North America collectively we made $223 million. To me the big story and one of the big stories that we want to get across today is the quality of the improvement across the business on a year-over-year basis.","If you look below the charge you can see the changes. The $3.57 billion improvement at the company level, it was driven by North America $1.9 billion of financial services, a contributor over $200 million but we got $1.4 billion of improvement from the operations outside North America and going forward our whole strategy is to keep North America strong, strengthen it to the extent that we can.","But it\u2019s really the other operations we need to get them moving forward in a positive direction both in terms of profitability and returns that\u2019s the big opportunity for us as well as the new opportunities and you can see we made great progress on that in the full year and I\u2019ll touch on that in the quarter as well.","Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 7 and here we'll look at the key metrics for the company. This is the automotive sector for the full year. So just kind of looking across the page; wholesale is up 5%, revenue up 4%, 9% at constant exchange, very strong improvement in the operating margin 6.8% and the pre-tax results up 60%.","And on the lower left, you can see the global market share which is up two tenths that was in South America and Europe and some favorable geographic mix effects as well.","Let\u2019s go on to Slide 8 and here we will look at the full year improvement. You can see $3.3 billion that was driven by $7.4 billion of improvement and market factors, volume, mix, net pricing all driving that in the positive direction.","We did have cost increases, both contribution cost and structural cost. The one thing I\u2019d like to highlight here we\u2019ve broken out for the first time manufacturing and engineering separately and you can see with the manufacturing call out, that we\u2019ve also indicated that it includes volume related effects.","Some companies include variable and labor and overhead in volume, but we don\u2019t do that. We put all that in structural cost, which is why we don\u2019t call it fixed cost because we recognize that the downturn we\u2019re able to respond appropriately whether it\u2019s taking over time out, shifts, lines to be changed and so forth.","And so hopefully that will help to understand better the cost and the nature of the cost that we're investing in the business.","On the far right, you can see the ratification bonus related to the UAW agreement. I should note that within the results and all this sits in North America, we\u2019ve got about $600 million of cost increases associated with the agreement.","Most of that is the one-time ratification bonus. The rest of it is just normal cost increases related to wage increases and so forth and that\u2019s sitting in our structural cost.","All right. Now let\u2019s move into the fourth quarter. I will start by looking at the absolutes on Slide 9, again very strong performance $2.6 billion and again glance across the page and you can see everything profitable with the exception of South America and again the collected results of the operations outside North America of profit of nearly $300 million.","Again I want to highlight the story year-over-year, go below the chart first line, $1.3 billion, $400 million from North America about a $130 million from financial services, but more than 50% or $760 million coming from the operations outside of North America, again demonstrating the progress that we\u2018re making in getting the company more balanced in terms of the contributions around the world.","Now let\u2019s move to the key metrics on Slide 10, again growth in wholesale is double digits, same thing in revenue of 18% a constant exchange, a good margin for the fourth quarter of 6.1% and pretax results have more than doubled and on the lower left, you can see our global market share was flat.","Let\u2019s go on to Slide 11, and here we'll look at the change in our automotive sector results year-over-year up $1.1 billion. Very similar pattern to what we saw in the full year, very strong market factors. We had cost increases again look at the structural cost, you can see the manufacturing of 23.5. Almost all of that is volume related. The balance is explained by the UAW contract and then the gratification bonus to the far right.","Okay. Let's go on to North America and here we'll start going through the business units. These are the key metrics. North America had very strong growth in the quarter. It was their best quarter of growth of the year.","You can see wholesale is up 15%, revenue up probably nearly 20%. The operating margin very, very good at 8.2% traditionally for the fourth quarter is our weakest quarter and this includes the full $600 million of UAW related cost. So really strong result from North America and you can see the profits of $2.1 -- or $2 billion of 26%. ","You go below the chart you can see the full year, very strong factors right across the Board and again the margin came in at 10.2%. As we look at the guidance for the year we expect to sustain this level of benchmark profitability with margins about around where we actually ended up about 9.5% or higher.","But I thought I would comment on this because it was certainly something that was discussed quite a bit at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier in the month when we provided our guidance.","Let me just again put into context how we're seeing the North American business. It is performing and has been performing for years at benchmark levels of profitability and margins and then as we've mentioned in three of the last four years other than the year when we launched that F-150, its been operating at 10% or higher, which actually is at the high end of the range that we're targeting on an ongoing basis of 8% to 10%.","Then in 2016 we expect the margins again to be in this range 9% or higher but unlike in 2015 when the year-over-year growth in the market factors far exceeded the cost increases, we expect to see a smaller improvement in the market factors while we'll continue to invest for profitable growth and this is reflecting mainly three factors.","The first is the fact that we will see much less benefit in '16 from industry growth in the U.S. The second one is that we are expecting impact of the super duty launch, which takes place in the second half to have an impact.","Now we've target a normal launch, but it\u2019s still going to incur cost associated with such a large launch and we're going to have the normal volume ramp up curve that we have to climb. So it will have an effect primarily in the third quarter.","And as mentioned lastly, we're continuing to invest for profitable growth this year and beyond not only in the traditional business, the core business, but also as we transformed Ford into an auto and a mobility company. So that\u2019s how we see it. We're very pleased with the results. We think we\u2019re going to sustain this level of profitability as we move into 2016.","Okay let's go to the following slide on Slide 13 and let\u2019s look at what happened in the quarter for North America, an improvement of $400 million strong market factors. Cost increasing related to the products which also drove the market factors, but also the structural cost, which were largely volume related and the UAW agreement with the ratification bonus also having effect which is over in other.","Mark Fields","And when you look at just a couple of comments we're coming off a strong year for Ford in the U.S. and as Bob mentioned earlier in terms of the investments, one of the stories within here is our new products have enabled strong pricing power with our transaction prices up over $2,200 versus last year and that was more than double the industry increase.","And going forward this year, we're going to continue to focus on profitable growth while at the same time launching some very important high volume products like the Escape, the Fusion and as Bob mentioned the Super Duty.","Let\u2019s turn now to South America on Slide 14, there is a lot of very big macro trends that are sweeping across the global economy and certainly the strong dollar commodity -- weak commodity cycle is one and there is probably no region that\u2019s more affected by this than South America and you can see it clearly in our results in the fourth quarter and the full year.","You can see the wholesales were down sharply 39%. The revenue was actually down 52%, about 45% of that was related to weaker currencies. Margin of course down sharply and the results were down as well.","If you look at the fourth quarter the same-store EBIT, when you get to the full year, you can see that we actually had an improvement in the results and that was related to the fact that we have a non-refit of the big Venezuelan devaluations in 2014.","In terms of guidance, as we mentioned we expect our guidance or our guidance for that region is that it will be loss in 2016 and likely to be greater than what you're seeing today for 2015.","Okay, let\u2019s move on to South America on a year-over-year basis, down $108 million and if you look at the callout box on volume and mix you can see that it's more than explained by the industry decline.","We had a 33% reduction in the Brazil industry in the quarter. Clearly we had a impact on the business, but I will tell you our team did a great job of doing what they can do with the things they can control. We had a strong pricing. We had very favorable results in terms of cost performance and I would highlight that within these positive cost factors we have you have over $100 million of negative impact from the very high inflation that we're seeing in Brazil and in Argentina.","And then lastly I would call out the exchange we had over $100 million of bad news that came from the devaluation of the Argentinean Peso that came towards the end of the year as new governments started to take action to restructure the economy so it's good for the longer term of Argentina but certainly hurt the business in the fourth quarter.","Bob Shanks","Okay, let\u2019s turn to Europe now which is a very good story around the progress that the team is making there. In the fourth quarter, we were profitable. That's the third consecutive quarter of profitability.","We had the strongest growth among the business units in Europe in the fourth quarter. It was up 21% and wholesale is up 19% if your whole exchange constant and of course we returned to profitability with a positive margin.","And the story on a full year basis is just as good. We had growth although revenue was down if you adjust for exchange it was actually up 8% and then of course the profit that Mark mentioned of $259 million.","Now if you look in the lower left, you can see we also grew share in Europe. We were up six tenths of a point across the entire region that was driven by Britain and Germany and some favorable impact of the geographic mix of the markets. And we also had favorable market share among the Europe 20 and that was driven by good performance of the Mondeo and the Eco Sport.","In terms of guidance for 2016 we expect the results for Europe to be higher than what they were in 2015.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 17 and here we'll look at the year-over-year improvement on the quarter from Europe. So up $428 million and going across the page most everything positive we had favorable volume and mix.","We had higher net pricing. We had lower cost and if you go to the far right the other is largely the effect of the consolidation of our Ford Sollers and City in Russia. So really, really strong performance right across the Board in Europe.","Mark Fields","And just to jump in here for a second, obviously we're pleased with our progress in Europe, but not satisfied and we just want to be clear that getting profitable in Europe is just the first step and our goal is to deliver a sustainable and a vibrant business despite the competitive and regulatory pressures that we're seeing and also the difficult business conditions in Russia.","Bob Shanks","Okay. Let\u2019s go into Middle East and Africa. This is the only slide we have for this region. You can see we had growth in the quarter. We also had positive results and for the full year we had a profit of $31 million as the team continues to start to unfold the growth strategy that they developed put in place last year.","As we move into 2016 we expect the results to be about the same if not better in Middle East and Africa.","Let\u2019s go into Slide 19 and turn to Asia Pacific, great story here. Wholesales were up sharply 16%, the revenue was up 38% if you adjust for exchange, a very strong operating margin and record pretax results in the quarter.","If you look at the numbers below the chart, which are the full year somewhat quite as strong growth because the fourth quarter was clearing the big quarter of the growth in 2015. Very strong margin of over 7% and that record profit that we talked about earlier.","On the lower left you can see the share in China was flat but we did improve the share overall across the region and that was largely due to favorable geographic mix. In terms of guidance, we\u2019re expecting results in 2016 to be even better than that were in 2015.","Let\u2019s go to Slide 20 and we'll look at the improvement in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific which was quite strong $349 million was largely driven by volume and mix and you can see it was industry a bit of share which is again geographic mix favorable stocks as the industry grew and we also got new products into the pipeline and the mix was very, very strong.","Within this mix and other of $181 million you actually had $355 million of favorable mix that was largely the effect of the Edge which is hot and high margin, as well as good performance of the Mondeo and the Kuga.","And you can see that the cost were pretty much flat and over to far right you can see other that is largely the royalties in China, so volume related as well. So very strong performance across the region and setting us up for another record in 2016.","Mark Fields","And just focusing on China for a second, we delivered record sales in 2015 and we saw growth across the country, but the fastest growth actually occurred in the Tier 4 through six cities and as we started out this year what we're seeing is industry retail sales in January have started strong.","They look to be in line with the sales rate that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015 although they're moderating in the second half of the month versus the first half.","But just a note to point out that as you know the Chinese New Year is very variable. Some years it falls in January, some years it fall in February. So we're really going to need to look at how sales perform across January and February to get a clearer view of how the industry is tracking.","Bob Shanks","Okay. Let's turn now to Ford Credit and on Slide 21 we've actually created a new slide. We wanted to be able to show you the absolutes that are important to the Ford Credit operations.","On the far left, you can see a couple of growth metrics around contract volume, which was up 8% in the quarter. Managed receivables grew 12% as Ford Credit supported for its growth overall.","Pretax result of $556 million that was up 31% and then we've got three metrics, which just represent the portfolio performance, which continues to be very strong and very robust and for those of you that want to understand more of course you can call into the fixed income call, which will take place later today and our team will take you through more insights and details into Ford Credit's performance, but the portfolio performance continues to be at very, very good levels and in fact compared to history low levels.","If you look at the data below the chart, again growth across the Board there whether its volume or managed receivables of the profit of $2.1 billion and again look at those portfolio performance metrics are looking quite good and this is simply because Ford Credit has got a very clear point of view around its purchase polices.","It\u2019s been implementing those very consistently for a number of years. So for example in terms of high risk business continues to be about 5% to 6% of the portfolio and its performing very well as the data indicates.","What I want to highlight on the left and I am not going to talk about it until I get to the next slide, but look at the debt $120 billion to support Ford Credit and the managed leverage of 9.5 to 1. We target 8 to 9 to 1. It's above that level because of the effect of the strong dollar as it translates the equity of our operations outside of United States.","In terms of guidance, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be strong performer about the same if not better in 2016 than it was in 2015.","Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 22 and we'll look at the fourth quarter and year-over-year performance. Ford Credit, you can see that it was driven by the growth, the volume, favorable mix across the globe in terms of the products and services that it provides and favorable financing margin, which came from lower borrowing cost.","With that let\u2019s go into Slide 23 and we'll look at automotive sector cash and cash flow. This was a really great story in the quarter and also for the full year. If you go about a third way down the page, you can see the $2.1 billion of automotive operating cash flow the quarter, driven by the profits.","And if you look at the full year the $7.3 billion record at least of 2001 again driven by the very strong profits and then you can see the uses of the cash flow there. On the lower left, you can see we ended the year at $34.5 billion of liquidity, a very strong level and then the automotive debt of $12.8 billion.","I just want to stop by here because one of the things I just wanted to take a minute and comment on, we\u2019d seen a number of articles that continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company and generally that point of view is because people are taking this automotive debt, they're adding it to the financial services debt, which is on a previous page and of course the business will look for how to leverage.","But that\u2019s not the way that investors should look at. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it. If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self funding, Ford Credit also self liquidates in a downturn at lower volume.","And so you think about Ford Credit separately and then in terms of its own leverage you want to look at that managed leverage that I touched on and as I mentioned we've historically been within the 8% to 9% we target. A little bit above because of the translation effect in '15. but we're going to go back into a range in 2016.","The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is this what's on this page, the $12.8 million and this is the lowest it's been since 2000 and its representative of a very good leverage position by the company along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at.","So we're in great shape in terms of the balance sheet but I just wanted to clarify that for everyone who had any questions about that.","Okay I\u2019m going to wrap up on Slide 24 and this is looking at the planning assumptions and key metrics that we provided at the beginning of the year, and what I'll say is we delivered.","If you go to the very bottom of the Slide, you can see a new metric that we've added that we disclosed at the Deutsche Bank Conference earlier this month, which is our after-tax five-year average return on invested capital. We came in and at 16% 2015, which was unchanged from 2014 and in both years well above the cost of capital.","So Mark back to you to talk about '16 and wrap it up.","Mark Fields","Okay, thanks Bob. So as you go on Slide 25 here you can see the company guidance is unchanged from the outlook that we provided on January 12, and we expect 2016 to be another strong year for the company, one that features obviously sustained strong financial performance and returns, profitability across all parts of our business, except south America, a continued strong balance sheet and of course the next stage in the deployment of our shareholder distribution strategy.","Now as always for our process, we're going to continue to monitor the business environment to anticipate or react to any changes that we see and take appropriate action.","So to sum it up, before we get to the Q&A, we promised and we delivered on our commitments for 2015. We promised to restructure and invest in our operations around the world and we delivered both topline and bottom line growth.","And this year our commitment is to accelerate our pace of progress even further by building on our strengths, but also we're growing lean. We're going to be focusing obviously on profitability and making tough choices to restructure where necessary. We're moving fast to expand our business model and we're on track to deliver both our near and our long term strategic objectives.","And our commitment quite simply is to deliver continued strong results in 2016 and expand our business model to take advantage of the huge opportunities in the changing world.","So with that, why don\u2019t we just open the phone lines for your questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","John Murphy","Just a first question on cash flow, which was obviously very strong for the fourth quarter and for the full year, Bob as we look at the pretax profit that you\u2019re looking at for the total company is going to be flat on a year to year basis.","So I would imagine that's -- or up, but that\u2019s not going to have too big an impact that would be negative on free cash flow in 2016. So why the same or lower for the free cash flow number for 2016? Is there something else going on below the line that either benefited on in '15 that would be a headwind in '16?","Bob Shanks","Yes thanks John. That\u2019s a good question. Yeah there are two things to think about in terms of our call for 2016 and one of them is exactly what you mentioned. If you look and I am on Slide 23 here, if you look at the cash flow for the full year, you can see a favorable change in working capital and what we benefitted from was the fact that in 2014 we had the launch of the F-150 and there is a launch effect at the end of the year as well.","So we had a drain down if you will that was unusual of working capital. We kind of restored that, replenished that in 2015 and benefitted from that. That does not obviously repeat in 2016. So that\u2019s one of the factors.","The other factor on the slide you can see favorable other than timing differences and at least based on what we're seeing right now for '16, we don\u2019t think we're going to benefit same degree in that area of the cash flow statement as well.","So those are the two factors that are causing us at this time to say that it will still be strong yet not as strong as what you\u2019re seeing here on Slide 23. So I think you can get a sense that it's going to be a good number, but just not at the level that we're seeing right now.","Now of course we're going to continue to work to try to get everything out that we can and we will update you in the year if things change.","John Murphy","Thank incredibly helpful. The second question just APAC, it seems like you it a real inflection point here in the fourth quarter. It was like a very significant step up on year-over-year basis but more important on a run rate basis.","Is there anything that would change going forward here in the near turn? Just mitigate that step up because it is a big factor in the quarter.","Bob Shanks","John when you look at the run rate of the fourth quarter, so your question was for 2016, a couple of things, one is as you know in the fourth quarter we do have higher dealer stocks due to the seasonal increases as we prepare for the Chinese Lunar New Year selling season.","Also we had a few product launches. So were stocking up on that. Obviously we have to keep an eye on, on what\u2019s happening with the Renminbi in terms of the currency that\u2019s impacting us.","And of course we're going to continue to have investments particularly engineering in for new products, but also to meet the regulatory requirements. So we expect as you saw from the guidance to do better in Asia Pacific in 2016, but hopefully that gives you a little flavor of the run rate going in.","John Murphy","That's helpful and then just lastly, Brazil seems to be holding up very well for you and the industry. Obviously that's important for FMCC, but it\u2019s also very important for pricing on the new vehicle side.","What are you seeing on residuals and as we see this continent march on product cadence just ramping up, how important it is to keep supporting your residuals and how do you see that impacting pricing for the new vehicles?","Marion Harris","Hey John this is Marion Harris. Residual prices recently or our auction values have been holding up pretty well. We've seen a little bit of weakness recently, but nothing material.","And I think, as we look forward, with the growth in leasing over the last number of years, we do expect to see some higher auction volume coming through over the coming years and as such, we baked in or have planned some expectation lower used vehicle prices.","John Murphy","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please go ahead.","Colin Langan","Great, thanks for taking my question. One of the big highlights today seems to be the opportunity to see profits improve around the rest of the world. Can you remind us of the longer term targets you have in those major regions like Europe.","And I guess the attention may have changed from the last update a couple of years ago and then particularly Asia ex China, when do you think to maybe get that back to profitability?","Mark Fields","We would expect Europe to get to sort of a 6% to 8% margin, that\u2019s what we're targeting. If you think about Asia Pacific, there I think it would be 8% or maybe it\u2019s a bit higher because you've got the effect of the JV net income with no equity. So actually it could even be higher than that.","Do you remember Stuart?","Stuart Rowley","It's more like over 10%.","Mark Fields","Over 10% on the basis that we report and then in case of South America, I would just go back to what we did, the previous nine years before this particular downturn started. We got very healthy margins there.","So I think I would expect to see the same type of margins, but you have to think about South America over big cycles. You don\u2019t look at it year-by-year so much as you think about okay what did I get over these nine years. What am I kind of suffering from right now and then it will come back once the worm turns again.","So I think we think about it that way, but would expect to get very, very strong margins when the cycle turns once again. ","Bob Shanks","And then when you think about your question around Asia Pacific outside of china, as you can see we've made progress and it's really in a couple of different areas. One is in the ASEAN markets we made a lot of progress and part of that was the industry getting better, but also we saw a lot of good mix on the back of our Ranger and Arius.","The fruits of the labor of our Australian transformation plan are really starting to take hold as well as some capacity actions that we took in India. So we'll continue to work on that. We've seen some good improvement this year and we're going to work very hard to continue that in 2016 Colin.","Colin Langan","Okay. Great. And any color on the pricing environment around the world? There\u2019s been a lot of concern about Europe and China. How is it looking for you and how are you thinking about it the next year?","Mark Fields","Well when you look at Europe, it\u2019s still a challenging pricing environment, probably more challenging in the non-Euro countries like U.K. and Sweden as those currencies have strengthened against the Euro. But we're still seeing challenging situation there.","I think the good news is when you look at our performance on the back of our new products we actually had positive pricing performance. So I think it's showing that the investments that we're making for our products are paying off.","And China a little bit of a different story, we saw negative pricing in the industry of about 6% last year. We actually saw it probably peak at about 8% in the fourth quarter. Part of that was the purchase tax reduction and as we go forward into this year, we think we\u2019ll see it in that 6% range and again we\u2019ll see how we go going forward.","And here in North America I think on the truck side it's pretty healthy. Obviously we're seeing more competition on the car side particularly the sedan side and given the migration we're seeing from customers.","Colin Langan","Just one last question, I get a lot of questions around financing market in the U.S. it seem like Ford Credit's results were actually quite solid and stable. I think what are you seeing in the market? Are you seeing issues with the supply in particular? Any challenges out there that you're seeing in terms of the lending market product?","Marion Harris","Colin, this is Marion. No, we\u2019re really not. I know there is a lot of discussion about this, but with the exception of the trend in longer term financing we're not seeing any weakness in the consumer alone. In fact delinquencies which are a leading indicator were at an all time record low for us.","Colin Langan","And I think our mix of higher risk is what always is 5%, 6% right?","Marion Harris","That\u2019s right. And so our underwriting same has remained consistent and our portfolio continues to be very robust. ","Colin Langan","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Galves from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dan Galves","All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just looking at the dealer stocks in the appendix pretty big increase sequentially like 11% globally and some of the markets are up year-over-year a lot more than in overall industry demand is.","So I guess could you comment on the sequential increase in stocks? Is that normal for this time of year and then looking forward, can you give us any color on what you expecting in terms of year-over-year, full year production growth for Ford in 2016?","Mark Fields","Dan this is Mark. When you look at the stocks again you have to put into relation where the market are going and in the U.S. for example when you look at in our day supply basis we're only up one day from 2014. So we think we\u2019re in pretty good shape there.","Europe, we're probably about four days above last year, but that\u2019s taking into account the growth that we're seeing as we went from quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019re actually seeing in January the growth in Europe continuing.","So we think we\u2019re in good shape there and in China as we mentioned earlier we do have the seasonal increases in stocks as we get ready for the Chinese New Year.","Bob Shanks","And in terms of what we are expecting for 2016 Dan, we do expect to see growth in volume in 2016, it's going to different by region. So we will have higher production, but we\u2019re not going to provide any specific details at this time.","Dan Galves","Okay. Got it and then on the North American margins obviously really solid right now. Are you stick into the 8% to 10% kind of long term number even thought the pension accounting change added a 100 basis points.","Just wanted to ask that question and then how should we think about the margin level let\u2019s say if -- have become more of a North America trend demand level or U.S. trend demand level in the $15 million range. How should we think about detrimental margin if eventually we do get a bit of a down tick in the U.S.?","Mark Fields","Yeah, that's a good question. When we develop the 8% to 10% this was before, this was quite a number of years ago actually. So since then we've had this big reduction in interest rate which really drove very big increases in these re-measurement losses which is one of the reasons why after we saw that\u2019s a current understood how the market was really quite sophisticated in understanding the company\u2019s results when they treated in the way that we\u2019re now treating it.","And so we decided to move in that direction so that you could clearly see the operating performance of the business. So we developed 8% to 10% before that. So I would say we're back to where we were in terms of the effective it had on the business.","And we developed the 8% to 10% and think of it as over a longer business cycle. It's not peaked. We\u2019d actually like to maybe a bit below that and the downturn, but we\u2019d like on average to be around that 8% to 10% and so we see that as something that we're aspiring to get to we think with the breakeven that we have with North America that\u2019s probably where we would be.","But going forward, as we've said, we\u2019re operating at this 10% level in fact in two of the last four years, I think we were over 11% from that. So we clearly can go higher and we'll continue to work to do that and certainly Joe is working to stay at the level that we've been in the last several years and do even better if possible, but we\u2019re operating at benchmark levels and the results speak for themselves.","Dan Galves","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Pat Archambault","Thank you very much. Just a couple of follow ups, I guess for the North America profit walk for the fourth quarter on Slide 13, just wanted to understand how we see those cost playing out over the course of 2016.","We appreciate the detail here. I think it\u2019s very helpful, but there seems to be some moving parts that will affect distinct parts of the year right. We have the anniversarying of the launch or the ramp of the F-150, the launch of the Super Duty and then presumably there is also opportunities that you have to take cost out of the existing F-150.","So, how do those things interplay as we think about the cost performance versus '16?","Mark Fields","Yeah, I think what you will see in 2016 as that you'll see as I mentioned earlier you'll see less tailwinds of those tailwinds from the market factors in terms of the cost you will see less of an impact on the contribution cost and particularly the product cost because we had the big effect in 2015 versus '14 because of the F-150, but also have the Edge and Mustang and some other products.","In 2016 you won\u2019t see such a big effect. So I see much less of an increase in contribution cost in North America than we saw in 2015. And then in terms of the structural cost, we'll have an increase. A lot of that will be in manufacturing, it will be in engineering and some of the other aspects of the business including frankly some of the initiatives that we're working in smart mobility.","But I think overall you'll see much less of a cost increase in North America in '16 than we had in '15 but it will be largely driven by the performance and contribution cost.","Mark Fields","The only thing I would add Pat is as we look at the cost particularly Bob mentioned the contribution cost, we\u2019re also going to get the full year benefit of the price tower that we're seeing from these new products whether it\u2019s the Edge of the Lincoln MKX or the F-150 particularly in the second half of last year, we get the full benefit of that.","Pat Archambault","Got it. Makes sense, one just addition to there on commodities, I think if I\u2019m paraphrasing you guys correctly at the Trade Auto Show that was fairly small positive and likely offset by FX I think it was maybe the commentary, even since then commodities have continued to go down, is there may be a potential upside risk there just given where some of these things are cracking.","Mark Fields","Yeah, we saw -- I am not looking at the number, but I think was $930 million of good news on commodities for the company and a lot of that in North America and '15 and then we had the $249 million of exchange.","Things are moving in fact since we talked at Deutsche Bank, things that moved, if we look at this year and I just got with the team yesterday and we've looked at this, I think we'll still see positive performance from commodities.","It won\u2019t be quite as great based on what we\u2019re looking at right now as it was in 2015, but it will be positive and we will have some headwinds on the exchange. So I think the net of the two at the moment again it changes every day as you highlight it, but the net of the two won\u2019t be quite as strong as it was in '15.","The other thing I would just highlight so everyone understands is that we basically of all you locked in about a third of our commodity's exposure either through contracts largely on steel and\/or hedging that we do on some of the base metals including aluminum, which is the second largest exposure that we have.","The other thing is that our policy on hedging for exchange is basically to have the operating exposure that we have identified across the full year largely hedged on key currencies, not every currency because we leave some un-hedged because we believe that they naturally are hedged with some of the commodities.","But we lock in some of those commodities 100% operating basis at the beginning of the year and that\u2019s the position that we're in right now.","So we do that not to play the market but we are trying to reduce the volatility both in terms of the impact of commodities and the impact of exchange -- operating exchange.","Pat Archambault","Okay. Great. Thanks, appreciate the color.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. So your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brian Johnson","Yes, good morning. Most really probably for Mark is it I\u2019m believe Joe on the phone, if we think about overall environment in North America just around energy prices, it's almost like the opposite of 2007, 2008 we\u2019ve got gas prices approaching $1 in some places.","apparently your pickup truck sales and light truck sales overall are very strong but within your results, can you give us a sense of what the drag is on cars maybe recap some of the capacity actions taken.","And then with regard to the light trucks since this low gas price hasn\u2019t been lost on others, we heard from a competitor in your suburbs yesterday about adding SUV and pickup trucks capacity, some of the Asians seem to be converting cars to CUV capacity and how do you see the capacity situation in the industry for light trucks verses cars going forward?","Mark Fields","Well Brian for your first question if you can tell me where that gas station is that\u2019s selling gas for a dollar. I'm there because that\u2019s a good price, but we're seeing gas prices here in the Detroit Area about $1.50.","As you think about the second part of your question on SUV capacity, we think given our view of where the market is going that I think we're well positioned to capitalize on both SUV and trucks and we have opportunities to -- in terms of capacity we're nearly there, but we have opportunities to add line speeds, work during some of the shut down periods etcetera. So I think we're well positioned there.","And in terms of the car capacity as you know we did take some down time in for example our Michigan assembly plant to make sure our stocks in line for vehicles like our Focus, but overall we'll just continue to work our process and you know our process, its always matching production to demand and we'll adjust as necessary.","And just two more things on the truck piece of it and we're getting a little bit more specific. You may have seen the other day, we announced in Ohio assembly facility we're actually adding super duty capacity and also at our Louisville assembly plant where we make the Escape, we are actually putting in some increased line speed. So we will watch the market and be balanced in our inventories and focusing on profitable growth.","Bob Shanks","And to jump in on that, those are the types of cost that show up in that volume related aspect of manufacturing social cost. So obviously they come in but we think they can also come off in a down turn.","Brian Johnson","And in terms of the mix versus -- or the pricing versus contribution cost variance in cars, are you seeing pressure in pricing in cars? And so is there a tale of two cities within the profit walks that you're not -- that obviously wouldn't show it, but just directionally?","Mark Fields","Well in the marketplace it's very clear what you\u2019re seeing is a percentage of variable marketing as a percent of the transaction or the MSRT, it is clearly higher on the car side and I think that's reflective of the segmentation shifts that we're seeing.","And there's a number of our competitors that really want to defend that. We want to make sure as usual, we're taking a balanced approach to profitable growth and as we said, we will just work our process of matching production to demand.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Then just finally on that, why not over the midterm have more plants that can flex back and forth like the one here in Chicago? Between cars and light trucks.","Mark Fields","Well as you know if you looked actually over the last seven or eight years as you look across our plants, we have increased the flexibility and I think you can assume that going forward we're going to continue to walk down that path because we've always said, we want to make sure we position ourselves for market changes. So I think you can be assured we're going to continue down that path.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC. Please go ahead.","Joseph Spak","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just going back to some of the announcements and comments around Detroit and then, Mark, again you talked about this transformation into more of a mobility company. It's clear that partners are going to become important. I think you have already seen that with some of your announcements.","I realize it varies depending on what you are trying to do, but can you give us some sense as to how you go about that process? Especially since you could build the case that in some areas, depending on the partner or the function, that could theoretically distract the consumer from the Ford brand and potentially even marginalize the brand.","Mark Fields","Well to answer your question Joe when you look at where we're heading we said we were transforming into an auto and a mobility company because it\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t lose sight of our core business as I mentioned on our remarks upfront.","But when we look at partners and first off in some cases, I\u2019ll use an example of the Amazon relationship that we have. That really came out of an idea from one of our folks in our Pala Alto facility and it happened to also bump into one of the Amazon folks in the valley.","So part of it is just discovery that happens. The other piece is as we identify a need in the marketplace, we look within ourselves and we say what are our core competencies and in some cases we convince ourselves. We can fulfill that need on our own.","In other cases we can say listen there are other great companies out there that we can approach and partner with. So that\u2019s kind of the process that we're going through to identify these opportunities and then to execute them.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody. Just a couple things. First, you've been asked this in some ways, strategy in passenger cars. Obviously, some competitors are acknowledging that in some markets like North America passenger cars are going to be tough for as far as the eye can see, assuming oil stays where it is.","And you see what GM is doing with capacity and yesterday FCA saying they are going to outsource the Dart and the Chrysler 200. Haven't heard anything along those lines from Ford. Is the bottom line that you just have to accept lower margins in certain segments in order to have a balanced approach, or is there a plan to address the passenger car situation more broadly?","Mark Fields","Well as you know Rod we're always looking to be as efficient as possible and to your point, in every product that we bring out we want to make sure we're earning our appropriate return on that.","As you think about small cars and just cars in general, we believe very strongly that it\u2019s important to have a balanced portfolio because it\u2019s to anticipate changes in customer demand, changes in the economic environment or the regulatory environment.","So as we go forward, we're going to be very focused on this and understanding in some cases what do we do on our own. We're always open to talking with others and as we go forward because we realize that we have to be very realistic around what is the type of revenue that these vehicles will be able to command and make sure we have an appropriate cost structure to earn a reasonable return.","Rod Lache","So I guess that's TBD on the plans there. I appreciate the color you provided on the structural cost inflation and where that's coming from. Could you just give us a sense of maybe bracketing how we should be thinking about structural cost inflation in North America as we look out to 2016 in the base case? And in a slowdown, how much latitude do you have to moderate that part of your cost structure?","Bob Shanks","Well in terms of 2016 over '15, I think you'll probably see less effect of these volume related costs because of what we've seen -- what we've done last year coming off of '14 where we had a lot of down weeks and that sort of thing and also just we had a really big increase in overall volume year over year.","I don\u2019t see that happening to the same degree in 2016. We'll still have some volume related cost and Mark just referred to a couple of them, but I don\u2019t think that will be as much of a factor in '16 versus '15.","But the key point which is what you mentioned Rod and I think someone else just touched on, but the key point is that we just want to highlight that our structural costs aren\u2019t necessarily fixed cost, that we've got the ability when volume changes or the economic cycle changes to go in and do something about it.","I think you can see an example of that in South America, where despite really big headwinds on inflation we're actually getting net reductions through actions of the team we're taking including around some of these volume related factors, but we're probably across the business and that flexibility is there.","I think the way that perhaps we were showing and talking about the structural cost that wasn\u2019t clear and so we just wanted to make that understandable to the investors.","Rod Lache","Okay, thanks. Then just two more last things. One is any color on how you are feeling about credit costs? Obviously, benchmarks and spreads have widened a little bit in certain markets, subprime, ABS. Even the Ford Credit CDS has widened slightly.","If that continues, is there something -- is that something the industry absorbs or do you think that gets passed along? And then just a point of clarification on your Asia earnings guidance for 2016 in the context of I think you said minus 5% pricing. How are you feeling about Asia this year?","Bob Shanks","Well let me answer the Asia question, I may have Marian respond to your other question about the credit spreads. So we've factored that in and I think Mark actually mentioned that we were assuming about 5% or 6% reduction in pricing in China.","So we have factored that in and we actually came in line at about that level I think on 2015. So that is consistent with our guidance of higher results in '16 versus '15. Marion?","Marion Harris","Okay, Rod and you\u2019re absolutely right credit spreads have been widening out a bit and that has affected us and the industry.","But on the other side of that the base rates have not gone up as much as we had anticipated either and so the actual all-in cost to the consumer hasn\u2019t really flown through yet.","Rod Lache","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from Susquehanna Investment Group. Please go ahead.","Matt Stover","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered and I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I kind of want to think about this car problem or car issue because it feels like it's deja vu all over again with the industry.","I know you guys are in a much different place versus FCA in terms of your product and your balance sheet. But I do wonder if you think about this program over the course of the next five years, if there -- or 10 years rather, if there's an opportunity for you to more significantly restructure the cost structure of your small and mid cars.","And what I'm specifically speaking about are the transmissions and engines, referring back to some of the work that you've done with GM on transmissions in the pickup truck market.","Are there opportunities for you to husband some capital investment as you think about these new programs to fundamentally improve the cost structure of them as their near term demand seems uncertain, but long term demand seems more necessary.","Mark Fields","Yeah, thanks for the question Matt. And you're right. It's a little bit like looking at the crystal ball and your view depends upon the point that you're at and right now obviously we\u2019re seeing customers migrate more towards small and medium size SUVs.","But in simple answer to your question, yes, we're looking at all opportunities because we want to make sure that we get a good return on our invested capital as you saw we\u2019re measuring that and we pay a lot of attention to that as a company.","So we\u2019re going to always look at different opportunities to improve the profitability of all of our vehicles including our small cars.","Matt Stover","Just out of curiosity from a timing standpoint, has the Board okayed the next-generation Fusion and Focus or is that still something in front of the Board?","Mark Fields","No, we don\u2019t talk about what decisions have been made by the Board etcetera, but obviously you're seeing the launch of the freshened Fusion that we showed at the North American International Auto Show.","Matt Stover","Okay. Thanks Mark.","Mark Fields","Sure.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. So our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman","Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a couple really on the latest that you are seeing in terms of demand in China and the U.S. The stock market seems -- the industry market seems actually quite great in both of those countries, but the stock market seemed to sort of reflect the price to the automakers and the suppliers that investors think that these markets could decelerate maybe materially over the short run.","So just what you are seeing there, the latest, for example, in China the big surge in 4Q; does that pull ahead from future periods? And if so, which future periods? Because industry forecasters, like IHS, they are increasing their outlook for 2016 thinking it pulls from 2017, but the investors we talked to think it pulls from much sooner, like as soon as this quarter.","So any color you can provide on what you are seeing in China in January, etcetera that would be helpful. Then in the U.S., too, December was a little bit softer than the preceding months.","Are there any signs that the U.S. is really slowing on an underlying basis? Are there any real reasons to think it might slow as the stock prices, including your stock price, seems to maybe imply?","Mark Fields","Okay, Ryan thanks for the question. In China obviously as we mentioned, when you look at the stock market volatility, that\u2019s endemic of the country that's moving from an investment and industry led economy to one that's consumer led.","And actually when you look at the components of GDP growth there, the services in the consumer portions of that are actually growing while some of the industry ones are coming down and we view that as a good sign. It's going to be a big bumpy as they go through that transition.","As we mentioned in the fourth quarter you usually see a more production by the industry and by us that\u2019s normal as we get for the -- get ready for the Chinese New Year.","We're going in we're in line with our stocks going into January, into China. And as I mentioned China started off -- the month is starting off strong. We have seen it moderate in the second half verses the first half, but as I mentioned, we really have to wait and see how January and February play out because of where the Chinese New Year falls this year and we will get a good sense for that.","But our view is that the market will grow in China this year and a lot of that on the back of the response we've seen from the purchase tax reduction. In the case of North America in terms of the industry, we don\u2019t see the cycle being over.","Obviously the consumer sector drives the majority of the economic growth. All the metrics we're seeing, wages growing, jobs growing, low interest rates, low energy costs, those types of things are really putting more spending power in the hands of consumers and when you marry that with the demographics of the inventory of vehicles that are out there, they\u2019re the oldest they\u2019ve ever been, pickup trucks also in particular are very old. So we think that bodes well.","As we get into January what we're seeing it will probably be a solid month for the industry, but as you know January is always a bit of a difficult month to call, right because it\u2019s a small industry. There\u2019s lots of seasonality. Of course I hate the turn January always into a weather report, but there\u2019s always storms and obviously we have that big one on the East Coast.","So we could see an industry maybe around 17 million units, maybe somewhere around there, but I think it\u2019s a little bit of a tricky month, but what we're seeing in our business, commercial sales continue to be strong and we will report out on February 2.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That's helpful and encouraging color. Thanks a lot.","Mark Fields","Sure.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","So I appreciate all the color on the profile from North American margins and certainly understand the issue of maybe less industry growth this year and then the Super Duty launch. It also feels like there's a decent amount of it that has to do with investments, maybe not necessarily just for the short term but for the longer term of the business.","Can you give a little more color on that? It just feels, maybe in comparison with some of your competitors, that you seem to be investing more heavily maybe. Can you either put that into buckets or how should we think about these investments and what they are going towards?","Mark Fields","Well I think let me start with, I think we said that at Deutsche Bank, but our CapEx for the company for this year is expected to be about $7.7 billion. I think we came in at $7.1 billion in 2015.","So you can see that, that will be increasing again as we invest for our future growth. As I look across the business more broadly and I think you were talking specifically Emmanuel about North America, is that correct? ","Emmanuel Rosner","Yes.","Mark Fields","There I think we will see higher engineering. The spending related will go up because we've been ahead of the curve in terms of the spending. The DNA is catching up. So that\u2019s probably going to be around $0.5 billion alone.","And then there is additional investments that we're making to support some of our more future opportunities around Ford Smart Mobility, which we're not going to break out, but clearly that is something that is ahead of us as well.","So around product refreshment, powertrain investments to support regulatory actions, and Ford Smart Mobility and obviously we expect all of them to pay off which they\u2019ve done over the little last six years.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. And then still on the topic of investments, just wanted to ask a little bit more about where you stand now in China. I know you've opened a lot of factories and capacity over the past few years, including in 2015. Is there more to do? Do you have more in the works or are you pretty much now working at filling this capacity and maximizing what you have?","Mark Fields","Well from a capacity standpoint we're at 2.7 million units across Asia and when you look at China in particular we're at 1.9. We are adding our Harbin facility a little later this year.","So I think we're in good shape Emmanuel from a capacity standpoint and when you look at the investments as Bob mentioned earlier, the investments on the product freshness in China, but also meeting the regulatory requirements of powertrain and those type of things and also Ford Smart Mobility.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. Thank you very much.","Mark Fields","Welcome.","Operator","Okay. Thank you\/ [Operator Instruction] So our next question comes from the line of Christina Rogers from the Wall Street Journal.","Christina Rogers","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Mark Fields","Hi Christian.","Christina Rogers","First off on the UAW profit sharing, how much will that cost in absolute turns? Is this a matter of just taking the 93,000 per worker and multiplying it by the workforce? And when will that payout be booked? Is it in the first quarter?","And my second question is also on the shift and demand to trucks. Auto Nation's Mike Jackson just said America has gone truck-crazy and it sound like there is opportunity there for you to increase production on those vehicles, but I\u2019m wondering will you be taking down passenger car capacity to do that?","Mark Fields","Okay, Christina on your question on UAW profit, its generally in line, but again the profit sharing checks when we say on average is 93,000, so it depends on how many hours have been worked by the employee etcetera. And that profit sharing check will be paid in the first quarter and its booked in the first quarter as well.","When you think about trucks obviously we have our capacity, it\u2019s a medium term thing, but in general when you look at trucks just focus on F Series for a minute, we\u2019re going to have -- we expect actually our volume on F-150, we think there is upside opportunity this year to grow it versus 2015 because we now have the availability of regular cabs and super cabs and so we didn\u2019t have a lot of availability of that and so that will give us some good entry points both from the mid and the entry level price points.","So we think we have about opportunity to grow at least our volume in F-150, but over the longer term, again we'll make our assumptions around what we think the segmentation is going and make appropriate capacity changes. No and just in the short terms as we talked about earlier, line shift beat or lines beat adjustments and working shutdowns.","Marion Harris","And just to clarify, we pay it in the first quarter -- about 1,500 of that was paid in the fourth quarter that was -- and we accrue could -- we accrue that throughout 2015. We accrue in advance.","Christina Rogers","With the total charge look like in the first quarter for the payout to have\u2026","Mark Fields","Well, it\u2019s a cash outflow, it\u2019s not a profit hit because we accrued for it during 2015. So that profit recognition is behind us. It\u2019s in the results that you're seeing today.","Christina Rogers","Okay. Okay. And then regarding the passenger car capacity, will you be looking to take that down as you increase volume on the truck and SUV side?","Mark Fields","That will be based on our view of segmentation going forward. So that will be part of our business planning process.","Christina Rogers","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. So your next question comes from the line of Bob Gritzinger from WardsAuto. Please go ahead.","Bob Gritzinger","Hi, thanks for taking my call. I noted that you\u2019re dropping out of the Japanese and Indonesian markets in the coming year are there other small volume market that you are considering pulling out of.","Mark Fields","Well, obviously we announced Japan and Indonesia. We\u2019re going to follow our normal process and we\u2019re committed to serving global markets, but also at the same time, we\u2019re committed to aggressively restructuring parts of our business where we don\u2019t see a reasonable path to sustain profitability or a return on our investment over a reasonable period of time.","So we\u2019ll continue to work that process going forward, but nothing to announce.","Bob Gritzinger","Okay. Good. Thanks for taking my call.","Mark Fields","You bet.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. We have no more questions at this time. So now I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ted Cannis. Please go ahead.","Ted Cannis","All right. Thank you very much everybody for joining the call today and we\u2019ll see you soon.","Operator","Thank you for participation in today\u2019s conference.

I would now like to turn the call over to Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Ford Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ted Cannis - Executive Director-Investor Relations","All right. Thanks very much, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome, everybody, for the first quarter 2016 financial results. As normal, copies of the press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford's Investor website and the media websites. As always, the results discussed today include some non-GAAP references and those are reconciled to the US GAAP equivalent in the appendix to the slides.","Also, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may vary, and those most significant factors are included in our presentation. Also, by the way, later today we will be issuing the 10-Q and Ford Credit will be hosting a call at 11:00 AM to review their results.","Now presenting today and we'll have a few more comments, Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Corporate Accounting; and Marion Harris, our Ford Credit CFO.","Before we dive in, we just made some changes to the presentation just to make it a little clearer for you, a bit of a more overall look to the business and highlight key points. And also, we just wanted to show you how we're continuing to focus on creating value and driving our long-term growth.","So with that, Mark, ready to go.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We have some very strong results to share with you today. In fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. Our company pre-tax profit came in at $3.8 billion and that was $2.1 billion better than a year ago. Our net income was $2.5 billion and our operating earnings per share was $0.68. Both those results are more than double versus last year.","Our revenue was $37.7 billion and that was up $3.8 billion, increasing 15% from last year at constant exchange and 11% as reported. We grew global market share from 6.9% to 7.1% and that was driven by improvements in North America, Europe, and our Asia Pacific regions.","Our Automotive operating margin came in at 9.8% and that was a quarterly record, and Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.7 billion and that was a record for the first quarter. We also provided $1.7 billion of distributions to our shareholders in the quarter as well. We had a tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. Here in North America, we achieved a record quarterly profit and a record operating margin of 12.9%.","Looking at Europe, we earned $434 million in the quarter and that was up $476 million from a year ago. And this was also our fourth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. Our revenue in Asia Pacific climbed 18% to $2.7 billion, and pre-tax profit more than doubled. And Ford Credit grew pre-tax profit and they delivered more than $500 million in the quarter.","So all-in-all, a very strong start to the year, and given our strong start, we remain confident in our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. And we're taking the opportunity today to reaffirm the guidance for the company that we gave in January, which is to deliver performance equal to or better than last year's record.","So now let's turn to slide four. And we are continuously focused on the four drivers of shareholder value that you can see on the screen here. That's about growth, returns, risk, and rewards. So first, let's talk about growth. Growth is strong and it's especially evident in our trucks, our SUVs, and as we pursue expansion into mobility.","Second, let's focus on returns. We expect strong returns from our healthy mix, targeted increases in investments that will make the business stronger in the years ahead, and diversifying regional profitability. And this includes continuing our momentum in Europe and Asia, acting decisively in South America, reducing high-cost car capacity, of course increasing efficiencies across the business, and leveraging partnerships where we can.","Third, let's turn to risk. Our risk profile is improving as we work to reduce our break-even levels globally with a focus on sustaining our robust structure in North America, strengthening our regional diversity, and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.","And finally, let's talk about rewards. We're continuing to reward our shareholders with the payout of our regular dividend, plus a supplemental dividend, and we will remain absolutely focused on driving total shareholder returns and ensuring we maintain our regular dividend through a downturn.","So looking at the first quarter on slide five, as I mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress in all four focus areas. We grew our top line and announced our actions to continue to grow our core business, while expanding our business model into new areas of emerging opportunities around mobility.","Our returns were strong, setting a number of records, as I mentioned earlier, and demonstrating very strong broad-based performance. In terms of risk, our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable and improved year-over-year. We also, at the same time, saw the progress we've made in improving our risk profile, which was recognized by ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's, S&P, and DBRS. And finally, in terms of rewards, we increased distributions with the addition of a supplemental dividend of $1 billion.","Looking at slide six, among some of the other quarters, other highlights, we were recognized for the strength of our products, notably the F-150, as well as for our ethics as the only automaker on the list of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We continue progress in our journey to grow the Lincoln brand, and of course advances in new technologies and new mobility projects.","So with that, now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and what's ahead. So looking at the global business environment on slide seven, conditions remain broadly supportive of growth in the global economy. This will be driven by the U.S.; continued modest recovery in the euro area; growth in the U.K., despite probably some increased volatility that we are seeing ahead of the June Brexit referendum; and continued growth in China, although at slower pace that we've seen in recent years. We also expect conditions in Brazil and Russia to remain difficult through 2016.","And before I turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the details of our performance, let me just underscore again the strength and the broad-based nature of the record quarter that our team delivered, the very strong start to the year and our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016.","So with that, Bob, do you want to take it away?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on slide nine by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also the automotive and the financial services sector. Now, because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent slides, I just want to pull out a few things from this one.","First, if I ask you to look at the year-over-year performance in the column to the right, just scan down that column and you can see everything is essentially positive and very, very positive versus a year ago. The one exception is special items. We did not have any special items a year ago. We have two that we are booking in this quarter. The larger of the two was at $186 million; relates to buyouts that were part of the UAW contract that we agreed in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the special items relate to charges associated with our exits from the Japanese and the Indonesian markets.","If you go just above that you can see our operating EPS of $0.68. $0.39 better than where we were a year ago, so more than doubling that. And if you go down two lines to after-tax results or net income at $2.5 billion, again we more than doubled that particular metric. What's not shown on the slide is our tax rate that came in at 29.5%, which was lower than what it was a year ago.","So with that, let's turn to the next slide and here we'll look at the company results. These are absolutes and we'll look at it by segment. To the far left, you can see the record profit of $3.8 billion. Going right beside that, we've got the North American result, $3.1 billion. Go to the far right, financial services came in very strong at about $0.5 billion, and within that Ford Credit was $514 million. We had the best result in Europe since 2008 at $434 million.","We doubled our profit in Asia Pacific at $220 million, and then in South America we had a loss, as expected, and in the Middle East & Africa we fell into a loss driven by largely the external environment exchange. I will talk about that in a bit. And in Other Automotive, that's largely net interest expense. Now when you look at the operations outside of North America, the business units outside North America, we did make a profit there. It was nearly $400 million and that was more than $400 million better than a year ago.","All right, let's go to the next slide and we will start going through the details of the automotive sectors starting with the sector itself. These are the key metrics and as you just scan across, you can see all of them very, very strong and all of them improved compared with 2015 first quarter.","Starting at the left, we had strong growth in the top line, both wholesales and revenue up double digits. Revenue at constant exchange was actually up 15%. We grew our market share and that was in a global SAAR that also grew up 3%. And that was around North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe. Operating margin was a record at 9.8% up sharply, and then Automotive also set a record at $3.3 billion, again up sharply from where we were a year ago.","All right. Let's go to the next slide and we'll look at what was behind the improvement. This is slide 12. A $2 billion improvement and, as you can see, it was driven largely by higher volume, favorable mix, and favorable cost performance, driven by favorable contribution cost. We did have negative net pricing, but within that $548 million decline there was a one-time stock accrual effect that I will talk about in just a minute. That was over $600 million.","You will note in the callout box for volume and mix, mix and other we had over $1 billion of good news on product mix. And that was a theme that really drove performance, not only in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia Pacific.","All right. Let's go to the next slide. Now we'll start going through the business units with North America. North America, of course, had extraordinary performance and it was very, very strong right across the board, very strong improvement in the top line at over 20%. Revenue about the same, market share was up in a growing industry, both for the region and in the U.S., and that was driven by two things.","One, it was in North America, rather in U.S. and that was fleet sales. It was around SUVs, Transit, and F-Series, but also in Canada. We had very strong performance in Canada. We were up 1.5 points of share. That was driven by F-150 and by the Edge. Operating margin at 12.9%, a record, and then the $3.1 billion that we talked about earlier. So really, really strong performance in North America.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","And just some \u2013 we've gotten some questions around fleet sales, and Bob mentioned fleet. There's just absolutely no change to our approach in fleet. Fleet is good business for us, including rental, commercial and government sales. We understand these customers real well; their use cases. Rental deliveries, as we've said before, were frontloaded this year. This is primarily due to the model year changeover, which in some of our vehicles was late last year, and based on rental company requests because, keep in mind, rental companies like to purchase their vehicles as close as possible to job one as possible.","And for the full year, we expect our rental sales to be about the same as last year with the government and commercial sales up slightly, driven by the availability of the new F-150, because a lot of variants have now come on board. So we have good margins in the fleet business and, as you can see, they contributed nicely to a record performance in the quarter in North America.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix, and it was lower cost performance. So it was very strong in some really key parts of the business. Within \u2013 there's three or four things that I want to call out here. If you look at the stock performance of $691 million in the callout box there for volume and mix, that is more than explained by the F-Series.","This time last year, we were launching F-Series, F-150 rather, in Kansas City. Obviously, that's behind us now, and we're operating both Dearborn and Kansas City at three crews. So that's simply reversing what was an anomaly last year and making it more normal. So on a year-over-year basis, picked up that good news.","If you go into mix, mix and other, about $0.5 billion, and that was actually favorable product mix. Again that was around returning to normal with F-150, but also a year ago we were launching the Oakville products, the Edge as well as the MKX. We are benefiting from the fact that that plant is now up and running. We've got normal supply of those successful products.","If you go into the net pricing, this one is interesting. You can see the incentives and other of negative $1.2 billion. Half of that is a one-time stock accrual that is taking place and most of that, about 80% of it. Again it's driven by the anomaly of last year. Last year, because we were launching the F-150 at Kansas City, we had extremely low levels of inventory. We also had very low levels of incentives.","So in the first quarter this year, of course we had normal supply. The incentives, while they are still lower than our domestic competitors, they're at what we would consider to be normal levels, and so that effect is reflected in the stock adjustment.","So if you think about it, that's an accounting adjustment. It didn't have any effect in the quarter in terms of what incentives were given to customers. And so, if you take that out, we actually had somewhat positive, small, but positive net pricing. And then with the favorable mix that I talked about, we ended up having higher U.S. retail transaction prices. They were up about $1,500, if you exclude lease.","Okay, let's go to the next slide. We will look at South America. South America, the team is doing a great job in a very, very difficult environment. And this is really around Brazil, because we actually are very encouraged by what we're seeing in Argentina from the actions of the government, the new government has taken since it has come into power. Very, very positive and really bodes well for what we can see from that part of the region in the months and years ahead. But if you look at the metrics, we did have a sharp decline in wholesale, down 38%.","Revenue was down 44%. Half of that actually was exchange. If you look at market share, we had a decline. As we pulled back from certain sales, it just didn't make any sense in terms of profitability, so we lost share, if you will, in an industry that was down. The results of that is we had a sharp decline in the operating margin, and we were able to keep the increased loss, if you will, to about $67 million.","And we'll go through that on the next slide, please, slide 16. So this was really around industry volume. You can see that we had a negative industry volume, effective $91 million. That was Brazil itself down 29%. The team continued to do a great job on cost performance.","Last year, we did over $400 million in terms of the cost performance. We did $76 million in the quarter and during the quarter, and there's not much effect from this, but during the quarter we did remove the third crew at Camacari, which is something I mentioned to the analysts and investors that were listening in on the Let's Chat call back in March.","So, team's still working to get more costs out because the environment is still very, very difficult. We still expect probably next year that we will start to see things bottom out, particularly from the commodity cycle, and start to turn around.","Let's go to the next slide. That will turn to Europe, which is a great, great story. Europe, if you look at the metrics, wholesale volume up, while revenue as reported was flat. Actually up 6% at constant exchange. We had higher share in an industry that was growing. That share was driven in terms of markets by Italy, Germany, and Russia. In terms of product, it was basically SUVs and commercial vehicles. The operating margin was over 6%. And again that profit, that was the best that we've had since 2008. So very, very strong performance in Europe.","Let's go to the next slide and see how we got there. The improvement of nearly $0.5 billion came from everything. Industry was favorable. The volume factors were favorable. The mix was favorable to the tune, within that $106 million that's shown on the slide, of about $300 million that was both product mix from what we've done around the products over the last number of years, as well as series mix and options.","And then we had favorable cost performance, both contribution costs and structural costs. And even though it's not shown on the slide, even though the Russian market continues to be very challenging, actually Russia improved on a year-over-year basis as well. So the team, really delivering across all aspects of the business in Europe and you can see the results of that.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Just a little bit more color on Europe. If you recall, a central part of our European transformation plan that we last launched at the end of 2012 was continuing to invest in our core business of great product. And as you can see from the results here, it's really starting to pay off.","Actually our average transaction prices in Europe on a year-over-year basis were up over $1,200 and actually our high series models and sports derivatives accounted for 60% of our Ford passenger vehicle sales. Things like Titanium, Vignale, ST versions of Focus and Fiesta, and even Mustang, which, I don't know if you caught this, but in March Mustang was the best-selling sports car in Germany, leading folks like Porsche 911.","So this is really allowing us to accelerate our efforts in total. And many of the things that we saw in the North American turnaround we used as a blueprint for Europe and it's paying off.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great, let's go on to the next region, Middle East & Africa. This is a region also that has many, many challenges external deal, geopolitical issues, weak currencies, a number of the markets are major oil producers and so they are suffering, if you will, in terms of the low oil prices. But within that environment the team basically held on wholesales. Revenue was actually flat, excluding exchange.","As reported, it was down 9%. We held our own in terms of share and that was in a declining industry. It was down about 7%, 8%. But if you take Iran out, which actually is growing, and we don't participate in Iran, it was down over 20%. In that environment, we did move into a small loss of $14 million and that was largely driven by weakness of the South African Rand. We've got operations in South Africa and adversely impacted by the weakness of that currency.","All right, let's go to the next slide and turn to the great story here in Asia Pacific. We had another strong quarter driven by new products. You can see wholesale is up 9%, revenue up 18%, 25% at constant exchange. Here we also grew share in a region that also was growing.","The AP SAAR was up over 2 million units, as was China, so strong performance there, it was really driven by the new products that we have introduced. And China was one of the big factors there as well in terms of market contribution to the share. But we saw share improvement in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia so a lot of good things going on in terms of the market performance across the region. Our operating margin was over 8% and the pre-tax results at $220 million.","On the lower right of the slide, slide 20 I'm on \u2013 I don't think I mentioned that \u2013 you can see the very strong performance we had from our China JVs that came in at $443 million. That was up sharply, over 20%, and they generated a margin of 16.4%.","The other good thing about the performance in the region is that we had good news coming from China, but we also had good news coming from the other parts of the region: India, ASEAN, and Australia. So that was very encouraging.","Let's go to the next slide, and this is how we got here. It was largely around volume, so industry share and then the favorable mix that I had mentioned earlier. This was again driven by the new products. Edge was one of the big factors, but we saw good news from the Ranger, we saw good news from Mondeo, and a number of other products. So again, a broad-based contribution there.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","I just came back from the Beijing Auto Show, and it was very interesting to see consumers are almost fervor for SUVs. You saw it not only in the exhibitors that were there, but just looking at the folks that were crowded around the vehicles. And I think the investments that we've made over the last couple of years to have a full lineup of SUVs \u2013 small, medium, and large is really great for timing of the market.","At the same time, we introduced the Raptor. And I have to tell you, I literally had to, as we were done presenting, it run out of the way because of the people running up to the vehicle. I think that vehicle will do well, not only just from a sales standpoint, and it won't play a major role, but we will sell, I think, every one we can but what we'll do to continue to accelerate the perception of our brand.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Let's move on to another part of the business we absolutely love, that's Ford Credit. I should mention that today at 11 o'clock, and the details are in the press release, we are going to have a Ford Credit earnings call for the first time. And that will be led by Bernard Silverstone and Marion Harris. You will be able at get much more deeply into that part of the business. But we have that on some extra slides and data here are to support this call, so let's go through it.","On slide 22, you can see contract volume was flat. We grew everywhere with the exception of the U.S., and that was largely driven by the type of marketing programs that we had in effect in the U.S. in the first quarter. Managed receivables were up. Pre-tax results over $0.5 billion, as I mentioned, and up.","If we look at some of the metrics around U.S. retail and lease performance, we still had a very strong FICO score. If you look at the delinquencies, over 60 days they were only up 1 basis point; loss to receivables up 11 basis points. And those are levels that we still consider to be at the very low end of our historical performance, so very healthy.","Let's go to the next slide and look at the improved results year-over-year of $31 million that was driven by a strong growth in all of our products and regions. We did have unfavorable performance in credit losses and also lease residuals. I kind of referred to the lease residual performance at Let's Chat in March and that was driven by a couple of factors.","One, we had losses on units that came in during the quarter and we also have an expectation of lower auction values going forward. So we've had an impact in terms of accumulated supplemental depreciation and that is very much in line with what I said at Let's Chat about that metric coming in: bad news year-over-year, but less than $100 million.","If you look at the credit loss, that was also impacted. There were two things there. Charge-offs increased related to severities, and then we also have increases to the reserves. Expectations, again, of the impact of lower auction values going forward, but also just the business being bigger.","Let's go to the next slide. This is an added slide giving you some additional metrics around some areas that I know of interest from analysts and investors. On the upper left, if you look at the lease performance, the industry has been \u2013 we have been seeing increasing lease rates over the last number of years, but even during the last few quarters. And you can see in the first quarter, it was 32%. We have traditionally not been at the same level as the industry, which was the case. In the first quarter, we came in at 26%. Our expectations are that for the full year we will come in at a level that will be below that. Again, we are continuing to follow a proprietary modeling that we do of lease, making sure that we don't have any concentration of risk, whether it's geographical, product series, and so forth. We are very comfortable at the level of leasing, but that number will come down for the full year.","On the bottom just beneath that, you can see our experience in terms of auction values at first quarter mix across all periods there. And you can see that we have seen a decline in both 24 months and 36 months auction values versus a year ago. We are up sequentially from the fourth quarter. We would normally have expected that increase to be higher. It hasn't occurred and that is largely based on supply. We have, across the industry, more units coming back from the increasing rates of lease over the last number of years. We'll have about 200,000 units coming back this year.","Demand, for us anyway, is still very healthy and about where it has been, we just have more units coming back. So we have assumed going forward, as I mentioned earlier, lower auction values. And that's built into our guidance.","If you go to the upper right, you can see the retail contract placement terms, our experienced. Of course, this has been, again, an industry trend of longer-term placement terms, for us at least, over the last number of quarters. We are sort of around that 64-month level. We do have \u2013 we are participating in terms that exceed that and you can see that on the line. About 3% to 4% of our business has been at 73 months or higher, which is well below what the industry is at.","And if you go below that, you can see our FICO scores. You can see we did have a decline in the first quarter. That is not unusual. We've gone back and looked at the last five years, and we generally see that happen, a lot of that is mainly due to the types of marketing programs that we have in place in the quarter, which tends to drive a little bit fewer customers to Ford Credit than to other alternative financing.","If you look at the line, you can see our risk portfolio continues to be in that 5% to 6% range that we've had for quite a number of years. So, very robust balance sheet and strong performance by Ford Credit.","All right, let's go to the next slide and we will look at cash. This is slide 25. I think the best thing to say about the very strong performance on cash flow is it just underscores the quality of the earnings. You can see the $3.3 billion of automotive pre-tax profit. Over 80% of that flew right through the cash flow, so a very, very strong quality of earnings message there. With that cash flow, we had some pay down of debt, normal maturities. We did fund some of our funded pension plans. We're still on track to $1.5 billion for the year and then, of course, the dividends that Mark mentioned.","In addition, in the quarter we completed the anti-dilutive share repurchase program that was about $145 million. Ended with very strong liquidity and automotive debt of about $13 billion. That is up a little bit from where we were at the end of last year. It was largely exchange and some non-cash debt changes.","Okay, with that I'm going to turn it over to Mark.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks, Bob. Slide 26 summarizes our industry and our GDP planning assumptions going forward. Again, all-in-all, we see conditions as being supportive of growth in the automotive industry sales globally and for the major markets that you see on the slide here. Our expectations for the full year industry sales by market are unchanged.","I won't go through slides 27 and 28, but they show our guidance for each of the business units and our company guidance, both of which are unchanged. And just to provide some additional color on guidance, we are through the first quarter. We had a really good start to the year, and we'll continue to focus on delivering our guidance, which is equal to or better than last year's record.","So just kind of bringing it all together on slide 29, the first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us. It was an all-time record quarter for the company. It was a very strong performance across our businesses. Our commitment remains to accelerate our pace of progress even further, and again focusing on those four key areas that drive creating value in the company: growth, returns, risks, and rewards.","Importantly, we are building on our strengths as we expand our business model to be both an auto and a mobility company and also taking advantage of emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility. Importantly, as we grow, we are committed to growing lean and focusing on profitability. So, I guess the bottom line is that we expect 2016 to be another strong year with sustained strong financial performance and returns and with continued strength into 2017. And I believe our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our passion for products, our focus on innovation in all areas of our business, and driving improved mix \u2013 they are driving improved mix, a strong business structure, and of course exciting new technology that benefits our customers around the world, all of which is paying off with the record performance.","So we're proud of our achievements, but with the full understanding that we have to continually earn them. We're excited about the future and we are confident in our ability to continue to drive growth, returns and rewards at lower risk across the entire company.","So with that, why don't we open it up to your questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Pat Archambault of Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Good morning and congrats on a great result.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks, Pat.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess maybe two areas of questions for me, it is first on the walk in North America. Just a little bit more, perhaps, on the pricing versus cost piece. Maybe I'll just take it at a very, very high level. I think one would've expected that, given the newness of the portfolio, pricing would be still up as it was in previous quarters. And I get that there was that inventory adjustment, but even with that it seems that pricing would have been up much?","Then also, likewise, on the positive side, I guess -- I think I was quite surprised by the extent of benefits from lower variable costs, right, and just given all the new content. I guess that took me by surprise as well. So maybe we could talk a little bit about that and how we think about those things going forward?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'll take that, Pat. So if you look at the pricing, you can see we did have strong absolute pricing of about $600 million and that was pretty much, if I take the stock accrual aside, that was pretty much offset by incentives. And again, I think this quarter, in terms of a run rate, is sort of more normal. Last year was the anomaly because of what was going on with the F-Series and the Oakville launch. And I think that really is influencing this because last year we largely did have \u2013 while we had the new product, we had very low levels of incentives because of how tight the inventory was at that time. So really what you've got is you've got F-Series, or F-150, which is an important product for us in terms of absolute volume, coming back to more normal levels but still better than our key competitors.","So I think that's largely what is at play. We are seeing some benefit from the Edge and the MKX, although again Edge was in the first quarter of performance last year as well. So I don't think you're actually seeing so much in terms of brand-new product in this quarter versus the lack of that product in the year-ago period, which is maybe a little bit unusual in this particular quarter.","In terms of the contribution cost, again I think it's the same factor. We didn't have as much in the way of adverse or increased product-related cost, new product cost, because we had F-Series largely in the quarter last year. Not a lot of volume, but it was there. Edge was there. So as a result, what you can see is the great performance the team delivers quarter in and quarter out in terms of material efficiencies flowing through. We also had some good news on \u2013 down in that warranty, freight, and other line. A lot of that was freight. We had a lot of premium freight in the quarter a year ago related to some of the launches, and so that's coming through.","One thing maybe I'd take the opportunity to answer. I did say, I think it was back at Deutsche Bank, that we didn't think we'd see as much benefit on commodities this year. That clearly has changed based on what's happened subsequently to continued decline in commodities, I think. Last year we'd had, I think, it was $930 million of good news on commodities for the full year. At the moment, it looks like we were tracking to something like that. I still think we'll have a little bit more bad news on exchange this year on a year-over-year basis than we had last year, but the net of the two are still going to be a bit more good news than what we had expected.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","And just one more thing in terms of what to expect going forward. Our teams, I think, are doing a really terrific job of really understanding the consumer and what costs should we be putting in products. And I think you're seeing that path in the mix in terms of the average transaction prices. And our average transaction prices are up more than double the rest of the industry. And that really comes down to understanding the customers and putting the right costs in the vehicles that drive revenue.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Could I squeeze one last one in just on production? I think they were some comments out this morning in the press about having to reduce production in the back half, just given the inventory situation. More on that?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What we really see in the second half is primarily around two other factors. One is normal seasonality. You've got, both here and in Europe \u2013 and in fact, in Europe you have more \u2013 the summer shutdown weeks. You also have the shutdowns that occur at the end of the year, so it's just normal to have less production, and therefore less wholesales in the second half than in the first half. It was a bit different last year because of the launches, but this is going to be a more normal year.","Secondly, we've got the Super Duty launch that I referred to that will take place in the third quarter. While we'll be able to contain that in terms of down weeks within the normal scheduled summer downtime, you still have the launch curve, which is going to take some volume out. Which is one of the reasons why we're a little heavy on Super Duty stock today, because we have to anticipate that, make sure we've got enough inventory to get through that whole launch. So that's a key factor.","In terms of tweaking the production for inventory, that's just going to be a normal process. We see ebbs and flows of demand in inventory and we will adjust as we go forward, but it's really those first two factors that are the key ones that are affecting us. There's not just in North America, but particularly in Europe too.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay, thanks a lot for the color and congrats on the quarter.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that warning you gave intra-quarter about the $100 million headwind to Ford Credit in 1Q from lower used car prices, impact of lease residuals, etc. Yet, your profit there was strong and it rose year over year. So can you talk some more about the tailwinds impacting that business that are allowing you to offset that headwind, whether just an increase in portfolio or something else? Then, as the year progresses, what is your outlook for both the headwind from used car prices and the tailwind from the offsetting factors?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ryan. Good morning. I think it's largely the same thing that I said at Let's Chat, which is we would expect to see sort of an adverse year-over-year from lease residuals in most of the quarters that we have ahead of us, if not all of them, although it will start to mitigate as we get towards the end of the year. So we think \u2013 and we built that in.","As I mentioned in March, we do have an expectation of lower auction values and that's particularly on the car side of the business, but we haven't built that in. I think that will be on a year-over-year basis, the headwind, although again mitigating towards the end of the year. But that will be offset by strong growth of the business, not only in North America, but in other parts of the world as well. So I think that will be an offset.","Again, the other thing I should mention is the team is really, really focused on cost performance. Our operating cost performance is the best in the business and that will continue to be something that will keep us lean and mean and enable Ford Credit to continue to generate the types of profitability that it has.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. Yeah, go ahead, sorry.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","And then, Ryan, on your question on used car prices, obviously you've seen some of the Manheim reports. This is not a demand issue. The demand is there. It's really a supply issue as more of these three-year leases come off. We're going to watch it closely. Obviously, we've done a lot of the studies to see, are used car buyers actually cross-shopping with new cars. It's very small, it's in the single digits, but clearly it does have implications for trade-in values, so we're going to continue to watch that closely.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Then just on the 6.3% margin in Europe, obviously that's really impressive. If I go back to your last Analyst Day in September 2014, it looks like you were guiding then for 3% to 5% margin by 2020. How sustainable do you think this improvement in Europe is? I understand it's a seasonally stronger quarter, but presumably as volume continues to normalize higher over time, does that now mean there's upside to your out-year 3% to 5% outlook?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think we're going to have a great year in Europe. And as we said, even though we are off to a very good start and I think we're going to continue to have a very good year, our objective is to make Europe a very sustainable and vibrant, profitable part of our business and achieving 6% to 8% operating margin. And that's what we are focusing on. Importantly, as we do it, we are seeing a lot of the things that we've done over the past couple of years pay off.","On the cost side, as you know, we reduced our capacities. On the brand side, if you look at, for example, our channel mix in Europe, we're about 6 points above the rest of the industry in terms of channel mix of retail and fleet, which is good business for us. If you look at the investments we've made in our commercial vehicle brand, we are number one, the best-selling commercial vehicle brand. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing very rich mix in Europe, which I think bodes well, particularly based on the experience we've seen over a period of time here in North America.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Just lastly then, I'm curious with your planned new plant in Mexico and now with the really essentially complete intertwining of the U.S., Mexican, and Canadian auto markets, whether you have given much thoughts to the potential risk to your North American operations, and to the industry in general, from all of this weird rethinking on both sides of the political aisle of the benefits of NAFTA.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I can't speak to what's being said on the campaign trail. Obviously, we have these trade agreements and I think, as we look at our business, we have made a big commitment obviously here to our facilities here in the U.S. You've seen some of the numbers in terms of backing that up.","Not only just the absolute numbers of what, we've invested $10 billion over the last number of years and another $9 billion going forward, of which you saw some of that announced two days ago. But, clearly, we manufacture more vehicles here in the U.S. than any other OEM and employ more people. But at the same time, we are looking at our footprint and we are seeing what does it make sense for our business? And I think we have a good plan going forward to support our growth, despite some of the political campaign chatter right now.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Congrats again.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Rod.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple of things. First, on North America. Obviously the Q1 numbers are up a lot and, as you said, the full-year earnings will be flat, which implies some, I guess, negative comparisons later in the year. And I think you alluded to some of those drivers. It sounds like a lot of it is related to the launches. So as we think about the pluses and minuses, the last year obviously you had a pretty significant number of launches. This year you've got the Super Duty, and I presume next year is going to be the same. So as you look out to 2017 are there some drags that are being incurred right now that you think might go away as we look further out?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Rod, I think you kind of touched on a number. When you look at our Super Duty launch, we will have the full benefit of that launch in 2017. Couple of other things, we continue to see here in the U.S. customers migrating from passenger cars into SUVs. And when you look at our lineup and you look at the performance there, we think that continues to bode well for us. I think our work overall, as I mentioned earlier, are really understanding the costs that we're putting into the product to drive mix, will be important. So I would look at it \u2013 you could look at it and say, oh my gosh, the second half is going to be weaker and that's going to run into 2017. As we said, this is kind of a normal year in terms of the calendarization of our profits and sales, but the bottom line as we get into 2017, we see continued strength based on the foundational elements of the business: product, brand, and cost.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you comment on where you expect to end the year with respect to inventory days, to the extent that there is some \u2013 a little bit of an elevated level in the field? Is that something that gets corrected by the end of the year? And how should we be thinking about the outlook for the non-raw-material cost inflation going forward?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of inventory, Rod, as I said back in March, our expectations are that you will continue to see the inventory levels come down, particularly as we get further into the higher selling seasons in the spring and the summer. And then towards the end of the year, we always end strong, usually with the end-of-year sales as well. So I think you'll see us very, very normal by the time we get into the second half of the year in particular. So I don't see anything unusual there at all.","We are a bit heavy right now on Super Duty, as I said, and then of course with the very low volume January and February sales months, the visible, if you will, of the day supply look high, but we are actually quite comfortable with where we are. So I don't think you're going to see anything unusual other than what I just mentioned. In terms of the raw materials, I think I mentioned...","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You mentioned non-raw materials.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, non-raw materials. I think we have a very strong cost performance across the business this year in North America. You saw the positive news and the same thing with Europe. You will see seasonal cost increases in the second half and I think you'll see some cost increases, for sure, coming from the new Super Duty, which is normal. We'll have the product-related costs that will come through in the second half of the year, which is not unusual in and of itself, but also remember we haven't updated this product in 19 years. So we're going to be coming out with a product that's going to really set the standard and be something that we can sustain over the next 5 to 10 years.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Is that something that should be \u2013 should that be more benign than what we've been seeing with the F-Series and Edge and some of the other products that had a lot of content cost added, some of which was regulatory? Is there any color you can provide on the trajectory of that content cost related to regulatory?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We will talk more about that when we get to the launch itself. And we've got an Investor Day, which happens to be about the same time, so I think we'll provide more insight and texture at that time.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","The only thing I would add on that, on the Super Duty, is just look at our performance on F-150, in terms of the content that we put in it and what it's driving in terms of revenue. Even in the quarter, the F-150, our average transaction price was up $1,700 year-over-year, so customers are really seeing that value. And that's the same approach the team is taking on Super Duty.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers of Evercore.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first one just on China, you reported a nice step up in the JV margin, which remains at a very strong level. What do you see as the sustainable margin for your China JV over coming quarters? And do you see improvements in mix and structural costs effectively compensating for lower net pricing or could margins move higher still?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think we'll see very strong results for the course of the year, George, from China. I think the margins, I don't know if they will be at 16%, but they will be double digits. They will be very, very strong. I would suspect. It might be different by quarter because you get calendarization and volatility by quarter, but I think by the time we get to the end of the year, as we have shown in recent years we'll have very, very strong margins. I would add, when you look at that number and you look at the Asia Pacific results, you go what am I missing? The China JVs is not the total China profit for Ford. We incur engineering that we absorb and are reflected in the results for the region that we don't recover from the JVs until we actually start producing the vehicles years later. We're launching Lincoln. We've got other allocated costs that sort of, sit at the regional level that you wouldn't see there. So China very profitable for us and improving year-over-year, but I think you'll kind of, see very strong performance in JVs over the course of the year. How are we offsetting the effect of negative pricing? That's through a lot of cost efficiencies through the business and then we have been benefiting also from the very, very strong mix that we have and I think that will continue through the course of the year.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you. And then also just with respect to Europe, I was wondering if you could give any indication on what Brexit, if it happens, might means for Ford given the importance of the U.K. market and your fixed cost basis and what strategy or plans do you have in place if it does indeed happen.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, George. Well, when you look at the issue around the Brexit, obviously the U.K. is a very important market for us and what's important for us as a business is stability, particularly stability in trade, and that's important because that allows us to continue to build a strong business in the U.K, for the over 14,000 folks that are part of the Ford team there. And that's why our position has been that it's beneficial for the U.K. to be part of a single market, a reformed EU. In terms of what may or may not happen, we'll apply the same approach in the U.K. as we do in every other part of the world. Our aim is to keep up our businesses globally competitive. So wherever that referendum comes out, we'll do that.","George Galliers - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a sort of a simple question on North America. I mean, when you look at the guidance of 9.5% or higher, that would, at the low end of the range, indicate a sort of, a mid-to-low 8% EBIT margin or pre-tax margin for the remainder of the year. As we think about this, and I know there's a lot of puts and takes and there's seasonality here, what I mean, should we kind of, focus a little bit more on the higher component of 9.5% or higher, or do you think that 9.5% is something we really should keep in our thought process?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, let me just restate what the guidance says. It's not 9.5%; it's 9.5% or higher. So we do see upside potential from where we were last year and so we just need to let the year play out. We're in the first quarter. There's a lot of moving pieces, a lot of things that we have to manage. We will have, as I mentioned, lower production, which is normal. In the second half, we will have a launch, which will have an effect in the second half with all the benefits to come later, as Mark mentioned.","But we think that we'll come in at 9.5% or higher, and I know Joe and the team are working as hard as humanly possible to make sure that we continue to get everything out of that business unit that we can and they certainly did in the first quarter. So we feel super good about where we are in the quarter and we'll have an extremely strong year.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","And we'll provide updates on this at the end of the second quarter when we do the second quarter call.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That's very helpful and thank you. And then on Europe, you kind of alluded to Russia not being as big a drag in the quarter. I was just curious, if you could put Russia in context in the European business, sort of, size and potential stability and recovery there because it seems like the rest of Europe is firing on all cylinders and if that ever stabilizes, as you could even see some real upside to Europe.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Yep. (51:54) Just to put it into perspective from just a sales standpoint or a share standpoint. In Europe in total, our share was up a couple of tenths to, I think, about 8% in terms of market share. In Russia, we actually doubled our market share in the quarter from a year-ago period. We were about 3%. So you can do the math and see the impact from a volume standpoint. But our approach, as you know, in Russia going forward, we view that as it's going to be -- it's an important market. It will recover over time and the investments that we've made both on the product side and the distribution side and just the business structure itself. I think it will position us well for when the market does start to come back around and that will happen when commodities start coming back around.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think it is a really good point. That is one of the, sort of, on its own a big profit opportunity for us, when the commodity cycle starts to turn.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly on slide 24, you gave us some great incremental data here on financial services at Ford Credit. As we look at the, sort of, the slight extension in terms that are happening in the industry but don't seem to be happening for you and then also look at, sort of, the percentage of loans that are above 73 months. Can you talk about what's going on with credit scores and the consumer that's being offered extended terms? Because it seems like that's only occurring in high credit quality consumers. And also maybe, if you could just comment on prepayment speeds as you've seen an extension in terms, because I think they have been picking up.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll just give a high-level comment and then we'll let Marion supplement. What we are seeing and you touched on it, and I think we talked about it at Let's Chat, we are seeing these customers have very, very high FICO scores. These are really high-quality customers. The other thing that's interesting is we are seeing them come out of that contract early. They don't hang into the bitter end, if you will. And so we are also not seeing any signs here or in Canada, which is about 10 years ahead of us in terms of this trend, in terms of extending the trade cycle.","So right now it just looks like these customers recognize it as being a good deal and they are taking it, but then they don't necessarily hold on to it as long as the contract would allow them to. So you're right in that the industry is higher. I think it is like a 17% mix or something like that. That's around these 73 months terms. We are not participating in that. We actually are offering in very small volume even 84 months. That's something that is out there as well, but again, I think you'll see us trending well below the industry as that trend continues. Marion, do you want to add anything?","Marion Harris - Chief Financial Officer","No, I think you covered everything, Bob.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody. Really strong quarter. Question on for Smart Mobility LLC, I think that you made some really important efforts to identify some of the opportunities as the industry changes and to put some of these technologies within a kind of captive company. The question is, is there a rationale to take the LLC and to separately capitalize it or create a tracking stock or some form, which has been done by large companies in the past in your industry and in others, as a way to kind of find a mechanism through which to attract and compensate employees that would be -- that you would be recruiting in that battle for talent that could be done in a more customized way outside the scope of the traditional forces that affect an auto industry's and auto company's performance?","And I say that seeing thing, your stock up, you posted an incredibly strong result. Your multiple is still really, really low. Stock is up a percent and change. At some point does the capital \u2013 the mechanism through which you can raise and attract capital need to match the mission, if you follow?","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks, Adam. And those are some really interesting thoughts. I think, first off, the reason we set up the LLC to begin with is we wanted it to be what I call separate, but connected, which is to allow the Ford Smart Mobility group to have the organization and the structure to face off with some of the tech and mobility companies in terms of acting really fast. And I think going forward, it's still way too early to kind of talk about some of the things that you mentioned. I wouldn't put them off the table, but at the same token, what's really important is this Ford Smart Mobility group is working very tightly with our core operations.","And I guess where we're at on Ford Smart Mobility, we are very focused, Adam, on where to play and how to win. And as you know, we are generally using experiments and pilots to, not only test technology and customer preferences, but very importantly test the business models, because at the end of the day you want to make money on these things. And we're doing that before we make, what I would call, major bets on investments, whether it's internally or externally. And we'll have more to say about this as our Ford Smart Mobility strategy progresses this year.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate that and look forward to hearing from Mr. Hackett. Can I just have one follow-up about the cycle? Many industry leaders, including yourself, Mark, I think have made statements like and I'm not direct quoting, but that the automobile will see more changes in the next five years than in the last 50 years. If you just take that at face value, and first, do you believe, say categorically with that kind of sentiment?","But if that's even order of magnitude correct, what does that mean for the potential for a super cycle of unprecedented replacement of vehicles in the park now that might become obsolete a little faster than in the past? Where do you come out on this with your team? Is this good for SAAR, is this this urgency to replace and that buying a car is a life-saving decision? Or does it gets stunted by the fact that you have maybe trillions of dollars of used cars out there that where the equity is kind of stranded and creates a credit problem as people, trapped in that equity, that negative equity? Thanks.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks. So there's a lot of kind of aspects to that question. I do think \u2013 I do agree \u2013 we've said that we are going to see \u2013 we're at an inflection point as an industry over the next number of years, given the technology that's available, not only in the product itself, but how to serve the customer.","So when you look at the \u2013 your comment around is there going to be a super cycle, listen, I mean there's hundreds of millions of cars, over 100 million cars here or \u2013 I can't remember exactly the numbers. There's a lot of cars here in the US. It's going to take a long time, even with breakthrough technologies, where people will change that over. Just the math will show you that will take a good amount of time.","And in terms of what technology, whether it's autonomous, or semi-autonomous, or all the connected cars will do for the industry, what is it going to mean? From our standpoint, we're looking at this \u2013 first off, it's too early to tell, but we're really looking at this as vehicle miles traveled. And you could argue that in urban areas there may be less car density, either because of costs or just outright legislation, not allowed to use personal vehicles, which could dampen car sales.","But also, at the same time, if you make something more available and you make it less expensive, it's used more. And if you think about things like autonomous vehicles that will be used 24\/7, they'll rack up miles sooner, which will drive, as I mentioned earlier, more service revenue and, ultimately, more car sales. So I think it's still too early to tell. But our strategy, very clearly, is to continue to make the investments on the technology side and the investments on the mobility side so that we can participate in both of those revenue streams.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Mark. This makes a lot of sense. Cheers.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","All right. Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Just want to go back to sort of more of the next five years in terms of North America and Europe. We seem to, as you've noted, had this heavy shift towards CUVs versus sedans; seems to be creating what some might call a sedan recession.","So as you think about your mid-term capacity plans, putting aside NAFTA and political issues, just where do you think you need more CUV capacity? Do you have, and I know I keep coming back to this question, more ability to get additional factories to be able to flex between the two product lines? And then, as you kind of look across the industry, do you see maybe a risk of too much capacity coming in to the CUV category?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the CUVs or SUVs, in terms of flexibility, clearly we've said, for example, we're going to come out with four SUVs in actually new segments over the next number of years. And what we're seeing, Brian, around the world, literally around the world, is this migration from passenger cars to small and medium and large-size SUVs and CUVs.","So, clearly, our planning going forward is looking at the marketplace and making sure that we're there for consumers in that. So I think you'll see that here in the U.S. You'll see it in Europe and you will see it in Asia Pacific as well. In terms of your comment of will everybody be going there, well, I think that's the nature of the business right in terms of understanding where consumers are going. And that's why I keep bringing back to our strategy of how we are differentiating ourselves on fuel economy, safety, quality, and smart technology, and using our brand. And if you think about this, Brian, whether it's CUVs or SUVs, this really plays to kind of the sweet spot or really a strength of our brand. And we are seeing it now in our results and I think that will bode well going forward.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And will you be reducing car capacity and do you think \u2013 and will others do it such in a way to take some pressure off the car pricing?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I can't speak to others, but clearly, as I mentioned, when you think about the number of SUVs that we're going to be adding, you could see us do that. With the caveat, our approach as a company is to offer a full lineup of vehicles and that's for a couple of reasons. Obviously, one, to anticipate any changes in customer demand, any changes in the economic environment, or any changes in the regulatory environment.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And final question on this shift. What happens when someone comes in with a five-year-old car, maybe a Japanese brand car, that hasn't held its value and they're looking to get into one of your CUVs, are you hearing anything from the dealers about the need for trade-in allowances, underwater loans, or something to help that car buyer get into \u2013 car owner get into a CUV?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I mean, we're not hearing anything above the normal kind of commentary we get from dealers on that, so nothing above the normal.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Means they always want money?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. That was the politically correct way of saying it, yes.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks, good morning. Just one question on leasing and one question on Europe. Bob, your comments on leasing mix for Ford, if I heard right, you said it's going to be going down, your penetration will be going down throughout the year and I just want to know how much of that is a function of not having, say, AA type of credit rating versus standard residual value risk management and related, do you think the industry is being too excessive in its leasing penetration right now?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","For us it's -- we do have what we call the One Ford Lease Strategy, so we've got a lot of analytics behind what we think is the right and appropriate level of lease. We look -- because we are really -- we want to make sure we can support what the market needs, but we also want to make sure that we are managing the concentration of risk. We think that at 26% that will be sort of a high-water mark for us this year. And some of it is seasonal. When you get into the summer selling season, it tends to be much more of a \u2013 it's a retail season and it's very much around APRs and that sort of thing.","So there is just a natural change that occurs in certain times of the year. But that's one of the reasons why we think when we get to the end of the year we will be at something probably a little above last year, but below where we are right now. And we think that's the right level given where the market is. The other thing I would mention is that, for us, there's a much lower percentage of leasing, in Ford anyway, on Super Duties and F-150s, on trucks, that has not been \u2013 that's been generally true across the industry.","Although some of our competitors got pretty heavy on that in the first quarter in some of the regions of the country, we didn't participate in that. So I think that's another factor as well. It's just our natural mix of product.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Thanks. And on Europe, if I heard right, you said 60% of your passenger vehicle volume was on the high end trim packages, which is impressive. I was just curious is the European customer trading up in price given an economic recovery or are you just attracting wealthier customers than in the past?","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","I think it's a combination, David, of both of those things.","David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. Thank you.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning and congrats, everyone.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thank you, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Maybe just to continue on Europe, I mean given the improvement in mix and pricing, and I know there's a lot of political uncertainty out there, as well, for early in the year. But could this be a year where Q1 contributes, maybe what it used to contribute in terms of the quarterly cadence back in 2005-2006 when you were profitable in Europe? I mean what prevents this from being sustainable?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we think it is sustainable. I don't know if it's going to be sustainable at the margin, because we would expect again going back to what's normal.","The second half in Europe is generally not as strong as the first half because of the summer shutdowns and the end of the year shutdowns, that seasonal cost effect that comes into play.","But, yeah, we think that we're going to have a good second quarter. We think we'll be profitable throughout the year and we're going to have strong results in Europe. But we do think that there will be a first half stronger than second half story, but it's still going to be a great story all throughout the year for Europe.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Which again is a normal kind of cadence of our profitability. Nothing unusual.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Absolutely, that's good to hear. Then maybe just going back quickly to North America. I know you alluded to year-end inventory targets. I know you don't provide an annual North America production outlook, but as we think \u2013 I think your first half was up about 11% in North America production. Any kind of ballpark of how we should be thinking about the full year in terms of a range or kind of roughly where you think you might come out as you manage through the launches and some of the inventory?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I don't think we want to provide a guidance for the full year because we still have a lot of year left in front of us. I think we're just going to continue to manage the production in line with demand. You can see on Appendix A9, the call for the second quarter for North America, 850,000 units, that's up 35,000 from where we were a year ago and pretty much in line with where we were in the first quarter.","So, I don't see anything unusual in the year progressing. Again, you'll have lower volume in the second half, for the reasons we've talked about throughout the call, just seasonal and also the effect of the Super Duty launch.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Markets.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Congrats on a really strong quarter.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks Joe.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","First question is on commodities. I believe back in Detroit, you'd mentioned it would be a fairly neutral for the year. It was obviously up by almost $0.5 billion in the first quarter. Is there a change there? Or given that commodities are coming back up a little bit, do you expect to maybe give back a little of that in back half?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","What I said at the Deutsche Bank conference was that we would have favorable commodities on a year-over-year basis this year versus last year. It just wouldn't be as favorable as what it was in 2015 versus 2014.","Getting to the neutral point, that was, the point that I was making was, that we have favorable commodities, not as great as last year, but we'd also have more headwinds from exchange in 2016 than what we saw in 2015. So that was the neutral bit. It was good news commodities would be offset by bad news on exchange.","What I said earlier in the call, Joe, is that now we see commodities as being more favorable than what we thought, because the prices have continued to fall. So I think we will see commodities about as much of good news, based on where we are today, as we saw last year, which was over $900 million. But we will still have more bad news on a year-over-year basis from exchange. So the net of those two, while it will be positive, won't be as positive as it was in 2015 versus 2014.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for the clarification. Then on Europe, it sounded like mid or long-term there is a little bit of a bump to that margin target, 3 to 5 to 6 to 8. Is it fair to think that maybe 1.5 or 2 points of that 3 points is related to the pension accounting change and then maybe 1 point is just from some better operations or mix outlook?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly the elimination of that drag that we had on pensions, which we were relatively unique compared to our peer set, that certainly helps. But actually what it is, it's our view of what we can get out of the business from a performance standpoint of change.","The team has done a really, really good job on all the various aspects of the transformation plan, product, brand, and cost. And we see more potential now in terms of driving the business to the types of margins that we need than where we were perhaps two years ago.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","To put that into perspective, Joe, again we're using this momentum to really drive us towards those margins. Not only is the product launches that we have this year, but we're looking at the product portfolio we have. We are focusing on the products that have high growth and high profitability, and we will drop products that actually don't have either of those characteristics.","At the same time, we are going to continue to work on the costs. As we've said before, we have a voluntary separation program going on right now in Europe which when all is said and done, should save us around $200 million a year annually going forward. So we're going to continue to work every element of that to make sure it's a sustainable and vibrant part of this.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I would just add. When we had that conversation in 2014, that was only about two years into the plan. So we didn't fully see the potential that we are now seeing from the business. The aspects of the plan are very much the same. It's just the team is really, really delivering and we see a lot more potential now for Europe than perhaps what we had before.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks, Colin.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","I understand the comments about second half getting weaker from a seasonal cadence perspective, but how should we think about quarter-over-quarter? You are going off record margins in North America, you had $600 million accrual in Q1, and production in North America looks flat. So should Q2 also be a very strong quarter? And the same thoughts on Europe, it looks like production is even up quarter-over-quarter. Should Europe actually maintain a very strong level in Q2 and then fall off in the second half?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing that I will say about the second quarter is we expect it to be strong, but I don't want to get into calling quarters because I'm always wrong. But it will be a strong quarter. The first and second quarter, again going back to this theme around what's normal, they are the stronger quarters of the year.","I would expect that to be the case this year. So we'll have a strong second quarter. I won't characterize it any way other than that. And then we'll have the seasonal effect in the second quarter, along with the product launch impact. And then a really, really strong year.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Is there anything unusual in Q1 that we should be aware of going in North America and Europe that actually helped it out but that won't reoccur?","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I'm glad you asked that question, because there is actually nothing in the results in any of the business units that you would consider to be unusual. This is really quality earnings right across the board.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And any color on \u2013 I saw in the press release you mentioned Ford passed this rolling out. How has that rollout gone? Is that going to be something you are going to advertise going forward? Any just color there on that launch?","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","What we're doing, Colin, right now is, we should be launching that in the next month or so and we are very excited about it. Think about, we will obviously communicate it, because we think it really provides a way for us to have a fundamentally different relationship, not only with our customers, but customers that don't own Fords. And so what you will see is, think about it this way, it's a launch, but then we'll be continually improving it to improve the experience for our customers.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much for the color.","Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Colin.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Keith Naughton of Bloomberg.","Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP","Good morning.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Good morning, Keith.","Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP","Hey, Mark, there has been some headlines recently that have said that the Ford did not plan to offer a 200-mile electric car to compete with the likes of the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevy Bolt. And I just wanted you to clarify, does Ford plan to offer a long-range electric vehicle?","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Absolutely. Our approach, very simply, is we want to make sure that we are either among the leaders or a leadership position in the product segments that we are in. And if you look at our BEV today, our Focus has about a 100-mile range and that is very competitive for the price point that it's at in the marketplace right now. And that's why, as you know, we've made the announcement late last year where we're going to invest another $4.5 billion into our vehicle lineup on electrification. And by the time we end the decade, we will have 40% of our nameplates around the world that will be electrified and they will be very competitive from a cost, quality, range standpoint to allow us to move the business forward.","Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP","And will your long-range electrical vehicle go 200 miles and when will that come?","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Well, our electric vehicle will be, as I said, it comes down as we want to make sure we are among the best or the leaders in those areas. So in that timeframe, when you look at some of the competitors, what they've announced, clearly that's something that we want to \u2013 we are developing for.","Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP","Thank you, Mark.","Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call.

Please proceed.","George Sharp","Thank you, Katrina, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our second quarter 2013 financial results.","Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford Motor; and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Mark Fields, Chief Operating Officer; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Now copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s investor and media website. Please note that the financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q and a non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck.","Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the presentation over to Alan Mulally.","Alan R. Mulally","Thank you, George, and good morning. We are pleased to review our second quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our One Ford Plan. Let\u2019s turn to the first slide please.","Our One Ford Plan depicted here remains the foundation for everything we do. Across the Ford Enterprise we continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitability at the current demand and changing model mix, accelerate development of new products our customers want and value; finance our plan and continually improve our balance sheet and work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets.","Our goal is to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles, small, medium and large cars, utilities and trucks, delivering profitable growth for all. No place is as better represented than in China, where execution of the One Ford Plan is well underway with growing evidence of our success demonstrated in our results.","As shown here on slide 2, our product portfolio is rapidly expanding in China. With five new segment launches in 2013, we\u2019re nearly doubling our lineup by year-end and we continue to freshen our showrooms with three all new or refreshed products. Our dealer network in China is also expanding to serve our customers. We\u2019re on track to grow from about 600 dealer outlets at the end of 2012 to more than 900 by 2015.","Strong sales of our new products grow significant market share improvements in China, stay in their record quarterly market share of 4.3% in the second quarter. In fact, our market share in China improved seven times representing its point from the first quarter and was up 1.5 percentage points from the same period last year.","To meet the growing demand for Ford vehicles in China, Changan Ford one of our joint ventures, opened a new engine plant last month in Chongqing, more than doubling Changan Ford\u2019s annual engine capacity. The plant initially will produce the award winning 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine with our turbo charged direct injection three cylinder engine, recently named international engine of the year for the second year running as well as a 1.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine.","Also in June, JMC another of our joint ventures, opened a new commercial vehicle assembly plant in Nanchang. This new highly flexible production facility more that doubles JMC\u2019s annual capacity. We also announced plans to bring two new global products to JMC, an all new Ford commercial vehicle in all new Ford SUV. With the launch of these products, Ford will have a full portfolio of vehicles in China, delivering on our plan to introduce 15 new vehicles in China by 2015.","Let\u2019s now turn from the exciting progress we\u2019re making in China to our second quarter results. We\u2019ll start on slide 3, with a summary of our accomplishments. The Company had an outstanding second quarter, earning operating profit of $2.6 billion, our 16th consecutive profitable quarter.","Automotive operating related cash flow was very strong at $3.3 billion, and quarterly end liquidity exceeded $37 billion. The top line has showed double-digit percentage gains in year-over-year growth in both wholesale volume and total company revenue, supported by market share gains in all regions around the world.","Among our business units, both North America and Asia Pacific had record results. In North America we had a highest second quarter and first half pre-tax results, and in Asia Pacific and Africa, we achieved our best pre-tax profit of any quarter. Ford credit, once again delivered solid performance and South America returned to profitability. Europe incurred a loss, but it was improved compared with both a year-ago and the first quarter, as we continue to execute our transformation plan leading to profitability by mid-decade.","Total automotive operating margin at 6.4%, improved 1.5 percentage points from 2012 with all regions contributing to our strong performance. Today we\u2019re improving our full-year Company financial guidance. We now expect total Company pre-tax profit to be about equal to or higher than 2012. In automotive operating margin to be about equal to 2012. We also now expect automotive operating related cash flow to be substantially higher than last year.","Before turning to the financial details, let\u2019s recap several other noteworthy achievements from the second quarter. As shown on Slide 4, we launched a number of products around the globe, including the refreshed Fiesta in the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina; the Tourneo Custom in Russia; the Fiesta ST in South Africa and China; the EcoSport in India; and the 1.5-liter EcoBoost in Asia Pacific and Africa.","In Russia, we started full production of Explorer in our Elabuga Assembly Plant. At the Shanghai Motor Show we introduced the Escort Concept indicating our future direction to meet the preferences of Chinese customers. We announced investment in two new engine plants, one in China at JMC and another in Russia at our Ford Sollers joint venture.","In Australia we announced the transformation of our business with plants discontinued domestic manufacturing in 2016 and serve our customers with an exciting lineup of products from around the Ford world. Meanwhile in the U.S., we celebrated the sale of more hybrid vehicles in the first five months of the year than we had sold previously in any full year.","Finally, in North America we announced the addition of over 2,000 jobs in Kansas City to support higher F-Series demand and launch of the Ford Transit. This addition along with 1,400 jobs to be added at our Flat Rock Assembly Plant enabled an increase in the straight-time capacity of 200,000 units annually to meet demand. We're also announcing the reduced summer shutdown throughout North America.","Bob Shanks will now take us through the details of our financial performance in the quarter. Bob?","Robert L. Shanks","Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased to be able to share our second quarter results with you today. Second quarter wholesale volume was 1.7 million units, up 231,000 units or 16% from a year ago and revenue at $38.1 billion was up $4.8 billion or 15%.","Pre-tax profit was $2.6 billion, excluding special items, $726 million higher than a year ago and our after-tax earnings per share at $0.45 were $0.15 higher. Net income attributable to Ford including unfavorable pre-tax special items of $736 million was $1.2 billion, $193 million higher than a year ago.","Earnings were $0.30 a share, up $0.04. Special items in the second quarter included $442 million for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe and $294 million associated with our U.S. salary retiree voluntary lump sum payout program. You can find additional detail on these special items in Appendix 3.","Automotive operating-related cash flow was $3.3 billion marking the 13th consecutive quarter of positive performance. Automotive growth cash improved to $25.7 billion exceeding debt by $9.9 billion. Our second quarter operating effective tax rate which isn't shown was 32% consistent with prior guidance. We continue to expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be similar to 2012, which was 32%.","In the first half, vehicle wholesales and revenue increased by about 13% from a year ago and first half pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $4.7 billion, a $579 million improvement. Net income was $2.8 billion, $408 million higher than a year ago.","As shown on slide 6, both of our sectors, automotive and financial services, contributed to the total company's second quarter pre-tax profit of $2.6 billion. And as shown in the memo below the chart, profit improved $726 million from a year ago driven primarily by the automotive sector. Compared with first quarter 2013, total company pre-tax profit improved $409 million reflecting higher automotive profit.","The key market factors and financial metrics for our total automotive business are shown on slide 7. The strong automotive performance reflects continued outstanding performance in North America, recovery in South America from the exchange-driven loss in the first quarter, great progress in Europe and continuing to deliver our transformation plan and as noted, the best ever quarterly profit in Asia-Pacific, Africa.","As already mentioned, total automotive second quarter wholesale volume and revenue were both up strongly from a year ago. The higher volume reflects improved market share in all regions and higher industry volume in all regions except Europe, as well as lower dealer stock reduction this year compared with the year ago.","The growth in revenue reflects higher volume in all regions and net pricing gains everywhere except Europe, offset partially by unfavorable exchange in all regions. Automotive pre-tax profit was $2.1 billion, up $722 million from the year ago, more than explained by favorable market factors and that's volume, mix and net pricing.","Operating margin at 6.4% was 1.5 percentage points higher reflecting mainly favorable market factors. As shown in the memo below the chart, first half volume and revenue were both 13% higher than a year ago and total automotive first half pre-tax profit at $3.7 billion and operating margin at 5.8% also were both higher.","The $700 million increase in total automotive second quarter pre-tax profit compared with 2012 as explained by the causal factors shown on slide 8. The improvement reflects favorable market factors across all regions, offset partially by higher cost and unfavorable exchange primarily in South America.","The cost increases mainly reflect investments in higher volume, growth and new products for this year and the future, as well as restructuring-related costs in Europe and higher pension in OPEB expense in North America and Europe. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was $0.5 billion higher than first quarter, more than explained by favorable volume and mix and exchange. You can find more details on the quarter-to-quarter change in Appendix 8.","Our second quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown on slide 9. All regions were profitable except Europe and they all improved compared with the year ago. In addition, the regions outside North America achieved the best combined results since second quarter 2011.","Other automotive reflects net interest expense offset partially by a favorable fair market value adjustment on our investment in Mazda. For the full year we now expect automotive net interest expense to total about $800 million to $850 million. This is up from our prior guidance of $750 million to $800 million, primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates on the market value of our cash investments portfolio.","Now we'll look at each of the regions within the automotive sectors starting on slide 10 with North America. North America continued to perform very well achieving a pre-tax profit of $2 billion or more and an operating margin of 10% or more for the fifth time of the last six quarters.","In the second quarter, this reflects improving industry sales and a healthy full-size pickup segment, our strong product lineup, U.S. market share growth including strong growth in the East and West Coast markets, continued discipline in matching production to real demand and a lean cost structure, even as we invest more in product and capacity for future growth.","As you can see on the first two graphs on the left, North America grew strongly in the second quarter with wholesale volume and revenue each 14% higher than a year ago. The higher volume drove the revenue increase. The volume improvement mainly reflects higher U.S. industry sales increasing from SAAR of 14.5 million to 15.7 million units and the higher U.S. market share.","North America pre-tax profit was $2.3 billion, $390 million higher than a year ago and operating margin at 10.4% also was higher. Favorable market factors more than account for the improvement in both metrics. As shown in the memo below the chart, North America first half, pre-tax profit was $4.7 billion, a first half record, and operating margin was 10.7%, about the same as the year ago. Volume and revenue were both about 16% higher than the same period a year ago.","On slide 11, we show in more detail the causal factors that drove the $300 million improvement in North America second quarter pre-tax profit. As mentioned, the improvement was driven by favorable market factors offset partially by higher costs, including investment and new products and growth. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit decreased by $100 million compared with first quarter, more than explained by higher costs.","Ford U.S. market share trends are shown on slide 12. Total U.S. market share increased in the second quarter compared with last year and the prior quarter. Retail share of the retail industry also improved from the year ago but was down from the prior quarter. Starting on the left, our total market share was 16.5%, up nine-tenths of a percentage point from the same period last year, reflecting robust F-Series sales and strong sales of the all new C-MAX and Escape.","Our share was up six-tenth of a percentage point from first quarter 2013 reflecting stronger demand for small cars and E-Series vans from our fleet customers and the higher retail sales of Lincoln MKZ and Escape. As shown on the right, our retail market share of the retail industry was 13.7% up 9\/10 of a percentage point from last year reflecting increases in F-series, small cars, Escape and MKZ. This includes favorable market segmentation for full-size pickups and mid-size premium cars. Our retail market share declined from first quarter reflecting primarily lower dealer inventory of some products including Fusion and Explorer. We expect to address these constraints in the second half with the launch of Fusion at our Flat Rock assembly plant and an increase in Explorer capacity at our Chicago facility. Now turning to our full-year guidance for North America, it remains unchanged. We continue to expect higher pre-tax profit compared with last year, and an operating margin of about 10%.","Let\u2019s turn now to slide 13, and talk about South America. In South America we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product lineup while progressively replacing legacy products with global ONE FORD offerings. Customer response to the new Ranger pickup has been strong while the all new EcoSport and Fusion are segment leaders. The recently refreshed Fiesta is also launched to a strong start. In the second quarter wholesale volume and revenue increased from a year ago by 24% and 28% respectively. The higher volume reflects favorable changes in dealer stocks, higher industry sales which increased from a SAAR of 5.3 million to 5.8 million units and higher market share. The market share increased from 9.4% to 9.6% with more than explained by strong sales of EcoSport.","South America\u2019s growth in revenue were driven mainly by higher volume from new products and that pricing gains offset partially by unfavorable exchange. Pre-tax profit was $151 million and the operating margin was 5%. The year-over-year improvement in both metrics is more than explained by a favorable volume in mix and net pricing gain. As shown in the memo below the chart, South America first half loss was $67 million which is more than explained by the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuela and Bolivar in the first quarter. Volume and revenue were higher than last year.","On slide 14 we show more detail behind the $146 million increase in South America\u2019s second quarter pre-tax results. As mentioned our new products are gaining momentum and contributed the favorable mix and higher net pricing in the second quarter. Higher costs and unfavorable exchange were partial offsets. As shown in the memo pre-tax results were $369 million better than first quarter explained primarily by favorable market factors and exchange offset partially by higher cost. Our full-year guidance for South America remains unchanged. We continue to expect results to be about breakeven in an environment that remains challenging across the continent.","Let\u2019s turn now to Europe beginning on slide 15. As we\u2019ll discuss in more detail shortly Europe is well on track in executing our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. In the second quarter Europe\u2019s wholesale volume and revenue each improved about 8% from a year ago. The volume increased primarily reflects non-repeat of dealer stock reductions incurred in 2012 and higher market share. Lower industry volume was a partial offset. The SAAR declined from 14.4 million units a year ago to 13.6 million units this year. Europe\u2019s market share improved 5\/10 of a percentage point from 7.6% to 8.1% more than explained by higher share of the retail market. The increase in Europe\u2019s revenue mainly reflects the higher volume. The pre-tax loss for Europe was $348 million and the operating margin was a negative 4.6%, both improved from a year ago despite the lower industry and the restructuring cost associated with our transformation plan. As shown in the memo below the chart, Europe\u2019s first half loss was $810 million and operating margin was negative 5.7%, both worse than a year ago more than explained by $291 million from restructuring costs. Volume and revenue were about equal compared with last year.","Slide 16 shows more detail of the causal factors that drove the $56 million improvement in Europe\u2019s second quarter pre-tax results from a year ago. The improvement is more than explained by a favorable volume in mix offset partially by higher structural cost mainly accelerated depreciation and a non-recurring write-off related to facilities we plan to close. The memo on the right side of the slide shows the restructuring related cost that are included in our operating results. Personnel separation related costs which were significant this quarter are captured in special items. As show in the memo below the chart pre-tax results improved $114 million compared with first quarter mainly due to favorable volume and mix.","Slide 17, which is new this quarter shows total market share for the 19 Europe markets we track as well as passenger car retail market share of the retail industry for the five major European markets, and these five major European markets represent about 75% of the 19 markets. Starting on the left, our total market share was 8.1% up 5\/10 of a percentage point from the same period last year more than explained by strong sales of the all new V-Max and improvements by Transit, Kuga and Ranger. The share also was a 4\/10 of a percentage point from first quarter. A key element of our European transformation plan is to focus on retail sales and to reduce reliance on short cycle rental and dealer self-registration units. This is key to our brand health, residual values and margins.","As shown in the right hand chart, our strategy is working. Our share of the retail segment of the five major European markets grew to 8.3% in the first quarter and 8.4% in the second quarter nearly two percentage points better than the same period last year. This improvement has been underpinned by the strong retail performance of our all new V-Max and Fiesta as well as retail share gains for Focus. Consistent with our strategy dealer stock day supply of new vehicles at the end of the second quarter have been reduced in line with our plan and stocks of dealer self-registered vehicles have been reduced by about 2\/3 compared with prior-year. Going into the third quarter our retail order banks are very healthy and about 50% higher than prior-year in a down market.","The slide 18 shows, we continue to progress in delivering our European transformation plan. Our product acceleration remains on track with the introduction now of five new passenger and two new commercial vehicles through June. Due in part to the strength of our new products as already noted our retail share improved sharply in the second quarter and our fleet share also improved 4\/10 of a percentage point. Internal data also suggest we\u2019re improving quality and the perception on the Ford brand and the region as well. We continue to make progress on cost too including our plan to close three facilities and relocate production for a more efficient manufacturing footprint. Our Southampton Assembly plant and Dagenham Stamping and Tooling operations will close at the end of this week and we\u2019ve completed the consultation process with the unions at our Genk, Belgium plant which is scheduled to close at the end of next year.","As mentioned earlier, special items in the second quarter shown in Appendix three include $442 million for world-wide separation related actions of which $419 million was related to separation cost per personnel at the Genk and U.K. facilities as part of our transformation plan. The total of these separation cost is estimated at about $1.2 billion all of which we expect to incur by year end 2014 with about $800 million we recognized this year including the $400 million I just mentioned for the second quarter.","Now in terms of our full-year guidance for Europe we now expect our loss to be about the same as the year ago or about $1.8 billion. This compares to our prior guidance of a loss of about $2 billion. While the outlook for the business environment in Europe continues to be uncertain, data trend suggest that economic and industry conditions may have begun to stabilize.","Let\u2019s now turn to Asia Pacific, Africa on Slide 19. Our strategy in Asia Pacific, Africa is straight forward, to aggressively grow with an expanding portfolio of global ONE FORD products tailored for the region with manufacturing hubs in China and India and in ASEAN. Implementation of the strategy is fairly gaining momentum. As shown on the left second quarter wholesale volume was up 27% from a year ago and net revenue which excludes our China joint ventures grew 35%. The higher volume reflects mainly higher market share as well as stronger industry sales which increased from a SAAR of 33.4 million units to 35.4 million. Unfavorable changes in dealer stocks were a partial offset. Second quarter market share in the region was 3.6%, one full percentage point higher than a year ago and a quarterly record. The 38% improvement was driven by China which isn't shown where our market share improved as Alan mentioned by 1.5 percentage point to a quarterly record of 4.3% reflecting mainly strong sales of the new Focus, Kuga, and EcoSport. Asia-Pacific, Africa's higher revenue primarily reflects favorable volume and mix.","Pre-tax profit at $177 million was in any quarter record and operating margin was 5.8% both improved from last year due to favorable market factors. This was also the regions fourth consecutive quarterly profit. As shown in the memo below the chart, Asia-Pacific, Africa first half profit was $183 million with an operating margin of 3.2% both higher than a year ago. Volume and revenue also increased.","The $243 million improvement from a year ago in Asia-Pacific, Africa second quarter pre-tax results is explained by casual factor on slide 20. As we've seen in past quarters, top line related factors were favorable offset partially by higher costs as we continue to invest for future growth as well as unfavorable exchange. We also benefited from higher royalties, parts and accessories profits as well as an insurance recovery all included in other.","As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific, Africa pre-tax results were $171 million higher than first quarter 2013 more than explained by favorable volume and mix. Given the strong first half performance and the momentum demonstrated by our business in the region, we now expect Asia-Pacific, Africa to be profitable for the full year.","Turning now to Ford Credit, slide 21 shows the $16 million increase in second quarter pre-tax results compared with the year-ago by causal factor. The results are more than explained by higher receivables and financing margin, offset partially by lower credit loss reserve reductions. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax results decreased by $53 million compared with first quarter due to unfavorable mark-to-market on the derivative portfolio and seasonal insurance losses.","Ford Credit remains key to our global growth strategy providing world class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid profits and distributions. For the full year, Ford Credit continues to expect pre-tax profits to be about the same as last year and distributions to the parent of about $200 million. Ford Credit now expects year-end managed receivables to range between $97 billion and $102 billion which is within our prior range of $95 billion to $105 billion.","Next on slide 22 as our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow, as you can see here automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $25.7 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion from the end of the first quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $3.3 billion driven primarily by automotive profits of $2.1 billion and favorable timing differences of $1.2 billion.","During the quarter, we contributed $1 billion to our worldwide funded pension plans which included about $800 million of discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plans in line with our long-term pension derisking strategy. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $400 million and we continued our compensation-related share repurchase program.","In the first half, our operating related cash flow was $4 billion and gross cash improved $1.4 billion. We now expect automotive operating related cash flow to be substantially higher than it was in 2012 which compares to our prior guidance of simply higher which was $3.4 billion in 2012.","Now we'll summarize our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the quarter which is captured on slide 23. Automotive debt at the end of the quarter totaled $15.8 billion which was $200 million lower than first quarter. In April, we took advantage of favorable market conditions by increasing our revolving credit facility from $9.3 billion to $10.7 billion and extending this maturity from November 2015 to November 2017. We entered the quarter with net cash of $9.9 billion and liquidity of $37.1 billion.","We'd now like to provide on slide 24 a special update on our pension derisking strategy. In the first half, we contributed $2.8 billion to our global funded pension plans including $2 billion in discretionary contributions to our U.S. plans. For the full year, we continue to expect contributions of $5 billion to our global funded plans including about $3.5 billion in discretionary contributions.","In the second quarter we settled $1.5 billion of obligations related to the U.S. salary retiree voluntary lump sum program with $2.7 billion settled since the inception of the program last year. As a result of the second quarter settlement, we recognized a special item charge of $294 million reflecting the acceleration of unrecognized losses in the plan. The lump sum program now is about 60% complete based on obligations and concludes by year end.","Also we've continued to progressively improve the mix of fixed income assets to our plans portfolios with the objective of reducing funded status volatility. As a result of the strategic actions we've been taking along with recent increases in discount rates, the funded status of our global funded pension plans significantly improved as of June 30 compared with the end of last year. As usual we'll provide a full update at the end of the year.","Now with that, I'd like to turn it back to Alan who'll take us through our outlook for the business environment as well as an update of our 2013 planning assumptions and key metrics.","Alan R. Mulally","Thank you, Bob. Summarize on slide 25 is our view of the business environment going forward. Overall, our outlook has not changed substantially. We project 2013 global GDP growth to be at the lower end of the 2% to 3% range. Global industry sales are projected at the higher end of an 80 million to 85 million unit range.","U.S. economic growth is expected to be in a 2.5% range with industry sales supported by continuing improvement in the housing sector and replacement demand as a result of the older age of vehicles on the road. In South America, recent developments in Brazil add uncertainty to the near-term outlook while in Argentina and Venezuela; there are escalated risks as both economies are weak with an unclear economic policy direction.","The Euro Area is in recession but incoming data suggests that economic and industry conditions may have begun to stabilize. Recent policy decisions such as the European Central Bank's rate cut and the European Union's extension of deficit targets for some markets are positive steps.","In Asia Pacific and Africa, economic indicators point towards growth in the 7% to 8% range in China this year. Growth in India on the other hand is below its full potential due partially to high inflation and interest rates. Overall, despite challenges we expect global growth to continue for 2013.","Our guidance for 2013 is detailed here on slide 26. We now expect full year industry volume to range from 15.5 million to 16 million units in the U.S., Europe to be at the higher end of 13 million to 13.5 million unit range and China to range from 20.5 million to 21.5 million units.","We project our full year market share to increase over 2012 in the U.S. and China and to be about equal to last year in Europe. But we expect our retail share of the retail market in Europe to improve.","Our total company second quarter production volume shown in Appendix 5 was about 1.7 million units, 218,000 units higher than a year ago, reflecting higher volumes in all regions. We expect total company third quarter production volume to be about $1.6 million, up 195,000 units from a year ago, also reflecting higher volumes in all regions. The outlook for quality is now mixed as we expect performance in North America, South America and Asia-Pacific to be about the same as last year but Europe to be better.","In terms of our financial performance, we now expect total company pre-tax profit to be about equal or higher than 2012, automotive operating margin to be about equal to 2012 and automotive operating related cash flow to be substantially higher than 2012 including capital spending of about $7 billion to support our industry leading product refresh rates, expansion of our portfolio in an absolute sense and across the regions and capacity actions. Overall, 2013 is proving to be another strong year for the Ford Motor Company as we continue to work towards our mid decade outlook.","In closing, our One Ford Plan is built on a compelling vision, comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation. As the results we have announced today make clear our One Ford Plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world and we are absolutely focused on building great products, creating a stronger business and continue to contribute to a better world. We achieved outstanding results in the second quarter and we continue to expect strong results for the full-year. This includes continued strength from North America, delivery of global products in the South America for product led growth and the remainder \u2013 for the remainder of the year, even as we work to adjust to an uncertain economic environment in the region. Continued successful execution of our transformation plan for Europe for which many proof points are evident and which is proceeding as planned as we work to return to profitability by mid-decade.","Strong investment for the long-term success in Asia Pacific and Africa, which is already beginning \u2013 being reflected in improved revenue, market share and financial results and consistent performance from our valued Ford Credit operations, which delivers a world class customer service and solid bottom line results.","Now we\u2019d be delighted to take your questions. George?","George Sharp","Thanks, Alan. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community then take questions from the media. In order to allow as many questions as possible, please keep your questions brief. Katrina, can we have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Colin Langan representing UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan - UBS","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a great quarter.","Robert L. Shanks","Thank you, Colin.","Colin Langan - UBS","Any color on Asia Pacific results? Are there anything you meet in the quarter that\u2019s not sustainable, anyway I think in your Investor Day couple of years ago, you highlighted that Asia Pacific would be a meaningful contributor, seems to be evidence for that, but is there anything that we should think about as that proceeds through the year?","Alan R. Mulally","Bob?","Robert L. Shanks","Hey Colin, I think the only thing that I\u2019d just note in the result, there was an insurance recovery, but it was relatively minor. I think it was around $30 million, if you will. So, if you put that aside, $130 million profit or so, very, very strong for us. So, I think when what you\u2019re seeing is the strong topline performance that we\u2019ve seen for quite some time is now starting to show up, which we knew it would on the bottom line. And as we look ahead at the balance of the year and at a very, very strong market reaction to all the new products, we\u2019ve got more coming in the second half of the year. That\u2019s what given us the confidence built from the momentum that we\u2019ve established in the first quarter to raise our guidance on each specifics. So, we feel very good about it and it\u2019s a quality result we went through.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. And then on South America, you highlighted in your closing comments that Brazil has some uncertainty and there is risk in Argentina, Venezuela and it does seem like even within the quarter foreign currency kept working against you. What gives us confidence to maintain your guidance for that region?","Robert L. Shanks","Well a couple of things. One is the first half was largely affected by the one-time devaluation of the bol\u00edvar. That was nearly $200 million and so that\u2019s what\u2019s pushing us into the loss cumulatively in the first half and we don\u2019t expect the Venezuelan government to do anything on that front in the second half of the year. So, we think that was if you will a one-timer at least from the perspective of the calendar year. So, if you put that to the side, we\u2019d have been in at low level, but we\u2019d been at a run rate that was profitable in the half. We think that will continue into the second half. The strong market reaction that we\u2019re seeing for the Ranger to the EcoSport, we\u2019ll continue, its really giving us great performance in terms of market share growth. It\u2019s getting us favorable mix, because the margins on these products are very healthy and we\u2019ve got the all new focus coming in the second half of the year, which we build on that. So, putting aside some anomalous events that could occur, we think that probably will get us at least a breakeven result. I should have mentioned also we\u2019ve introduced the refreshed Fiesta, which is also doing very, very well in the marketplace. So feel pretty good about where we\u2019re right now, and we think breakeven is the appropriate call at this point of time.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Yes, good morning and congrats also on the quarter. Just wanted to follow-up on that Latin America question actually, it does seem in fact that the guidance implies a sequential pretty big drop down, right? I think it was a 150 this quarter and haven\u2019t done the fine tuning, but it would be substantially below that ticket to breakeven on a quarterly basis in the second half. Can you tell us a little bit more? I mean, obviously you\u2019ve got a lot going on there in terms of product, but I guess maybe the production outlook is a little bit different given some of the uncertainty you\u2019re facing or are you actually taking schedules down a little bit, little bit more color on that sequential path.","Alan R. Mulally","Yeah, we think \u2013 if you just step back for a minute Patrick, and look at the region, clearly you\u2019re looking at the headlines of Brazil and so there is some uncertainty in terms of what that will all mean. Its clearly we\u2019re seeing the growth, the GDP growth of Brazil soften and its running at well below its \u2013 what should be a much stronger run rate. In the case of Venezuela, Venezuela is Venezuela and it presents a unique challenges everyday every quarter. And when you look at Argentina it\u2019s going through one of its cyclical swoons and that presents challenges as well. So, I understand your point. We do think that we\u2019ll be profitable obviously in the second half and we\u2019ll work hard to make it better, but that\u2019s just our best call at this time.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then if I can ask one on Europe, may be a two part question there. Out of the $1.8 billion loss that you\u2019re forecasting for this year, can you remind us of how much of that is really one-time related to accelerated depreciation and alike. How much of that kind of comes out once you close \u2013 once you do remove Dagenham and Southampton? And then, kind of the second part to that question is also can you tell us a little bit more about the transition cost now that you\u2019ve got permission to close Genk, I guess you really start sort of the efforts to ramp up Valencia and sort of how big of a nut is that in terms of the cost headwind? Thanks.","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, I will just give you an answer to the first and then may be Mark could give you a perspective on what we\u2019re doing in terms of the footprint reconfiguration. We think that the impact this year on our restructuring cost will be $400 million, $500 million. And you can see what we\u2019ve here in the quarter, which included a one-time write-off of some assets related to largely the Genk. So we think \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been saying. We think we\u2019re on track to that and now moving ahead with the reconfiguration since \u2013 in fact the plants in the U.K. close this week and we\u2019ve gotten past the information and consultation product \u2013 process in Belgium and now moving towards closure at the end of \u201914. But Mark can tell you a bit more \u2013 give you some color in terms of how we\u2019re moving forward on that.","Mark Fields","Thanks, Bob. Well, as you know we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019ve mentioned before that as we look at the transformation plan in Europe that our structural costs over time will actually increase and that\u2019s to support our growth strategy. And as part of that will be the cost associated with moving products around as you mentioned down to Valencia as well as Saarlouis to make sure that we can continue to produce those products in a more efficient footprint. So, we\u2019ll report out on that as we go forward.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thank you guys.","Alan R. Mulally","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","Good morning, everybody. Congratulations.","Alan R. Mulally","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","Just one quick thing, just a follow-up on that last question, what should we be thinking with respect to the accelerated D&A in Europe next year? Does that fall off?","Alan R. Mulally","We are not going to provide any guidance to next year, but we\u2019ll continue to have the restructuring \u2013 the write-off of the restructuring related to Genk will go all the way through the closure of the facility and that will at the end of the year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay.","Alan R. Mulally","But U.K. will be finished with the closure of the facilities. That was by far the smaller of the effects that were included in the restructuring cost.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. And just jumping over to Asia, it\u2019s pretty significant if you annualize the number from the quarter. It sounds like, just based on the SAAR expectations, that maybe you\u2019re expecting a little bit of moderation in the back half versus what've we've seen in the first half because your full year outlook is a bit below \u2013 at least the midpoint of your full year outlook is a bit below what we did in the first half. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in that market? You have any thoughts with respect to maybe different GDP scenarios and what that would do to demand?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, when we look at \u2013 China's obviously the biggest market in the region. Our growth prospects for China, I think as Alan mentioned, are sort of 7% to 8%. It is softening at a very high level which is probably healthy for the long-term prospects for the economy. But we do see it softening a bit from where it had been in the recent years. Our call for the industry is \u2013 we've tightened a range a bit to 20.5 million to 21.5 million units in terms of the SAAR and so I think we feel pretty comfortable about that right now. It could be towards the higher end, but we think that is looking good. India is the other big market there and again we're seeing a little bit of softening in growth but it still is a pretty good rate but under what it could perform. And we're seeing as a result of high interest rates, an inflation impacts on the GDP and also on the industry there too. So it's been softening a bit but it's still large.","Alan R. Mulally","The only thing I would add to what Bob mentioned, first to put this into perspective, the China market is going to be up significantly year-over-year when you look at our ranges over 10%, but one thing we're watching very closely is in June the OEMs have a practice to pay midyear bonuses based on wholesales, so potentially what we saw is a little bit of spike up in the month of June. We'll see how July plays out. So we're factoring that into our call.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay, thanks. And just lastly a little bit of clarification on North America, you did $1 billion of better earnings from volume on 104,000 unit increase in wholesales which is like $9,600 a unit which is obviously higher than what we've seen historically and maybe you could just clarify what you're thinking in terms of pricing? It looks quite good. We're seeing some of your competitors becoming a little bit more aggressive in small mid cars, but your inventories are constrained. So how should we be thinking about the outlook there?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we've said \u2013 for the company itself, we're going to have positive pricing globally for the year on a year-over-year basis and we think that's the case in North America. Everyone is still performing and acting in a rather disciplined way. You're going to see some players each month depending on the vehicle item what they've got going on doing something. But in general, I think the discipline we've seen for quite sometime is still holding up. And of course associated with the new products that we introduce, we always add equipment and generally have been able to price for that. And so that's one of the things that \u2013 in fact that is exactly what's driving our pricing is new equipment. If you took the equipment out, we probably wouldn't be in positive territory. But we think in total that we'll see positive pricing continue for the full year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","And the volume affect, is there anything unusual there in $9,600?","Robert L. Shanks","No, nothing unusual. As you can see on slide 11, it's just driven by the industry, the share; less of a \u2013 we've got a small change in stocks, it's not really material. There's an adverse mix actually which is a good thing, it's just the huge success that we've seen in the super segments that we've talked about, F-Series is still doing very, very well. It's just that the super segment products are doing even better and particularly on the East and West Coast, so nothing unusual.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay, thank you.","Alan R. Mulally","Thanks, Rod.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy. Please proceed.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on all the new hires, I'm just curious how many of them are tier 2 workers or are you still calling back tier 1 workers?","Mark Fields","John, this is Mark. As we mentioned, the 2,000 workers that we're bringing back this year between \u2013 in our Kansas City facility but also the other 1,400 at Flat Rock, the majority of it is the entry level wage. We've redeployed a lot of our folks but a lot of it is entry level wage and we're planning on that accordingly.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And what kind of limits do you have on those hires as far as the percentage of your work force and where would you be once you're through this wave of hiring?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, when we had the contract back in 2011, I believe the limit was 20% but we did have some exceptions to that, our facility in Rawsonville as well as another facility. So it's about 20%. We're working on our way towards that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then second question, Bob, just on the pensions on slide 24. I mean you gave us a good update but you talked about a material improvement. As we look at this and where rates have gone and asset returns have gone in your contributions, I mean it looks like in the U.S., the $9.7 billion underfunded status is probably at this point more than cut in half and by the end of the year, there might be a material step further. What does material mean as far as you're improving? I mean is it at least half? I mean I'm just trying to understand sort of the [tea leaves] here because this is a pretty important topic?","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, it's very important and we're very encouraged by the progress we're seeing. I think the way that I would think about it is we've put $2.8 billion into our funds in the first half, $2 billion of which were discretionary in the U.S. plans. And then as you might recall from some of the other presentations that we've provided, if you look at a sensitivity, a one point change in U.S. discount rates would impact U.S. funded status by about $5 million and we did about 70, 80 basis points I think is the\u2026","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's extremely helpful. Then lastly, Alan, you've kind of been very vocal about the weakness in yen and you're concerned about that from a competitive standpoint, but in U.S. we haven't seen it show up in pricing or competition yet. I'm just curious, are you seeing that in other regions and how important a topic do you think this is to really stay on top of going forward?","Alan R. Mulally","Well clearly, John, it's really an important topic not just for Ford but everybody around the world because it's just so important that the markets establish exchange rates and valuations. To answer your question specifically, we are seeing some actions primarily outside the United States. And as Bob mentioned in his comments, there have been some pretty clear indication from some of our competitors' leaders about the importance of using that in their business going forward. Now having said that I think the work that's going on internationally but especially associated with the U.S., associated with the TPP free trade agreement is really, really important because so many people now really appreciate the importance of free trade agreements that have the markets established in the currency. So I think we're going to see more attention on that subject and I think that's really positive because it's absolutely really important to free trade agreements going forward.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And lastly, just one follow-up to that, Alan. Are you seeing any change in the pricing strategy from some of your Japanese suppliers versus your North American suppliers and what their bidding levels are?","Alan R. Mulally","No, not substantially at this time.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Alan R. Mulally","Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks","John, before you run away I probably wish it were $5 billion but apparently it's only $2 billion to $2.5 billion for one basis point of change. So it's still material.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I got very excited and was about to run away, but that's still pretty good. But that's still pretty good. That's still a pretty good improvement. Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks","I have dreams and aspirations. Apparently that was not coming true.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys.","Alan R. Mulally","Thanks a lot, John.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson representing Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnson - Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning. Just to follow-up on the pension then a question on Europe. Certainly we understand because it's mechanical, the reduction in liabilities from discount rate. Yet at the same time part of your derisking strategy, as you flag, is to be in fixed income and maybe even move towards first income. A couple of questions. One, had you gone to a liability-driven investing strategy where you're attempting to match the duration of those fixed-income assets to that of your liabilities, and whether or not and if so did you pull back that duration to try to time the bond market? And regardless of that, just where is the fixed income part of your asset base performing? And what does that mean for the potential direction of the funding gap?","Robert L. Shanks","We're not going to provide any specific performance measurements around the asset returns that we've seen so far nor are we in terms of the specific number of related to the funded status but we have made really, really good progress in terms of moving towards the strategy of sort of an 80-20 fixed income versus growth asset mix. And as of the end of the half we were at 60%, so really making good progress to that objective. And as you said, Brian it is to match better the assets and the obligation so that when there are changes in discount rates and so forth we\u2019re able to reduce the volatility and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do and we\u2019re on path to do so.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Doesn\u2019t that delude some of the potential closing of the funding GAAP?","Mark Fields","No, because we\u2019re doing it progressively we\u2019re doing it sort of inline as we get more and more funded. We are progressively improving the amount or increasing the amount of fixed assets. So we\u2019re not moving too fast so that we can benefit from opportunities from growth assets, but that\u2019s part of the overall strategy and don\u2019t forget we are -- as we do that we become increasingly less exposed as discount rates change.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And then on Europe can you comment a bit on the sequential pricing environment. It appeared the week-end quarter-over-quarter, are you seeing, your order books are very full which would imply maybe a less of a need for discounting?","Mark Fields","What we\u2019re seeing is, on a sequential basis we were adverse in terms of net pricing. That was largely driven by the timing of some rental sales. We pulled back on the rental market, but we did have some -- the timing affected some of those sales which affected the quarter. And we also had some other sort of just timing issues if you will that impacted that. What we have seen is an increase in incentives at Ford in Europe, but it is much less than what our competitors have been doing. So, again it's part of the overall story of us pulling back from those unhealthy channels enabling us to get more per unit in terms of what we\u2019re selling.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","So were these the wholesale revenue booked upon return of the program car?","Mark Fields","I don\u2019t know. I think it was related more to just -- it was just related more to the daily rentals and the timing and there were just some deliveries that occurred in that -- in the second quarter that drove that performance along with some other \u2026","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","[Indiscernible] if it was deliveries or return of cars, so it sounds like [indiscernible] okay.","Mark Fields","Yeah, no \u2013 no it was the sales. Yeah.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Alan R. Mulally","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","For a minute I was thinking it was $5 billion for each one basis point, I was getting real excited there, but wow. So, a question on China; can you give us a capacity utilization number in China even if it's a rough one because given how much structural cost burden you\u2019re shouldering for the growth there versus your current level production, it is tough to get a sense and can you help us out?","Mark Fields","Yeah, Adam this is Mark.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi Mark.","Mark Fields","Obviously we don\u2019t give out specific numbers, but as you can imagine we are running our facilities pretty flat out there, and at the same time building new facilities. As you know in Asia Pacific in total we\u2019ve built about \u2013 we have either built or in a process of building 10 plants and seven of those are in China and three that we just announced. So we have four more to go and we\u2019re using them flat out. And to give you a sense of kind of what's going on in the market place our biggest challenge right now is meeting demand. It's a true retail pull not a wholesale push. But the demand pull from the dealers is very strong, that strength is across the regions, across the multi-tiered cities. What has also helped is our full lineup of SUVs now as customers are coming in for our wonderful new Kuga, they\u2019re seeing the Explorer, they\u2019re seeing our EcoSport. And as you can imagine the sales as a percentage of availabilities are very high. And it's having some residual other benefits as well as you know we\u2019re growing our dealer network there to support our growth in the Tier 2, 3, 4 and 5 cities so we\u2019re getting actually even better candidates for our dealers, and its also helping our recruitment efforts for our employees. So overall we\u2019re running as fast as we can there, doing it with quality and delivering those products to our customers.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, Mark, I appreciate that, and just a couple of follow-ups, any impact the Detroit bankruptcy you wanted to highlight or dismiss?","Mark Fields","No, I think the best initiative -- an interesting thing to look at as you know we all went through our own restructuring and it's a serene experience, it's something you never forget. It seems like it goes on for ever. But as you can see from the results that we have been announcing and that we\u2019re announcing in the past and that we\u2019re announcing today. When you work your way through it, when you come out the other end you\u2019re much healthier and it's just a much better -- a much better situation and we\u2019re confident that the government leaders of Detroit and the State will move forward and address the issues of the city, it could be healthy for Ford, healthy for suppliers, healthy for the State. It's not having any direct impact on Ford, but we\u2019re fully supportive and wish everyone the best and we\u2019ll participate to the extent that we can help. It's just going to be good when it's all said and done. And I think we\u2019re a good example of that ourselves. Didn\u2019t go through bankruptcy but we went through a horrible restructuring in terms of the experience. So we know what it's like and it's going to be good.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that. And my last question, I would normally ask about a months results but given the model your changeover is so substantial for not this year but mainly for the -- for many of your competitors as well. Any comment on how July is progressing in the United States? Thanks very much.","Mark Fields","Yeah, I mean it looks like the SAAR is running at a very healthy rate again, maybe it's around 16 million units including medium heavy\u2019s; we wouldn\u2019t say anything about our own performance but we\u2019ll talk about that in detail as usual at the beginning of August.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much.","Mark Fields","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Silver representing Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","Thanks very much for taking the question. In your comments you described cash flow has been substantially better for the year; would that simply reflect the changes in the automotive operating guidance or is there more to that and additionally can you provide some color on the timing differences in cash flow, suppose the charges have something to do with that. But are there any other issues like incentive accruals and such?","Mark Fields","Thanks, Matt for the question. Well, in part the change in guidance simply reflects what's already in the bank. We\u2019ve done $4 billion in the first half. We did $3.4 billion for the full-year last year. So clearly we\u2019re going to do substantially better in 2013 than we did in 2012, and they\u2019re acknowledging that. When you look at the details of it, clearly the stronger profits are helping. We are seeing favorable changes in working capital. And then in the quarter in particular we had very strong timing differences which is generally around marketing, warranty, our extended service programs, pension compensation those types of things where the difference between expense and cash are recognized in this category. So that\u2019s -- but I will just remind everyone we had 8\/10 negative in this category in the first quarter, so we\u2019ve kind of equalized that plus come out ahead by about 4\/10, so that\u2019s one of the contributors as well. But it's generally happening everywhere. The only area we\u2019ve got sort of a negative if you will within the cash flow which is a positive for the business is the net spending because of the investments for products and capacity and growth in the future, that\u2019s obviously adversely affecting the cash flow.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","Okay. The second question is on North America, and the results there have been quite strong. In the quarter you showed really nice volume improvement, mix has been pretty good, but it has on a year-over-year basis been just mathematically negative for the last two quarters, pricing has been positive but the gains have been declining. I guess, as I think about the second half my instinct would be that given the cadence of new product, there\u2019s more volume but also a negative mix of pricing in the second half. Is there any reason not to believe that pricing wouldn\u2019t be negative year-to-year in the second half?","Mark Fields","Well, as I said for the full-year we\u2019re expecting our pricing to be favorable in North America as well as for the total Company. And when you look at the individual quarters we\u2019ll have to wait and see where we come out, but we think that given the strength of our products that we\u2019ve got out there and the customer response to them that at least for the full-year that will be positive and now we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the individual quarters bring.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","Okay. Thank you very much.","Robert L. Shanks","Thank you, Matt.","Matt Silver \u2013 Guggenheim","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'd like to welcome questions from the media. (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Craig Trudell representing Bloomberg News. Please proceed.","Craig Trudell - Bloomberg News","Hi. Thanks. My question is related to the pension and sort of rising interest rate environment and you've said that you're seeing a material improvement on underfunded status. What sorts of things \u2013 does that improvement for us ought to do? Would you put more cash toward your products? Would you be able to boost the amount of cash you return to investors? What sorts of things would that free you up for?","Robert L. Shanks","Thanks, Craig. I think there's two things that come to mind when you think about the improvement in the funded status. One is the credit rating agencies look at the underfunded status and consider that as debt when they're looking at our ratings in the metrics to evaluate. So the improvement there is clearly a positive in terms of the strength of the balance sheet as viewed by the rating agencies and frankly as we look at ourselves, so that's a big positive. In addition, we have assumed \u2013 as you know, our derisking strategy is to get our global funded plans fully funded in the decade and so we have assumed there'd be a normalization over time of the discount rates which means an increase because they've been at historic low levels. So, this is simply what we have assumed in terms of the glide path. It's getting us to the point where we'll be able to have fully funded plans. We won't have to allocate as much capital to pensions as we have the last couple of years and certainly this year and that will give us the ability to take the cash that we're generating and invest it in other parts of the business that can support further growth and that's certainly what we have in mind.","Craig Trudell - Bloomberg News","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vipal Monga representing Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.","Vipal Monga - Wall Street Journal","Good morning, gentlemen. A question for you Bob. I just want to make sure I get the math right. The expectation for the lump sum payments by the end of 2013, is that 4.5 billion I'm assuming that if you're 2.7 billion right now and that's about 60% of the way, is that about the right way to think about it?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we're not providing a specific number because it obviously depends on the remaining participants who have the individual right of selection of whether they want to participate or not, but directionally probably what you're saying is correct, but we're not actually providing specific guidance on that.","Vipal Monga - Wall Street Journal","Okay. And then just in terms of the take-up rate or the percentage of people, how is that met expectations that you might have had?","Robert L. Shanks","Again that's something that we're not going to talk about until we're completely finished. The types of individuals who remain include term vested, so it's a different kind of group of employees that have yet to make a choice, so we'll have to wait and see because again, every person's different, probably every different category of employee retiree is different, so we'll have to wait and see. But we'll give you all the details when we're all done.","Vipal Monga - Wall Street Journal","Great. And just a last follow-up on that. Any consideration of doing things that \u2013 for example Verizon and GM in terms of doing an [annuitization] as well as you attempt to derisk the pension?","Robert L. Shanks","No, we have no plans to do that at this time.","Vipal Monga - Wall Street Journal","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Klayman representing Reuters. Please proceed.","Deepa Seetharaman - Thomson Reuters","Hi. This is actually Deepa Seetharaman. I just have two quick questions. So in the second quarter you settled about 1.5 billion of pension obligations related to the lump sum program of 2.7 overall. Why was the \u2013 why was the amount so high in the second quarter? Was it something special? Was this a particularly successful round? Why was more than half settled in this quarter?","Robert L. Shanks","It depends on the number of participants and a number of people that were involved in the second tranche programs. So again as I said, Deepa, it's very individual. We haven't said how many people have been participating in any particular tranche. We're about halfway through, so I think I can tell you that. But it really depends upon the concentration of the offers, who they are, how many people and so forth. It's been different tranche by tranche, so I wouldn't read anything into that. Based on the previous question, I think it's probably reasonable to assume we're about 60% of the way through in terms of obligation. Directionally you can probably figure out more or less where we'll end up when it's all done.","Deepa Seetharaman - Thomson Reuters","Okay. And then you guys talked about capacity constraints a lot in the first half of the year, do you have any sense as to how much more capacity you would have needed in the first half to absorb all the demand for the Fusion, Explorer and other vehicles in the U.S.?","Alan R. Mulally","Hi, Deepa. Clearly as we say we're getting a little tight on inventories on vehicles like Fusion, and as you know we're taking some actions around that. So really couldn't put an amount to it, because we probably leave a few sales on the table, probably, but we're rectifying that as we go into the second half of the year as you know, as we put the third crew on at Kansas City for F-Series and then of course launching the Flat Rock Assembly Plant which will bring on a whole another tranche of Fusions to meet the surging customer demand that's out there. So we're in the process of addressing that.","Deepa Seetharaman - Thomson Reuters","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan R. Mulally","Thanks, Deepa.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Bomey representing Detroit Free Press. Please proceed.","Nathan Bomey - Detroit Free Press","Hi, guys. I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on where the market share came from in China. Do you feel like you were stealing customers away from \u2013 was it the Japanese? Are they still losing market share because of some of the issues there or are you taking it from the domestic manufacturers? Where did you see it coming from?","Robert L. Shanks","As you probably know, most of the buyers in the China are still first-time buyers. So that's one of the great things about our investments here is we're going after first-time buyers. We don't have to steal them, if you will, which is really hard. So first-time buyers and it's coming from all the new products that we'd launched. In this particular quarter it was the Escape, it was the Kuga, the Focus is still doing very, very well. The refreshed Fiesta, EcoSport I don't know if I've mentioned that. But we're expanding the lineups so quickly and I think as Mark mentioned earlier or maybe Alan, I can't remember who said it, SUVs or utilities are really popular now everywhere in the world and China's no exception. And so with the introduction of Explorer, EcoSport and Kuga which is Escape Europe, the market has really responded very, very strongly and driving the share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey representing Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","Hi. Good morning. Alan, I was hoping you could answer this question which is if you had to figure out one thing that's driving your strong revenue growth around the world, can you pin it to your global product plans so that you're able to put out all these new products around the world at the same time, is that kind of the secret to how you can get 15% revenue growth in an environment where I don't think that most auto companies are anywhere close to that level of revenue growth?","Alan R. Mulally","Sure, Mike, and good morning to you. I think absolutely it's grounded in the foundation that we all put together nearly seven years ago and that was to all the customers around the world with the full family of best-in-class vehicles. And then of course clearly focus on the Ford brand and then Lincoln. And I think probably \u2013 it's kind of like what Jim Farley said \u2013 I know you remember this well that you can't build your reputation by telling people what you're going to do. So we really focus on developing world class products in every market segment and let those then lead the brand and the response has been absolutely incredible. With every new product we've watched the favorable opinion, we watched the coverage and the brand itself, Ford itself. And so I think it's a combination of these great products, a complete family of products and also our belief to introduce those products very quickly because based on our One Ford Plan, we have all those top hats off the different core platforms and we now introduced those as are needed and wanted around the world very quickly and I think that the data that we show today about the new market segment introductions in China, plus the refresh, just is a terrific proof point about that, because who\u2019d ever thought we could be touching almost every market segments within a couple of years. So, I think absolutely the Ford \u2013 One Ford Plan and the product plan is a \u2013 absolutely key to that.","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","Thank you so much.","Alan R. Mulally","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel representing Detroit News. Please proceed.","Karl Henkel - The Detroit News","Good morning. Just had a quick question. If you look at the results from this quarter, obviously Europe it seems that things are at least becoming little more certain and clear, obviously very profitable and APA. Do you get the feeling that at this point, couple of years now you could look back at, at about this timeframe in 2013 and say that this is where all four major regions were locked and loaded and ready to go and can kind of all, I guess, sort of coalesce and become profitable on a more even basis moving into the future.","Robert L. Shanks","Karl, its Bob. I think it\u2019s a very, very important point that you\u2019re raising. Obviously, our plan is for all parts of the Company to contribute appropriately to the bottom line, and we\u2019re investing heavily in Asia Pacific and you\u2019re starting to see the green shoots come through there. In the case of South America, we\u2019ve got them back into the black. They had been profitable for nine years in a row until the first quarter. So they\u2019re back in the black and continue to work hard to push them further into the black over time, particularly as we expand the product lineup down there with ONE Ford products. And I think Europe is such an important story, it\u2019s a major restructuring, its an environment that is not a great environment. But we clearly are on a very good track to deliver the transformation plan that we laid out in October last year, its not just for Western Europe, but we\u2019re growing in Eastern Europe or we\u2019ve had a very robust activity in Russia with our partner Sollers is there. So, I think we feel very good about that and the thing its kind of interesting about what happened in the quarter, which is so exciting for us is that with the profitability that we saw in Asia Pacific which was quite meaningful and return to profitability in South America, combined with a lower loss and Europe we actually combined in those three regions effectively delivered about a breakeven, and I think in the first quarter that was a loss of over $600 million. So it just demonstrates the power of what happened when we\u2019re able to get that part of the business contributing much more positively because with the strength of North America, the strong solid profits from Ford Credit and then to get that part of the business contributing, its just kind of \u2013 its going to be a dynamo and very, very excited about what we saw in terms of progress there in this particular quarter.","Karl Henkel - The Detroit News","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to give the call back to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks.","George Sharp","Thank you, Katrina. Well, thanks everyone. That concludes today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to George Sharp, executive director, investor relations. Please proceed. Thank you. ","George Sharp"," ","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our third quarter 2013 financial results.","Presenting today are Alan Mulally, president and CEO of Ford, who is linking in from our Asia Pacific Africa headquarters in Shanghai, China and Bob Shanks, CFO. Also participating are Mark Fields, chief operating officer; Stuart Rowley, corporate controller; Neil Schloss, corporate treasurer; Paul Andonian, director of accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Now, copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on our investor and media website.

Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings.","With that, I would like to turn the presentation over to Alan.","Alan Mulally","Thank you, George, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our One Ford plan. Let\u2019s turn to the first slide.","Our One Ford plan shown here is the foundation for everything we do. Across the Ford enterprise, we continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at the current demand and the changing model mix to accelerate development of new products our customers want and value, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet, and work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets.","Our commitment remains to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles, small, medium, and large cars, utilities, and trucks, delivering profitable growth for all. We continued to make good progress towards this goal in the third quarter, which we will now review starting on slide two, please.","The company earned a record third quarter operating profit at $2.6 billion, our 17th consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was also a third quarter record, and at quarter end, liquidity was very strong. The top line grew compared with last year, with market share gains in all regions.","This was our fourth consecutive quarter of volume and revenue growth. The company\u2019s pretax profit was driven by our best-ever third quarter results for the automotive sector. This reflects continuing strong results in North America and combined profit for the region outside of North America for the first time since second quarter 2011.","Within these results, Asia Pacific and Africa earned a record third quarter profit. South America was profitable, and Europe substantially reduced its loss compared with last year and the second quarter. Ford Credit also contributed solid results.","Based on our year to date results, we are improving our full year financial guidance. We now expect total company pretax profit to be higher than 2012, improved from our prior guidance of equal to or higher than 2012. We also now expect automotive operating margin to be higher than last year rather than about equal. ","Before turning to the financial details, let\u2019s recap several other achievements from the third quarter. As shown on slide three, we launched a number of products around the globe in the quarter, including the Fiesta ST in the U.S., Cargo Extra Heavy Duty and the Fusion Hybrid in Brazil, Focus in Argentina, Focus Electric in Europe, and the Mondeo in China.","In Europe, we further detailed our product acceleration plans. We now plan to introduce at least 25 new vehicles within the five-year period beginning September of 2012. This is up from our previously announced plan to introduce at least 15 new vehicles over the same period. ","Among the new products coming to Europe and other markets is the Transit Connect. It was recently named the 2014 International Van of the Year, marking the second consecutive year Ford won this award. ","In Germany, we revealed the S-Max and the Mondeo Vignale concepts, and we also announced plans to increase production of our award-winning one liter EcoBoost engine in our Cologne plant to meet strong customer demand. ","In Sydney, we announced future plans for Ford of Australia, including 11 global vehicles by 2017. In India, we announced our intention to develop the country as a global production hub, exporting to more than 50 markets around the world. In August, we shared a comprehensive capital strategy with investors. Details of our strategy are available on our website.","And finally, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P. With this upgrade, the four major rating agencies that rate us now report Ford and Ford Credit as investment grade with a stable outlook.","Bob Shanks will now take us through the details of our financial performance in the quarter. Bob?","Robert Shanks","Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. Third quarter wholesale volume was 1.5 million units, up 216,000 units or 16% from a year ago, and revenue at $36 billion was up $3.9 billion or 12%. ","Pretax profit was $2.6 billion, excluding special items, $426 million higher than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.45 were $0.05 higher. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges of $498 million was $1.3 billion. This was $359 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.31 a share, down $0.10.","Special items in the third quarter included $250 million for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe, to support our transformation plan, and $145 million associated with our U.S. lump sum payout program as part of our pension derisking strategy. ","We settled about $700 million of pension obligations in the quarter and $3.4 billion since the program began. The program is now about 80% complete and will conclude by year-end. You can find additional detail on the special items in Appendix 3. ","Automotive operating related cash flow was $1.6 billion, a third quarter record, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of positive performance. Automotive gross cash was $26.1 billion, exceeding debt by $10.3 billion.","Our third quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown, was about 33%. We now expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be less than 30%, compared with 32% last year. This reflects a year to date tax rate of about 31% and a fourth quarter reduction in Ford Credit\u2019s tax liability.","In the first nine months, vehicle wholesales increased by 14% from a year ago and revenue increased by 12%. Pretax operating profit, excluding special items, was $7.3 billion, a $1 billion improvement. Net income was $4.1 billion. This was $49 million higher.","As shown on slide five, both of our sectors, automotive and financial services, contributed to the company\u2019s third quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion. The memo below the charge shows that profit improved $426 million compared to 2012, more than explained by higher automotive sector results, driven by regions outside of North America.","Compared with second quarter 2013, total company pretax profit improved slightly, again driven by the automotive sector. Within financial services, Ford Credit\u2019s results were higher in the third quarter than last year, while other financial services was lower. The third quarter loss was $64 million for other financial services, and this primarily reflects charges related to the sale of a portfolio of financed receivables that was not included in our sale of the Volvo auto business in 2010.","The key market factors and financial metrics for our total automotive business are shown on slide six. As previously mentioned, the record third quarter profit reflects continued strong performance in North America and a combined profit from the regions outside North America, including the record third quarter result in Asia Pacific Africa.","Total automotive third quarter wholesale volume and revenue were both up strongly from a year ago. The higher volume reflects higher market share in all regions, improved industry volume in all regions except South America, and favorable changes in dealer stocks in all regions.","The growth in revenue primarily reflects the higher volume, as well as the net pricing gains in all regions. Operating margin of 7% was 0.7 of a percentage point better than a year ago, and our best quarterly margin since second quarter 2011.","Automotive pretax profit was up $451 million, more than explained by favorable market factors. As shown in the memo below the chart, first nine months volume and revenue were higher than a year ago by 14% and 13% respectively. ","Operating margin, at 6.2%, and total automotive pretax profit, at $6 billion, improved as well. The better results primarily reflect improved market factors across all regions, offset partially by higher cost as well as unfavorable exchange, primarily in South America.","On slide seven, we show the factors that contributed to the $500 million improvement in total automotive third quarter pretax profit. Favorable market factors, volume, mix, and net pricing across all regions were offset partially by higher costs and unfavorable exchange. ","The cost increases mainly reflect investments in higher volume, like growth and new products, not only for this year but also the future, as well as restructuring related cost in Europe, higher OPEB expense in North America, and higher pension expense in Europe. ","As shown in the memo, pretax profit was $200 million higher than the second quarter, more than explained by lower cost and higher net pricing, offset partially by lower volume due to seasonal plant summer shutdowns in both North America and Europe. You can find more details on the quarter to quarter change in Appendix 8.","Our third quarter pretax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown on slide eight. All regions were profitable except Europe, and all regions improved compared with a year ago, except North America, which was about the same. ","Other automotive reflects net interest expense, offset partially by a favorable fair market value adjustment of our investment in Mazda. For the full year, we now expect automotive net interest expense to be at the lower end of our prior guidance of $800 million to $850 million. ","Now we\u2019ll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector, starting here on slide nine with North America. North America continued to perform very well, achieving a pretax profit of $2 billion or more and an operating margin of 10% or more for the sixth time out of the last seven quarters. ","In the third quarter, this was driven by a strong industry and a robust full-size pickup segment, our strong product lineup, U.S. market share growth, continued discipline in matching production to real demand, and a lean cost structure, even as we invest more in product and capacity for future growth.","As you can see in the two graphs on the left, North America continued to grow strongly in the third quarter. Wholesale volume and revenue increased from a year ago by 13% and 12% respectively. The volume improvement mainly reflects higher U.S. industry sales, increasing from SAR of 14.8 million to 16.1 million units, favorable changes in dealer stocks, and higher U.S. market share. The higher volume drove the revenue increase.","North America\u2019s operating margin, at 10.6%, was lower than last year, due primarily to cost increases, mainly investment and new products and growth, as well as the non-repeat of a couple of favorable items that we\u2019ve previously disclosed.","Pretax profit was $2.3 billion, about equal to last year\u2019s record profit. As shown in the memo below the chart, North America\u2019s operating margin for the first nine months was 10.7%, 0.5 of a percentage point lower than a year ago, while pretax profit was $7 billion, up about $600 million. Volume and revenue both improved 15% compared with 2012. ","On slide 10, we show the factors that contributed to North America\u2019s third quarter pretax profit being unchanged from last year. Favorable market factors were offset for the most part by higher costs, including investment in new products. As shown in the memo, pretax profit also was unchanged compared with the second quarter.","Ford\u2019s U.S. market share trends are shown on slide 11. Total U.S. market share and retail share of the retail industry both improved compared with a year ago. Both share metrics, however, were down compared with the prior quarter. Starting with the left chart, our total U.S. market share was 14.9%, up 0.1 of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by F-Series.","Our share was down 1.6 percentage points through second quarter, explained primarily by lower Ford share of the fleet business, as well as lower fleet mix of the total industry, which is typical for the third quarter. ","As shown on the right chart, our retail market share of the retail industry was 13.3%, up 0.6 of a percentage point from last year, reflecting F-Series, Escape, and C-Max. Our retail market share was down 0.4 of a percentage point from second quarter, reflecting primarily lower share of the small car segment and lower inventory availability of Escape. ","We continue to have success with what we call the super segment vehicles. This is small vehicles and small to midsized cars, particularly on the coasts. Our super segment market share was up 0.5 percentage point in the quarter, compared to last year, with the coastal regions contributing almost all the improvement.","Our full year guidance for North America remains unchanged. We continue to expect higher pretax profit compared with 2012, and an operating margin of about 10%.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 12 and review South America. In South America, we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product lineup while progressively replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. Our new products continue to perform very well. Customer response to the Ranger pickup and refreshed Fiesta remains strong, while EchoSport and Fusion continue to be segment leaders.","In the third quarter, wholesale volume and revenue increased strongly from a year ago, with both up 22%. The higher volume reflects increased market share and favorable changes in dealer stocks. The higher market share, 8.4% improving to 9.5%, is more than explained by EchoSport, Ranger, and Fiesta. ","South America\u2019s revenue growth was driven by the higher volume and net pricing gains, offset partially by unfavorable exchange. Operating margin was 5.6% and pretax profit was $159 million. The year over year improvement in both metrics is more than explained by favorable market factors. As shown in the memo below the chart, volume, revenue, operating margin, and profit all improved in the first nine months compared with the same period last year. ","On slide 13, we show the factors driving the $150 million increase in South America\u2019s third quarter pretax results. Market factors more than explained the improvement, with our new products having a favorable impact on volume and mix. ","The higher net pricing mainly reflects efforts to recover the adverse effects of high local inflation and weaker local currencies, along with pricing associated with our new products. As shown in the memo, pretax results were about the same as second quarter.","The overall environment in South America remains uncertain, but given the performance of our business in the first nine months, we now expect to be about breakeven to profitable for the full year. This compares to our prior guidance of about breakeven.","Let\u2019s turn now to Europe, beginning on slide 14. In the third quarter, we remained very much on track in executing our Europe transformation plan. Europe\u2019s third quarter wholesale volume and revenue improved from a year ago by 5% and 12% respectively. This is the second consecutive quarter of year over year top line growth.","The volume increase reflects higher industry sales, lower dealer stock reductions than a year ago, and higher market share. Europe\u2019s market share improved 0.2 of a percentage point, from 7.8% to 8%. The increase in Europe\u2019s revenue mainly reflects the higher volume.","Europe\u2019s operating margin was a negative 3.5% and the pretax loss was $228 million, both substantially improved from last year, despite restructuring costs associated with our transformation plan. So far, we\u2019ve seen our business in Europe improve sequentially in each quarter this year.","As shown in the memo below the chart, Europe\u2019s first nine months operating margin was negative 5%, and the pretax loss was $1 billion, both about the same as a year ago, despite about $400 million of restructuring costs and lower industry volume. Volume and revenue were both up slightly from a year ago.","Slide 15 shows the factors that contributed to the $240 million improvement in Europe\u2019s third quarter pretax results from a year ago. All factors were favorable, with the exception of other costs, which is more than explained by restructuring cost, shown in the memo to the right. Personnel separation related costs, which were significant once again this quarter, are captured in special items.","As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results improved $120 million compared with second quarter. All factors were favorable, except volume and mix, which reflects mainly lower volume due to Europe\u2019s seasonal plant shutdowns for summer holidays.","Europe market share trends are shown on slide 16. Total market share and retail share of the retail passenger car industry improved from a year ago, but were down slightly from the prior quarter. Starting with the left chart, our total market share for the 19 European markets that we track was 8%, up 0.2 of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by strong sales of B-Max. The share was down 0.1 of a percentage point for the second quarter.","As shown in the right chart, our passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 8.3% in the third quarter. That was up 1.3 percentage points from the same period last year. This improvement was underpinned by strong retail performance of B-Max, Fiesta, and Focus. The share was down 0.1 of a percentage point from the second quarter.","For the full year, we now expect our loss in Europe to be less than 2012. This is an improvement from our prior guidance of a loss about the same as a year ago, reflecting progress the company is making on our European transformation plans.","Let\u2019s now review Asia Pacific Africa, on slide 17. Our strategy in Asia Pacific Africa is to grow aggressively with an expanding portfolio of global One Ford products, tailored for the region, with manufacturing hubs in China, India, and ASEAN. Implementation of this strategy continues to gain momentum. ","As shown on the left, third quarter wholesale volume was up 35% and net revenue, which excludes our China joint ventures, grew 7%. The higher volume reflects mainly improved market share, with the higher industry volume and the favorable changes in dealer stocks also contributing.","Third quarter market share in the region was 3.7%, 0.6 of a percentage point higher than a year ago, and a quarter record. The improvement was driven by China, which isn\u2019t shown, where our market share improved 0.8 of a percentage point to equal last quarter\u2019s record of 4.3%, reflecting mainly strong sales of Kuga, EchoSport, and Focus. Asia Pacific Africa\u2019s higher revenue primarily reflects favorable volume and mix. ","Operating margin was 4.4%, and pretax profit was $126 million, both improved from last year due to favorable market factors. This was the region\u2019s fifth consecutive quarterly profit. As shown in the memo below the chart, Asia Pacific Africa first nine months volume, revenue, operating margin, and profit all improved from a year ago.","The $81 million improvement from a year ago in Asia Pacific Africa\u2019s third quarter pretax results is explained on slide 18. As we\u2019ve seen in past quarters, top line related factors were favorable, offset partially by higher costs as we continue to invest for future growth. We also benefited from higher royalties from our joint ventures and an insurance recovery, both included in other.","As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific Africa pretax results were $51 million lower than the second quarter, more than explained by unfavorable volume and mix. Our guidance for Asia Pacific Africa is unchanged. We continue to expect to be profitable for the full year.","Turning now to Ford Credit on slide 19, we\u2019re explaining the $34 million increase in third quarter pretax results compared with a year ago. The increase is more than explained by higher volume in North America. ","The drivers of higher volume were an increase in leasing, reflecting changes in Ford\u2019s marketing programs, as well as higher nonconsumer finance receivables due to higher dealer stocks. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit\u2019s pretax results were $27 million lower than the second quarter. ","Ford Credit remains key to our global growth strategy of providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and producing solid profits and distribution. ","For the full year, Ford Credit continues to expect pretax profit to be about equal to 2012, but we now expect year-end managed receivables of about $100 billion, which is within our prior range of $97 billion to $102 billion, and distributions of about $400 million, which is up $200 million from what was previously planned, reflecting a fourth quarter reduction in Ford Credit\u2019s tax liability. ","Next, on slide 20, as to our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow, automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $26.1 billion, an increase of $400 million from the end of the second quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $1.6 billion, more than explained by automotive profits.","During the quarter, we contributed $1.1 billion to our global funded pension plans, which included about $700 million of discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plans, all part of our pension derisking strategy.","Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $400 million, and we continued our compensation related share repurchase program. ","In the first nine months, our operating related cash flow was $5.6 billion, and gross cash improved $1.8 billion. We continue to expect automotive operating related cash flow to be substantially higher than last year.","Slide 21 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, equal to second quarter. We ended the quarter with net cash of $10.3 billion and automotive liquidity of $37.5 billion. ","This now concludes our review of the financial details of our third quarter earnings. Now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Alan, who\u2019s going to take us through our outlook for the business environment as well as our update of 2013 planning assumptions and key metrics. Alan? ","Alan Mulally","Thank you, Bob. Slide 22 summarizes our view of the business environment. Overall, our outlook has not changed substantially. We project 2013 global economic growth to be around 2%, and global industry sales to be about 84 million units this year. ","U.S. economic growth is projected to be in the 1.5% to 2% range, with industry sales supported by continued improvement in the housing sector and replacement demand as a result of the older age of vehicles on the road. Fiscal policy uncertainty poses a risk as negotiations on the debt ceiling and funding government operations have now been pushed out to the first quarter of 2014.","In South America, Brazil\u2019s economy is relatively weak, with below-trend growth, while in Argentina and Venezuela there\u2019s escalated risk, as both economies are weak, with unclear economic policy directions. ","The euro area\u2019s economic and industry conditions have begun to stabilize, and are consistent with a modest recovery that could occur in the near term. The European Central Bank has committed to keep interest rates low for an extended period.","In Asia Pacific and Africa, incoming economic indicators for China suggest stabilization, with growth in the 7.5% range this year. Growth in India, on the other hand, is below its full potential, due partially to elevated inflation, volatile currency, and high interest rates.","Overall, despite challenges, we expect global economic growth to continue for the remainder of this year. Our guidance for 2013 is detailed here on slide 23. We now expect full year industry volume of about 15.9 million units in the U.S., about 13.6 million units in Europe, and about 21.7 million units in China. ","We project our full year market share to improve compared with 2012 in the U.S. and China, but to be about equal to last year in Europe. We continue to expect our retail share of the retail passenger car market in Europe to improve. ","Our total company third quarter production volume, shown in Appendix 5, was about 1.5 million units, 187,000 units higher than a year ago, reflecting higher volumes in all regions. We expect total company fourth quarter production volume to be about 1.6 million units, 102,000 units higher than a year ago. This includes a reduction of 15,000 units from our prior guidance for North America.","The outlook for quality remains mixed. In terms of our financial performance, we now expect total company pretax profit and automotive operating margin both to be higher than 2012. We continue to expect automotive operating related cash flow to be substantially higher than 2012, including capital spending of about $6.5 billion to support our industry leading product refresh rates, the expansion and global deployment of our portfolio, and capacity actions. This compares to our prior capital spending guidance of about $7 billion.","2013 is on track to be another strong year for the Ford Motor Company as we continue to work toward our mid-decade outlook and deliver profitable growth for all.","In closing, our One Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, a comprehensive strategy, and relentless implementation. As the results we announced today made clear, our One Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world. We are absolutely focused on great products, creating a stronger business, and contributing to a better world. ","We achieved record results in the third quarter, and we continue to expect strong results for the full year. This includes continued strong results from North America; South American results of about breakeven to profitability as we continue to introduce new global products to support product led growth over the remainder of the year, even as we work to adjust to an uncertain environment in the region; continued successful execution of our transformation plan for Europe, which is proceeding very well as we work towards returning to profitability by mid decade; strong investment for long term success in Asia Pacific and Africa, which already is being reflected in improved revenue, market share, and financial results; and consistent performance from our valued Ford Credit operation, which delivers world-class customer service and solid bottom line results. ","Now we would be pleased to take your questions. George? ","George Sharp"," ","Thanks, Alan. Now we\u2019ll open the lines up for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. In order to allow as many questions as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief. Operator, can we have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] We have our first question from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. ","Colin Langan - UBS","Alan, can you comment on the media reports that you\u2019re considering leaving for Microsoft or another position? Are you still committed to staying through the end of 2014?","Alan Mulally ","Yes, I\u2019d be pleased to. There\u2019s nothing that has changed about our plan that we announced last November, and I\u2019m clearly excited and honored to continue to serve Ford.","Colin Langan - UBS ","And any color on Europe in the quarter? Is there any sort of one-time benefit, or should we kind of consider this from a cost basis a good benchmark going forward? With Q3 volume is ticking up just a bit, should Q4 start ticking up, or is there something unique in Q3 that kind of helped the quarter out? ","Robert Shanks","No, there\u2019s nothing material that\u2019s going on in the results. It\u2019s very clean, as you saw. When we looked at what was happening compared to last year, and even versus the second quarter, putting aside the volume effect, because of the shutdowns on a quarter to quarter basis, everything is looking positive for growing the business. ","We\u2019re starting to see revenue, transaction prices, tick up a little bit. We\u2019re holding the line on incentives. The team\u2019s doing a great job on cost. We got a bit of good news on exchange. The plant closures are going very, very well. Of course the U.K. is closed, and the team is now working to kind of remap the footprint and making the investments to do that going forward. ","So I think the team\u2019s just doing a great, great job across the board, and you\u2019re seeing the evidence of that in the results. ","Colin Langan - UBS ","I think in the past you\u2019ve commented that utilization once [unintelligible] is closed, would be in the mid-80%. You\u2019re closer to, I think, almost 100% in North America. How do you think about capacity in Europe longer term? Would you consider additional actions there to get you closer to where you are, similar to North America?","Robert Shanks ","Well, as you know, we always manage the business everywhere to match production with demand, and if and when we think we need to take action, whether that\u2019s to increase capacity or to address capacity, sort of structural capacity, excess capacity, we\u2019ll do that. We\u2019ve done that in the case of Europe to the degree we thought was appropriate, and in Europe, and in any part of the world, if we see the need to do anything based on how things progress or change in the future we\u2019ll do that. ","But we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve done in Europe and what we\u2019ve announced, and as I said, the implementation of that\u2019s going smoothly, so we feel very good about where we stand, obviously in an environment of excess capacity, because that hasn\u2019t really materially changed, although some other competitors have taken a few actions. But in terms of what we\u2019ve done, we feel very comfortable with where we\u2019re at. ","Colin Langan - UBS ","And if I could just slip one more in, cash flow year to date seems extremely strong. It\u2019s almost at a $7.5 billion annualized base here. Is there anything unique this year that\u2019s driving cash flow maybe a bit higher than a normalized rate? Or any color on that?","Robert Shanks ","No, nothing unique. You\u2019re just seeing the strength of the business flow through. The only thing I probably would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention is we have had some favorable timing effects. And part of that was we had some unfavorable effects towards the end of last year. I think we had a little bit of issues last year also with working capital, some of which is reversing out this year. So that\u2019s probably helping us to some extent, in the absolutes this year, but really for the most part what you\u2019re seeing is just the strength of the business flowing through into the cash flow.","Operator","We have our next question from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just first on slide 9 and 10, and looking at North America, as we look at an 85,000 unit increase in volumes, and $2.2 billion higher in revenue, it\u2019s kind of curious that we wouldn\u2019t see at least a flat line or a slight expansion of operating margins in pretax earnings. And I can understand the [walk] that you\u2019re showing on slide 10, but is there something going on here as far as product development behind the scenes for big launches next year that might be weighing down these results in somewhat of an unusual fashion? Because it just seems like you should be putting up slightly better results with $2.2 billion in revenue in North America.","Robert Shanks ","No, I don\u2019t think so, but let\u2019s just go through it and [peel] it back a bit. In terms of the cost, and you can see that on slide 10, you are seeing higher manufacturing costs. That\u2019s largely, if not entirely, associated with volume and capacity that we\u2019ve put in place relative to where we were last year. We are investing more in engineering, but that\u2019s across the business as we continue to invest for further growth right across the board, around the world. ","The only other thing I would mention within the cost, and we talked about that earlier this year, I might have mentioned it in the second quarter as well, in North America you\u2019ve got two other things, they\u2019re not cash related, that are going on. ","One of them is that we had the plan amendments to our OPEB for our healthcare program back in \u201905 that gave us $2.5 billion of savings. That was amortized over the life of the remaining participants that were subject to those plans. That largely, if not entirely, ran off last year, so that\u2019s giving us headwinds this year. It\u2019s not cash, but it\u2019s giving us headwinds and shows up in cost. And very, very similarly, we had a fixed asset impairment in North America in \u201908 that again was amortized over the remaining life of the assets affected, and that was basically ran out for the most part last year, so that\u2019s in the numbers as well. ","We also have higher compensation related cost, and that\u2019s simply due to the fact that we\u2019re making more money, and so for example in terms of our hourly profit sharing in the U.S., we\u2019re accruing more for that. ","And the other thing I would mention is mix. We do have adverse mix effects in the quarter, which is good, because what it means is that we\u2019re growing the business, particularly in the super segments, which have lower margins on average than, for example, our trucks and our larger utility vehicles. So that just is broadening our base, and that\u2019s actually showing up in terms of our super segment share, which is growing in an absolute sense, but particularly on the coasts, which I mentioned.","So I think those are the factors probably that are giving you the issues that you\u2019re trying to sort out through the numbers. But it\u2019s still a fabulous result in terms of the margin, at 10.6%.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just a second question, as we look at the European results, and I think it\u2019s on slide 15, and you\u2019re getting closer and closer to breakeven, particularly when we exclude the restructuring cost, which at some point, I would imagine, in the future, fade. Is there the expectation that you might be able to get closer to breakeven before the sort of generally expected view of 2015? ","And as we look at 2014, when do the benefits of the Genk closure ultimately roll in? Will we see those in late \u201914, or will they really just not show up until 2015? So, first, you really seem to be making a lot of great progress in Europe. It seems like you might be able to get back to breakeven before you even close Genk, and just trying to understand when the Genk benefits roll in.","Robert Shanks ","That\u2019s a very good question, particularly given the 50% plus improvement in the loss versus last year. We obviously are doing a bit better than what we had expected, because we guided at the beginning of the year that our loss would be about the same as a year ago, and now we\u2019re improving that, so the team is actually doing a better job even that what we had expected in terms of driving forward this transformation plan. ","I wouldn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. I think this still leaves us firmly on track, maybe more firmly on track, to a profit. Not breakeven, but a profit by 2015. So we\u2019re feeling even better about that.","Genk itself doesn\u2019t close until the end of \u201914, and so you won\u2019t see the full benefits of the Genk closure flow through until after that. So that would be in \u201915 and beyond. But I think clearly the team\u2019s doing a wonderful job, the progress we\u2019re making is very good, and as you noted, we have substantial restructuring charges in our numbers. We also didn\u2019t impair any assets and things of that sort. So we\u2019ve got very, very strong results, even with all that, and feel very confident about the direction the business is heading there.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And just simply on the Ford Credit, the receivables for Volvo that were a $64 million loss in the quarter, when do those completely roll out of the results? Is this kind of the end of that? I\u2019m just trying to understand how we can think about maybe Ford Motor Credit just on an ongoing basis, without that noise.","Mike Seneski","Those receivables are actually held in other FSG. There was an entity that had about $1.4 billion. About $500 million or $600 million or so was actually sold to a third party. There\u2019s about $100 million left on the books, and those will sell in tranches and be gone by the end of this year. The other amount, which was related to the Swiss entity, which is mostly Ford assets, we actually transferred to FCE, and those will be on the books as we continue to grow that business.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","So that $64 million number should diminish quite dramatically in the coming quarters?","Mike Seneski ","Yeah, that\u2019s a one-timer. Going forward, we would expect other FSG to just reflect the small loss each quarter. ","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And then lastly, Alan, just U.S. sales have been incredibly strong. Obviously there\u2019s some noise around some timing and potential weakness in the September numbers. But given where the economy is in general, auto sales are running way ahead of where you would expect relative to everything else that\u2019s going on in the economy. ","Obviously a lot of that has to do with replacement demand, but are you kind of of the view, without putting a fine point on numbers, that as the economy finally picks up, hopefully in the coming quarters, or even in the next year or two, that we really could see a sales level that\u2019s way above and beyond what we\u2019re looking at right now, and that we\u2019re just looking at replacement right now, but when we get some real discretionary demand coming into the market that we really could have another step function improvement in auto sales, without putting an exact number on it. I\u2019m just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the U.S. market and how you\u2019re planning going forward.","Alan Mulally ","I think you really hit the main elements that we\u2019re looking at, really kind of starting with the fundamentals of the recovery, especially the housing and the pent up demand. Of course as we start to satisfy that pent up demand over this next couple of years, it will come down to more of a normal growth rate based on demographics and discretionary income, and we think that it\u2019s going to be in the 16 million to 17 million range. ","I think the peaks that we\u2019ve seen in the past that were fueled by a lot of factors as you know, we don\u2019t expect to see. And I think that nice, steady rate that reflects those fundamentals would be welcome by all. And I think that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at that right now. ","Operator","We have our next question from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan ","We\u2019ve seen a couple of very good quarters now in a row from the international operations while North America has remained strong. And I think there were some comments out this morning, maybe by Bob, that Europe has \u201cturned the corner.\u201d So this would seem to suggest that your profitability has structurally improved here. I remember that being one of the preconditions for increasing the dividend, when you find yourself with capital in excess of the target, as you outlined in August. ","So I realize that the dividend is a board decision, but I wonder if there\u2019s anything you can say there. Or, if not, if you could just comment on whether you think your profitability has now structurally improved relative to a couple of quarters ago. ","Robert Shanks ","You hit a lot of interesting points there, if I can sort through them. I did not say that we\u2019ve turned a corner. I think I\u2019ve said that we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. I think I may have gotten a question earlier today about did we think the environment in Europe, as well as industry sales, may have turned a corner, and I think that is our point of view. ","As we look at economic leading indicators, as we look at various ways of parsing the industry and run rate of [SARS] and so forth, it seems to us that we clearly have stabilized and we\u2019re seeing signs that we should start to see very, very modest growth in the near term. So we\u2019re feeling much more positive about that than where we\u2019ve been the last year or year and a half.","In terms of our own business, you hit on a really important strategic point for Ford, which is to sustain the very strong performance of North America, which has been ongoing for quite a number of quarters, not just the last couple. But continue that, and then to get the rest of the automotive business up to the point where it\u2019s pulling its fair share of the business. ","And we\u2019re far from that. We\u2019re very confident about getting there, but we clearly see that as a huge opportunity for us. In fact, it\u2019s interesting, when you look at the margin, which, as I said, is the best since the second quarter of \u201911, and the improvement on a year over year basis, that is all explained by the operations outside of North America. So you can see the power and the opportunity that we have as these businesses continue to gain traction and move forward.","Now, relative to the dividend, what we\u2019ve said on the dividend is our strategy is to continue to grow the dividend as earnings grow, as liquidity permits, but only up to a level that we think is sustainable over an economic cycle. And then if we have excess cash, above and beyond that level, and we don\u2019t think we can invest that for more growth in the business, then we will be open to thinking about things like a special dividend and potentially more substantive share buyback programs. ","But we\u2019re a long ways from that, because as we\u2019ve talked about in New York at the JPMorgan conference, we still have to get our automotive debt down to about $10 billion by mid-decade. We still have quite a bit of investment ahead of us in terms of our global funded pension plans to get them fully funded. And then we have the opportunity to address the convertible that\u2019s outstanding in 2014. ","And so all of those things are ahead of us, plus continued investment in the business in terms of growth and so forth, and new products. So I think we\u2019re a bit away from having to worry about what to do with excess capital. But, you know, we feel good about where we are, and definitely if have the opportunity, in the interim, to improve our dividend, we certainly will, but we certainly are not talking about anything like that today.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan ","Maybe just a question on Asia. I\u2019m curious if you could comment on how the different regions or countries within the Asia Pacific and Africa region are doing. Obviously I imagine China\u2019s probably the biggest contributor to your improvement given your sales are up so much there, but you\u2019ve also been making some pretty sizable investments in Thailand and India, which I don\u2019t think get as much attention. Maybe you could speak, are there pressures or wind down costs associated with [unintelligible] final assembly in Australia? Maybe you can just kind of comment on what\u2019s happening within the region?","Robert Shanks ","That\u2019s a good question. I think the way to think about it Asia Pacific, Africa in the near term is it\u2019s being driven in terms of bottom line results by China, as well as the top line. The top line performance in China was really remarkable. Through the first nine months, wholesales were up 51%. The share was growing. Revenue strong, inventory\u2019s in great shape. So the China story is an incredibly positive story. ","We have a lot of work to do in the rest of the region. If you think about India, we have major investments underway in two facilities there, which won\u2019t be up in terms of production for a couple of years, as we complete that construction. We\u2019ve just launched the EchoSport, so that\u2019s gaining traction there. ","In ASEAN, we opened a new facility last year. We can build a lot more there than we are, and that will happen over time, but we\u2019re in the early stages of filling that plant up. And as you said, in Australia, we announced a plan to restructure the business there, and that will occur by 2016, 2017, somewhere in that timeframe. ","And so we have some time to get to that point, but Alan and Mark, and Jim Farley and others went down there and announced a very aggressive plan around product, just as we did in North America and in Europe, and so we feel very good about where that business ultimately will be, around outstanding products. ","So I think we\u2019re in a different phase in the rest of Asia Pacific outside China, but we feel confident about our plans for that part of our business in the future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","A couple of things. One is I was hoping you could just speak about one part of North America. Obviously you continue to be pretty bullish on it. Alan, you just said you believe the market is going to get to 16 or 17 million. For Ford specifically, F-Series continues to go very well, and it looks like you\u2019re now at essentially 100% capacity, on three shifts, at your F-Series plants, so not a lot of cushion for growth, especially if you take some downtime for transitioning to a new version. ","Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019d manage that? Is some of the upside in the market going to maybe translate into pricing as opposed to volume? Is there opportunity for you guys to squeeze out more volume, even out of plants that are operating at very high levels? ","Mark Fields","It\u2019s a great question. Overall, as you mentioned, the full-size pickup segment is doing well this year, particularly versus last year. It\u2019s up over a point, and obviously as you mentioned that\u2019s driven a lot by the housing market. Our performance, as you mentioned, has been very good this year. Our transaction prices remain at the highest level in the segment. ","As we look at the capacity, as you know we\u2019ve added the third shift at Kansas City this year. That allowed us to produce even more to meet the demand that we\u2019re seeing. We do have some opportunities, as you look at maybe more over time, or increasing some line speeds, but clearly our approach going forward is making sure that we have, as we\u2019re doing right now, an orderly transition out of our \u201913 model years now into our \u201914 model years. ","And we\u2019re going to continue to be appropriate in the marketplace to keep our leadership position, but also at the same time preserve our transaction prices and margins while at the same time providing good value to the customer. ","So we\u2019re watching the market very closely. We\u2019ve added production, and we\u2019re going to keep watching that. But at some point, if the market does get even stronger, clearly we\u2019ll react to that in one form or fashion, either more production or preserving our pricing. ","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank ","And also on North America, this might be a little bit of a housekeeping thing, but if you look at that slide 10, and divide the volume related positives, $900 million on a year over year basis, by the 85,000 units of higher wholesales, it looks like a pretty phenomenal $10,600 per unit of additional profit. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything unusual in that number.","Robert Shanks ","No, there\u2019s nothing unusual. Maybe a little bit of rounding is getting to us there, but there\u2019s nothing unusual in the numbers.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank ","And just lastly, sequentially both in North America and Europe you\u2019re seeing some pretty good positives from contribution cost declines. How should we be thinking about that going forward? Are you starting to see some tailwinds maybe from commodities? Could that be more of a positive despite some of the content you\u2019re adding into new models?","Robert Shanks ","Commodities, whether on a year over year basis or quarter to quarter, are pretty benign. So no, I don\u2019t think commodities are anything to look at. And as you know, they\u2019ll be what they\u2019re going to be, and we\u2019ve had years where they\u2019ve been pretty horrible and years when they\u2019ve been very strong tailwinds. But this year they\u2019re not really much of a factor. ","So it\u2019s just other parts of the business, as we continue to work on cost reductions, we see warranty expense improve, teams working on trying to optimize our material costs, just the usual three yards and a cloud of dust, just trying to make the business better and more efficient, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the numbers.","Operator","We have our next question from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","I also had just a follow up on Europe. I guess the net pricing piece, which was positive both sequentially and year on year, unless I\u2019m mistaken, I feel that\u2019s like the first positive pricing increase we\u2019ve seen since last year, if I remember well. And so my first question was just could you tell us a little bit more about that? How much is that Ford product driven? How much of it is just a change in the industry? I think we did have comments from Peugeot yesterday suggesting that the environment had potentially gotten a little bit better. So just a little bit more comment on that would be helpful.","Mark Fields","It\u2019s a great question. We have seen the past couple of quarters actually some net pricing improvements. And I think it\u2019s a combination of the factors that you mentioned. First off is a number of the new products we\u2019ve put into the marketplace over the last number of quarters, like our B-Max, which is doing well, and our C-Max, in the marketplace, and the Kuga. ","But also at the same time, as you know, we have focused on channel mix very greatly in Europe, focusing primarily on retail and also the commercial fleet segments. And we\u2019ve been deemphasizing daily rentals and also self-registrations, which in self-registrations we\u2019re not only below the industry average, or actually significantly below this year. ","So we\u2019ve seen, through that channel mix, I think we\u2019re starting to see the combination of the channel mix and the new products, despite a very intense competitive environment and pricing environment. You\u2019re seeing some improvements there. ","And I was a bit mistaken in the first and second quarters we actually did see some negative net pricing. So the good news is you\u2019re starting to see the positive aspects of the products and the channel mix in the third quarter. ","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs ","So it sounds like there\u2019s some sustainability to that direction, just given these are structural factors.","Mark Fields","Well, obviously a lot of that\u2019s going to be based on the competitive environment. And as we said, despite the fact we\u2019re seeing stability in the markets there based on consumer and business confidence, it\u2019s still a very competitive pricing environment. But we\u2019re going to continue to focus on introducing those 25 new products in the next five years, of which eight have been introduced in the market so far. And we think that, and also just continuing to have the appropriate channel mix, will hopefully continue to show gains in that area.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs ","And one last one, just on Latin America, if I may. You posted a pretty good number there relative to expectations. Now, I know that you guys have a fairly big commercial vehicle business in Brazil, and this was obviously a very big quarter for truck volumes. How much of the performance was driven by that, and how much of it was just improvements in light vehicles from some of those product factors you mentioned?","Robert Shanks ","The cargo business is very, very profitable for us, and it does drive a lot of profitability for the region in South America, and that certainly was a factor. And as we said earlier, I think in Alan\u2019s remarks, we did launch the new cargo extra heavy duty truck. So that was a factor. The team is working on efficiencies. We\u2019re trying to also price as much as we possibly can to offset what I had mentioned around the high inflation effects, as well as the drag of the operating exchange impacts. But clearly the heavy truck business is important to us in South America and it did contribute.","Mark Fields","The only other thing I\u2019d add is when you look at our performance in South America it was also driven a lot by our strategy of introducing the One Ford global products. So clearly last year, the launch of the Ranger, the EchoSport. Earlier this year we launched the Fiesta and the Fusion, which is driving pricing as well as share. And the good news is we\u2019re just launching our Focus into the marketplace right now, which is a fairly significant segment in the region. So those things, including the heavy trucks, have helped improve our performance.","Operator","We have our next question in the queue from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please proceed. ","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Just a long term question around Europe. You still do have the 6% to 8% margin outlook. How do you feel about that margin outlook today? And if we think about mid-decade, and your outlook for profitability, and with the improvements you\u2019ve made year to date in the business, could mid-decade be anywhere in the vicinity of that 6% to 8%? Or how should we think about it? There\u2019s a general view that maybe you\u2019re, to an earlier question, maybe at breakeven or slightly above? How should we think about the mid-decade view relative to that long term 6% to 8% margin target?","Robert Shanks ","Well, the mid-decade for the company was 8% to 9%, and I think we indicated for North America it would be 8% to 10%. For Europe, and this was sort of post-downturn, as we announced the restructuring plan, we felt over the medium term that 6% to 8% was an appropriate target. ","So when we talk about profitability for 2015, I think it would be probably a stretch to get to 6% to 8% by that point in time, but certainly that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving to do over what we call our business planning period, and then would like to do even better than that ongoing. We\u2019d like to see all of our automotive businesses generate something like an 8% return or so. But that\u2019s probably ahead of us. ","So I think certainly we\u2019re very comfortable and excited about the recent return to profitability, and then we\u2019ll continue to work on getting the margin up to the level that you just talked about. ","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup ","Two cash flow questions. One, Bob, do you have any update on the pension mark-to-market discount rates, where you\u2019d kind of put them today? Maybe asset returns? And then also on the capex, I think the guidance did come down by about $500 million, but a bit surprising given the strength in earnings and cash flow to date. Is that the efficiency, timing, or just maybe a little conservatism from earlier on in the year?","Robert Shanks ","On pensions, nothing new to report. At the second quarter, we talked about the fact that the funded status of our plans was much improved from the end of last year, which was underfunded to the tune of nearly $19 billion, including the plans that remain unfunded. We saw big improvement at the time of the second quarter. That is still what we\u2019re seeing at the end of the third quarter, and it\u2019s around the higher discount rates. We\u2019ve put even more contributions in, obviously, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, another $1 billion plus, into the plans. ","And the asset returns are much less of a factor. But we still see substantial improvement. Again, as in the second quarter, we\u2019re not going to provide any specific numbers, but we think what we talked about there is holding as we get towards the end of the year. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that.","In terms of the capex, I think it\u2019s probably everything. If you go back and look at history, we tend to under run what we say on that. I think some of that is perhaps some conservatism. There might be a tiny bit of efficiencies. We do have some timing changes, though. The programs themselves remain on track, but we have had some timing changes on some of the programs, and that\u2019s moving some of the spending out of this year into next year. But nothing really major. Just a number of timing changes that are just flipping over past 12\/31 into next year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup ","And then maybe on quick one, lastly. Maybe it\u2019s a little early to ask this, but with the new pickup truck launch next year potentially having a weight reduction or additional complexity with aluminum, should we think about the changeover costs, the downtime, given your high utilization today, to maybe a little bit greater than you might have had otherwise, in previous changeovers?","Robert Shanks ","Well, we haven\u2019t said anything about future products, and we certainly wouldn\u2019t do that today. There\u2019s a place and time for that, and it\u2019s not right now. We have talked, though, about the need for us to reduce the weight of our vehicles, and we actually have a plan and a strategy to do that, to the tune of roughly 350 to 700 pounds. ","And so that\u2019s certainly something that you should see from new products coming from Ford in the future, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take in order for us to meet the regulatory requirements that we\u2019re facing, not only here but around the world. And so that certainly is just a part of our product plan going forward. ","In terms of what may or may not happen in \u201914, we\u2019ll be chatting with you in January about that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are now going to take questions from the media. [Operator instructions.] We have our first question in the queue from the line of Dee Ann Durbin from the Associated Press. Please go ahead. ","Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press","Alan, I\u2019m going to circle back to the first question and ask it in a different way. Have you actually spoken to Microsoft about the CEO position?","Alan Mulally ","We don\u2019t comment on the speculation. ","Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press","So you won\u2019t say either way?","Alan Mulally ","We have no change to our plan and I love serving at Ford. And we don\u2019t comment on speculation. ","Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press","And Bob, can you say how many U.S. retirees have taken the lump sum pension payments?","Robert Shanks ","The total potential participants in the program are somewhere around 90,000, just a little bit more, and I think through the end of third quarter we\u2019ve seen a bit more than 70,000 that have had the opportunity to participate. So that\u2019s roughly 80% to 83%. ","And we\u2019re not talking about how many actually have decided to take the lump sum offer. We\u2019ll do that when we conclude the whole program in the fourth quarter. Because we\u2019ve actually seen quite different take rates based on different types of cohort groups, you know, term vested versus retirees, different ages and so forth. It\u2019s quite variable, so we\u2019ll just give an overall number once the total program has concluded. So we\u2019ll talk about that in January. ","Operator","We have the next question from the line of Craig Trudell from Bloomberg News. Please go ahead. ","Craig Trudell - Bloomberg News","I have a question about in Asia, the new Mondeo coming. Can you give us an update on timing for that and what your expectations are on what that might do for pricing going forward?","Mark Fields","That\u2019s a good question. We launched the Mondeo into the marketplace about six weeks ago. It\u2019s off to a very good start, and it contributed, obviously to the market share or the tying of the record market share in China that we had in the second quarter as well as the third quarter. And we have about 1.5 months of sold orders, so it\u2019s off to a great start.","Craig Trudell - Bloomberg News","Is it going to do similar to what you\u2019ve been able to do in the U.S. with Fusion?","Mark Fields","Well, we expect it to be just as big a success in China as it has been here in the U.S.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Carl Henkel from The Detroit News. Please go ahead. ","Karl Henkel - The Detroit News","Just had a quick question on Europe, and Bob I know you talked before about certain regions within Europe who have maybe bottomed out sooner than others. But I\u2019m curious as to how that looks now from your opinion. Are the improvements that you see being driven by just certain key areas, or is it more of a broad thing?","Robert Shanks ","Well, it\u2019s not our opinion. We really have a great economics group, and they\u2019re continually showing us the leading economic indicators for the euro area, and I touched on a couple of them, whether it\u2019s confidence factors, industrial production, even the spreads on some of the sovereign debt in the countries that been most at risk have improved. ","So there\u2019s a number of different factors that we look at, as well as the SAR factor, as I said, on a different view of run rates and so forth. All of it suggests that first of all the economy has stabilized and there\u2019s signs of tipping over towards very very small, modest growth, and the same holds true for the industry. ","And that\u2019s whether we look at sort of the so-called peripheral markets, so that would be Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece. We look at Germany, France, and the U.K. The U.K. obviously is doing very well on its own. We\u2019ve looked at the other markets I haven\u2019t mentioned. Whichever way we look at it, we\u2019re just seeing signs of what I said around stabilization and ultimately a return in the near term to growth. ","Operator","Next question is from the line of Mike Ramsey from The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead. ","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","Alan or Mark, I don\u2019t know who wants to take this one, but I was just looking at your wholesale deliveries, and it looks like you\u2019re probably going to come in a little over 6 million this year, and your forecast is to get to 8 million, I guess by 2015. And my calculation is that that would mean a more than 15% compounded growth over the next two years. Do you feel pretty confident that you\u2019re going to be able to get that kind of wholesale growth and revenue growth over the next two years? It seems like that\u2019s a really big increase, although I guess you\u2019re up pretty significantly this year.","Mark Fields","First off, as you know, we have that mid-decade guidance sometime in the mid-decade, but yes, we\u2019re quite focused on growth right now. Keep in mind, year to date we have grown our wholesales 13% in 2013, and that\u2019s on top of growth in 2012. So clearly that\u2019s going to have to be driven by products, and as you know, our product pipeline is very full. ","At the same time, as you know, we\u2019re in the process of adding capacity in places like Asia Pacific. As we said, in Asia Pacific we\u2019re going to be increasing our manufacturing capacity there to 2.9 million units, up from about 1.5 million in 2011, really accelerate the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Europe. ","Industries, as well, as we\u2019ve said, just looking back at the total industry, our view is industries are all in the range of 4% to 5% annually. So when you look at industry growth, look at our product pipeline and introductions that are coming, look at the capacity that we\u2019re putting in place, and you look at the momentum that we have, which is so demonstrated in this quarter with growth around the world, we\u2019re extremely excited to realize that growth going forward. But we have to have the physicals in place, and we\u2019re working on that. ","Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal","So you feel pretty good on the forecast that you\u2019re going to be able to at least maintain the current revenue and wholesale delivery growth of 13% to 15% the next couple of years?","Mark Fields","Well, obviously there\u2019s a lot of factors that we control. There\u2019s a lot of factors that we don\u2019t control. I\u2019d say we feel good about the factors we do control, and we\u2019ll manage through the business environment and continue to monitor it, keeping our goals in mind.","Operator","We have the next question from the line of Deepa Seetharaman from Reuters. Please go ahead. ","Deepa Seetharaman - Thomson Reuters","I just have two quick ones. One, Lincoln, I\u2019m just wondering, how satisfied you guys have been with the progress on Lincoln. It\u2019s been about a year since you rebranded it the Lincoln Motor Company. And where do you see that brand on its recovery or its transformation? And second, Alan, I was just piggybacking off of Dee-Ann\u2019s question. What do you think the prospects of you staying beyond 2014 are?","Mark Fields","On Lincoln, as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re absolutely committed to reinventing Lincoln into a world-class luxury brand with a client experience to match. And as we said when we launched our strategy around Lincoln, that this was going to be a journey not over a matter of months, but over a matter of years. ","And we\u2019re off to a good start, after a little bit of a rough production launch of the MKZ. When you look at the quarter, our MKZ sales were up 13%. Five out of the last six months we\u2019ve had record sales months for MKZ. Importantly with that product we\u2019re growing on the coasts. California is a great example, those two regions, L.A. and San Francisco are our fastest-growing regions. And interestingly, about two-thirds of those MKZ sales are hybrids. ","So we\u2019re on our way. We\u2019ve said this will be based on product, and we have four products coming in the next four years, which started with the MKZ. So we\u2019re pleased but not satisfied where are, but we said this was going to be a journey, and we\u2019re off and running on that journey. ","Alan Mulally ","Our plan has not changed. Thank you.","Operator","We have the next question from the line of Joann Muller from Forbes. Please go ahead. ","Joann Muller - Forbes","Alan, I wanted to ask you about your overall One Ford strategy. Obviously it has been working to improve your results, but my question is where do you still see opportunity to really improve the finances in the business and to save some costs, and so forth? Where else is it that you can mine?","Alan Mulally ","Sure, good question, and pleased to share our perspective. I think I would start on the revenue side first. And as you have described, we continue to round out and complete our complete family of vehicles. And we are now moving into more and more covering all the market segments around the world. ","There\u2019s a couple of really exciting things about that that I know you know well, but just like on the SUVs, who\u2019d have ever thought that we\u2019d get such a response in the marketplace for smaller SUVs like the EchoSport, you know, SUVs on the B size, the C size, the CD size, in addition to the Explorer size. And so that\u2019s a really good example of expanding the number of markets that we can serve with this complete family of vehicles. So I think at the very start it\u2019s covering more of the market segments with our complete family of best-in-class vehicles.","And to your point on the second one, I think we have such an opportunity to improve our fundamental efficiency, as Bob and Mark have described, going forward. As we increase our scale, and we realize that scale, along with the changes in the footprint to optimize the flow of the goods, and in addition to our aligned business framework with all our suppliers where we\u2019re getting the value of global suppliers, but also getting the value of all of this localized in our production. ","So over time I think you\u2019ll see us continue to improve the revenue with an expanded family of best-in-class vehicles, and I think that we\u2019ll continue to expand the operating margins. And we feel very comfortable, as Mark and Bob have shared too, about that mid-decade guidance of 8 million vehicles and margins in the 8% to 10% range, and we feel really good about it on the revenue side and the efficiency side to achieve it.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Imani. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets. Also joining us are Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President, Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President, Global Operations; and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit.","Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled last quarter. Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then Jim Farley will provide a deeper dive into our global markets. After Jim Farley's comments, we'll open the call up for questions and then following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.","Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions include forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 43. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year. Company EBIT and EPS are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis.","Now, let me to turn the call over to Jim Hackett.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Lynn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to honor the contributions of Sergio Marchionne, a charismatic leader who deserves praise not only for his business accomplishments but for his resolute discipline, demanding the most of himself and those around him, courage to speak plainly in the face of adversity and an unwavering commitment to his values. Our thoughts are with his family and colleagues and may Sergio rest in eternal peace.","Now, please turn to slide 2. In April, we shared our framework to improve the competitiveness, profitability and returns of our portfolio and to drive sustainable value creation. This includes four smart choices for growth: A winning portfolio, commitment to new propulsion, investment in autonomous technology and advancement of Ford's role in the mobility experience.","At that time and filtering for value creation, we also put a spotlight on the divergence between the accretive and dilutive parts of our business. We said we're going to feed the high performing parts and deal decisively with areas that destroy value. And we affirmed that where we can raise the returns of underperforming areas via fitness and\/or alternative business models, we would, and we would disposition the rest.","Today I want to provide an update on how we're moving swiftly to execute against that framework including the AV and organizational changes we announced yesterday. There's plans for restructuring that I will discuss in a moment as well as an update on our near and longer-term targets. And I'm also going to touch on our underperformance in China and Europe.","So back to the growth strategy. Let me start with our commitment to cultivating a winning portfolio, and if you would turn to slide three. Now this graph, which is based on our 2017 results, and is similar to what we showed you last quarter, shows our profitability by region. It gives you a clear roadmap of where, from a geographic perspective, we have opportunities to redesign our business model. Now this redesign includes the reallocation of capital to opportunities with higher returns, restructuring and strategic partnerships. Now relative to restructuring, and mind you, we see this underneath that redesign, we now believe we have the potential for about $11 billion of EBIT restructuring charges with $7 billion of cash-related impacts over the next three to five years.","It's no surprise that North America, which is solidly in the upper right quadrant on that chart, accounts for all our company EBIT. With returns of about 24%, the region earns well above our cost of capital which is evidence of our earnings power when we focus our portfolio on where we can win. And over time, North America's return profile should improve further driven by fitness and our decision we talked about last call to no longer allocate capital to traditional sedan silhouettes. Now these actions give us confidence in our target to return North America to 10% EBIT margin.","Notwithstanding this quarter, Europe and Asia Pacific have been profitable but with nagging low margins and ROIC below our targeted cost of capital. Now South America, well it's firmly in the lower left quadrant with highly dilutive margin and ROIC. Middle East and Africa is in the same quadrant. However this year, that team has done an excellent job on fitness and the region now has a credible path to growth and improved returns.","Now I'd like nothing better than to give you visibility into the specifics of how we may restructure, but I want you to recognize we're mindful of all of our stakeholders here, the employees, dealers, unions, regulators, government officials and investors. Therefore we only can share information publicly once decisions are made. And we followed a similar approach last quarter when we announced our decision to exit sedan silhouettes in North America, but our commitment is to keep you informed and often.","When you have strong and weak franchises in regions, it's not as simple as just pulling the plug or exiting markets. We know we can capitalize on our strengths \u2013 we have a strong brand \u2013 bolster underperforming products and regions and then smartly and selectively disposition where we cannot make an appropriate return. To do this well and with grounding in the future, it takes some time, more than the year I've been in this role.","As we mentioned in our earnings release, we have postponed our September Analyst Meeting. Now this was driven by the fact that we're in the midst of our global business redesign efforts. There's important partnership discussions that are taking place and because of the uncertain policy environment that we're all in. We plan to do two things: first we're going to reconvene when we have concrete details to share, but we're going to update you more certainly with touch points such as conferences and one on one meetings and daily interactions. We plan to communicate frequently.","Now let me turn back to the other smart choices for growth that I've been highlighting, so turn to slide four. This is the area where we're starting with new propulsion choices. We continue to stand by our global commitment to the Paris Accord 2 degree stabilization glide path. And we're using this to guide our business. For example, we're on track to add hybrid electrics to our high volume profitable vehicles like the F-150. Our battery electric vehicle rollout starts in 2020 with a performance utility and we'll have 16 BEVs in our portfolio by 2022. Those 16 are all additions to our portfolio.","In the quarter we had announced two new fuel efficient taxis, hybrid and diesel, to give operators more choice and lower total cost of ownership. We also introduced an all new Police Interceptor Utility hybrid. People said it couldn't be done. This is the industry's first pursuit-rated hybrid SUV delivering improved performance at a lower cost.","Now the next area of growth is autonomous technologies. So coincident yesterday we announced the reorganization of our autonomous vehicle efforts into a single entity under the Ford Smart, Ford Mobility umbrella. This new Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC will be led by CEO Sherif Marakby. Sherif has had a long career at Ford, time at Uber, and it's an important step to provide our customers with trusted mobility services while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. This new structure, which allows for third party investments, brings together the teams who have focused on our AV development for the past 18 months with a singular focus of commercial deployment of our AV business in 2021.","For your information, by 2023, we will have invested $4 billion into the development of our AV business and this includes the $1 billion we announced when we became a majority stakeholder in Argo AI. By creating this AV LLC now, we can leverage the incredible strides our development teams have already made and streamline future decision making and better capitalize on market opportunities.","In the mobility segment of our growth strategy, we expanded the scope of our strategic partnerships with a new memorandum of understanding with Zotye to establish a JV to provide smart customized all-electrical vehicle solutions in China's fastest growing ride hailing market. We also signed a letter of intent with Baidu in China to jointly explore areas of cooperation in connectivity, artificial intelligence and digital marketing. And Ford Commercial Solutions introduced two new connected vehicle products to provide fleet managers and telematics service providers direct access to valuable OEM grade vehicle data. This is the power of the APIs to allow them to better manage their fleets.","Let me go back for a moment to the winning portfolio. Candidly, we're extremely dissatisfied with our performance in Europe and China and we had not planned for these types of results. For each region we've identified root causes. This is why I mentioned with the winning portfolio we see issues there. And we know how to do this, the actions required to get these businesses back on track. In fact today, I've invited Jim Farley to take you through a deeper dive on this before we go into Q&A.","Let me return to the announcements we made yesterday and touch on four key management changes that we announced along with the new AV LLC. As I mentioned, Sherif Marakby is the CEO of that. He will report directly to Marcy Klevorn. And Marcy had a rich history at Ford, building the software stack as our Chief Information Officer. I'm really happy that Marcy will now focus execution with this group.","Joe Hinrichs will now have responsibility for IT and our global order-to-delivery system. In support of fitness initiatives, this realignment will help us accelerate the integration and application of technology across the industrial system to further streamline manufacturing, adopt big data, speed vehicle delivery times, reduce inventories and improve capital efficiency. Joe's had roles not only in setting up new businesses around the world running North America, but also was part and parcel to these important negotiations 10 years ago that helped save the company. He's got a great view of the business end-to-end and is an important assignment.","Under Jim Farley's leadership, we're now embedding a deeper product line focus across the company which will allow global product line teams to put greater emphasis on customer insights and market opportunities, delivering more user driven products and services. This approach builds on the success we've already experienced with our F-Series teams in North America, the Ranger team in Asia Pacific and we've copied it with the commercial vehicle team in Europe. We're also suddenly making a linkage between the market leadership and the product leadership here.","And Hau Thai-Tang, Executive Vice President of Product Development and Purchasing, will now report directly to me. This move ensures that these critical functions have an even stronger voice at our leadership table as we execute on fitness and we create the winning portfolio around the world.","Okay. Turn to slide six for me please. And before I turn it over to Bob, let me say that I am confident in our plans to create a winning portfolio and execute on our other growth drivers including AV. I mean North America and Credit, the quarter they just have shouldn't be lost in our news today. They had very solid quarters. And while Europe and China are notably challenged, we're moving swiftly to stem the negative tide in both of those businesses. We've been working on this. We have line of sight to about $11 billion in restructuring with cash related effects of $7 billion over the next three to five years, which we believe will provide substantial benefits from both a growth and a profitability and return perspective.","Now due largely to the performance in Europe and China, today we're lowering our 2018 EPS guidance range to $1.30 to $1.50. I'll say it again, $1.30 to $1.50 despite better than expected performance from Ford Credit and North America. I'm going to get asked this question, so let me say looking further out, we are still targeting the 8% EBIT margin and high teens ROIC by 2020.","So let me at this point turn it over to Bob for more detail.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Thanks, Jim. If we could go to slide eight please. Clearly as Jim said, our second quarter was challenging. This was due in part to unexpected events over which we had little control such as the fire at our U.S. supplier Meridian. It also reflects a policy environment that's increasingly uncertain, causing real unfavorable bottom line effects on the business such as higher commodity costs, beyond normal cyclical effects as well as tariff-related impacts.","The quarter however also underscores the importance and urgency of the work well underway in Ford to redesign our business. And as we do this how critical it is that we consistently focus our capital on areas where we have confidence of earning an appropriate return. And where we don't we must and are addressing those issues. Thus the $11 billion of EBIT contingencies with $7 billion in cash-related effects that Jim just mentioned.","It's important to highlight that we believe we can fund these cash effects without impinging on our other capital outlays including investments for growth and our regular dividend. You'll note that all of the metrics for the quarter were lower than a year ago. These declines were primarily driven by lower volume of high margin products in our North America business due to production disruptions caused by Meridian, along with performance issues in our China operations.","Now at a high level, company revenue was about $39 billion. Company adjusted EBIT was $1.7 billion with an adjusted margin of 4.3%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27 and this included an effective tax rate of about 21%. And company cash and marketable securities at quarter end were about $25 billion with total liquidity at about $36 billion.","On slide 10, the year over year bridge for company revenue, the $1 billion decline in revenue was more than explained by lower volume, fully explained by North America, which was the Meridian disruption, and Asia Pacific, which was mainly our China consolidated operations. All other factors improved.","Turning to slide 11. The company's adjusted EBIT was down $1.1 billion from a year ago. This was more than explained by Automotive. As shown on slide 12, our Automotive operations were profitable, generating an EBIT of $1.2 billion driven by a $1.8 billion EBIT in North America. This was offset in part by a combined EBIT loss of about $600 million in the operations outside North America, with each region in a loss position except ME&A, which delivered a record second quarter profit. As shown below the graph, North America and Asia Pacific accounted for nearly all the Automotive EBIT decline due to the factors I've already mentioned.","The underlying strength of our North American business came through in the quarter. As detailed on slide 15, we earned $1.8 billion with an EBIT margin of 7.4% despite the adverse impact at Meridian. The year-over-year bridge for North America, which is detailed on slide 16, shows that effectively the entire $579 million decline in EBIT was due to Meridian.","It's worth looking at this bridge more closely to get a better appreciation for North America's profit trajectory supported by strong market factors. If you exclude the impact of Meridian, the favorable effect of the gain from the IPO of Pivotal and the adverse impact of the Takata settlement, North America's EBIT margin jumps from 7.4% to 9.9%, the level of ongoing margin that we're working to deliver.","Now in our earnings deck this quarter, we are providing you with greater transparency into the profitability and returns of each of our business units that Jim touched on, similar to what we did on our first quarter call for the total company. The graphs show the major parts of each business disaggregated by high and low performance. As you can see in slide 17, the majority of North America's business is strong and high performing with an EBIT of $12.5 billion, a margin of 18% and a ROIC of 48%.","We plan to strengthen and expand this part of our North American business and we've already begun to address the low performing parts, demonstrated by our recent announcement to no longer allocate capital to traditional sedan silhouettes. This is just one part of our effort to return North America to margins of at least 10% and to create a more resilient business.","Now moving to South America on slide 19. The EBIT loss in the quarter of $178 million was unchanged from a year ago. While overall industry conditions improved and we held costs essentially flat excluding the inflationary effects, this was completely offset by the significant weakening of local currencies, particularly the Argentine peso and very high levels of inflation, especially in Argentina.","As slide 20 shows, our business in South America lacks a strong competitive position or profit pillars. In fact, we have not earned an appropriate return on investment over the most recent economic cycle that spans from 2004 to the present. For those reasons, we are moving on a significant redesign of our business model focused on where to play and how to win.","Turning to Europe on slide 22. Let me state plainly that we are disappointed with our performance. The loss of $73 million compares to a profit of $122 million last year. The decline in EBIT was driven by higher costs, primarily regulatory related, and unfavorable exchange, mainly sterling. While market factors were slightly positive, we had expected a much stronger boost from the top line both in volume and net pricing.","Turning to slide 23. Europe similar to North America actually has a strong core product portfolio that last year represented more than 200% of the region's EBIT. This quarter consists of commercial vehicles including Ranger, our Kuga small utility and select imports. On the other hand, the low performing part of our portfolio represents a majority of our volume, revenue and capital deployed in the region, consisting principally of cars and multi-activity vehicles such as C-MAX.","Clearly our European business requires a major redesign and refocus particularly given the ongoing effects of Brexit on our most important and profitable market. That work is already underway, focused on addressing the low performing elements and expanding and strengthening the healthy pillars of our portfolio. It's important to recognize that partnerships, which are a part of our fitness toolkit, are already an integral part of our European operations and going forward we expect them to play an even greater role.","Let's turn now to Asia Pacific. Now effective this quarter, we are breaking China results out separately, which encompasses our unconsolidated JVs plus our consolidated operations. This provides investors greater transparency into how we are executing in this critical market and also how our business in Asia Pacific outside of China is performing.","As you can see on slide 26, a summary of Asia Pacific's key metrics, we had a very difficult quarter with major year over year declines across all metrics, almost entirely driven by China. As slide 27 indicates, the year over year decline in Asia Pacific's EBIT totaled $561 million with $506 million of this coming from our China operation and $55 million from the operations outside China. At the total AP level, the year over year decline was due to lower volume and net pricing as well as lower China JV net income.","Slide 28 provides the absolute and year over year details for China, with the rest of the region shown at the bottom. We are very disappointed in our performance in China. We lost $483 million in the quarter, a decline of $506 million from last year. The decline was driven by unfavorable market factors for Ford and Lincoln imports into China and continued negative industry pricing. The lower net pricing also includes adverse stock accrual effects driven by price changes in response to tariff changes.","The decline in the China JVs was driven by unfavorable volume and mix as well as lower net pricing, which was primarily industry related. Since volumes in the JV were down year over year, we also saw a decline in royalties in compensation for engineering expense that Ford incurred in the past.","Given the large increase this year in Ford engineering expense to support a substantial expansion of our product portfolio, including all new BEVs along with a number of imported products to be localized, the gap between Ford incurred engineering expense and present-year royalties we receive from the China JVs is substantial.","As shown below the chart, the operations in Asia Pacific outside China were profitable, earning $89 million, which was down from a profit of $144 million a year ago. The EBIT margin was 4.2%. This decline was driven by unfavorable market factors, mainly in Australia and ASEAN. India continued to improve, although it did incur a modest loss.","As slide 29 shows, in 2017, Asia Pacific had a meaningful, high performing business anchored by Ranger, most utilities, Mondeo and Mustang. Moving forward, we're focused on getting our China business back on track, including localization of most imported products, sustaining the strong performers in the region outside of China, and getting appropriate returns from our business in India. India is another example of where we're leveraging partnerships, specifically Mahindra, to strengthen our competitiveness.","Now turning to slide 30. Our Mobility segment including mobility services as well as autonomous vehicles, we saw EBIT loss of $181 million, which was down $118 million with both the absolute loss and the year over year variance split about equally between mobility services and investments in autonomous vehicles.","Ford Credit had another strong quarter as shown on slide 31, with modest growth in receivables, earning before tax of $645 million, up $26 million with very strong credit and consumer metrics. Auction values in the quarter were up 4% from a year ago, and we now expect full-year average auction values to be up 1% to 2% at constant mix.","Operating cash flow in the quarter detailed on slide 34 was a negative $1.8 billion, which was driven by unfavorable working capital and timing differences. The balance sheet remains strong as does our liquidity.","And finally as shown on Slide 37, the company adjusted EPS bridge, we have updated our full-year guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.70 to a range of $1.30 to $1.50. Based on the midpoint of each range, the decline of $0.18 or about 11% reflects lower than expected contributions from Asia Pacific and Europe offset in part by stronger performance from North America, despite taking a substantial hit on commodities and Ford Credit as well as a slightly lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%.","With that, I'd now like to turn it over to Jim Farley, who's going to share insights on our North America, Europe and China businesses. Jim?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you, Bob. Well it's great to see the progress in North America. In fact this morning, J.D. Power has reported the results of the annual APEAL survey and for the first time in history, a domestic product won the top score, the Lincoln Navigator.","Beyond the products, the 10% margin has galvanized our team in North America. Our performance in the quarter reflects the underlying strength of our current portfolio and mix of trucks and the intense focus the team has on fitness. You can feel the momentum.","We have built strong, profitable, competitive moats like our LCV business. F-Series and Transit make up the industry leader in commercial vehicles, thanks not only to the product but our distribution and commercial capabilities. Our F-Series this year is on pace for a record setting year with sales up 5% and equally strong pricing despite an incredibly intense competitive market.","Talking about the revitalization of our utilities, our first big launch, the Expedition\/Navigator, well, sales are up 55% and we are having even stronger results on pricing. All of this is before we refreshed 75% of our North America lineup next year, mostly utilities. We know that when we play to our strengths for customers, we drive strong profits and returns. In contrast, the erosion we've seen in both Europe and China is unacceptable, highlighting why we are changing our portfolio in these regions to profitably grow.","Turning to Europe and our deteriorating results. Despite being only 30% of our revenue, our LCV business continues to be the bright spot, with 13% EBIT margins. This reflects our strong core portfolio with Ford as the number one best selling LCV brand, led by Transit and our vans and Ranger which is now the best selling pickup in the region. But despite this strength, one of our underlying issues is that we are behind on the shift to utilities and now our portfolio under index on this highly profitable and growing segment.","The biggest issue we face is the UK. We're the number one brand in the market. Back in 2016 we made $1.2 billion in Europe and most of it was in the UK. Brexit and the continued weak sterling has been a fundamental headwind for our European business. This explains the majority of our deterioration along with the age and mix of our utilities and cost. Taking all of these factors into account, we now expect to deliver a loss this year in Europe. To deliver on our long-term target of 6% EBIT margin, clearly we have to redesign Europe, centering the operations on our profitable LCV business. We are aggressively attacking costs and driving improved capital efficiencies across the business. Importantly, capital allocation plans now align with utility and the LCV business opportunity.","Turning to China. The deterioration of our business in this important global market has been swift. When we completed the deep dive into the root cause, we exposed serious shortfalls in our go-to-market capabilities, including inadequate dealer profitability, excess stock including our high volume C cars. We now maintain we haven't maintained a fresh enough product lineup for this rapidly changing and dynamic China market. These missteps together, with our uncompetitive cost structure has resulted in a significant deterioration in our 2Q results.","We have taken urgent action. We've addressed the dealer profitability, also our stock and production and we've completely reset our merchandising. New products are on their way. 60% of our lineup will be refreshed or new by the end of next year. However until all of our utilities are launched in China, we'll continue to face this mix deficit. We are improving our cost competitiveness with aggressive fitness actions as well as more localized product, as Bob said in China, such as the Explorer. We're close to hiring a new CEO for Ford China and we have already onboarded a number of local Chinese talent in key management positions such as marketing and sales leads for both Ford and Lincoln to drive not only our strategy but they're already reinvigorating our sales.","China is already the world's largest automotive market, growing to twice the size of the U.S. market by 2025. And I can assure you, we understand the importance of getting our China business back on track. This will complement the progress we've already made in the region with ASEAN and Australia thanks to Ranger and India as Bob mentioned with the work we're doing with Mahindra.","Before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to end on this. Bob mentioned the sizable provision for restructuring contingencies of $11 billion and $7 billion of cash-related effects. With this and other fitness actions, we are determined to reshape our portfolio of products and markets.","Complementing this is our aggressive reallocation of capital to regions but products that people love in the most profitable segments. We're expanding our incredible lineup of Ford commercial vehicles. We're growing the range of white hot utilities, not just Expedition, but in all sizes and price points. And we're completing the build-out of an incredible urban crossover lineup with world class energy efficiency.","Operator, let's go to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Okay, your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks everybody. Just got two questions. First one on restructuring. I want to ask the question, what does $12 billion, I'm sorry, what does $11 billion of charges or $7 billion of cash charges buy you in the restructuring world? But am I wasting everyone's time here? Are you going to \u2013 is there anything else you can say in terms of geography, function, region? Anything else tonight besides the number?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah hi, Adam, Jim Hackett.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","No we're not going beyond that tonight.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Tonight's not the night for that. Okay, all right. The second question, Jim, is to you. I think the postponement of the Capital Markets Day, it's kind of a pretty big deal, Jim. These types of things you're introducing into the strategy like spending $11 billion over three to five years, dealing with key stakeholders, tech partners, revamping China. It requires someone to be in the seat a fair amount of time to see it through. So to be direct with you, Jim, whenever you do reschedule the Capital Markets Day, to be clear with investors, will you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it?","And I mean that with all due respect. You're a very spry 63 and you've got great contributions to the culture and to accelerating cultural change. But I think it's important, and I'm kind of reflecting a fair amount of sentiment in the investment community around management continuity as well. So we really would appreciate a comment on that. Thank you.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, thank you, Adam. It's a straightforward. I love the job that I have. We're making tremendous progress. I get to look. This is a year ago that we had our first quarterly call and I've looked back and what we said we would do. We've made tremendous progress. We've made a number of decisions. In fact, a few are worth emphasizing.","One is this product portfolio turnaround, all the work. Of course, as you know the industry, Adam, these are decisions that will fuel growth and profits in the future. I'm not blaming anyone in the rearview mirror, but I had nothing to do with the portfolio that we're now kind of laboring under in a couple markets. And we've taken really decisive action to address all of that.","The second thing is, the fitness initiatives which we introduced, kind of an abstract word, everyone wasn't sure what it meant, we now have earmarked over $11 billion of value. We've started to work on our longer-term planning and we're expecting more to come from that. So it's had more traction than I first forecasted.","The third thing is, is this team has really come together. I feel like, in any kind of endeavor I've been in, it takes time for a group of people to come together and work closely. You heard with these management choices. I'm really proud of the group that I have on side-by-side with me. And hell yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we're going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Could I just comment on the question around restructuring?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah and so, Adam, we can talk more about this later, but I think you're raising a really important point and I just want to make sure that investors and others who are listening understand why we shared what we did today. So first of all, you should expect that we will be using the earnings calls and other interactions that we have with you and investors and buy side, as things take place and as we can share what our thinking is and our plans and actions, we're going to be doing that real-time.","So what I want to leave with you is this. If you go back to the prior quarter and the what I call, the bubble chart which is the high performing, low performing which we provide for the total company. And then you look at what we're providing today, which is like a next step forward. So we're showing you what that looks geographically. We've also shown you within each region where we have high performing and low performing parts of the business.","The way I would encourage you and investors to think about all of that is, those are, if you will, roadmaps, not specific to the degree I understand you would like to see, but they are roadmaps. They are roadmaps in terms of the strong business that fits inside what, in the aggregate is a somewhat mediocre business, because of the low performing elements that we still have. But it's a roadmap in terms of where we're going to allocate more capital to. It's also a roadmap, in general, of where we're going to allocate capital from.","So as you can imagine, that is a complex thing to do in terms of over the whole business. We're going to have to orchestrate this. It will play out over time. There are many constituencies that we're going to have to manage, because while those numbers that we gave you are large and substantial, they could be even larger if we don't manage this in the right way. I mean, we'd like them to be smaller, so we're going to not, if you will, tip our hand before we need to so that we can manage this in the most efficient and effective way that's possible.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I appreciate that, Bob and listen, Ford's a 115 year old company. It's not your first rodeo here in terms of restructuring over that 115 years. I just can't really think of an example where, for such an important restructuring and such large numbers, and you're kind of almost teasing the market with these very large numbers. Even not just for investors, but internally for your own people who are going to read the newspaper and say, what's going on. I mean, doesn't \u2013 I'm just, I'm concerned that and seeing examples of people that restructured successfully, including one we lost today, laying it all out in a narrative that can be understood, that can be on the back of a card, like from the Mulally days. That had a powerful impact, because I think the risk is that this industry is so dynamic, possibly yeah, very, very dynamic and cyclical that as that narrative plays out, the rules change, your free cash flow moves negative. And then we're dealing with a moving bar and we don't know what to compare it to. Sorry, that's just feedback. I really do hope you can reconsider the communication strategy because it's just not good enough, Bob.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","No, I understand what you're saying, but let me just provide another, yeah, a few other thoughts for you and others to think about. So one reason that we wanted to provide it is because we have been doing a lot of work in terms of how we're going to redesign the business. We clearly have a point of view, maybe not complete yet, because we still have a lot of more work to do, but we have a point of view about what that redesign is going to entail. We're not providing the specifics for the reasons I mentioned, but it's clear that that redesign is going to be fundamental and it's going to be deep and it's going to really address these underperforming parts of the business.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","The other thing I would remind you is we've been to the rodeo. If you go back 10 years, a number of guys that are sitting around the table and gals went through an enormous restructuring with similar types of numbers if not bigger in the restructuring of North America. And I was there on the day that Mark provided the first view of what The Way Forward plan was going to be. It was high level. We talked about numbers of plants that we might close. I actually looked at the details today. It turned out some of those plants were different. Some of the plants that we were going to close we didn't, and some that we ultimately closed, we didn't think we were going to.","And the thing that's interesting about this and this is another thing that's important for investors to understand, because everybody wants to have the answer today. When we announced that in January of 2006, the last two plants, which we didn't identify at that time that closed were in 2011 when we closed Twin Cities which built the Ranger and St. Thomas in Canada where we built the Crown Vic, the Grand Marquis and the Town Car because it was the right time to do that. We were able to run them out, generate the cash flow, and manage that in the appropriate way. That is exactly the same approach that we're going to take now.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have a question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to ask a question on the $11 billion of restructuring charge and $7 billion of cash outlay in another way. So I understand you're working on a variety of possible actions that you're not ready to disclose including because they may not be finalized, you have a variety of stakeholders and it might not be value maximizing to announce these actions sooner rather than later such as plans to exit a country or a region et cetera.","But with that said, now that you have disclosed the potential costs of restructuring, can you also disclose the potential benefits? So for example, what is the return on the $11 billion or the $7 billion? What is the payback period on that investment? What is the improvement to margin and free cash flow that that spending could bring about? Are these costs simply necessary to achieve your targeted 8% EBIT margin and high teens ROIC, or does this take you above and beyond the 2020 targets?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, so let me respond to that. So the way that I would think about that, Ryan, and obviously we'll provide more as we can as I mentioned earlier in the Q&A with Adam, think about it this way. We're showing you substantial parts of the business where we get extraordinary margins. And we've told you that we're only going to allocate capital to new investment opportunities going forward that generate the appropriate returns on capital.","In the process, we will either move the low performing parts of the business through fitness or other means in the lower left quadrant up or we will dispose of them. So if you think about what that business looks like, it's going to be a business that rocks. It's going to be a business that generates very strong operating margins just as we do in North America and very, very strong returns on invested capital. It will look different. It will be different but it will be a much stronger business. And that's exactly what's behind the restructuring charges that we've shared with you today as the, if you will, the creation and the design of that new business.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the last topic area I want to explore is Asia Pacific. So just looking at the China EBIT bridge on slide 28, and you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think the way to interpret this chart is that the change in China equity income is reflected in the JVs category. And then the volume\/mix and net pricing comes to the left of that relate to I guess consolidated China operations. Is that right? And if so, I had not realized that your consolidated operations there were material enough to result in that type of a swing factor, $141 million from volume\/mix, $101 million from net pricing. Maybe Bob can help me understand that.","And then secondly, Jim, I remember meeting with you shortly after 1Q results and you seemed pretty excited about the potential financial contribution of refreshing something like 80% or 90% of your portfolio in China this year. After your sales performance and profitability in China in 2Q, how are you feeling about the ability to benefit from those launches?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Let's let Jim Farley take that part first because I'm going to have Bob come back to the way the accounting is coming through. Jim?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Yeah, thanks for your question. We have 16 launches in China, all of them in the second half, so we are still very optimistic about the impact of those launches. We have addressed the go-to-market capabilities and gaps that we've seen and dealer profitability etcetera. Most of the launches like the new Focus or new Escort are sedan silhouettes and most of the profit uplift for us and others is really around utilities. So as we build out in 2019 and 2020 the whole new lineup of utilities in China, that's when we're going to get the lift. So it's going to be great to see that revenue build in the second half. The profit will come with our utilities.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","So let me answer the first part of the question Ryan. And that question is exactly why, really it's one of the reasons why we wanted to start disclosing China the way that we are, because of the significance of what goes on outside the joint ventures which is all that we disclosed previously. So you're correct in your understanding that the JV is the $192 million decline that you see in the call-out box under the JV column. We've put against that the royalties because they come from the JVs. And you can see that they're giving us less on a year over year basis because of the volume decline.","So when you think about the rest of the business and the consolidated business, think about it in normal situations we would see a good return, a good profit coming from the Ford imports and the major factor there would be the Explorer, which we've already announced we're going to localize. We have losses for Lincoln, no surprise because we've just started over the last several years to establish it. It's off to a good start. We even grew in the first quarter again. And that business model changes when we begin to localize, which starts in 2019. In fact, if anything, the business case is even stronger with the level of tariffs that we have today.","The piece that you don't see and that's changed and that should change in a positive way as we move forward is around what I call net engineering expense. So Ford Motor Company engineers for the joint ventures today and we get compensation for that product when it comes to market and they start building it, let's say, three or four years from now. So there's a lag between the two.","Jim has talked about the fact that we've got a big product onslaught that's underway, including BEVs, a much stronger lineup of SUVs, quite a number of products coming. So let me just give you a couple of things that will dimension this for you. If you go back to the 2015, 2016, 2014, 2015, 2016 period, the balance between the engineering that Ford incurred in the current year and the royalties that we were receiving from the joint ventures was pretty much balanced, 50\/50, so there was no net impact, if you will, on the bottom line because the expense was offset by the royalties.","In 2017, as we began this onslaught of engineering, if you will, for this big expansion of the portfolio, it started to tilt out of balance because we started to invest much more heavily in terms of engineering. But that's for products and an expanded portfolio that comes in years ahead. So we started to tilt out of balance in terms of net expense, net engineering expense. That net engineering expense this year, in an absolute sense, is about $600 million.","So we've gone from balance to a negative net engineering expense of $600 million, and that's a $300 million increase on a year over year basis, which is part of the headwinds that we were facing. That's not part of the guidance change because we had expected that, but that is definitely a major, major factor in terms of the absolutes that we're looking at. As we move forward and the engineering becomes more normalized and we start to see the volumes grow coming from the expanded portfolio, our expectation is that we go back to a much more balanced position, which will be part of the improvement that takes place over time in the China consolidated business.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I see. Thanks for the explanation.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Talk about North America. How are you thinking about the back half competition from GM and FCA? They both had pickup truck related headwinds due to their changeovers in the first half. And I think both of them today said they're targeting approximately 100,000 increases from 1H to 2H in their wholesales. So how are you thinking about that increased supply coming into the market for pickup trucks? And are you anticipating any pricing pressure or again that incremental competition for Ford North America in the second half of the year?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Jim?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","Well, we're really confident about our leadership position in the truck market. Obviously, we have very new product. Super Duty is doing extremely well. We have good stocks, but they're on the low side. We've had great transaction price improvements despite the sell down of multiple brands' trucks. So we continue to expand our sales and unit volume. We have a refreshed product. As you know, we have the diesel F-150 at 30 miles per gallon, which is great for merchandising and for customers. We have the new Raptor coming, which is very popular and a significant part of our mix now and Super Duty just continues to get traction. Customers seem to really appreciate the powertrain improvements of F-150 including the 10 speed transmission and the other changes we made. So we think we're in great shape.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So no anticipated headwinds. Pickup trucks continue to be strong for Ford. All right. My second question just on the Ford Autonomous Vehicle unit that was announced. How is that business currently capitalized in terms of cash that's been allocated to it? How are you thinking about potential third-party investments? How imminent could that be? Have you been approached? Are you approaching anyone, or is that more just setting it up down the road for potential investments?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Dave, this is Jim Hackett. Let me confirm that setting this up does a number of things for us. If you look at the slide 38, it's on the right, this is the part you probably wouldn't see if you were peering into Ford where all the capabilities that we've been in the middle of managing, we now tie that together.","And then the monetization on the other side, which is the promise of this whole business, which many of you have written about. This is expanding in terms of interest. Lots of people of course in other parts of our industry have received capital. So we've had people approach us. We're not disclosing any of that tonight, but yeah we've had interest. And I would just suggest to you a couple things. One, there's not going to be 10 winners in this space when we look back. There's going to be a few and we plan on being one of them. And we can look at the computer industry in a similar evolutionary way to see what happened as it took off.","Two, the Argo AI team, we just met with Bryan today, is really making progress. In fact the velocity of the way the vehicle learns, you got to think about the compounding that you know about from miles driven. The velocity of its learning is faster than some of the chip capabilities that we contract for, which said another way is we're already advancing the neural network learning of this system beyond what people thought it might do, which is great because that's what it has to have in order to be safe and deployable.","The third thing is that we've committed in our plan $3 billion of additional dollars. But that's a fair question to ask if there's more. And, Bob, I'm going to let you address that.","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, in terms of the funding, we are setting it up obviously as a separate legal entity. We've done the same thing with Ford Smart Mobility, so there's optionality there. And it is to allow for other partners or participants in the future. We will be establishing a balance sheet if you will for them, but for now it will be funded internally. And I wouldn't disclose any details around that.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I'll follow up later with a few more. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening, guys. Maybe just to follow up on this large spend of $7 billion in cash, $11 billion in EBIT. Bob, as you think about this as a CFO sort of philosophically, with maybe not even getting into details, I mean is this the kind of thing that you look at as an 18 to 24 month payback on a standard basis, or is this a sort of a much more holistic turn in the company to something that is totally different than what we're looking at right now?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, what I expect it to do is basically to, if you will, we've got anchors. We swim in the water with ankle weights, big ones. And what we want to do is we want to get them off so that the real underlying strength of this company can come through. And I can tell you it's kind of interesting. Again, I went back and looked at \u2013 I actually kept all this stuff. I'm not supposed to. I think it's way past the time, but I kept all the files from back in 2005, 2006, and I was looking at the projections that we made of what would come out of what we called The Way Forward plan. I mean, it paled in comparison versus what we actually delivered. So the power of what this company can bring in terms of returns if it just invests in the right things in the right way and just releases the anchor weights that we historically have carried around with us for whatever reasons will be tremendously powerful.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And that's where I want to sneak in to Adam and Ryan and all of your questions about how long have those weights been on those ankles. And so this is a credit to the team. In a very short time we're making decisions, planning. We're going to do this very thoughtfully, but with dispatch. And so I'm really proud of that and I'm a little mystified why that doesn't come through, because this, in previous calls, this was the question, are you really going to be candid, Jim, and take a deep look at things, and how quickly will you come to conclusions and what actions will you take? I do understand that it's fair that you want to know what kind of returns these bring and so we plan to update you on that. But I think this hard work has really happened, and so I'm happy where we stand tonight with what we know.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it sounds like you've identified sort of the outperforming products and the underperforming products. So if we look at the rough 6.5 million units of global volume that you have on a consolidated basis, I mean, are we looking at a third of that being sort of the high performing, a third being low performing and one-third in the middle being sort of stuff that you can fix and move up? I mean, what are the rough numbers? I mean, are we going to see potentially significantly lower volume in the future? Is the 6.5 million going to be 4 million or 3 million? Is that the kind of stuff that's going on in the thought process?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","Well, we're looking at that. I mean obviously, when you go market-by-market, and we even provided a few specific comments today that would tell you in certain regions that the majority of volume or revenue is actually low performing. We haven't done that across the board. But your supposition, John, is correct in terms of the magnitude of what we're having to address. But what I would also remind you is that there's a capital reallocation to new things.","So while certainly, some things will be left behind and they should be, there will be new things that we'll be investing in that actually are already more friendly to us, we're already strong, and we see ways that we can expand our portfolio in those areas, both if you will, from a horizontal standpoint as well as vertically. And also Jim is working to identify and get ahead of future trends and try to get us in the forefront of providing products to address those consumer needs, so we don't find ourselves in the future in the situation where we're under-indexed, for example, in utilities in many parts of the world where so many customers have moved.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","And I would add to that, Bryan, or John, that the fitness initiatives, which we've talked about, we've identified 19 of these. Those have come in richer than we originally projected. And so I'm going to assert here that as you stare at the volume as you do and you start looking at the profit performance of the business, it's still realizing lots of value that comes from these fitness initiatives.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, Jim, you've got a great management team underneath you with Joe and Jim and Marcy and a whole bunch of other people. The plans keep shifting and it's kind of difficult to operate in that kind of environment. Is there any risk of retention or any idea to go out with retention packages, because it sounds like this is going to be a pretty big tear up, and you want to make sure. I mean, it's a great team. You want to make sure you keep them together. How do you think about human capital in this equation?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","It is the center of gravity. And so the company, yeah, the company has addressed that and it's an important thing. In fact, it's so important, it's the kind of thing I discuss with the board quarterly just so that everyone's on the same page about how important these people are to us.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, Bob, when you looked at the outlook for cash flow, it didn't have the term but still positive. Is that still part of it? I mean, you're saying just the operating cash flow lower year over year versus 2017 but the still positive clause was taken out. Is that reading too much into it or?","Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.","No, no, I'm laughing because I looked at the slides this afternoon. I said, oh, I forgot to add that. Yes, positive cash flow but lower than last year. Thank you for asking that.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Still positive. Okay. Thank you so much.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Appreciate the question.","Operator","Okay. We will now take our last question from Mr. Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. We had a lot of discussion around strategic repositioning and restructuring, and I guess we're not going to get more answers there. So instead I want to kind of ask a question more about just the week to week operational management in the quarter and how comfortable you are between the two Jims, Joe, Bob, that you're on top of these issues in Europe, China as they develop.","I go back to in May, you reaffirmed your guidance despite the Meridian fire, which indicated things were on track in North America, but probably more broadly, there are at least no surprises or at least other offsets and now we have this. So can you give us a sense just, A, of kind of what really changed so rapidly towards the end of May and June? And B, whether you feel, because I know having been a consultant, it's easy to get to spend a lot of time planning with the five years out and forgetting about the five weeks out, how you make sure that part of the business is running well?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, there's a huge commitment to that. I mean, the way the company thinks about this, we think about it in time phases of now, near and far and each one of them gets attention. I think that from a now perspective, we really know our business. We know where profit's coming from, where the challenges come from.","I think when you stare at the China problem, we're taking full responsibility for what we would do differently with that. And it does go back to the things we've been saying, is that there was some what I would call weak signals that became profound about the product acceptance in China, Ford products and the aging. There were some things about the partnerships that need tuned up. We are a new team and we're committed to these folks and our dealers.","So I'm confident. This is why I said this in my comments, that the things, Brian, that you wonder slipped away here, we actually know how to do. We've got really good people and know how to fix this. There is a sense, I just want to show you the humility of this, China is a really competitive market, hypercompetitive, 20 to 30 competitors that we didn't have a decade ago that are indigenous. So, but I love a challenge like this. I think that our ability to understand customers and use and translate that into product is going to be one of the big pillars of our recovery.","As you think about though, the questions all the way through that time phase of just what we work on now, you can't forget the future. And in the middle of this, we've all been dealing in industry and business with trade and shifts in that regard. I'm really confident the team's been great at dealing with that. If you think about North America, we had all the effects, because we have supply at a higher percentage from North American steel than any of our competitors, same with aluminum. And here we are recording the kind of margins that we're seeing today.","So I'm really happy with the unexpected events. A fire hits the company, and it's amazing, amazing what the people at Ford did to turn that around. And you see the extent of what it could have done to damage our business, and we think we're going to actually recover by the end of the year there. So this is just an endorsement that these kinds of things aren't hard for us to manage. And I'm confident that I really believe in everybody here and our ability to address all these things.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And in terms of what led to guidance reaffirm to guidance cut?","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Well, I mean, you've had a long day in that regard, right, in terms of as you stare at the industry. So I think the headwinds relative to some of these unexpected things are why we've got to have confidence that this isn't being upended by trade and tariffs and things like that.","I'll just make a statement that, I've said this before, the trade structures always have existed. And the best times that you can see business perform inside trade is when there's equilibrium. And forget for a moment who's winning and who's losing. Just think about you design your business to the certainty of that. So all of us are learning how to kind of deal with that unexpected nature. And who can speculate how long the uncertainty will stand? But we're ready to deal with it.","I think when you think of Brexit, for example, it's probably lost in our reporting how profitable the UK normally is for us. And I'm reading about other aerospace companies who want to have you still waiting to see the evolution of that trade structure so they can make decisions. What we're telling you today with the forecast of the charges for restructuring, we're going ahead and starting to deal with the effects of all these things in a way that we get more control of our future.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just finally, are you through the WLTP changeover or is that going to pressure third quarter schedules as well?","James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.","That's a great question. We're through all of our past year cars. We have just S-MAX, Galaxy to go. We still have the commercial vehicles to go. It was definitely a lot of extra workload on the team, not only us, but also the homologation teams, but we are through it now. It's not a material impact to us as a company financially. We've probably had 0.1% or 0.2% maybe lost just because the delay in getting homologation done in terms of our sales. But we're on track and steaming along, which is really important for our light commercial lineup.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.","Thank you. Lynn, so I'd like to just make some closing comments. Thank you everyone for joining us again today. We're committed, as you've heard over and over, that we're taking appropriate and decisive action to drive profitable growth, maximize returns of our business over the long term. We're through this process of identifying opportunities by region to redesign our business model. We are actively reallocating capital to areas where we can generate the higher returns including understanding restructuring and strategic partnerships. Remember, we've announced a few of these. There is a sense of urgency in the company. We're committed to this EBIT margin target of 8%, the high teens ROIC in 2020. And we realize that the China and Europe performance need to be clearer to you and to us in terms of a positive future.","So thank you for following Ford and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Katina and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director, Ford Investor Relations. Please proceed.","George Sharp","Thank you, Katina and good morning. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our second quarter 2015 financial results.","Copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s investor and media websites. Now presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. Also with us is Ted Cannis, who will be replacing me as head of Investor Relations effective next week.","Today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and of course detailed in our SEC filings. Finally, any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck. Our Form 10-Q is planned to be released later today.","With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks, George. Good morning everybody. What I would like to do is start out within overview and then Bob will walk us through the slides.","The headline is that we had an outstanding second quarter. If you look at some of the highlights, we had the best automotive quarterly profit since 2000; the best quarter ever in North America; a second quarter record in Asia Pacific; strong continued results at Ford Credit; we roughly broke even in Europe; and we\u2019re on track to deliver a breakthrough year that we talked about at the beginning of the year.","As we rack up the numbers for the quarter, we achieved $2.9 billion in pre-tax profit, which is up 10% versus last year. Our net income was up 44% to $1.9 billion. Our operating margin, our automotive operating margin came in at 7.2%, which was up six-tenths of a point from last year. Our automotive operating related cash flow was a healthy $1.9 billion. Importantly our global market share grew for the second quarter in a row. Our wholesale volume was up.","Now revenue was flat and that was due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on our international operations. And I would note that in the quarter we had no special items. As a matter of fact, in the first half, we had no special items in the company.","Now as we go forward, we\u2019re going to stay very focused on our three priorities, and these drive all of our folks including myself every day we walk in the door and it\u2019s around accelerating the pace of progress of our One Ford plan; delivering product excellence with passion; and driving innovation in every part of our business. And I believe our results in this quarter show that the plan our people and our processes are delivering.","If we look at the first half, we racked up $4.3 billion in profit and we expect a stronger second half. On the balance of the year, this year is in total remains very busy. We have 16 new vehicle launches. And I\u2019m happy to say 12 of them have been completed. And importantly, we\u2019re delivering on quality. And actually all regions across the globe are seeing strong progress on quality so far this year. And it\u2019s really encouraging for us to see third-party validate the progress that we\u2019re making on bringing great quality in our products for our customers.","As we look at our business units, we expect particular strength in North America and that\u2019s because essentially we\u2019re benefitting from a full supply of new products like the F-150 and the Edge as well as Explorer. We now see the opportunity to be in the upper half of the 8.5% to 9.5% range in North American operating margin. Our new F-150 is a full production and customers love it. We\u2019ve also completed the launches for Ford Edge, Ford Explorer and Lincoln MKX. In Europe, we\u2019re equally busy. We\u2019ve had several new products launch in the first-half including the all new S-Max and the new Fiesta in Russia. And in Asia Pacific, we fulfilled our promise of 10 new plants with the 10th plant opening during the second quarter.","Now the balance of the year, we have four more new global vehicles to launch and they are all on track and it includes the Everest full-size SUV and the Taurus sedan in Asia and the F series medium duty truck which is going to be built in Ohio and the Mustang GT350, which will be built in our Flat Rock plant in Michigan.","And speaking of our products, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the customer reaction that we\u2019re getting to our new products. In North America, the new F-150 is a smash hit; it has record transaction prices. And for those of you that saw that last week J.D. Power APEAL awards came out and the F-150 was the award winner for pickups. And also AutoPacific came out with their Vehicle Satisfaction Awards and the F-150 received the highest vehicle satisfaction ever for a full-size pickup. Our new Edge, well we had record sales in the second quarter; Explorer, in the second quarter, our sales were up 30%. In Europe, we\u2019re gaining market share and that\u2019s being led by transit. And as you know, we\u2019ve basically redone our entire Transit lineup in the last year. Our new Mondeo and also our SUVs are doing well.","In Asia Pacific, Escort is the fastest growing nameplate in the segment and it competes in the Sales-segment. Mustang is already the best selling sports car from a volume brand in China. And down in South America, the Mondeo now leads the segment in Argentina.","So while we\u2019re delivering today and staying very focused on that, we\u2019re also intensely focused on the future because we believe that we really are in a period of change and disruption in the industry unlike we have seen in many, many years. And you can see that it manifesting itself in car sharing and autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and new mobility solutions. And rather than seeing that as a threat, we see that as a huge opportunity as a company. And we\u2019re really encouraging our organization actually to disrupt our own business model and really take advantage of the spirit of innovation that we have at Ford, going all the way back to our founder Henry Ford.","And our company vision is pretty simple: It\u2019s to make people\u2019s lives better. So, this is about nurturing our core business, but also embracing emerging businesses whether they be products or services. And earlier this year, we launched what we call Ford Smart Mobility. And this really is our plan to go to the next level in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and big data. And we launched 25 experiments earlier this year and now it\u2019s really exciting because we\u2019re moving now from experimentation to the start of implementation on a number of pilots. And I can assure you that as we go forward, we\u2019re going to share more details in the coming months about the progress that we\u2019re making.","So stepping back, overall it was one of the strongest quarters in our recent history. It was a great first-half. The second half is going to be even better. And we\u2019re now more confident than ever that we\u2019ll deliver our breakthrough year.","So with that, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Bob?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Mark. Just in terms of process first, I am just going to go through selected slides today, so I\u2019ll be calling out the slide numbers of the deck that was published. So, follow me that way.","Let me provide a bit of context first, and I am on slide four. If you go back to the beginning of the year, we laid out a year that was going to start slower and build momentum into the second half which we expected to be the strongest of the year and then ultimately to a breakthrough year. And I have to tell you, based on the good start to the year that we had in the first quarter and what is clearly outstanding results for the company here in the second quarter, strong first-half, we are clearly on a path towards a breakthrough year which includes a good performance that will build on what we have done here in the first-half, something that we\u2019re really, really excited about.","What I\u2019d like to do now is start going through the details. I won\u2019t touch on the details of this slide because Mark has touched on it. So, let\u2019s just dive right into the sector results here on slide five.","So, if you look at the upper left, you can see that we earned $2.9 billion in the quarter for the company on an operating basis. We had no special items in the quarter. We were up 10% from a year ago, and this was a third best quarter of company operating performance since we came out of the great recession. On the slide, you can see the automotive results were strong at $2.4 billion and financial services at nearly $0.5 billion with Ford Credit itself just over $0.5 billion. So both sectors contributed to the performance; and as you can see below the chart, both contributed to the improvement compared with the second quarter a year ago and both contributed to stronger results compared with the first quarter. Automotive fairly was the big driver between the two segments but both were positive contributors. ","Let\u2019s go on now and look more deeply at the auto sector on slide six. Here are key metrics and if you start up on the upper right, you can see the $2.4 billion pretax profit in the quarter also up 10% and this was the best automotive profit that we have generated since 2000. Results were better than they were a year ago. They were also better than the prior quarter and in both instances, that improvement was due to favorable market factors. So that\u2019s volume, mix and net pricing.","The margin was strong at 7.2%. We did deliver higher wholesales up about 2% that was North America and Europe. Revenue was about flat and this was inclusive of just over $2 billion of adverse currency effects from translation of local currencies, revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. If you look in the lower left, you can see the SAAR was down on a year-over-year basis about 0.5 million units; this was driven by Asia Pacific which includes China which we\u2019ll talk about later. South America was down as well as was Middle East and Africa. Our market share was up as Mark mentioned. For the second consecutive quarter, it was up a tenth to 7.6% and we saw improvements in South America and Europe and in Middle East and Africa.","Let\u2019s now go to slide eight and let\u2019s look at the absolute of the sector in the quarter. Let\u2019s start with North America which clearly was a driver of the overall performance. It was North America\u2019s best ever quarterly profit. I\u2019ve probably said that five times and maybe six times if I can do it again. But it was a fantastic quarter for North America. It also drove the year-over-year improvement and the quarter-to-quarter improvement. But there is actually a lot of good things that are happening in the operations outside of North America as well. Let\u2019s look at them individually first.","So, Asia Pacific had a record quarter for the profit. We did say potentially a breakeven result when we met with you last time but the team did a fantastic job of delivering a good cost performance in the quarter which generated the good results that we see today. And I want to call out Europe which even though was at about breakeven, there is a lot of positive things that we see both in external environment in Europe but also on our own performance that I\u2019ll touch on in just a minute.","If you take these operations collectively, the ones outside North America, they approached breakeven. So letting the North American profits essentially flow through and they collectively improved versus the first quarter and also versus the year-over-year results second quarter of last year. So, very, very pleased with the performance across the board, the breadth of it as well as the depth of it, particularly in North America.","Let\u2019s go on now and we\u2019ll start going through the business units on the next slide which is slide nine and this is North America. The North America consistently has been profitable since 2010. It\u2019s average to margin of over 9% and let\u2019s jump right to the margin. Here you can see just a fantastic result of 11.1% in the quarter. And I want to highlight that North America did not benefit from positive year-over-year performance from F-150. F-150 is fairly doing very well but it was still in launch phase during the second quarter; we only reached full production very late in the quarter. Wholesales were actually down 25,000 units on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So, this performance was a very broad-based performance which is one of the things that we feel so excited about when we look at North America.","If you look at the profit, we\u2019ve already talked about it being a record but I can do it once more, $2.6 billion; it was up year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter due to favorable market factors. Now, I\u2019m not going to go through slide 10 which is the details of the year-over-year but if you look at the pricing performance, kind of unusually; you\u2019ll see that we had higher pricing and that was not just F-150 that was across many products in the portfolio. We also have lower incentives. So, it was a very powerful quarter in terms of our pricing performance.","Operating margin, I\u2019ve touched on. Let\u2019s go over and look at the top line. The top line was up; wholesales were up and that\u2019s despite the decline in F-150 that I mentioned. And in terms of revenue that was up as well. And that did include headwinds from exchange on the revenues that we earned in Canada and Mexico.","Looking at SAAR; SAAR was up on a regional basis and in the U.S. share was down however and this was due to the launch effects of the F-150. It\u2019s not shown here but our retail of retail share of U.S. is actually up a tenth. In terms of the full year, we continue to expect our profits going to be better than it was last year. And as Mark mentioned, we clearly see the opportunity based on the first half performance to generate a return that\u2019s in the upper half of the 8.5% to 9.5%.","Mark, any comments on that\u2026?","Mark Fields","Yes. Let me just give some perspective on F-150 because obviously there is a lot of interest in it. First off, we are really excited and we\u2019re seeing strong demand for the new F-150. It\u2019s turning on our dealers\u2019 lots of more than twice as fast as the segment as a whole. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing record transaction prices with lower incentives versus last year. The mix is rich. We talked about the third party awards that we were winning in that product. And more basically now, we are at full production at the plants and we expect to hit normal levels of inventory by the end of the third quarter. So, we could not be more pleased and confident where we are with the F-150.","Bob Shanks","Yes. It\u2019s really a great performance and certainly something that\u2019s going to drive the performance in the second half.","Mark Fields","Yes, absolutely.","Bob Shanks","Okay, let\u2019s go on to the next region; we\u2019ll talk about South America on slide 11. So looking at South America, I mean the first thing you have to talk about is the external environment. It is very, very tough, particularly in Brazil. And we\u2019re not seeing any good signs from recent economic indicators, fiscal actions in Brazil have been taken to improve the economy longer term and that probably means more pain in the short-term. So, no signs at this point of reaching bottom. Our team is managing very, very well and very proactively in this environment and we believe that they\u2019re positioning our business for recovery, once it does occur. But again, no signs of a bottom and certainly we\u2019re not talking about a recovery today. But having said that, certainly our One Ford product strategy is paying off; we saw strong share growth in the region and in Brazil once again that was driven by the all new car, but we also saw the Fusion leading its segment once again in Brazil and we saw the F-Series and the Cargo leading the semi-light and the light segments; also proud to say that the Argentina -- in Argentina that the Ford brand was again number two there in terms of market share.","The loss in the quarter was $185 million that was a pretty good improvement year-over-year that was due to higher net pricing. Two elements of that: One is the fact that we\u2019re recovering or trying to recover inflation which is very high in the region as well as the adverse operating exchange effects of the weak currencies but we did also see positive pricing from new product in particular, the car. The results were pretty much the same on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","If we look at Wholesales that was down, that was due to the lower industries. And if we look at revenue that was down sharply as well, again due to lower industries but also exchange. In fact about two-thirds of the overall decline in revenue was due to the weaker local currencies. If we look at the full year, we continue to expect a loss but we expect that loss to be lower than what it was a year ago.","Alright, let\u2019s go on and we\u2019ll go to slide 13 and we\u2019ll look at Europe. Actually feel quite encouraged by what we saw in Europe in the quarter. We approached breakeven which is about where were, a year ago, as you can see here. We did do better on a quarter-to-quarter basis and that was due to market factors. But let me talk about some things that we think indicate that there are some positive things going on here and certainly make us feel that we\u2019re on a good path towards profitability.","If you look first at the external environment, we\u2019re seeing modest but good growth in the euro area, stronger growth in the UK in terms of GDP. If you look at industry sales, we\u2019re seeing growth in total Europe and that\u2019s despite big decline in Russia and we\u2019re seeing growth in Europe 20. Our wholesale volume is doing well, it\u2019s up in total. If you look at share, in terms of total Europe, it was up in the second quarter; it was also up in the first half which isn\u2019t shown here. If we look at Europe 20, it was flat in the quarter but it also was up in the first half.","The revenue decline that was more than explained by exchange translation, so again on a local basis, we\u2019re seeing growth in revenue. There are a few other things that I just want to highlight in terms of the results for you to think about.","If you look at slide 14, which we won\u2019t go to now, but you\u2019ll see in the callout box for volume and mix that we took a hit in the quarter of about $150 million from the fact that in the quarter, stocks only increased by 1,000 units. Normally in the second quarter in Europe for seasonal reasons, we\u2019ve got the plant shutdowns in the third quarter; they\u2019ll have a stock build, which is what we had last year. So, on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re taking about $150 million hit in the quarter because we did not have that normal stock build. Several reasons for that, first of all, we had a pretty decent level of stock going into the quarter but during the quarter we had industry strikes in Turkey that affected our operations there, that limited the supply of transits back into our European operations and then very late in the quarter, we had launches of the all new S-Max and the Galaxy, which constrained supply of those products in the quarter.","Another factor to think about is that in the quarter compared with the year ago, we had higher pension cost. These are lower discount rates that we saw at the end of last year that are increasing the amortization of losses related to our pension obligations in Europe. So, think of this as sort of a penalty for something that\u2019s already happened in the past; it\u2019s non-cash. The underlying run rate of the business is better. But I just wanted to call that out for your awareness. And then the last thing I guess, I\u2019d mention is a year ago -- we talked about it year ago, we did benefit from a onetime reserve release associated with our Cologne investment agreement, so that did not obviously occur this year and we still delivered about the breakeven result that you see today.","So we feel that the European transformation plan is continuing to progress. We clearly have to push even further on brand, product and cost but we do feel that we\u2019re on track towards profitability.","In terms of the full year, it\u2019s not going to happen this year. We still expect the loss; it will be better than it was a year ago. I will say that we do think the second half results will be worse than the first half and that is due to normal seasonal factors.","So with that what I\u2019d like to do is turn to Mark to see if he\u2019s got any comments on Europe.","Mark Fields","Yes, just some perspective on the market in Europe. We remain cautiously optimistic on the continued industry growth in the second half. If you look at the channel mix, it\u2019s fairly stable year-over-year. Commercial vehicles encouragingly are up more than passenger cars. And as you know that\u2019s a good indicator for where the economy is going. Pricing, we\u2019ve seen some modest improvement but incentives obviously still remain high. And it\u2019s interesting; we\u2019re seeing some trends in Europe that we saw during the North American recovery. In particular, we\u2019re seeing some pent-up demand, obviously not to the same degree, but some of that pent0up demand. And we\u2019re seeing a mix improvement. When customers are ordering their vehicles, they are ordering a more well-equipped and that\u2019s exactly what we saw here in North America and that\u2019s helped a bit of the pricing environment. So overall, we\u2019re seeing some green shoots, but still we know we got a lot of work to do.","Bob Shanks","Let\u2019s go on and I\u2019ll talk about Middle East and Africa. This is our youngest and smallest business unit, I just want to remind everybody, this is a region that is 1.4 million consumers and it\u2019s growing about 4% or 5% a year. And we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re doing here and what the team is working on to establish a good position for us as this region begins to take off. In the quarter, results moved from the small profit last year to a small loss this year and this was driven by essentially production timing differences. Most of the volume that we actually sell in Middle East and Africa is sourced from other regions. So as a result, we\u2019ve got long order and lead-times since we\u2019re going to get volatility by quarterly results and certainly really that\u2019s what we saw this quarter.","In terms of the full year, we continue to expect the results to be about breakeven. So, not a lot to talk about today on Middle East and Africa, but team is working hard to really position us for substantial growth here in the years ahead.","Let\u2019s go on to slide 16 and we\u2019ll talk about Asia Pacific. So Asia Pacific, a lot of excitement here with record for the quarter, operating margin of nearly 8% and this was despite lower industry sales including lower industry sales in China. Also just want to mention that we also continued to incur cost in the quarter that is for growth that we\u2019ll see in the future. We also just launched the Hangzhou, China and the Sanand, India plants. So, we had probably more cost of revenue if you will in the second quarter. We\u2019re certainly going to see a lot of revenue coming down at those plants in the balance of the year.","The profit did improve year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. I want to highlight that that was actually due to operations outside of China. So, we saw a good improvement in ASEAN, Australia and India, and really excited to see the progress the team has made in these parts of the business. Because we\u2019ve been talking about them for some time as areas that we are really focused on to try to get them moving forward in a positive manner. And the progress that team made here in the second quarter was very, very encouraging.","For the region, wholesale volume, revenue and share were down year-over-year due to our consolidated operations -- I am sorry, actually share was down a bit. But within China, we saw wholesales about flat; share in the quarter at 4.7% was actually up a tenth and that equaled the record that we set in the third quarter of 2014. So good results in Asia Pacific; clearly some concerns around China and the slower growth, but for the full year we continue to expect strong results from Asia Pacific and expect those results to exceed those of last year. And Mark, you might want to say something about China.","Mark Fields","Yes, let me just give some perspective on the China market because there is obviously a lot of discussion around it. It\u2019s clear we\u2019ve seen a market slowdown in the market there in the industry. We\u2019ve seen commercial vehicles actually come down more than past year vehicles which again is a bit of an indicator to us. And that in turn is putting pressure on the likely suspects around pricing, but we\u2019re also -- we\u2019ve also experienced negative pricing in this market for quite some time, but it\u2019s continuing now. But we have to put this market into perspective. This is -- it\u2019s the biggest market in the world right now. By our forecast it\u2019s going to grow to about 30 million vehicles in the next 5 to 10 years. So we\u2019re still very bullish on China, but it\u2019s going to go through its fluctuations and that\u2019s what happens in emerging markets and we\u2019re going to work our way through it in a positive way, and grow the business.","Bob Shanks","Let\u2019s go on to the last of the business units and this one, Ford Credit. Once again, Ford Credit had a very strong quarter and as I mentioned, generated that profit of over $0.5 billion. It was an improvement year-over-year and that was due to higher volume that was driven by higher consumer receivables and also with leasing increase in North America. Mix was favorable. We also saw recurrence of large insurance losses that we saw a year ago due to storms in North America. Ford Credit\u2019s business and credit conditions continue to be very healthy. Our origination practices remain consistent. Costs at Ford Credit are well-controlled and very much in line with expectations. Credit losses remain at historically low levels; delinquencies also remain low; and repossessions also are at historically low levels. So everything that we can see in the business looks robust and very, very positive as we look at the future.","In terms of our full year guidance, we\u2019re reconfirming that guidance and that includes the pre-tax profit that would be equal to or higher than in 2014.","So with that let\u2019s move on and look at automotive cash. We had very strong cash flow in the quarter, automotive operating-related cash flow you can see here of $1.9 billion. If you go back to the first quarter, we had some pretty large debt repayments and also we had some -- we had characterized most of our pension contributions in the first quarter and we said at that time that we would not see that as we move out the first quarter. So, we\u2019re delivering on that promise because if you look at the $1.9 billion that effectively is flowing through to the change in our gross cash position other than the dividends in the quarter which were about $600 million and that balance is the compensation related share repurchase program.","So, we ended the quarter with $20.7 billion of cash and marketable securities; subtract from that the automotive debt of $13.7 billion which was up a bit due to funding in Brazil; we ended the quarter with net cash of $7 billion. Liquidity was also strong at $31.7 billion.","So why don\u2019t we go now and move into the future and we\u2019ll look at the business environment on slide 21. So, this is pretty simple. We are projecting a global GDP to grow in the 2.5% to 3% range; this is driven by the U.S., by China, the modest growth that we\u2019re seeing in Europe, euro areas as well as stronger growth in the UK, little concerns still about South America as well as Russia; watching China closely but overall expect pretty good growth on a global basis. Now that is not translating into growth in global automotive industry sales this year which is unusual. And that\u2019s largely because the strong growth in China as Mark and I both talked about that is not translating at least according to our point of view, into growth in China and also Japan which we haven\u2019t talked about today; it is growing, but we expect the Japanese industry to decline in 2015 versus 2014.","So with that let\u2019s go on to slide 22 and now I\u2019ll end my comments on planning assumptions and key metrics. We are upgrading our outlook for the Europe 20 industry; we\u2019re taking that up to 15.7 million to 16.2 million units. We are downgrading China, as Mark talked about, to 23 million to 24 million units and then everything else of the other financial metrics on track. We\u2019re clearly on a track to achieve our total company pre-tax profit guidance of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. So, just seven words to leave with you today outstanding quarter, strong first half, breakthrough year.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks Bob. So, let me bring this altogether. Obviously our plan and our priorities are unchanged. And we\u2019re on track to deliver our near and our long-term objectives and they have remained the same and that\u2019s about being the top five in global sales, getting a better balance of profits and sales around the world, targeting 8% plus operating margins globally, being in the top quartile of total shareholders returns and then highly regarded by all our stakeholders.","We have our three priorities on accelerating our pace of progress on a One Ford plan, delivering our product excellence with passion and of course driving innovation in every part of our business. And the way I described it is, it\u2019s about having one foot firmly planted into today and staying riveted on the business and delivering today\u2019s results. But also one foot firmly planted in tomorrow and taking the point of view on that future and rewinding back to the day and making sure we\u2019re taking the decisions to maximize our success in that timeframe. So, we\u2019re really pushing ourselves to think, to act and disrupt like a startup company. And that really means trying to anticipate customers\u2019 wants and needs in that five, and ten, and fifteen-year down the road timeframe.","The second quarter, I think it shows more proof that we have the right strategic framework; we have the right process; and importantly, the right team. And again, it\u2019s one of the strongest quarters in our recent history. It\u2019s a great first half. And we expect the second half to be even better.","So with that why not we open to the phone lines.","George Sharp","Thanks Mark. Now, we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin as unusual with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow for as many participants as possible, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Katina, can we have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault, representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault","First, can we just get back to the supply of the F-150; I guess just a little bit more detail there. I think originally you guys were expecting to have that ramped up sort of midsummer and then I think it became late summer and now it\u2019s more towards the end of the third quarter. What have the issues been and how much confident do you have just surrounding the fix that\u2019s in place to try and get that supply up there? So that\u2019s my first question, just an update on that.","Mark Fields","Well to put it into perspective, I think we\u2019ve always said that by the summer we would be at full production, late in the second quarter we\u2019d be at full production which we are. And we\u2019re on track to, as I mentioned earlier, to make sure our inventory is at normal inventory level by the end of third quarter because you know Patrick there\u2019s a little bit of a lag time as we get both plants up to production fully that we have to then shift those to our dealers and then also to fulfill fleet orders. So, we\u2019re on track with our launch as with always launches. We work with our suppliers to make sure it\u2019s successful and we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re very confident in the product and we couldn\u2019t be again more happy with the kind of response we\u2019re getting with it. We expect in the second half as we get up to stocking levels, we\u2019ll fulfill more fleet orders and we expect our performance in the marketplace to grow.","Patrick Archambault","So it sounds like the operational stuff is well in hand. Maybe that dovetails well with my next question which is just on the pricing, which was obviously very, very strong, both on the incentive side and the pure pricing. How do we think about -- maybe that\u2019s sort of a Bob question, but how do we think about that being carried over into the second half? I know that -- I think you sort of launched with some of the higher trim level models, how to Dearborn [ph] first and I think some of the other stuff as less contended but just how do we think about those numbers being carried into the second half?","Bob Shanks","If I remember correctly, in the first quarter was at over 70% mix. I think it was a high series and I think we\u2019re at 50% [ph] and I think normal rates, if you go back to the old model, was around 30%. We\u2019ll have to wait and see where this settles out because the demand for this, particularly the higher series is quite strong. And as you saw probably was it this week we launched the Limited. So we got more to come that Limited coming in the winter; we\u2019ve got Raptor coming next year. So, we\u2019re not done plumbing every dollar of revenue we can out of that product. So, we\u2019re very excited about that and the customers are demanding that. As we look at the balance of the year, we expect pricing to continue to be a strong factor in North America\u2019s performance. We clearly expect North America to be stronger in a second half than the first. F series actually did not positively contribute to the bottom line in the quarter because of the fact that was in a launch phase, but we certainly expect in the third and fourth quarters on a year-over-year basis that it will be a positive contributor as we get, as Mark said, the stocks up to normal levels by the end of the third quarter, not just numbers of units but also the derivatives in the series and the mix and so forth.","So, you will see strong pricing coming from North America and not just F series but even in the quarter. F series clearly was a factor but there was a lot of different product lines and we were able to generate incremental pricing opportunities on in the quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Galves who representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Dan Galves","Just sticking with North America, can you give us a little bit of perspective on pricing versus material cost ex commodities which was I think slightly negative year-over-year, if you take those two together? And also if you can talk about the warranty freight positive as well whether that was some sort of non-repeat or whether that\u2019s a sustainable kind of improvement?","Bob Shanks","Yes, I\u2019ll comment and if Mark has anything afterwards, he can supplement. If you -- I\u2019d like to go back to what I said in the first quarter, because we actually I think got a very similar question then. I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to look at, at the way that you phrased the question.","We clearly are seeing product costs go up as we invest in the new products and we also see increases in the structural costs as we do, so because of the investments in the plants and so forth. But we\u2019ll get revenue for that and we just talk about for F series but you also get positive mix and then you grow the business, you get volume as well. So, really what you want to look at in terms of what\u2019s happen to the total contribution margin of the business is to look at what you are getting on volume, what are you getting on mix and what are you getting on pricing relative to the product cost and some of the structural costs that you build in to business. And as you can see in this quarter that is what generated the improvement year-over-year. And I\u2019ll mention once again, that was not because the F-150. F-150 really comes on stream in terms of the positive effect in the third and the fourth quarters. And so that will simply add to what we\u2019ve already seen here in the second quarter. So, to me it\u2019s much more -- it\u2019s a broader view of what we\u2019re doing with new products and just looking just those two categories that you\u2019d mentioned Dan.","In terms of contribution cost, our contribution cost we had favorable performance year-over-year on warranty as well as on freight. And duties on warranty that was combination of things, it was the non-repeat of some large field service actions that we had last year; we also had some supplier recoveries against some of those actions and other actions as well it might have been in different periods. And we also, as I mentioned, have the good news on freight. And I think that was largely because we had a lot of premium freight last year that we didn\u2019t repeat this year.","So going forward, we expect that we\u2019ll continue to have good performance on -- as Mark said, the quality is extremely positive not only in North America but around the world. But field service actions, they happen when they happen based on the data that\u2019s in front of us and kind of hard to forecast that one. But right now, everything looks good.","Dan Galves","Second question related to China, I mean great performance in the quarter with earnings up on flat revenue, flat wholesale volumes. Just checking like kind of if you could give us anymore detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of pricing? How deteriorated versus -- is the pricing pressure worse today than it\u2019s typically? And also it looks like inventory is up quite bit on a year-over-year basis; is that anything to be concerned about or is that are you at normal levels now? Thank you.","Mark Fields","On the inventory, it is up and part of that is due to as we were launching some new products and localizing and we had some bridging stocks. But also as the market has come down, we\u2019re implementing our process which is matching production to demand. So, you can see that in our production for the third quarter which is up healthy, it was up healthier and we\u2019ve taken the appropriate actions to get the inventory in line. So overall, we feel pretty good about the inventory.","And in terms of the pricing environment, as we mentioned, listen over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen negative pricing in the 1% to 4% range and this year we probably see it in the 4% to 5% range. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more and it depends on region and segment. But I think the approach from our team is -- and this is I think the silver lining of a little bit of a downturn in Europe. This is the first time our team is going through a downturn in Europe and we have some very experienced folks\u2026","Bob Shanks","China.","Mark Fields","Sorry, in China and we have some very experienced folks both in our operations there and in our JV partner and it\u2019s a great learning opportunity, so that when it goes down we know how to manage through and we know the revenue in a declining market comes off fast. And that\u2019s why the big effort on cost and that was one of the elements that drove our performance in the second quarter and our team will stay focused on that at the same time launching five new products in the balance of this year to drive our top-line.","Bob Shanks","And Dan, I just want to supplement. If you look at our guidance on production in the second quarter for Asia Pacific, we originally were at 395,000 units; last year came in at 362,000, so 33,000 units down. And back to Mark\u2019s point, this was a reflection of the team acting very quickly and very proactively as we saw the softening and taking production out ASAP. That\u2019s what we do anytime, anywhere that we see something like that happening, on the upside the reverse and the team really staying on top of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and protecting the level of dealer stocks that we should have.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli representing Citi. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli","I just want to go back to North America, really strong quarter, 11% margins; you mentioned you have the F-150 really contribute in the second half of the year. Adjusting that the second half margin guidance is maybe implied around 10% which is still pretty strong, but down a bit maybe from Q2, can you help us just walk through couple of puts and takes around the second half outlook as compared to the second quarter?","Bob Shanks","We\u2019re going to have a fantastic second half and we had a really good second quarter. So, I actually kind of see the first half performance of 9.1% sort of going up a tick, if you will, as we go into the second half. And that will be aided by what I mentioned earlier in terms of the F-150 contributing positively in the second half versus the first half with the launch effect. So, I don\u2019t know more to say, we\u2019re going to go from really good grade. It\u2019s hard to parse really fabulous performance.","Mark Fields","And also within that we have to look at the market and there is a lot of discussion around the market being at a peak. I really term it as a plateau because when you look at what\u2019s driving the market, it\u2019s really around replacement demand. And in any mature market, about 80% of the industry in any given year is driven by replacement demand. And we know the age of the car park which is over 11 years old. So we think that bodes well. Within the market, we\u2019re seeing actually incentives. We have to watch that closely because incentives are up year-over-year when you look at the U.S. market than actually been up every month. But interestingly, incentives are up every month on cars; they are actually about even to down on trucks. So that\u2019s an area we got to stay focused on, but we expect our performance to continue to be strong in North America.","Itay Michaeli","And then just my second question on Asia Pacific and again very good results, can you remind me what went right in the quarter? I think in the first quarter call, you talked maybe about I think breakeven second quarter on Asia-Pac, so maybe what went right there in the second quarter, if I missed it?","Bob Shanks","Yes, I just touched on that in my comments. Itay, it\u2019s cost performance. Mark and I were sitting here three months ago, they looked more like a breakeven type performance, but the team did despite the production adjustments that we referenced earlier, the team did a great job on cost performance. The other thing that was great about the quarter is the performance improvements that we saw outside of China. So that was another big contributor, the improved results in ASEAN, Australia and India. As you know those are areas we\u2019ve been focused on trying to get them moving forward in fastest manner and we did get traction on that in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan representing UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan","I just want to understand why did you not take the total company guidance up, given you had $4.3 billion in the first-half, if you set the second half, at least earlier you set second half stronger. What keeps you cautious from picking it quite higher into that range?","Bob Shanks","Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re being cautious. We think that the range covers the likely outcomes if you think about the first half, we made $4.3 billion, so that gives us the opportunity to do what is at 5.2 [ph] in the second half, that\u2019s a much stronger second half than the first half to be at the top end of the guidance. So I think we just feel comfortable that there is no need to change the guidance and we believe that at the top end, that covers the potential upside if you will that we\u2019re looking at.","Colin Langan","Should we still think the cadence being stronger in the second half for the total company or is that changed given how strong Q2 was?","Bob Shanks","I\u2019m sorry. Could you say that again?","Colin Langan","Should we still think that second half is stronger than the first half or is that changed given Q2\u2026?","Bob Shanks","No. We definitely think the second half is stronger. I mean, if we just multiply the first half by two, we\u2019re at eight, six [ph] and we think that we\u2019ve got, as I mentioned, clearly upside opportunity in the second half and expect to deliver that.","Colin Langan","And my second question, can you clarify the F-150 pricing? Obviously there is a local dealer advertising at $10,000 incentive. Has there been a change at all month-over-month in the F-150 incentive structure? Obviously it\u2019s created a lot of headlines.","Mark Fields","Colin, it did generate a lot of headlines. And as you know, incentives and rebates, they are normal part of the competitive environment and we use them to either encourage customers to buy more fully equipped vehicles or to finance it forward credit or to reward loyalty. But overall when you look nationally, our incentives on F-150 are around $3,800 or so. It\u2019s down year-over-year. That $10,000 figure that was thrown out, part of it is based on incentives that are available on all vehicles that dealers can add up to and in some cases, some dealer associations, of those a small minority of them decided to add to that. So in some cases, it was $10,000 but overall when you look at our average incentive of around $3,900 and it being lower than the segment and much lower than some of our competitors, I think it reflects the strength of the product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy, representing Bank of America. Please proceed.","John Murphy","Just to parse by results Bob just to understand North America little more. I hate to do this, but on slide 10 there is one number, the stocks positive 451; is that just a reversal of something that was unusual last year and we\u2019re looking at more normal or is that an unusual benefit this quarter?","Bob Shanks","Now, what is was, as we grew stocks by 7,000 units within this quarter and in fact if you go to appendix 6, it\u2019s pretty clear. I am sorry, we actually reduced stocks. We reduced stocks by -- actually for the region we increased stocks by 7,000 and we reduced in North America and the U.S. but we had increases elsewhere and last year, we actually had a decline. So it\u2019s the absence of the stock reduction last year on a relative basis that\u2019s generating the good news.","Mark Fields","John, part of it is, the industry is growing. So clearly you expect our inventories to keep up. To Bob\u2019s point, overall when you look at it, our inventory levels here in the U.S. are about 608,000 and that\u2019s down from about 643,000 last year. So our day supply are about 70 and this time last year it was about 72. So, we feel good about our inventory levels.","Bob Shanks","But the number you\u2019re talking about the 451, that\u2019s a non-repeat of a stock reduction last year; it was a smaller stock reduction this year.","John Murphy","Yes. So, last year was a little bit more unusual, this year was normal. It\u2019s really as what I trying to understand that\u2019s the thing what\u2019s going.","Bob Shanks","Yes.","John Murphy","And then staying on North America, I mean, Mark, you alluded to the medium-duty or the Super Duty launches that\u2019s upcoming in Kentucky Truck and that\u2019s not something getting lot of headlines but that could be a real big benefit above and beyond what\u2019s going on with the F-150 on the truck side. Just to understand if you guys can talk about that a little bit and when sort of there might be a little bit of a weight in results because of that changeover and when the benefits should ultimately come because that could be a big part of the story as well?","Mark Fields","Well, we\u2019ll get into that more as we start talking about 2016 but focusing on 2015, obviously in the next month or so, we\u2019re going be launching the medium-duty truck out of Ohio. And that\u2019s a really important product because that only -- we have a lot of customers and have those products, it drives a lot of ancillary commercial businesses across our other vehicle lines. So, we\u2019re excited about getting that up and running. And keep in mind that\u2019s a product we\u2019re bringing back and manufacturing here in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas","Bob, first a quick one. Can you tell us current capacity utilization at Changan Ford, even roughly to the nearest 500 basis points?","Bob Shanks","No. We don\u2019t provide that information publicly. The stock level -- the capacity is relatively well utilized but Hangzhou for example which we just launched that\u2019s got about 250? 250, I think in that particular plant but we\u2019re just launching it. So we\u2019ve got the Taurus coming later, so there\u2019s a lot of room for us to grow into that plant.","Adam Jonas","And Mark, just a follow-up, so I\u2019ve checked the last four earnings call transcripts and I searched Ford like Apple and Google and Uber and actually none of them have come up in any of your prepared remarks or in the Q&A of the transcripts. I take on board fully what you said about trying to create the startup culture and disrupt yourself and that was very evident when we toured the research facilities in Palo Alto. So can you share with us management\u2019s and the board\u2019s, say high level thoughts on whether players like Apple, Google or Uber are actually emerging competitors, not just that represents an opportunity but could they also be competitors in designing engineering cars and the things that you do? Thanks.","Mark Fields","We haven\u2019t heard what Apple is doing. To my knowledge, they haven\u2019t announced anything. But from our standpoint, you know our process, we\u2019re always looking at the business environment. And we\u2019re seeing folks like Uber, who knows what Apple is going to do or Google is going to do? First off, we think -- first off that it\u2019s positive for the industry in terms of generating competition and innovation and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us. But sure, we could see some of those players be competitors to us, in some cases they could be partners to us et cetera. We\u2019re looking at the whole waterfront here. And we know there\u2019s a lot of people that are interested in the automotive space and would like to extract some value out of that. We\u2019re very cognizant of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman, representing J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman","You talked in your prepared remarks about tracking in the upper half of the 8.5% to 9.5% North American margin target for the full year. It seems pretty easily attainable now; so, you\u2019re already at 9.1% in the first half, at least according to IHS you\u2019re going to build 19% more F-150s in the back half than the first which by the math should help quite a bit. So, I understand there are lot of moving pieces, not just the F150. But does the 2Q result now introduce the possibility that you will not just be in the top out the North American margin target for the full year, which you already are, but you might be above it?","Bob Shanks","I think it\u2019s more appropriate for us to cover -- I said on the upper half. We\u2019re always working to do better but I think upper half is where we\u2019re likely to land.","Ryan Brinkman","And this is really the same question. In last quarter\u2019s earnings deck, you included a slide, not in this deck, that showed pre-tax results by quarter as a percentage of expected full year pre-tax profit ramping sequentially from 1Q to 2Q and then from 2Q to 3Q before it was flat in 4Q. I know the guidance today is stronger in the back half than the first half. Do you still think that results improve from 2Q to 3Q or whether that 3Q is a greater percentage of full year pre-tax profits than 2Q?","Bob Shanks","Well, the purpose of that slide, Ryan, was to demonstrate that unlike most years where the first half is stronger than the second half and oftentimes you will see the first quarter compete with the second quarter in terms of which one is the strongest, that was not going to be the case this year, we want to show that. Also what\u2019s normal is the fourth quarter being the weakest and actually quite a bit weaker than most of the other quarters of the year. And we felt that the fourth quarter, have the opportunity to be much stronger than normal particularly because of the cadence of our launches. That\u2019s still all true. And we still expect as a result, the second quarter to be strong and stronger than the first half. So, very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seen, but didn\u2019t think it was necessary to put the chart and since the half is over and we\u2019ve only got two quarters go and within the \u201cstronger second half\u201d and expect to deliver that.","Ryan Brinkman","And then last question Europe, it was pretty good actually. It seems the biggest variance there was pricing. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? I imagine Mondeo, S-Max, Galaxy coming through but some of the other drivers you\u2019ve been working on maybe on channel mix, self-registrations, rental car or the [indiscernible] I\u2019m just trying to understand, I know 3Q is going to be softer seasonally but does the year-over-year pricing tailwind remain with us as we progress throughout the year?","Bob Shanks","Yes, you\u2019re actually spot on in terms of what drove it; there\u2019s one other factor I\u2019ll mention, but yes that\u2019s new products doing very well. The team has been focusing on brand and the network and customer service and that\u2019s translating into some incremental power in terms of pricing, particularly combined with the new products. The other thing that you didn\u2019t mention that\u2019s the factor, we\u2019re now consolidating Russia. So somewhat similar to South America where we\u2019re seeing some very positive pricing as we try to offset the effects of high local inflation and weak currencies, the exact same things going on in Russia where the team is doing the same thing. So, you\u2019ve got that phenomenon also in this quarter on a year-over-year basis because of the consolidation of Russia but everything else you said is true. And I would expect as we go into the third and fourth quarters that we will continue to see positive pricing in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, representing CLSA. Please proceed. ","Emmanuel Rosner","So, I have a question on North America and the one on China. On North America, I would like to come back to the earnings walk on slide 10. So, I completely agree with your point that the increased I guess material cost results not only in better pricing but also better mix and market share and volume. I\u2019m just curious how you see these material costs evolve over the rest of the year? I think in Q1, it was increase in cost of about $600 million and now it\u2019s about $1 billion and then obviously more new F-150s coming is also more new materials in there. How would you see that evolve over the next couple of quarters?","Bob Shanks","I think, let\u2019s look at it from a couple of different ways. I think you will see year-over-year increases that will start to mitigate because we had some of the products that are affected in the later quarters of last year. So, what I do think you\u2019ll see as we go forward is that the effects will be largely mitigated sequentially. So, we have what we have. Some of that will continue to show up on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially we\u2019re kind of where we would expect to be because the launches are behind us.","Emmanuel Rosner","And then on China, so just would like to come back on the quarter\u2019s performance; it was obviously an incredibly strong equity income quarter for in the 400 million which is although more remarkable in sort like the flattish volume environment, but also in Ford incurring all these costs from opening new plants. How sustainable do you view this performance in light of the dynamics that you described before in China?","Bob Shanks","We expect the operations to continue perform well. We actually expect the volume to be greater in the second half than the first half as we launch the new plant. We got the new launches coming -- product launches that Mark talked about. And some of those products, the Edge, three-row Edge, the Taurus, the Everest; those are going to be higher margin products. So I think that will fairly show up in the results. So I think we feel quite good about the performance in the second half relative to first half and overall for the full year.","The one thing I just want to remind you and everyone else that\u2019s listening in is when you\u2019re looking at those equity after tax earnings, that\u2019s not the total picture of China, that\u2019s just the joint ventures. So, if you recall, I said that our year-over-year results for Asia Pacific actually were not driven by China even though you can see that improvement at the JVs; it was driven by the operations outside and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve got EU imports which are consolidated, we\u2019ve Lincoln which we\u2019re investing in which is consolidated, and you\u2019ve got engineering that we\u2019re incurring on behalf of the joint ventures that they will reimburse for later, once we start building those products that we\u2019re engineering at some point in the future, will get that composition through royalty. So, when you take the total picture of China because of what was going on in the consolidated part of our business, it was actually down slightly. We had launch balance out of Edge as Mark talked about, we had balance out of export as we\u2019re getting ready to launch the new Explorer, we have the investments in Lincoln and we have higher engineering for products we\u2019re working on for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache, representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache","I was hoping just kind of a higher level question about China. Obviously one of the fears in the market is that just given the amount of capacity that\u2019s coming on line that it could just be broadly for the industry a significant deterioration in profitability. It\u2019s happened in other emerging markets, once growth in supply reaches or exceeds growth in demand. Can you give us a little bit more color on how does the earnings bridge look like? If you see 4% to 5% negative from pricing, what does every 1% imply for you as a headwind? And for every 1% change in volume, what does that do for you as a tailwind; how should we be thinking about the bridge and the levers that you can pull to mitigate that?","Bob Shanks","Well, let me just answer your question directly first and maybe provide a bit of color and then Mark could supplement. So 1% for is $90 million -- $100 million, but I guess the thing I would think about is if you look at our portfolio, we have actually a pretty rich portfolio. We have a very strong SUV portfolio, the Mondeo, the Kuga, the three-row Edge, the Taurus, the Everest, which is body-on-frame utility that\u2019s going to come off at the same platform as our Global Ranger. These are pretty high margin products. And I think that probably puts us in a pretty good position because as you think about where the competitive pressures be, I\u2019m sure it will be across the industry. But there will be a lot of that particularly at the lower end of the market particularly where you get maybe some overlap at the low end of the international brands with the indigenous brands. So, I think the place we occupy in the market is a pretty healthy place.","We also have opportunities for cost reductions; the team is continuing to make improvements there. And as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got Hangzhou plant coming on, but we\u2019re only going to man the plant to the level of volume that we actually believe is appropriate and that we can deliver from the plant. So, I think that as we go in, knowing the softness in the market, I think gives us the ability to plan that very effectively. Anything you want to add?","Mark Fields","Yes, the only thing I want to add Rod is when you look at the capacity coming on line at Hangzhou, as Bob mentioned, I mean it\u2019s for products that are in pretty high demand. We\u2019re localizing the Edge and obviously SUVs and a seven-seater SUV is in demand, the Taurus that\u2019s coming or large sedan, it\u2019s a pretty significant segment there that has pretty good revenues and Everest as Bob mentioned. But even the -- in the Escort, we launched that earlier this year and that is as I mentioned that\u2019s the fastest growing model in the segment and it\u2019s appealing particularly across the regions but particularly Tier 3 through 6. But across all this, as we look at the industry, look at the pricing et cetera, it\u2019s not only a focus on the top-line, team is taking a very intense focus on the costs and the costs in the industry. And that is the benefit, if you will, of looking at an industry which we\u2019re now calling flat to down and getting ahead of things. So we\u2019re working both ends.","Rod Lache","And that is what drove the performances in the quarter?","Mark Fields","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, representing Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnson","I want to wish George Sharp farewell and hope you enjoy retirement. We will certainly miss him and his sense of history, shall I say. So I want to quote couple of things, just a little housekeeping for Bob on North America and then a broader question on China. On North America, you talked about the F-150 having no contribution. Is the way we ought to be thinking about is that the volume decrement was roughly equal to the pricing less material cost contribution?","Bob Shanks","On a year-over-year basis, it did not generate, if you will, incremental profits and that\u2019s because the volume was lower. We also were in launch mode, so we had all the costs, the structural costs associated with the launch but didn\u2019t have the plants producing at capacity. That will not be the case in the third and the fourth quarter. So when I look at the data for third and fourth quarter year-over-year for F-150, it\u2019s a strong positive contributor to the bottom-line all in; and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to convey in terms of the effect it had in the first, second relative to the third and fourth quarters.","Brian Johnson","Okay. So, we can expect that change as we go -- get passed some of those launch costs as well as full volume?","Bob Shanks","Yes.","Brian Johnson","And second question on China is kind of Mark. You talked about disruptive innovations in mobility and at the same time you talked about China at some point getting to 30 million cars. I guess, when you think about where transportation could go in China, kind of ten years out. What\u2019s the real argument for such a densely populated urban country getting to the levels of penetration you\u2019d need for that? And are we going to look at kind of new mobility models as maybe kind of taking some of the wind out of those sales? And if so or even if not, how would you primarily with your upper-end -- mid-upper-end product line in China kind of participate in those new models in China?","Mark Fields","I think when you look at the overall size of the market, keep in mind that the Tier 3 through 6 cities, these are cities that are still growing, still cities where people are coming from the countryside and moving in. You don\u2019t have the license plate restriction that you do in some of the Tier 1 and 2 cities. So we think a lot of that is going provide the growth to that 30 millionish number in the next five to ten years and still be somewhat manageable.","In terms of the overall -- the mega cities, the cities of 10 million or more, I mean there is a lot of debate around what is that going to mean to the size of the industry. And right now, there is no clear answers, because you could argue that car and ridesharing increases the asset utilization which could reduce the car park, but also on the other side more efficient utilization of those assets and a greater just overall access to mobility could actually increase the total miles driven which could increase vehicle sales. It will definitely increase service business, for example with the duty cycles that these vehicles going through. So that\u2019s we\u2019re looking at. And overall as we look at these experiments and pilots, we have our team focused on this. We\u2019re looking at some of the innovative approaches, particularly in China which Baidu and Didi Kuaidi is implementing. And as I said, you\u2019ll see over the next number of months and year or so, in terms of what we\u2019re doing to create some pilots and create some business models out of this that not only can open new business opportunities for us but complement our existing business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak, representing RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joe Spak","Mark and Bob, maybe just to follow on some of your recent comments, I think numerous times you\u2019ve talked about how a lot of your growth in China needs to be driven from those Tier 3 to 6 cities. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color as to what you are seeing the impact or what\u2019s going on kind of in those cities right now, maybe what the growth is in those cities versus some of the larger cities.","Mark Fields","We\u2019re seeing, as we said, larger percentage growth in those cities. And again, part of it has to do with the fact that most of those cities don\u2019t have the restrictions that you do in the larger cities around license plates and lotteries that they have for that. As we look at our business, if you look this year for example, 85% of our dealer appointments are going to be in the Tier 3 through 6 cities. And actually if you look at our wholesales in the quarter, our wholesales in those Tier through 6 cities, were more than double percentage increases than in Tier 1 and 2 cities. So, we think we\u2019re well-positioned. The Escort as I mentioned is really resonating with customers there but also at the same time as Bob mentioned earlier, the full line up of SUVs that we have, small, medium and large we think will serve us well.","Joe Spak","And so, maybe a quick one on South America, obviously a very difficult environment, it seems the product is responding well in that tough environment. I know you\u2019ve taken some actions there in the past, is there anything more you can do? Are you rightsized for this level and is it just about a volume rebound at this point?","Bob Shanks","The team has done a great job of managing the environment. They have taken appropriate actions on capacity, headcount, personnel levels. We\u2019ve also been working very hard on total costs. They\u2019re looking as how we can -- obviously we were quite localized because we\u2019ve been there for 80 years but we\u2019re even trying to find further opportunities to shield the business from the weakening currencies. We are also working to try to get as much as we can in terms of mix of the products. So the teams doing everything they can but Joe, the environment is so difficult, it\u2019s going to be tough I think for anybody to make sense out of that business in South America until the recovery takes place. As I mentioned in my comments, there aren\u2019t any signs of that happening yet. So we\u2019re just going to have to hunker down, continue to go after every dollar of costs that we possibly can but this really going to depend for the industry on a recovery and the external environment.","Mark Fields","But I do think, we\u2019re well-positioned, to your point, around our new products are resonating and we are growing share or 10% share in the region now. So, I think that bodes well. I mean put in a perspective before 2013, the nine years before, we were pretty strongly profitable down that region. I think clearly in the mid to long-term we expect that to return but we\u2019re going to have work our way through difficult economic environment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Galliers, representing Evercore. Please proceed.","George Galliers","I had a quick question just really to the strategic on China. One of your competitors just announced plans to develop common architecture in engines with its Chinese JV partner for a global car to be sold in emerging market. Obviously your platform and One Ford strategy is well flagged. How do you think about co-developing future product with your Chinese partner for sale in other markets not just in Asia but globally, is that something you\u2019re already looking at or planning on looking at?","Mark Fields","Well, as you mentioned, with our One Ford strategy, we have now gone from 27 platforms down to 9 and ultimately to 8. Obviously, we have a couple of partners in China, both Changan at CAF and JMC which is our commercial truck partner. And the bottom line is nothing to talk about at this point but of course as our relationship grows, we will look at those opportunities. We\u2019re well positioned now. But as I said, as those relationships grow, could offer us the opportunity to do that.","George Galliers","And then also you mentioned the fact that you\u2019re seeing stronger growth in the Tier 3 and smaller cities in China. Can you give any color on how your market share compares in those regions relative to the 4.7%, you have for the full market?","Bob Shanks","I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me but our market share in those regions is quite good relative to the more developed cities. We\u2019re actually in the middle of the country in Chongqing and our performance is strong in the middle of the country; it\u2019s good in the 3 through 6 cities. And I think that actually positions us well going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston, representing Morningstar. Please proceed.","David Whiston","Mark, a question for you, going back to in your opening comments on disruption and how it\u2019s an opportunity; one of those opportunities is for the industry to have more ubiquitous software updates and perhaps not have a customer go to a dealer at all. And so is that an opportunity -- certainly for convenience, but is that an opportunity for Ford to charge for those upgrades or do you expect the customer to get those for free or perhaps a combination? And related to that, is there a lot of opportunity for cost reduction potential on -- particularly on recall repair from these updates?","Mark Fields","Well, obviously we\u2019re thinking through the consumer experience as we go forward. And clearly with the things like over the year updates offers, as you mentioned opportunity to make customers\u2019 lives easier and also opportunity as you mentioned to reduce cost for recalls, can\u2019t get into specifics about how we\u2019re going to approach that in terms of pricing et cetera. But our approach overall as we\u2019re looking at our products and we\u2019re looking at our services, the approach we\u2019re taking with our marketing and our engineering communities, we want our people thinking about experiences and then subsequently how does technology enable those experiences and obviously then what we can price for it, but clearly a big opportunity for us to better satisfy the customer and also improve our business going forward.","Operator","With no further questions at this time, I\u2019d now like to hand the call back to Mr. George Sharp for any closing remarks.","George Sharp","Okay. Thank you Katina and thanks everyone. We\u2019re really glad that you are able to join us today.","Operator","Thank you.

We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","George Sharp","Thank you, Chantelle, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so that we can provide you with additional details of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results.","Presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, our Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.","Now copies of this morning\u2019s press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Any non-GAAP measure are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck, and final data will be included in our Form 10-K.","Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance, of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect actual results are summarized at the end of this presentation and of course, are detailed in our SEC filings.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the presentation over to Mark.","Mark Fields","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Today we are going to review our fourth quarter and our full year 2014 financial results, and we\u2019ll also update our view of the business environment for 2015 and also our guidance for the year ahead. So let\u2019s get right into the first slide.","Our results this quarter and for the full year reflect our continued focus on our One Ford plan, which remains unchanged. Our plan is served as well and we\u2019ll continue to do so going forward.","And we are now building on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. We are starting to see the full benefits and strength of One Ford, and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward.","And here at Ford, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation. And we are absolutely committed to building on our product strength today, we have even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward.","So now let\u2019s turn to slide two for a look at the fourth quarter and the full year. The fourth quarter was our 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive and liquidity remained strong. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and company revenue were lower than a year ago by 2% and 5%, respectively.","Looking at the business units, North America and Asia-Pacific were profitable, and Ford Credit once again delivered strong results. For the full year, the company delivered its fifth consecutive year of pre-tax profit and positive automotive operating related cash flow, and the results were consistent with guidance.","North America was profitable and we achieved a record profit in Asia-Pacific. Ford Credit profit was its highest since 2011 and while we reported losses in other business units, Europe and Middle East and Africa improved from a year ago.","Volume was about equal to a year ago, while company revenue declined 2% and we achieved record market share in Asia-Pacific driven by record share in China. Our global pension plans were under funded by $9 billion at the end of 2014, which was unchanged from 2013 despite significantly lower discount rates.","For 2015, our company outlook for pre-tax profit, automotive revenue and operating margin is unchanged from our September Investor Day guidance and we expect company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion, with automotive revenue and automotive operating margin higher than 2014, which is largely driven by our new products and capacity. And today we are improving our outlook for automotive operating related cash flow from positive to higher than 2014.","And before getting into the financial details, I\u2019d like to take you through some of our other achievements in 2014, which if you\u2019ll see on slide three. We watched 24 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally last year. This included the all-new F-150, which was awarded the Truck of Texas and named the North American International Auto Show Truck of the Year earlier this month, and deliveries and sales began in December.","The launch is also included the all-new 50th anniversary Mustang, Escort, Ka, Transit and Lincoln MKC. Our best-selling midsize SUV the Ford Explorer debuted its new look at the LA Auto Show and will be available for customers in markets around the world later this year. We also revealed the all-new Ford Everest in Asia-Pacific.","Ford remained the best-selling vehicle brand in the U.S. and the best-selling automaker in Canada for the fifth year in a row. And this was supported by continued strong sales of F Series, which despite the downtime on F-150 to support the new vehicle launch achieved U.S. truck sales leadership for the 38th straight year and U.S. vehicle sales leadership for 33rd year in a row. We also set U.S. sales records for Fusion and Escape.","In Europe, we remained the number two vehicle brand, selling vehicle brand and continue to progress our transformation plan, achieving a year-over-year share gain for the Europe 20 market for first time since 2009. We also closed our Genk, Belgium plant improving our capacity utilization.","Our growth in China continued with a record $1.1 million wholesales in 2014. In addition, our Changan Ford joint venture opened two new plants and we launched Lincoln in China, with the first nine Lincoln dealerships, which began sales of the Lincoln MKZ and MKC.","Consistent with our plan to provide regular and growing dividends that are sustainable over an economic or business cycle, we increased our 2014 quarterly dividend by 25% and as you know, we announced an additional 20% increase earlier this month. We also completed our share repurchase program that reduced our diluted shares by about 3%.","So now, I\u2019d like to turn over to Bob, who\u2019ll take us through the financial results. Bob?","Bob Shanks","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on the top of slide four, where you\u2019ll see that fourth quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units that was down to 30,000 units from a year ago. And revenue was $35.9 billion, that was down $1.7 billion. Pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion, excluding special items. That was $197 million lower than a year ago.","After-tax earnings per share at $0.26 were $0.06 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges, was $52 million. This was $3 billion lower than a year ago, including a non-repeat of a favorable $2.1 billion special tax item that we benefited from last year. Earnings were $0.01 a share and it was down $0.74.","Pre-tax special item charges were $1.2 billion in the quarter reflecting primarily one-time loss resulting from a change in how we account for our Venezuela operations as well separation related actions in Europe and Asia Pacific to support our transformation plans and charges associated with the settlement of our 2016 convertible notes. You can find additional detail on the special items in appendix three.","Automotive operating-related cash flow was $500 million, and automotive gross cash was $21.7 billion, exceeding debt by $7.9 billion. In the full year, our operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown, was 35%. For 2015, we expect the rate which excludes the profits of our unconsolidated subsidiaries to be about equal to our 2014 rate assuming extension of U.S. research credit legislation in the fourth quarter.","Full year vehicle wholesales were about equal to a year ago, while the company revenue decreased by 2%. Full year pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $6.3 billion and, as Mark said, in line with guidance. The result was a decline of $2.3 billion from a year ago and net income was $3.2 billion, which was $4 billion lower than a year ago.","As shown on slide 5, both of our sectors Automotive and Financial Services contributed to the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits. Company fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits were lower than a year ago more than explained by automotive. Compared with third quarter Automotive was favorable, while Financial Services more than explained the $60 million decline in profits.","The key market factors in financial metrics for our automotive business in the fourth quarter are shown on slide 6. As you can see on the far left, wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% from a year ago respectively. The volume decline is more than explained by North America, while the revenue decline reflects all business units. About half of the revenue decline is attributable to unfavorable exchange.","Global industry SAAR is estimated at 90.2 million units, that was up 2% from a year ago. Ford\u2019s global market share is estimated at 6.9%, down two-tenths of a percentage point due to North America. Operating margin was 2.8%, down four-tenths of a percentage points from a year ago, while automotive pre-tax profit was $713 million and that was down $250 million. The decline in both metrics is more than explained by North America.","As shown in the memo below the chart, full year volume was about equal to a year ago, while automotive revenue was down 3%, more than explained by lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange, with the exchange effect accounting for nearly 60% of the decline.","Operating margin at 3.9% was down 1.5 percentage points. Total automotive pre-tax profit at $4.5 billion was down $2.4 billion. The lower results were driven by the Americas. All other business units improved. We\u2019ve included full year key metrics and year- over-year variance slides for the automotive sector and each of our business units in the appendix.","As shown on slide 7, the $250 million decline in fourth quarter automotive pre-tax profit was driven by higher cost and unfavorable exchange. Higher net pricing in all regions, except Asia Pacific, was a partial offset. And as shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was about equal to third quarter.","The absolute fourth quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown on slide 8. As you can see North America and Asia Pacific were profitable, while the other business units reported losses.","On slide 9, we show the factors that contributed to the $2.4 billion decline in total automotive full year pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher costs, including warranty, unfavorable exchange, and lower volume, including product launch effects and supply part shortages. Higher net pricing was a partial offset.","The absolute full year pr\u00eat-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as the other automotive are shown on slide 10. As you can see North America was profitable and Asia Pacific delivered a record result. Middle East and Africa was about breakeven, while Europe and South America incurred large losses as expected.","Now we look at each of the regions within the automotive sector starting on slide 11 with North America. North America fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue were down 5% to 6% from a year ago. While North America continued to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product line-up continued discipline in matching production with demand and a lean cost structure, our fourth quarter results were affected adversely by the lower volume.","This reflects lower market share and lower dealer stock increases than a year ago, offset partially by higher industry sales, including the US SAAR 17.2 million units, 1.2 million units higher than a year ago.","Our U.S. market share deteriorated 1.1 percentage points to 14.3% and that was largely retail related. This primarily reflects a lower F-150 share, as we continue to balance share with transaction prices and stocks during the transition to all new F-150. Shares were also lower for several other products at the end of their product cycles, as we transition to the new products launched either in the fourth quarter of last year or earlier this year.","As shown in appendix 8, our U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 12.8%. This was down nine-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago, mainly reflecting the factors I already cited. The decline in North America\u2019s revenue is explained by the lower volume. North America operating margin was 7.4%, down eight-tenths of a percentage point from last year, and pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, down $252 million.","As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics declined from the year ago. The change in the financial metrics is more than explained by the lower volumes and higher warranty costs, including recalls. Operating margin was 8.4%, which was slightly better than our guidance.","On slide 12, we show the factors contributing to North America\u2019s lower fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by the impact of new product launches in the quarter on volume and cost. Higher net pricing including for new products and lower warranty costs were partial offsets. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than third quarter, more than explained by lower warranty costs and favorable market factors. Higher structural cost, including the effect of new product launches, was a partial offset.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 13 and review South America, where we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up, including replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. We\u2019re also continuing to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth, lower industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries.","In the fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 2% and 9% respectively. The lower volume is more than explained by an 800,000 unit decline from last year\u2019s SAAR of 6.1 million units, reflecting primarily the impact of import restrictions in Argentina, and the weaker economy in Brazil.","South America market share at 9.4% was up nine-tenths of a percentage point, reflecting primarily the New Ka, which was awarded the most sought after car of the year award in Brazil from leading magazine, Autoesporte. Focus also contributed to the share improvement.","The revenue decline is more than explained by weaker currencies and unfavorable volume and mix with higher net pricing as a partial offset. Operating margin was negative 7.6%. This was down 2.9 percentage points from a year ago and pretax loss was $187 million, a deterioration of $61 million.","As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics deteriorated from a year ago driven by unfavorable changes in external factors. The full year loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects related primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar in the first quarter.","On slide 14, we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America's fourth quarter pre-tax results. Higher warranty cost including a field service action, more than explained the deterioration compared with both the prior year and third quarter. The adverse effects in the quarter of weaker currencies and high local inflation were nearly offset by higher net pricing. Also note that the share growth from new products offset the industry decline.","Let\u2019s now turn to Europe beginning on slide 15 where we continue to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. Europe's wholesale volume improved 5% from a year ago, while revenue declined 2%. The higher volume is more than explained by 500,000 unit increase in Europe 20 SAAR to 15.1 million units and a lower dealer stock reduction compared with a year ago.","The focus on product and brand saw continued progress in the quarter with launch of the new focus in all-new Mondeo. Our Europe 20 market share improved two-tenths of a percentage point to 7.6%, driven by a 2.8 point improvement in our commercial vehicle share to 11.7% reflecting the success of our full line of new transit vehicles and continued strong performance of the Ranger compact pickup.","The decrease in Europe's revenue is more than explained by unfavorable exchange. Europe's operating margin was negative 6.5%, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $443 million, an $86 million improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics improved from a year ago.","Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's fourth quarter pretax results. The improvement is more than explained by favorable market factors, offset partially by Russia. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results were about equal to third quarter despite the impact of Russia.","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 17 and review Middle East and Africa where we\u2019re focused on building our distribution capability, expanding our One Ford product offering tailored to the needs of markets in the region and leveraging global low-cost sourcing hubs for vehicles in this fast growing part of the world.","Middle East and Africa's wholesale volume and revenue declined 10% and 2%, respectively. The lower volume primarily reflects an unfavorable change in dealer stocks to align with near-term market demand. Operating margin was negative 8.2%, two percentage points better than a year ago and pre-tax loss was $82 million, $22 million better.","Higher net pricing and favorable mix more than explained the improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, full year wholesale volume and revenue declined compared with the year ago, while operating margin and profits improved.","Let\u2019s now review Asia Pacific on slide 18. We\u2019re continuing our strategy in Asia Pacific to invest for growth through both new and expanded plants, new products and the introduction of Lincoln in China. As shown on the left, fourth quarter wholesale volume was up 2% compared with a year ago, while net revenue which excludes our China JVs, declined 9%.","Our China wholesale volume, which isn't shown was up 5% in the quarter. The higher volume in the region is more than explained by higher industry volume. We estimate fourth quarter SAAR for the region at 40.7 million units that's up 600,000 units from a year ago.","Lower market share was a partial offset. Our fourth quarter market share of 3.5% was down one-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago. Our market share in China also deteriorated one-tenth of a percentage to 4.3%. This was due to our wholesale industry that was well above trend.","Asia-Pacific\u2019s lower revenue reflects lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange. Operating margin was 3.6%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from year ago and pre-tax profit was $95 million, down $14 million.","As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics improved from a year earlier and were records. In 2014, our China joint ventures contributed $1.3 billion to pre-tax profit, reflecting our equity share of earnings after tax. Additional detail can be found in the appendix.","The balance of results for the region primarily reflected Australia where we\u2019re implementing our transformation plan; India, where we're investing for future growth including the launch of two plants later this year and unfavorable industry and economic factors in ASEAN.","On slide 19, we show the factors that contributed to Asia-Pacific\u2019s lower fourth quarter pretax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher warranty cost related to a field service action. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific pre-tax results improved in the third quarter more than explained by favorable volume and mix.","Okay, let\u2019s turn now on slide 20, the Ford credit, our strategic asset and an integral part of our global growth and value-creation strategy. Ford credit provides world-class dealer and customer financial services, supported by strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford.","The Ford credit improved pre-tax profit this quarter compared with year ago as more than explained by higher volume as favorable market valuation adjustments to derivatives included in other. The higher volume reflects increases in consumer finance receivables and operating leases globally as well as non-consumer finance receivables outside of North America.","Partial offset of lower margin driven primarily by one-time reserve in Europe and the run-off of higher-yielding assets originated in prior years in North America. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was lower than third quarter, explained primarily by lower margin reflecting Europe reserve.","Slide 21 provides an explanation of the change in Ford credit\u2019s full-year pre-tax profit compared with 2013. The improvement is more than explained by higher volume, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance receivables globally, as well as operating leases in North America.","Partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual performance in North America resulting from lower relative auction values and lower financing margin. The lower financing margin primarily reflects the Europe reserve previously mentioned and lower portfolio pricing in North America.","Next on slide 22 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive growth cash at the end of the quarter was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. This includes a one-time unfavorable $500 million cash affect associated with the accounting change for operations in Venezuela.","Automotive operating related cash flow was positive $500 million more than explained by profits. During the quarter, debt repayments and pension contributions totaled $600 million while dividends paid were about $500 million. Full-year automotive operating related cash flow was $3.6 billion and gross cash declined $3.1 billion.","Slide 23 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, that was $1.1 billion lower than third quarter including actions taken on our 2016 convertible notes. We ended the quarter with net cash of $7.9 billion and automotive liquidity of $32.4 billion.","Slide 24 provides an annual update on our global pension plans. Worldwide pension expense, excluding special items was $1 billion that was $600 million lower than 2013, driven primarily by higher discount rates at year-end \u201813 compared with 2012. In 2014, we made $1.5 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, down $3.5 million, reflecting our improved funded status.","In 2015, cash contributions through our funded plans are expected to be about $1.1 billion globally, most of which are mandatory. Worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at year end that\u2019s unchanged from year-end 2013, despite significantly lower discount rates, down 80 basis points in the U.S. and about 100 basis points in non-U.S. markets.","These were offset by strong asset returns, contributions and favorable exchange. These results are clear evidence that our de-risking strategy is working. Of the $9 billion underfunded status, about $6.5 billion, or about 70% is associated with unfunded plans. Asset returns in 2014 for our U.S. plans were 16.4% and 15.7% for our non-U.S. plans, reflecting fixed income gains as interest rates fell, as well as strong growth asset returns.","We\u2019ve continued to increase the mix of fixed income assets with the objective of reducing funded status volatility. The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at year-end 2014 was 77% and that's up from 70% at year-end 2013. The U.S. plans were 97% funded at year-end.","Slide 25 summarizes our 2014 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics, compared with the plan we shared at the beginning of the year. We delivered solid results last year, meeting or exceeding all financial metrics established at the beginning of the year, with the exception of total company pre-tax profit.","Despite a challenging environment, particularly in South America and Russia and an unprecedented number of product launches, we achieved the total company pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, which as Mark said was consistent with our most recent guidance of about $6 billion. Importantly, we also continued to generate positive Automotive operating related cash flow. So, overall, 2014 was a successful step forward in implementing our One Ford plan to deliver profitable growth for all.","So this concludes our review of the financial details of our fourth quarter earnings and now, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark who is going to take us through our outlook for the business in 2015 looking at the environment, as well as our planning assumptions and key metrics.","Mark Fields","Thanks Bob. Let\u2019s take a look at the 2015 year, starting on slide 26, with our view of the business environment going forward. We project global economic growth to be in the 3% range, which is going to be led by U.S. and China. Global industry sales are expected to growth to between 88 million and 92 million units, after estimated sales of about 88 million units in 2014.","U.S. economic growth is projected in the 3% range. Consumer sentiment is improving, along with lower fuel prices, which will boost consumer spending, providing support for growth. South America faces continued market volatility and policy uncertainty. A weak recovery is expected in Brazil, while Argentina and Venezuela will remain in recession.","In Europe, growth in the euro area slowed after the first quarter of 2014, but it is projected at just above 1% in 2015. In the U.K., growth is projected to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range. In Russia, the combination of lower oil prices, geopolitical events, and ruble depreciation will lead to a sharp decline in GDP and higher inflation.","In Asia Pacific, China's economic growth is projected in the 7% to 7.5% range. Consumer income growth will support an increase in vehicle sales but at a more moderate pace this year. And with some encouraging signs of improvement, growth in India is projected to rise above 6% in 2015, supported by a more favorable policy environment. So stepping back, despite challenges in some key markets, we do expect the global economy to grow in 2015 and be supportive of a projection for higher global industry volume this year.","On slide 27, we summarize our 2015 outlook for our Automotive sector and Ford Credit. We expect North America to be strongly profitable a level higher than 2014, with an operating margin of 8% to 9%. This outlook includes higher market share and net pricing, reflecting the impact of launching seven all-new or significantly refreshed products, as well as the effect of the record 16 launches in 2014, many of which occurred late in the year. And keep in mind, the F-150 changeover and downtime at our Kansas City plant will impact the first quarter.","In South America, pre-tax results are expected to be substantially improved from 2014 but still a loss. This outlook reflects the continuation of difficult macroeconomic conditions, with industry volume about equal to 2014. We expect higher market share in 2015, as a result of new product introductions including the all-new car.","We also expect higher net pricing in part due to new products, but also to recover or at least in part, the unfavorable effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation. And finally, our South American results will not include the operating results of our Venezuela operations, including any impact of currency devaluations.","Moving on to Europe, pre-tax results are expected to improve from 2014, but still be a loss. This outlook reflects higher market share, volume and net pricing in the Europe 20 markets despite intense competition across the region, as well as weak economic growth in the euro area. This is updated from our September Investor Day guidance of a loss of about $250 million, that's largely due to uncertainty around conditions in Russia, as well as higher pension expense in 2015, as a result of even lower discount rates.","Middle East and Africa is expected to deliver a loss somewhat larger than 2014, as we invest for future growth. And in Asia Pacific, we expect wholesale volume, market share and pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014, as we continue to introduce new products and bring on line new capacity.","Our Automotive net interest expense is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014. And finally, Ford Credit continues to implement its growth plan and expects pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014. This outlook reflects year-end managed receivables in a range of $123 billion to $128 billion and managed leverage to continue in the range of 8 to 9 to 1, and distributions of about $250 million.","So moving on, let\u2019s look at the expected calendarization of total company 2015 pre-tax results. So our slide 28 shows, directionally, the counterization of our profits in 2014 will not be consistent with our typical historical trend. In North America, the all-new F-150 changeover and downtime at the Kansas City plant will affect first quarter results.","We also will incur costs and lost volume in the first half of the year related to our seven 2015 product launches, including the Edge and Explorer. And we expect to see the benefit of these launches in the second half of 2015. In Asia Pacific, we are leveraging Ford's global product portfolio to introduce 18 new vehicles in 2015. And this will result in lower first half results, as we continue to invest in four new plants that will bring new capacity on line for the second half of this year.","So now let\u2019s take a look at the total company planning assumptions and key metrics for 2015, which is shown on slide 29. So for 2015, we now expect U.S. industry volume to range from 17 million to 17.5 million units. Europe 20 markets to range from 14.8 million to 15.3 million units and China to range from 24.5 million to 26.5 million units.","In terms of our financial metrics, we expect automotive revenue and operating margin to be higher than 2014, automotive and operating-related cash flow to be higher than 2014. And as noted earlier, this is an improvement from our September Investor Day guidance of positive. And this also includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion. Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014, and company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. So overall very strong growth and substantially improved financial performance are expected in 2015, driven by our investments in new products and capacity.","So closing all this out on the next slide, our priorities remain consistent and that's to accelerate the pace of progress of our One Ford plan, deliver product excellence with passion, and drive innovation in every part of our business. And all of this underpinned with the continuing day-to-day focus on operational excellence. We are committed to our long-term objectives that we shared with you and we're making progress towards them, as we execute our strategic framework. And this framework is built on strong brands, serving all markets with the complete family of best-in-class vehicles, to lead and providing innovative mobility solutions through our Ford\u2019s mobility initiatives and deliver operational excellence that is among the best in the business.","And our success depends on a skilled and motivated team and the Ford team is among the best in the business and we intend to ensure that we have the right talent for rapidly changing world, and that we maintain the trust and the familiarity that allows us to rely on each other strengths to tackle any business issue.","Looking ahead, the global automotive industry presents substantial growth opportunities as well as rapid change and we intend to take advantage of both. 2015 is going to be a breakthrough year for Ford, driven by our unprecedented 24 global product launches in 2014, and another 15 global launches planned this year. So this is our One Ford story and we\u2019re confident in its continued success.","So at this point, let's open it up for questions. George?","George Sharp","Thanks, Mark. Now we'll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We'll begin as usual with questions from the investment community and then we'll take some questions from the media. Now again in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this limited timeframe please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Chantelle, can we have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please proceed.","Itay Michaeli","Good morning, everyone.","Mark Fields","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli","Just a question on Europe. I was hoping we can dig it a little bit more to the details around some of the incremental headwinds. You mentioned the pension expense in 2015. There may be a big picture view on kind of what it takes now as you look at the market to return to profitability. Maybe an update on what you think the reasonable timetable there and what else you can do to take action to respond to conditions there.","Mark Fields","Well, as you step back and you look at Europe, we've had some success in meaningfully improving the business in Europe when you look at the three elements of the transformation brand, product, and cost. On the product side, we've introduced over half of the 25 products that we said we were going to introduce. We increased our share as we mentioned earlier. Importantly, the investments we made in commercial vehicles are paying off. We've gone from the number seven commercial vehicle market share brand to number three last year.","So we made progress on product. We made progress on brand. Our favorability is improving. Our channel mix is improving. And actually channel mix of retail and fleet is healthier than the rest of the industry, about three points above. We made progress on cost, as we completed the restructuring actions. And as you know, that will save us ongoing between $450 million and $500 million a year.","As we look at the industry going forward, as Bob mentioned, we\u2019re impacted by the lower discount rates, which impact our pension cost. Obviously, the situation in Russia is going to continue to impact us and will be a drag on our earnings for a period of time. As we look at the industry, we\u2019re seeing -- we do think that some of the impacts of lower energy costs will help the consumer, which will be positive. On the same token, we also know that there are still a lot of challenges that Europe faces.","And our approach going forward, we are going to continue to use our process, Itay, which is used that creating value roadmap process, continue to look at the business environment, understand any additional actions that we need to take to improve the business situation, and that's what we\u2019re going to do. In terms of guidance on profitability, we\u2019re going to be -- our objective is to be profitable as soon as possible using those elements, I just outlined.","Itay Michaeli","That\u2019s very helpful, Mark. And then just two quick follow-up housekeeping questions. Any guidance on the year-over-year P&L impact from the Venezuela accounting change, maybe what the 2014 losses were and what the benefit could be in 2015? And then maybe I missed this, but you have a 2015 CapEx outlook, that would be great. That\u2019s all I have.","Bob Shanks","Okay. On the last one, Mark mentioned on the last -- next last slide I think that our guidance of $7.5 billion is just a touch-up from the $7.4 billion that we saw in 2014. On Venezuela, we\u2019re not providing -- we don't generally provide specific profitability on either markets or product lines. We did lose money in Venezuela, but it's been very volatile. I mean, I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s been most difficult about the market in terms of financial effect.","So going forward, as we explained in the 8-K, Itay, there'll be no effect on the company's results from what happens in Venezuela. Other than if we can obtain cash from the authorities in Venezuela and use that cash to either remit a dividend or use that cash to purchase components that we could then ship into Venezuela to support production, then the profit or the cash flow associated with that transaction will be reflected in our results, but otherwise nothing. So there will be no effect. If we get no further cash, we require components. Or if we can't obtain components to ship in, there will be no effect on our results from Venezuela.","Itay Michaeli","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","Mark Fields","Hey, John.","John Murphy","Just a first question. If we think about the guidance for North America margins of 8% to 9% for the full year and then the cadence of earnings that you\u2019ve kind of alluded to on slide 28, it would indicate that the margins in the second half of the year, maybe even in the second quarter in North America will be 10% or potentially higher. Should we think about that as a more normal operating environment or more normal level that you might be able to achieve in the future versus what we will see early in the year? Just trying to understand that.","Bob Shanks","Yes. What we said consistently for a number of years is North America should run between 8% to 10%. Of course, that\u2019s going to vary. It depends on the quarter. It depends on where we are in product cadence launch cycles, what's happening in the external environment, what competition might be doing so, but it should range. And then in fact if you look at prior to '14, we\u2019ve kind of averaged a bit over 9% from '10 through '13. We did better the last two of those years, but then we got into the big launch period.","And we said we'd be in the 8% to 9% range this year. We thought low-end, we came in sort of mid. So Joe and the team did a great job in the fourth quarter, particularly on cost and so we did better than we thought. As we move into next year, 8% to 9% continues to be the guidance. We are affected by the launches in the first quarter not just F-Series, but some other very high margin products that Mark mentioned, the Explore and the Edge and we actually have still a very active Europe launches in North America, I think seven overall. So it will have an impact in the first half, primarily first quarter.","So your thesis is right. We\u2019ll see a lower margin than on average through the year in the first quarter. It will start to recover and be very attractive in the second, third and fourth and give us the type of margin that we\u2019re describing for the full year.","And we will see how things work out. We might have the opportunity to operate at the higher end of that range but I think it's a bit too early to say. I would rather let the year kind of go underway, see how all these launches go. And as you know, S-series went very, very well and then we\u2019ll kind of update you as the year goes on.","John Murphy","Okay. Then just a second question on Asia-Pac. You don\u2019t think the results in China are coming through pretty strong, the JV net income or equity income as $1.3 billion almost. Yet, it looks like the rest of the business is really under some pretty significant pressure. For the full year, you posted almost the $700 million loss.","I know you\u2019ve alluded to some actions there but is there anything else that you need to do as far as rationalization of restructuring in that business that would be more concrete and provide for better results going forward. And what would the charges look like for that or what would be the actions look like for that?","Mark Fields","Well, when you step back, John, and you look at the results outside, obviously, part of it is due to just the business environment that we\u2019re dealing with there and the currencies. But we focus on the things we can control and to your point, as you know in Australia, we\u2019re restructuring the business. We\u2019re closing our plant there in 2016, so we\u2019re working our way through that.","And also at the same time introducing -- we\u2019ll have 30% more products in the market over the next couple of years to drive the topline as we\u2019re working the cost side to hopefully improve the bottomline. In India, it's about the investments we\u2019re making for growth. As you know, we\u2019re opening our second major assembly facility there, which is not only going to support the domestic market but is going to be an export hub for us as well.","So we\u2019re working on that and we\u2019re seeing the upfront investments around that, which is driving the situation. We\u2019re starting to see as you\u2019ve heard in my remarks earlier, a little bit more encouraging results. We expect from an economic standpoint, which should help domestically.","And ASEAN working our way through not only the business environments there, but looking at each and every country to make sure that we have the appropriate product lineup that we take advantage of some of the opportunities and strength that we have in some of our particular products and use that to drive our business higher. But the team is very focused on that piece of the business, so in total Asia Pacific can contribute equally.","John Murphy","Great. Thank you very much.","Mark Fields","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rod Lache","Good morning, everybody.","Mark Fields","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache","A couple things, one, your content costs in North America was, like an $18 million headwind, which seems pretty modest considering the magnitude of the new product ramp that you're going through. I was hoping you can give us some sense of how we should be thinking about that for 2015. Looking at the Europe business, perhaps you can give us some brackets around the year-over-year impact, you\u2019re anticipating from Russia?","And then lastly, since you guys gave guidance, oil prices obviously dropped pretty dramatically, 40%, 50%. Europe adopted pretty aggressive QE. A lot of people view that it\u2019s likely mitigating rate increases in the U.S. I guess kind of high level when you think about the changes that have occurred since the end of September. How do those influence your views on the outlook for North America to 2015 because I think you were expecting pretty flat earnings, net of the non-recurrence of charges last year?","Mark Fields","Thanks, Rod. Bob, you should take the first two and I will take the last one.","Bob Shanks","You want to take the last one first. Okay. Yeah. Sure. In terms of looking at the changes that you mentioned, obviously, the drop in the oil prices will be good for consumers and we think that will help the economy. As you saw Rod, we are expecting some growth in the industry so far. We haven't -- we look -- we take a look back and see if there was any correlation between low fuel prices and growth of the industry and there\u2019s not a lot of correlation there.","So we\u2019re very comfortable with our call for the industry, which is really driven by replacement demand because as you know, the industry is run under replacement demand for five years. So we think that provides a good foundation. In terms of the mix and what that means for segmentation, could be an opportunity but we really don't know yet, the impact of lower oil prices what that means for the industry here in the U.S.","If we look at the fourth quarter, what we saw in the fourth quarter was very consistent segmentation changes that we see seasonally over the years. You see full-size pickups rise because manufacturers are getting more aggressive. You see premium rise or some of the luxury OEMs go for leadership and you see small cars actually go down.","So we think, we'll see the first quarter will be key to gauge if there is changes in the segmentation because as you know, on the first quarter we usually see small vehicles and small cars actually go up as a percent of the industry. But stepping back at a high level, we think it's positive for the economy, positive for the consumer and that is the backdrop. Bob?","Mark Fields","Okay. Rod, in terms of the first question around the content, you didn\u2019t see much in the way of material cost in the quarter because the amount of new product that we actually wholesaled in the quarter wasn\u2019t that material if you will. You\u2019ll start to see that more fully in the first quarter when we report in April because what you had is you had a really good strong material cost reductions that the team delivered that you largely mitigated, the effect of what we did see in terms of product cost.","So in \u201815, the North America is going to see a much, much stronger business. As we said earlier, we\u2019re going to have lot of growth in terms of volume. We\u2019re going to have higher share. We\u2019re going to have much stronger net pricing and that\u2019s on the back of the products that we launched last year, which will have full year effects this year, along with the ones that we will newly launch largely in the first quarter of this year.","But with that what you will see, is you\u2019ll see a substantial increase in product costs and you'll also see higher structural cost. And particularly, if you go back to the F-150 program, given the scope with that program, the degree of which we had to change and re-facilitize the facilities, that piece will obviously be with us for most of the year, given the timing of the launch of the Kansas City. So very, very strong improvement in the top line but you will see cost increases flowing through both the product level and structural level.","Bob Shanks","In terms of Europe, it\u2019s interesting. When you look at Europe and you go back to the transformation plan that Stephen Odell and his team announced back in, it was October of 2012. In that, Russia was an important element because we had data decision to go with a local partner, which has been good. At the time, we were looking at an industry that could grow to 4 million units, I think it was by the end of the decade.","It was at sometime between then and the end of the decade going to become the largest industry in Europe and of course that\u2019s all changed. And it's just a difficult situation. We\u2019re looking now at industry volume this year that\u2019s probably sub 2 million units. You got very high interest rates. You\u2019ve got the collapse of the ruble. You've also got -- in our case for example, in all the euro based manufacturers, very aggressive pricing to respond to the change of the ruble versus the euro.","And then with our competitors, particularly, the Japanese and then the Koreans as well, would have not had the price as much because their currencies have already weakened relative to the euro and the dollar. So there\u2019s a change in the competitive environment within Russia as well, which we\u2019re trying to respond to.","So we do expect to see a big headwind from Russia in 2015 and that is the major change in the guidance that we are providing versus what we said in September. And when you think about it, the question you are going to ask me actually, well, you wrote of your equity in the second quarter of your 50-50 JV.","So you\u2019d said at that time that won\u2019t have any financial effects on you if they were too and continue to incur losses which is true, but we still provide components and make money on those components, we still provide after service parts, make money on those, we still engineer the products, that they will ultimately build and sell, so we are incurring that expense and for that we receive royalties, which of course, are going to be lower, all of that\u2019s lower because of the volumes are lower.","But in addition, frankly, because of the very difficult situation, the business is facing there, the partners are having to provide additional support for the business and of course, we are working very closely together to respond to what is a dramatically different to what we thought even six months ago.","Mark Fields","And just to Bob\u2019s point, we are acting very proactively on Russia. We are -- we have got production. We reduced overhead. But also we are working topline. As you know, we are introducing six new products between midyear last year and into 2015. And so, I guess, I\u2019d term it there is never bad time to introduce good product in any market and that\u2019s our approach.","Rod Lache","Hey. Can you bracket the impact that you are expecting, it see like, you\u2019ve changed a lot over there, but what is the magnitude?","Bob Shanks","Well, the only thing, I have to guide you through in the appendix, you can see the year-over-year effect of Russia on Europe and it was $350 million and all I\u2019ll say is that the environment in 2015 is more difficult.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Adam Jonas","Thanks everybody. Can you remind us how much of the pickup truck market in North America last year or whatever period that you have -- that's recent relevant is tied to oil and gas end markets and maybe the Great Lone Star State specifically?","Mark Fields","Well, Adam, this is Mark. We don't have a specific number. But, obviously, it's a piece of it. Obviously, the biggest piece of pickup truck is the housing market. But what we've seen is, there could be some, as we step back and we look at the energy prices and what that may mean, for example, for wellhead, drilling and all that kind of those types of things. It could have a slight negative impact in let say the Southwest.","But keep in mind we could see positive impact in the rest of the country from lower fuel prices with more money in consumer\u2019s pockets, plus the other thing that's encouraging, you look at the latest housing numbers in terms of starts and permits, et cetera. We could see an offset on that. So that's basically the way I would characterize it.","Adam Jonas","Okay. Thanks Mark. And this is a follow-up, what would your team rank as a more worrisome issue to you, the strong U.S. dollar or these cafe standards that are kind of completely out of touch in reality beyond 2017? And a follow on to that, maybe could Ford way in on where, on the issue of raising the gasoline tax, you guys have any dog in that hunt? Thanks.","Mark Fields","Okay. Well, let me take a last one first, the gasoline tax, our position is, we will leave that to the policymakers to figure out whether they have support for that and what we are in support of is the things that we can control and what we can control is continue to have the team focused on delivering affordable and fuel-efficient vehicles to the market that people want and value. So that\u2019s our approach.","In terms of the two things you mentioned, the impact of the strong dollar. As Bob mentioned, we are not seeing a big bottomline affect on our financials in 2015, because it's a multifaceted thing. On the positive side, a strong U.S. dollar indicate strengthen our economy and obviously, that's good, given our position in the market here and it\u2019s our largest and most profitable.","Alternatively, a strong dollar has an effective, as Bob mentioned, on our competitive position, especially against competitors who import here into the U.S. and they could take it through pricing, reduce pricing or increase content.","So as we think about that, for exchange, for exchange movements that are driven by the markets and not by governments will deal with the hand that were given and use our creating value that process to improve the situation.","On the regulatory, it is a big issue as you know to meet those requirements. It's going to be very important for consumers to adopt the new technologies, the electrified vehicles, et cetera, and that's an important part of meeting the countries goals. And what we are seeing right now is, they are not adopting to the levels anywhere near that we expected.","So, that's why we're very looking forward to the midterm review with the government and as you know to agree to the one national standard. We wanted to make sure we had a midterm review to look at the feasibility of the goals, cost to the consumer, impact on jobs, et cetera. So that's probably the one that -- is the one that we focused a lot on, because it requires a market response from that and adoption, and we are not seeing at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed.","Colin Langan","My first question, can you just give a broad update of the F-150 launch, the Dearborn plant ramping, is it fully ramped at this point as Kansas City on schedule and do you have any color of the new F-150 is pricing, any color around on pricing in particular?","Second question is on foreign exchange, how are you being impacted by FX, because you are expected to lose money in Europe and South America. So just some of the volatility there actually shrink the translation of losses, is that a net positive to you or is the intraregional FX impact more than offsetting that?","Mark Fields","Okay. Thanks, Colin. I\u2019ll take the first one. And I\u2019m surprised it took that long to get an F-150 your question, but I am glad we did. We are exactly on plan, where we expected to be with the F-150 launch. We have added the third crew at our Dearborn truck plant. We are almost completely through the acceleration curve, little bit more time on that, but that's going smoothly. In Kansas City, we have installed the equipment into the body shop and the team is going through the debugging right now. So that is absolutely on plan.","As you look at the market response. As we noted in December, we are seeing very strong demand for the F-150. It's our fastest turning vehicle on the lot and actually as we look at this month, we have a few more days to close you, if we track as we expected, we could have our best January since 2004 and we'll see material increase in terms of the percent of our 2015 F-150s as a percent of our total sales.","The rich -- the mix has been rich, which is good and just anecdotally, we were in the NADA Convention this week and talking with dealers. And I had a number of dealers telling me that they haven't even driven the truck home yet, because literally as soon as they are showing up on the vehicle transport they are going out. So very, very encouraging initial response to the F-150 and we are bang on where we expected to be in terms of our launch. Bob?","Bob Shanks","Yeah. Colin, in terms to your question on exchanges, I am kind of looking at 2015. It doesn't broadly across the company. There's some ups and downs, but doesn't seem to have much of the material impact.","I think you are technically right, where we have losses like in South America and Europe, just look at the translation effect, obviously, the loss in local currency will translate into fewer dollars. But there other flows, you have got pounds, you have got euros, you have got a number of different currencies that play there.","But broadly for the whole company, it is not having much of an effect there. The other, I won\u2019t talk again about the competitive factor, I think that\u2019s the bigger concern that we have in terms of the impact on the businesses, the competitive factor that Mark touched on, but he handle that.","So the only other thing, I would say is, I think, when we are having conversations around exchange and particular a strong dollar, we\u2019d probably also should at least comment on commodities, because there is a correlation between the dollar and commodities, and well many currencies and commodities. And what we are seeing, in fact, as the dollar has strengthened, we are starting to see good news on the horizon from commodities, it\u2019s pretty much across most commodities and we think that will actually be a help for the business in 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please proceed.","Brian Johnson","Yes. Good morning.","Mark Fields","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Johnson","Just given volatility of fuel prices, I want to ask a question, we haven\u2019t really talked about for awhile, which is around the flexibility in your factories to go back and forth between CUV and Sedan, because it really seams the consumer is rotating away from Sedan towards CUV\u2019s. A couple of -- three questions, one, can you recap just what factories you have right now that currently can go back and forth between the two? Two do see more scope for doing that, perhaps as you\u2019ve rollover some platforms in the next few years, so you have the flexibility? And three, do you currently have with work rules, layoffs, reassignment, provisions the kind of flexibility in your union contracts, you would need to kind of get to the nirvana being able to flex to where the customer demand is?","Mark Fields","Thanks Brian. Let me take the last one first, when you look at the flexibility, if you recall back in the 2011 contract, very importantly, we came to agreements with our UAW colleagues around improved flexibility. And that has worked wonderfully for us over the last number of years in terms of adding Saturday hours or increased shifts, et cetera.","In terms of the flexibility between cars and CUV\u2019s, I don't know the number off the top of my head in terms of the number of plants. But I would say it's fairly limited in terms of a plant that produces a car and a CUV and utility.","But we do have opportunities, as we see the market move, again using that flexibility, the work rule flexibility that we have with the unions to either add additional weekend days or in some cases increase line rates.","And to your second point about going forward, obviously, that's something that we continue to look at as we plan our product cycles and our manufacturing, optimizing our manufacturing footprint to take into account shifts and then can we get the flexibility that we want in our manufacturing plants.","I mean, we do have that, for example in a plant, in Wayne, Michigan, where we produce a number of different vehicles and engines, but we\u2019ll continue to look at that going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ryan Brinkman","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I know you discussed the impact of fuel prices on segment mix earlier and that\u2019s important? But looking at from a different perspective, can help us in terms of sizing up maybe your annual logistics and freight expense? How to think about, how that could be impacted by say a 50% drop in fuel prices, whether we should be taking that into account in our models?","Bob Shanks","Yeah. That\u2019s sort of a corollary to the commodities. The oil price decline is going to give us the opportunity to see reductions in logistics expenses and we are already seen it as an opportunity for this year. So you are spot on.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, I know you have pass-through agreements with suppliers to compensate them when commodity prices rise and to recoup those savings when they fall? Do have a way to capture the change in the supplier\u2019s logistics expenses or are they sort of permitted to keep that?","Bob Shanks","That would probably be subject to negotiation with them. But we do issue as you said, when we talked about it before, we do have indexing across parts of our supply base related to commodities. So as they go up, there is adjustment, as they go down, there is adjustments. So, I think, the logistics impact just as it is for us as it more indirect impact. But, certainly, we are aware of that and we\u2019d hope to capture that as that opportunity occurs at the level of the supplier.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay.","Mark Fields","And also just to add to that, we manage a lot of the inbound logistics into our plant. So we\u2019ll work that aspect as well in terms of what we can control.","Ryan Brinkman","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just last question for me on China, lot\u2019s of talk of China slowdown recently, but actually it hasn't slowed, we continue to see all-time record highs there, 25 plus millions are in December, et cetera? How are you thinking about China industry in 2015? What\u2019s the latest you are seeing on the ground and if sales did slow, does that necessarily impact your plans and you are also getting a lot of market share?","Mark Fields","Great, Ryan. As we look at China, we are still -- we still see growth as you saw from our projections, we expect it to be between 24.5 million and 26.5 million units. And again a lot of that growth is coming from the Tier 3 through 6 cities, as consumers, their income rises and they are able to buy a vehicle.","As we look at the industry, overall, you we had our record market share there last year of 4.5% and as I mentioned, record number of wholesales. We expect our business to grow again this year and the reason for that is, because we\u2019re bringing on another plant. We just launched our Escort the end of last year. We have a number of products coming this year, which are products that actually increase our segment breathe. So it's not just about introducing a new product in the segment we are already in, it\u2019s introducing products into segments we have not been in.","So we think that that provides a good basis for us and we are coming off a position of strength, the brand is held in high regard, the focus was the best-selling nameplate again for the second or third year in a row and our buyers are tend to be younger and have higher income than the industry average and working with our partners, we have really built out our distribution network particularly in those 3 -- Tier 3 through 6 cities.","So we expect growth not as much in the industry as we saw last year for the reasons I cited earlier, but we are very encouraged by the positive response we might get from our new products to help grow our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Please proceed.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner","I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the earnings impact from some of the large investments you made last year. Also in those markets specifically you mentioned before you expect stronger volume share and pricing, but also a substantial increase in product costs and structural costs? So wanted to just ask on both these things? First of all, on the product cost versus pricing, do you expected to be net positive this year and then on the structural cost, I don\u2019t know, if you\u2019ll provide guidance specifically on that, but by how much you expect D&A to increase this year, obviously, you have been running at $4 billion plus when you are spending $7.5 on CapEx. So do you expect a substantial increase in D&A this year?","Mark Fields","Yeah. Let me take that. So if I look at the company and I look at our structural costs, they will be up more than they were in 2014 versus \u201913. The biggest factors of that will actually be engineering and manufacturing, and some of that not just because of what we've already done, but obviously, we are still investing for even more growth in the years ahead, particular if you go back to Investor Day and think about the type of growth that we are projecting up through 2020. So those are the two biggest factors.","But we will see an increase in D&A, I am not going to provide a specific number, it\u2019s not, by any means the largest of the elements that we will see next year, but it will be a good increase in terms of the size. And again that is related to investments that we will -- have already made or perhaps some made during the year.","In terms of pricing, we will see strong positive pricing both for product-related actions and as we always do and that was evident in the fourth quarter too in terms of the pricing that we achieved around the world that where we can opportunistically take pricing on related to product, we will do that and I would expect that to be the case again in 2015.","But, again, we have to be very sensitive to the competitive position in that place back into some of the earlier comments around what the Japanese competitors in particular may do, particularly in the super segment vehicles.","But we\u2019ll have very strong pricing and again obviously since we expect the results for the company and for North America to be better, we do expect for the combination of the volume, the revenue that we\u2019ll see more of that in terms of the positive effect than we will to the combination of cost increases that we see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Actually, just one for me, the increased free cash flow guidance from positive to higher, what are the main drivers behind that?","Bob Shanks","Well, when we gave the guidance of positive, I mean, we were just saying that we were -- there wasn\u2019t going to be next. It\u2019s going to be positive cash flow and that we were waiting because obviously as you know cash flow was a change of a change to some extent. So we want to see how we did in 2014. So now we have a good baseline. We can look and understand what we\u2019re looking at for 2015.","So clearly, we\u2019re going to see it driven by the top line. So the profitability is going to be a lot stronger. We see about no change in terms of the CapEx. We\u2019ve already talked about that, the 7.5 versus 7.4. And then I think the changes that we\u2019ll see in working capital and timing differences are not that material in terms of preventing us from seeing the fuller flow-through of what's happening on the improved profitability. So I think that the profits are probably the single biggest driver that will flow through to the operating profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC. Please proceed.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask another F-150 question but this one about maybe the initial fleet reception. I mean, you\u2019ve talked about maintaining if not improving the cost of ownership. Obviously we saw the mpgs on the new versus the old and that feels a little bit lower So maybe less of a benefit there. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the Edmunds\u2019 report which showed that the labor to replace aluminum could be, maybe 4X steel and maybe 2X the time.","So I was wondering are there offsets to that cost of ownership that we\u2019re not considering. I mean, I know the residuals are little bit higher but wanted to see how that pitch to fleet is going? And then related, I guess, how are you supporting the repair shops both four dealers and the independents with getting up to speed on aluminum?","Mark Fields","Great. Thanks Joseph for that question. And when you look at the F-150 in terms of the response from the fleets, obviously we\u2019re just starting to ship. And as you mentioned, total cost of ownership is very important to them and their interest in the vehicle is very high. And we\u2019re just starting to ship vehicles to them in that regard. And we think it's going to go well.","All you have to do is, I know, it\u2019s a different vehicle. But if you look at our transit for example, which we launched last year, if you look at even in the month of December, we had a higher share in the van and bus segment since 2006 with the new products. So as you know, what fleets do is they take a few units first. They get some experience with them. And once they have good experience with them, they really start ramping up the orders. And we expect to see that with F-150.","In terms of cost of ownership and this gets back to what the purchasing managers are looking at, as we\u2019ve said, the total cost of ownership for the new F-150 is going to be very competitive. We saw the Edmunds\u2019 report and unfortunately the experience with that -- that with the dealer was incorrect. The amount of time to repair based on the standards that we've developed and also shared with the dealers, it would have been about half the time. So it wasn't quite correct.","At the same time, as you know, we designed the F-150 so that when there are issues, body issues, et cetera that the way we designed it from a modular standpoint, it's actually very efficient to actually repair the vehicle. So overall, in terms of what we've done, we've trained over 750 dealers to be certified. Unfortunately this dealer that this Edmunds went to was not one of them that they've not gone through that yet. But we have certified over 750 and we worked with over 1000 independent body shops to get them ready for the F-150 but overall, with the overall competitive, a very competitive cost of ownership.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle of Detroit Free Press.","Alisa Priddle","Good morning, gentlemen.","Mark Fields","Hi, Alisa.","Alisa Priddle","Good morning. So just couple things. First, I didn't catch what the percentage of the mix was of the new F-150s, when you were talking about sales in January? And secondly, Mark, I was hoping you would just talk a little bit about your continued efforts to make quality a priority, given that there was an additional $1.3 billion in warranty costs in 2014?","Mark Fields","Very good, Alisa. As I mentioned in December, 5% of our total F series was the new F-150. In January, we still have a month yet to close but you'll see a number higher than that, as we close out January, as we stock up the units and as we get them to customers. So, you will see a higher number or a higher percentage. In terms of quality as you know, we've had a lot of focus on quality. We've had great progress around the world.","We've seen some of our own internal surveys of initial quality to be very positive, particularly around the vehicles that we\u2019ve launched because traditionally we've had some issues around launch. And I think the team is doing a very good job on making sure that the quality that we send on our new products is what customers expect and we are seeing that progress verified by third-party results, whether it's J.D. Power or even Consumer Report. So we are going to stay very focused on that.","Alisa Priddle","Okay. Were there any lessons learned from what you saw in 2014 or, are recalls just too unpredictable?","Mark Fields","Well, it\u2019s difficult to predict recalls and some of those were obviously on some older models and we took a lot of lessons from 2012 and \u201913. And the team has used that to help our launches actually in 2014. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll see that reflected in our volume results in potentially recalls going forward but we will wait and see.","Alisa Priddle","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey of Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.","Mike Ramsey","Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I know that you guys have new guidance to 2020. But I am curious. I know that the mid-term guidance for the mid-decade at one point was $8 million sales globally and were a couple million off of that. Did things not go as quickly in terms of ramping up your global sales as expected and if so, where was it not as fast as you anticipated?","Mark Fields","Right. Thanks Mike. When we actually announced the mid-decade guidance back in 2011, we said it was euro assumptions. And at that point in time, Europe hadn't tanked and South America hadn\u2019t imploded. So when you take all that into account, a lot of, if you look at what we projected in terms of the number of wholesales, we had an assumption around industry, around the world and regions and that's changed dramatically given some of the realities of the marketplace. That being said, as you look back on a number of things on the mid-decade guidance, we have actually achieved and we\u2019ve factored those into our 2020 guidance going forward.","Mike Ramsey","Okay. So, do you feel pretty good though that with -- I know South America is a head scratcher a little bit, but do you think that some of these markets where you\u2019ve made big investments are going to pick back up again that we are going to -- with a stumbling you will see that previously anticipated growth?","Mark Fields","Yes. We spend a lot of time on making sure that the capital that we allocate that we\u2019re going to earn an appropriate return. And if you look at South America, we know that the business environment in the region remains volatile, which is going to add uncertainty to the near-term outlook. But in the longer term, it's an attractive and important place to do business. We want to continue to serve our customers there. As you know, the previous decade, we made very good returns on our investments in South America and we expect that going forward in the medium to long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin of Associated Press. Please proceed.","Dee-Ann Durbin","Good morning.","Mark Fields","Good morning.","Dee-Ann Durbin","Thanks for taking the call. Can you just talk briefly about China market share and where you expect that to go this year?","Mark Fields","Thanks, Dee-Ann. As we mentioned, we have a number of new products launching in new segments. We have two new plants coming on line in China, one an assembly plant and one an engine plant. So we expect in China that to positively impact our sales. We\u2019re not giving out a market share objective. Our objective usually is -- is usual around the world, as we are going to sell as many people want. And we've seen our share grow pretty dramatically there over the last two or three years. As we mentioned, we had a record last year at 4.5% in China. And we expect that to grow based on some of the new segments and we feel are compelling products for Chinese consumers.","Dee-Ann Durbin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe White of Thomson Reuters. Please proceed.","Bernie Woodall","Hello. And this is Bernie Woodall imitating Joe White. Could you do me a favor and I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about Europe already. But just looking at yesterday, Sergio Marchionne on the Chrysler call said things are going to be improved in Europe over a low base? And then if you have made profit in Europe in the fourth quarter, General Motors is looking to make return to profit next year. The casual observer might look at this and say, oh, what\u2019s Ford\u2019s problem in Europe? Can you address that into vis-\u00e0-vis your competition there? Thanks.","Bob Shanks","Bernie, it\u2019s Bob and I'm sure, Mark will add comments. Again, I think, if you pull apart the business, we've made great, great progress on the European transformation plan, if I put Russia to the side. And you can see that in the results on a year-over-year basis, when you go through the data. We\u2019re seeing improvement in the topline. We gained in share. We actually held price on a year-over-year basis in a very, very competitive environment. And we saw a reduction in our cost, so everything is moving in the right directions.","But as I said earlier, we've made a bet on Russia. We think that\u2019s going to be an important market in the future. It\u2019s going to grow. It\u2019s a commodity-based economy. So it\u2019s being hurt right now for what's going on in terms of oil prices as well as, of course the geopolitical issues. But we still have confidence that over time that could be an attractive market we\u2019d like to participate in there.","And I don\u2019t know to what extent some of the competitors do or don't participate in the Russian market and what affect it would have on their results. But certainly that is probably the area that has the most impact versus what we had originally expected when we set out the transformation plan. And as Mark said earlier, we have lot of work underway to respond to very changed environment and to make sure that, as that market recovers then we can participate fully in that opportunity.","Bob Shanks","And I\u2019d just add, we are going to continue to work our process and Bernie, as you know when you do comparisons, it is important that you look at the profiles of the various companies. And in our case, we are in Russia with our partners. Again, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case for some of our other competitors. I have to look at accounting treatments and things that were, that may have been gone away because of a bankruptcy or others that impact the results.","So it's really making sure you do the appropriate kind of benchmarking between the two operations. But we\u2019re going to stay focused. It's an important market for us. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. We have more headwinds, a lot of it driven by Russia and we\u2019ll deal with them positively.","Bernie Woodall","Thank you. And if I could steal one more, you mentioned earlier, Bob, that by 2020 or few years ago, you were looking at $4 million in sales in Russia. Is there any venture of what\u2019s your guidepost there for 20 -- by the end of the decade in Russia, are you making any guess?","Bob Shanks","Yeah. I think it\u2019s probably too uncertain to make a call at this point. Clearly, if you look at outside third-party forecast, those numbers have come way down. But one thing you have to be careful of with any of these more volatile economies is that when you are at a high because we don\u2019t project that out. When you are at low, you don\u2019t want to say that that\u2019s where we are going to be for the next five years rather because what goes up comes down, vice versa. But I think it's fairly probably is a less positive forecast at this point. But I think once we come out of it and our expectations are that Russia will be one of the larger industries in Europe over the mid long-term.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session for today.

[Operator Instructions] After the question-and-answer session, there will be closing remarks.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn?","Lynn Antipas Tyson","Thank you, Holly. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Business, Technology and Strategy; and David McClelland CEO of Ford Credit.","Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of the quarter and progress against our strategic initiatives. Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and then we'll turn to Q&A. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks.","Our results comments today will include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 22 of our presentation. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year.","As a reminder, in 2020, we will update the business units in our Automotive segment to align with changes to our management and reporting structure.

Also, our revised 2018 and 2019 results show how they will appear in the new reporting structure. Investor relations team is available if you have specific questions about these changes.","Now I will turn the call over to Jim.","James Hackett","Thanks, Lynn, and hello everyone. Overall, the Ford team delivered solid operational results in the third quarter, while at the same time we made further progress on the global redesign of the company. We know though that we have much more work to do. As this is the mandate at Ford, executing in the now while transforming into a much more fit, agile, and customer-centric company that can win in an era of rapid change and innovation. ","Our team is operating with urgency and a focus to meet these challenges. Please turn to Page 4. Now touching briefly on the quarter, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow. The year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was up 80%, largely driven by improvement in our Automotive business. In the quarter, we delivered $1.8 billion in company-adjusted EBIT. ","That was up 8% supported by improvement in our businesses in China, North America, and Europe, as well as mark-to-market gains in corporate other and another strong performance by Ford Credit. In year-to-date EBIT for Automotive, it was up 10% and company-adjusted EBIT increased 6%. ","Please turn to Page 5. At the highest level, our global redesign is about making choices to transform Ford into a more fit and competitive company. Simply put, we are absolutely committed to improving execution and addressing under performance throughout the company. ","I will walk you through our business region by region. In our North American business amidst an intensified competitive environment, we are in the middle of an extensive product renewal. Reminding you that we are significantly refreshing and growing our SUV portfolio, introducing models like the completely redesigned Ford Explorer and Escape, and our all new Lincoln Aviator and Corsair. ","And I am pleased to say that we are approaching now full production on the new Explorer and Aviator. This product renewal comes as we also phase out our most traditional sedan silhouettes. And again, our intent isn\u2019t to give up customers in that Sedan segment, rather to enhance their view of Ford\u2019s potential to please them in even a better vehicle. ","We also plan to protect and expand our leadership in pickups and commercial vehicles. Look for a new Super Duty pickup in the coming months, and our all new F-150 next year. In a few weeks, we are introducing battery electric vehicles that\u2019s designed from the ground up to offer stunning performance, gorgeous design, and an incredible customer experience that is fully connected and updatable over time. ","We also have big plans for the long awaited rebirth of the Bronco franchise. So, Ford is expanding into battery electric vehicles and rugged off-road SUVs, challenging brands that have had those two growth areas to themselves for long enough. ","In total, I remind you that we are in the process of replacing 75% of our North American lineup by volume by the end of 2020, dramatically improving the freshness and appeal of our portfolio. The Ford team in Europe is making rapid strides in restructuring the business. We have reset our revenue and cost base and are rationalizing our product portfolio. ","Europe is now focusing on three business groups; a strong and growing commercial vehicle business, a smaller and more profitable passenger vehicle business, and a niche portfolio of profitable and brand enhancing imported vehicles. So, going forward, you will see us redeploy capital to build on our position as Europe\u2019s number one commercial vehicle brand. ","In addition, our country-specific product plans have us on track to deliver against the new European 2021 CO2 targets without penalties or fines using new hybrid and electric propulsion choices. We are clearly not satisfied with our standing in China, and the team is working exhaustively to return to profitable growth in this important market. ","We are working to stabilize the business and are now launching new products that are tailored to the needs of Chinese customers. At the same time, we are attacking cost, reinvigorating our dealer network, and improving sales and market capabilities. ","In South America, we are restructuring our operations to be far more asset light. And as you know, we made the decision to exit our heavy truck business. We reduced our management employee base by a full 20%, and we downsized our regional headquarters and rationalized the dealer networks in both Brazil and Argentina. ","Finally, we recently announced the formation of our International Markets Group. We will refer to this as IMG, which brings together 100 high-potential emerged and emerging markets including India, Australia, ASEAN, the Middle East, Africa, and Russia. This is all under one leadership team. Emerging markets are growing at almost double the rate of the global industry. ","By 2024, one in three vehicles in our industry will be sold in these markets. Having the right business model to profitably address this opportunity is critical, and that\u2019s precisely what IMG will do. ","Now please turn to Page 6. An important enabler of the strategy is the agreement we reached earlier this month with Mahindra. The joint venture will help Ford profitably grow in India and unlock the low-cost product development capabilities we need to grow in emerging markets. Ford will benefit from Mahindra\u2019s lower-cost platforms and value-focused engineering. ","Mahindra, on the other hand, will gain from Ford\u2019s global reach, quality, and technology, and that includes the battery electric vehicle. We are also taking strategic actions to prepare Ford to compete and lead in an industry that\u2019s being profoundly reshaped through connectivity, the sharing economy, automation, and new forms of propulsion. You can think of this as the smart vehicles for a smart world. ","We are scaling products and businesses that connect to the world around them in ways that benefits customers. With all elements of Ford\u2019s Smart Mobility now in one organization led by Jim Farley, we are sharpening our focus on where to play and how to win across this broad mandate. We are not able to reveal all the work we are doing in this exciting and fast-moving era, but there are few things that I can share. ","We are prioritizing investments in connected vehicle services that will improve the customer experience, and this will enable Ford to transition from what has been historically a largely product-led offering to an ever improving and much stickier suite of products, accessories, services, and experiences, all bundled together.","These investments have a sharp focus on customer data privacy and safety. They will open new opportunities to realize value from connected vehicle data and deliver outstanding experiences for our retail and commercial customers. And we\u2019ll have more to say about all of this in the future. ","And as you know, we are also developing mobility services like Spin which is among the top three micro mobility companies in the U.S. with a footprint in 60 markets and growing and over three millions rides year-to-date, Spin is expanding Ford\u2019s reach and areas that we believe will contribute to an even stronger base for our Autonomous Vehicles businesses. ","Speaking of AVs, last month, we announced Austin as our third market for our Autonomous Vehicle services. Together with Argo AI, we are currently mapping the city and we\u2019ll gradually increase the size of our fleet like how we are growing out operations in the first two cities, Miami and Washington DC. We are constantly learning from our expanding deployment of AV technology and services. ","This space has shifted and evolved significantly even since the formation of our AV LLC in 2018 and we expect it to remain dynamic in the coming years. Our team is focused on building a successful, sustainable, and scalable self-driving vehicle service. And to this end, we remain focused on our plans for initial commercialization of the self-driving service in 2021 and we will begin to scale that service once we are able to remove the safety driver from the vehicle. ","Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me address our full year outlook. We are experiencing more headwinds than expected in our fourth quarter. Especially, higher warranty, as a result, we have lowered our adjusted EBIT guidance range to $6.5 billion to $7 billion which suggests we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended. ","Of course, we are disappointed in this. But we are confident that we are laying the groundwork for sustained improvement in profitability and cash flow over time. ","In terms of warranty costs, we are feeling the downstream impact is from products designed earlier in the decade that we\u2019ve taken extensive actions to improve long-term quality and durability including centralizing core engineering responsibility and bolstering our systems integration and design assurance processes. These actions are already bearing fruit as we are seeing an improving trend in quality studies on our models. ","Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Stone.","Tim Stone ","Thanks, Jim. Hi, everyone. Ford\u2019s results this quarter demonstrate we are making progress and delivering on our commitments to customers and other stakeholders. However, it\u2019s clear, we have much more work to do. We are focused on consistently improving customer experience and operational execution across our business. We are making progress on a global redesign making the tough choices to lay the groundwork for improvement and future growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital. ","We are positioning forward to lead and win through fitness. For example, holding structural cost flat to down excluding pension and OPEB, and forming the JV with Mahindra. We are prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable, long-term growth in Mobility and disciplined execution is driving strong results from Ford Credit.","In the third quarter, we generated $207 million in adjusted free cash flow, year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was up 80% to $2.3 billion supported by lower capital expenditures, higher distributions for Ford Credit and continued improvement in working capital in Auto business. Adjusted free cash flow is our most important financial measures and we are committed to generating sustainable growth over time. ","Cash and liquidity of $22 billion and $35 billion remain above our targets. We remain committed to investment-grade credit ratings and a strong balance sheet. Wholesale declined 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by Europe, China and South America. Revenue was down 2% largely as a result of foreign exchange. Auto EBIT was $1.3 billion in the quarter with a margin of 3.9% as higher pricing and flat structural cost excluding pension and OPEB were offset by higher materials costs associated with product launches, higher warranty expenses and adverse currency exchange. ","Our strategic investments in Mobility increased 48% as we continue to build out capabilities in connected services in Autonomous Vehicles. For the end of this year, 100% of Ford\u2019s new vehicles in the U.S. will be shifted to connectivity and we are targeting 90% globally by the end of 2020. ","Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, posting a 9% increase in earnings before taxes. Loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit and auction values for off-lease vehicles were slightly better than expected. We now believe auction values will be down about 2% on average for the full year and receivables were $149 billion. ","Corporate other of $18 million included mark-to-market and other investment gains of $113 million including $77 million from pivotal software. On an adjusted basis, company EBIT increased 8% to $1.8 billion and our EBIT margin expanded to 40 basis points to 4.8% driven by improvement in our businesses in China, North America and Europe. ","Mark-to-market gains in corporate other and another strong performance by Ford Credit. EPS is $0.34 and our tax rate in the quarter was 10.7%. In the third quarter, we recorded $1.5 billion in special item charges with cash effects of about $300 million. Actions related to our global redesign accounted for $1 billion in EBIT and a majority of the negative cash effects.","As expected, most of the third quarter global redesign charges were for an impairment in India related to the planned formation of our joint venture with Mahindra. Special charges in the quarter also included $300 million in non-cash pension remeasurement losses and a $187 million for an unfavorable customs ruling. ","For the full year, we now expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of EBIT charges as a result of global redesign with negative cash effects of about $1 billion to $1.5 billion. ","Let me touch in a few areas of the business in more detail. North America wholesale units were down modestly. ","Launch-related ramp up of all new Explorer and Escape, the overlap of very strong production of F-series in the third quarter of last year to compensate for the decline in production volume caused by the Meridian fire and our decision to exit low-margin sedans were largely offset by the favorable impacts of our new Edge introduced at the end of 2018 and also Ranger. As a reminder, we plan to start production of the new Super Duty in the fourth quarter. ","Revenue grew 5% supported by higher pricing and improved mix. EBIT increased 3% with a margin of 8.6% driven by higher pricing and volume in the U.S. which were partially offset by launch-related production costs and higher warranty expenses. ","As a reminder, we expect to conclude our negotiations with the UAW in the fourth quarter and to recognize the full impact of ratification-related payments as part of our adjusted results. ","In Europe wholesales declined 15%, primarily because of our redesign actions to exit low margin businesses, including discontinuation of the C-Max Sedan. Revenue which was down 14% or 9% excluding the impact of currency was also affected by the lower volumes. ","At the same time, the benefit of Europe\u2019s redesign were evident in the EBIT which improved 27% in the quarter. This is the first time in three years that Ford has posted consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in European profitability. ","This performance is attributable to lower structural costs, stronger product mix and higher profits from our commercial vehicle JV Ford Auto. It was included to lower volumes and adverse currency exchange rates. ","In China, wholesales declined 12% and consolidated revenue is down 27% as improvements in mix and pricing were more than offset by lower volumes, and component sales to the joint ventures in the country. ","Our EBIT loss in China narrowed to $300 million, an improvement of $100 million year-over-year driven by lower structural cost and favorable market factors in consolidated operations. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in profitability in China. ","As Jim mentioned, we are working to stabilize our China business and working intensively to return into profitable growth. Deal engagement and profitability are starting to improve and we continue to keep production aligned to demand and ensure appropriate levels of dealer stock. ","Please turn to Page 20. While our third quarter results demonstrate positive improvements in the trajectory of some areas of our business, we clearly have a lot more work to do. We are updating our outlook to reflect several headwinds that have intensified since the last gave guidance. ","The first is higher warranty, particularly related to coverages; the second is higher incentives than planned in North America; and the third is China due to lower volumes and JV profits. ","Taking these factors into consideration, we are now targeting a full year adjusted EBIT in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year. This implies our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT range of $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion. We continue to expect strong market factors, lower full year auto structural costs excluding pension and OPEB, and strength in Ford Credit. ","We still expect adjusted free cash flow to be up to the full year driven by our Auto business and we remain committed to driving growth in cash flow and profitability over time. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 12% to 13%, which is lower than our previous expectations, largely driven by more clarity on provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017. ","This would yield adjusted EPS in the range of 120 to 132 compared with 130 last year. Relative to calls on capital for the year, we expect CapEx to be about $7.5 billion, down year-over-year reflecting benefits from our fitness initiatives, funded pension contributions to be about $750 million and shareholder distribution to be about $2.6 billion. ","Our guidance assumes no material change in the current economic environment, including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks uncertainties and other factors including those detailed in our filings with the SEC. ","Before we move to Q&A, there are couple things that encourage you to keep in mind as you think about Ford, today and for the long-term. First, our customers are informing and driving everything we do. ","That\u2019s why 2019 and 2020 are such robust launch years for us in North America. We are bolstering our winning portfolio of vehicles, based on what consumers want and need, reallocating capital to those higher return growth opportunities and carrying out changeovers of our highest volume and most profitable vehicles. And second, we are determined to always get better to persistently focus on our fitness, and continuously improve our operating productivity. ","While we see increased headwinds in our fourth quarter, we were biased for action and are intensely executing on the inputs that will enable us to capture the opportunities across our business that will allow us to drive free cash flow along with long-term growth in revenue and profitability including adjusted EBIT margins of 8% or better and we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and holding investment-grade credit rating. ","Now, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America. ","John Murphy","Hi, good afternoon guys and thanks for the call. Just a first question on to the rest of the year related to the fourth quarter, even when you back out the UAW bonuses, it looks like you're doing $1 billion, $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. ","So, it seems like it\u2019s a little bit on the light side, and you very specifically highlighted higher-than-planned incentives in North America. I am just curious are you seeing something on the competitive front where pricing is getting much more difficult, and it just kind of seems a little bit odd after you just posted a $700 million positive net price in the third quarter. Just it doesn\u2019t seem to match up with what you just did, so something changed dramatically in the competitive environment?","James Hackett","Hey, John, Jim Hackett. Let me ask Joe to bring you up to date on that. ","Joseph Hinrichs","Hi, John. Thanks for the question. So, if you look at it, the simple answer to your question is, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything dramatically changed in the environment at an industry level. Let me explain to you what\u2019s going on. For example in the third quarter, Ford\u2019s incentive increase year-over-year was slightly lower than what the industry average was for the U.S. market in the third quarter. ","What\u2019s happening in the second half of the year, our incentives overall are slightly higher than we\u2019d expected versus our plan for the year. That\u2019s largely driven by a couple of products. If you look at Ranger launch this year, it\u2019s gone very well. We had a \u2013 we\u2019ve been regaining share every month this year, and we had 18% segment share in September. ","But as you could expect the competitors haven\u2019t let us just grow that share without any fight, so we\u2019ve seen a little bit higher incentives on Ranger than we had expected given the launch of the vehicle this year, still very optimistic about the product. It won APEAL, won IQS for JD Power, but the incentive spend on that product has been a little higher than we\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year. ","If you look at what happened in the summer months, our competition on F-series was very aggressive; and so in September, we took some actions. We saw our segment share in F-150 come back up in September, and so we had to take some actions there. And Edge is in a very competitive segment, a little more competitive this year than we had planned for the year. ","So, that\u2019s kind of where you look at it, but in general that\u2019s more us versus our plan for the second half of the year. But I was referring to the U.S. industry in the third quarter as a reference point. Incentives are still pretty much under control and the industry is behaving in a pretty rational way so far. ","John Murphy","Okay. And then just a second question, and this might be a little bit more for Joe. But Jim, obviously I\u2019d love to hear your view on this. There was a lot of concern around the Explorer launch, and it sounds like there was a lot of problems there, but it seems like you\u2019ve got your arms around it and are ramping up pretty well. Just curious was that story overplayed in the press? ","And we all got a little bit too concerned about that? And are there any lessons that you\u2019ve learned for product launches, because obviously you have a ton coming down the pipe in the next 12 months from that process that you can apply going forward to kind of make sure we don\u2019t have this kind of kerfuffle or issues going forward?","James Hackett","I think I should \u2013 John, it\u2019s Jim Hackett, I think I should confirm that we have higher expectations for our performance and it\u2019s my experience in the short time that I\u2019ve been here that Ford is really good at this. And so, Joe can add some color here, but the challenge, what I call the design problem is that we had to ramp down a really profitable vehicle. ","We had to clear out the plant literally bulldoze everything out, build a new plant inside, get it started and not drop any volume in the midst of that. So, it was pretty aggressive and as I look at that, I want to win like that in the future. But we fell short in a few ways. In fact, Joe just took my whole team through a deep dive on what we\u2019ve learned from that. ","I was very impressed with kind of the granularity of what we do understand of how the things that should have gone better didn\u2019t. But what I am not concerned about is whether we get it and whether we have a grasp of how to get control of it. I\u2019ll let Joe share with you because of course we are getting daily updates, the latest status of where we are on Explorer. ","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, thanks, Jim. Thanks, John. So, really an important launch for us clearly, just to step back for a second, just so far this year, we launched the Ranger, all new in North America, very successful launch. Very unusual that it wins in its segment in IQS in the first year of introduction. Just launched Escape and Corsair down at Louisville, and that launch has gone very. It\u2019s gone and we are ahead of plan actually on that launch. ","So the Explorer, Aviator launch is a very unique situation. As Jim said, we are disappointed in our overall performance in the ramp up of the volume. The products themselves are wonderful. The Aviator is a fabulous product. About half the sales of Explorer so far are FZ and Platinum, and if you haven\u2019t driven an FZ, really challenge you do so. It\u2019s a lot of fun and..","James Hackett","They won\u2019t give it back.","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, so, you are right. So \u2013 but back to the launch, so, Chicago is our oldest plant. It was launched in 1924. It's very constrained as far as physical location and as far as land and area around the plant. Simply put, we took on too much. We signed up for too much at launch. We tried to launch on 3 crew, which we didn\u2019t even try to do when we launched the Aluminum F-150 back in 2014.","We launched the Aviator and Explorer both at the same time. We had the high reversion of Explorer. We had the Police Interceptor. We had Black Label Aviators. We had all this content and simply put with the new - with the product going from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel architecture, all new assembly line, all new body shop, all those things at once we took on too much and we shouldn\u2019t have it. ","And so, part of the lessons learned is obviously go back to how we manage these launches and sequence them in a way that gives the team a chance to be successful. Our wholesales were down in the third quarter about 19,000 Explorers year-over-year. And we also had an additional 6,000 aviators that weren\u2019t in the year previous year. ","And so, we feel really good about the fourth quarter. The last week or so, we\u2019ve been running about 59 JPH. We are actually running out of parts from our suppliers as we\u2019ve started to ramp up. We used to run at 60 JPH. So we are just about where we have been historically in that plant, plus we have the Show Center, the new additional line coming online starting about 6 JPH by the end of the month. ","So, we actually feel really good about where we are right now. It\u2019s been a lot of work and a lot to get here. The products look great. We have plenty of available inventory now in the dealers and we are excited about where they are going to go from here. ","John Murphy","Okay.","Joseph Hinrichs","And for the rest of the launches, John, Super Duty launch looks good this year. Transit launch looks good this year. Puma in Europe looks good. We had a lot of work to do for next year's launches, but I feel good about where we are for the rest of the year. ","John Murphy","Okay. And then, one quick last one on Ford Motor Credit, given the rate environment is shifting around on us in a direction that we expected 12 months ago, you had the credit downgraded Moody\u2019s. Just curious, as you are managing Ford Motor Credit, has anything changed in the way you are thinking about the business? ","And where are we on the shift of getting better return on assets on sort of a constrained, purposely constrained asset base? And could we see returns improve or profitability improve as soon as next year based on sort of those actions?","James Hackett","So, John, Jim Hackett. I am going to hand it to David McClelland. As an former bank board member managing through the crisis in this last decade, I am really proud of the Ford Credit discipline and in fact, our efficiencies improved. We aren\u2019t using more leverage to improve returns. So, we are very careful about that. But David, you can talk about and the great news we keep getting from Ford Credit. ","David McClelland","Yes, John. Hi, this is David. So, I am echoing what Jim is saying. I am very comfortable with the way the credit company is going. The portfolio looks very strong. I mentioned this in the last earnings call and I haven\u2019t seen any change in that. We manage as you know, we manage our business. We\u2019ve stated that we want to keep it around $150 billion. ","We manage the leverage between 8 to 9 as Jim just mentioned. You guys know how much equity is employed in the business and you know that we expect to get and we made this quite public in 12% return on that equity. So, when you do the math, our expected earnings should be about $2 billion. ","This year, we have had \u2013 you referenced it in your question, we\u2019ve had good news, interest rate versus what we expected. So we have seen that in our DMV numbers and the used vehicle performance has been better than we expected. You\u2019ve said now that we think the used vehicles will be down about 2% for the year. We are about 1.8% so far for the year. ","I know that that\u2019s slightly different to what Manheim has said, but then I look specifically at the trend last year in used vehicles and I look at what happened in the fourth quarter last year. And then, most important we allocate the return mix and the Manheim is of the 2001 segmentations. When you look specifically at the Ford Credit return mix, I feel comfortable that 2% is about right. ","So, overall \u2013 go ahead. ","John Murphy","Yes, but is there been any shift in the portfolio so far maybe away from dealer floor plan financing to maybe a higher-margin retail business? I'm just trying to understand where we are in through that shift?","David McClelland","The floor plan in the U.S., the amount of floor plan we do in the U.S. is pretty constant. I would expect it to stay there. We do most of the floor plan in Europe. We haven\u2019t seen a change in China. Our Fico is pretty constant on our sort of marginal business as you\u2019ve seen over the last ten quarters remained constant at 6%. So we are not seeing any change. ","John Murphy","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","James Hackett","Thank you, John. ","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache, Wolfe Research. ","Rod Lache","Hi, everybody. ","James Hackett","Hi, Rod. ","Rod Lache","Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple. Just on Q4, just to follow on John\u2019s question, North America, it equates a bit lower than expected in the quarter and I was wondering, is there an unusual warranty catch-up impact in there? How should we be thinking about warranty which is up a lot over the past few years, anything in there that shouldn\u2019t recur next year? ","And then, also on pricing, I am still puzzled by what changed relative to incentives. Just thinking about the market, one of the biggest changes that\u2019s happened since your last call is that GM has had a strike and their in-transit pipeline is basically emptying out. ","So, if anything with your biggest competitor declining to maybe 50 days of inventory, I would think that the pricing environment gets better from here. So it sounds like you disagree. I was hoping you can elaborate.","James Hackett","Thanks, Rod. This is like the Chicago thing. I just want to make it clear that the management team, starting with me understand that warranty is an opportunity for us to fix things that underlying challenges in our processes or the way we\u2019ve done things. It\u2019s my early work that I got involved in, Rod, in fact, when we met in New York in our first gathering, I talked to you about this that we attack the product development process with a lot of vigor. ","And you understand the gestation period in the auto industry. So a lot of the improvement that we have made, Jim Farley, Joe Hinrichs, myself, how tie tang in getting the portfolio to generate all the new products that we are talking about coming with less capital committed that we \u2013 that was planned when this new regime started $20 billion less. ","I am confident that the work that the PD process is undertaking is going to generate better performance. However, with that said, Joe and I are committed to control of our business and we\u2019ve been surprised ourselves by some of these things because these are, Joe will explain, products and service, some that are longer three and four years out that. ","Of course, we have to deal for our customers with problems and we\u2019ll do that. There is also with the DPS 6 transmission, we made a decision as a team to remove any kind of questions from ongoing ownership of the vehicles beyond really first ownership that the company would stand by in the performance of the products. ","So this is a big Ford commitment to make sure that no one was suffering through that product challenge. I feel really good from what the company can control that we got a handle on that. ","So let me just summarize by saying warranty is getting a lot of attention and the first thing is that the PD process has been restructured in the smart redesign house work there was kind of leading the company. But the benefits of all that, or in the next-generation of products. So Joe, maybe you can comment like on these historical products, what we\u2019ve learned.","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, Rod, thanks. So, as you look at it, the bulk of the warranty cost increases are in North America. It\u2019s 2018 model year and before that are the model years where we\u2019ve seen an increase in the higher time in service warranty claims than we had accrued for and have been planning for. That\u2019s largely driven by some power train actions. ","Some of those suppliers some of them are own, as Jim suggested, we\u2019ve done a lot of rework on our product development process to make sure we\u2019ve learned from this. But we have to get this bubble work into our system that we are seeing is here. We are seeing really good progress in our 2019 model year vehicles at the same point in time including six months, nine months in service, those kind of things. ","So, we feel really good about the progress we are making. But we have this 2018 model year and a few years before that and working its way through the system. The way our process works, of course, we accrue the forward models based on the experience we\u2019ve been having. ","And so, it takes a little while for that to work its way through the system. But that\u2019s what you are seeing. It is largely in North America from that perspective and that\u2019s what you see. ","On U.S. incentives, I just want to go back to what I was saying before, first of all, we haven\u2019t seen a markedly different approach by any of our competitors in the marketplace recently. We will watch that very carefully of course. F-150 transaction prices are $3000 higher than the all new Ram and Silverado even though our truck is couple years older. ","But we are watching, as I said, there are couple of segments where we saw some changes in the dynamics that we didn\u2019t plan for in the second half Ranger and Edge were two of them I was referring to. But I also said that, that we saw in the third quarter and we\u2019ve also seen in October so far that market has been pretty disciplined to your point and we are watching that very carefully. ","But a little bit of the \u2013 the bulk of the guidance change is really warranty-related, just want to be clear. Some of these other issues are also important, but the warranty that we are seeing that we have to address some 2018 model year and before is really the majority of what changed in North America. ","Rod Lache","Could you just clarity what the charges for preexisting warranty that you are rolling through the numbers this year? And then, just my last question is, what signs should we be taking away looking at the international numbers and kind of thinking forward, obviously there is savings here in Europe, China and South America, but the volumes are down as well in those markets? ","So, as you sort of look at what\u2019s happening here, any color on how we should be thinking about the trajectory of improvement from here as we think about next year, the positives on cost maybe higher compliance cost issues, that kind of things?","James Hackett","Yes, so, Rod, on the go-forward warranty, what I have \u2013 what Tim and Joe have done in the expectation for the year, they have given you that in terms of the way that years been projected. So we don\u2019t go out beyond that, of course, we have our normal reserve for warranty. But Tim, I am going to let you add any color that might help them a bit. ","Tim Stone","Yes, it\u2019s exactly as you said, and from a warranty cost perspective just to be clear, we do expect warranty to be up year-over-year. And again it\u2019s a key driver of our change in guidance for the fourth quarter. As accruals, we go through every quarter of course, then accruals are appropriate and reflect the experience as we have seen as warranties today through that point of time. ","James Hackett","And Joe, you might talk about the color in Asia. ","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, on the international markets, Rod, we\u2019ve seen progress obviously this year in Europe and in China. I think the European team is really making a lot of progress on redesign work that\u2019s been in place now for quite some time. ","I feel good about the progress we're making. South America, still in some pressure from what\u2019s going on in Argentina, but the South America business continues to make improvements as well in their restructuring. So both Europe and South America are really well on plan where we want them to be on the redesign efforts. ","On China, our sales have not come up as fast as we were expecting them to in the second half of this year. Part of that\u2019s industry, but part of that\u2019s our own performance. We are really seeing the dealer network starting to really grow their sales force, their profitability is returning, so - and our inventory is in really good shape. ","So we are watching that very carefully. I think the one to watch is, what\u2019s the China industry and how well do we do with our new models that we are launching in the third quarter, like the Focus Active, the Edge ST and ST line, the Taurus, the Territory EV and number of our products coming. We need to show growth in our China volume. ","So, the volumes are down as you suggested. Part of that\u2019s intentional with some of the product changes we made, choices we made in Europe to gather some of that volumes and with the downsizing we are doing in Europe, we gather focus and \u2013 I am sorry, in South America, got our focus in Fiesta production. ","That's by design. But I think hopefully, you\u2019ll see from here forward, we can grow the business in China with the products we have and you will see continued improvements in the European business. ","Rod Lache","Okay. Thank you. ","James Hackett","Thank you, Rod.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets.","James Hackett","Hi, Joe.","Joseph Spak","Hi, good afternoon. I guess, I want to turn back to North America and dive back into the Explorer a little bit. So, you mentioned wholesales in North America were down slightly. In the U.S., they were up slightly. I think that's pretty close to what you did from a production standpoint. So, I guess the real question is, were all those Explorers that we read about the challenges about wholesale this quarter? ","Are there vehicles at Flat Rock, as has been reported? And even if they are at Flat, are they wholesaled? And I guess, if they were wholesale to set the dealers, if you are just still doing the rework on them, is that also some of the costs that might be considered in the fourth quarter?","James Hackett","So, Joe Hinrichs can clear this up. I am not happy with the press\u2019 view of way we work through this. I mean, I am just going to I think tickle your fancy a little bit by having you understand how diversified changes are in the auto industry. When products come from all kinds of trajectories in terms of what makes them up, there is no companies that are vertically integrated anymore. ","So the way the reporter talked about how things are moved around and shifted as an indication that the process was broken, that\u2019s just not fair. And we were doing things because we were trying to take some of the pressure off this job per hour or JPH that Joe talked about. We could reduce some of the complexity. ","So that\u2019s - that actually worked. So that was \u2013 that\u2019s the way that was painted as a negative. It was actually misrepresented and what he was saying to you is that the wholesales were still down 19,000 units, but that was worst last quarter. So we\u2019ve made a lot of progress but Joe, I don\u2019t know if you want to add more to. ","Joseph Hinrichs","Sure, so, Joe let me just be clear. We shipped about, through the end of the third quarter, it\u2019s just the data I am referring to, we shipped about 96,000 units. We had about 9500 as inventory. Most of those were in Chicago. There is a couple of thousand still in Flat Rock. Just a reminder, there is no physical space around the Chicago assembly plant. ","So, when we have any issue, there is no place to put the vehicle. And if you ever been in the south side Chicago, you know there is no physical space. But some of the reports have been overly dramatized. We've used the Flat Rock for many launches, because we - you do this in the past because Flat Rock right now is working on one shift. It has plenty of capacity. It has lot of skilled depot. ","It has a rail yard nearby and when you are doing software updates or even if you are doing some physical repairs to the vehicle or doing some inspection, having skilled depot and having floor space and space in the yard to be able to do that is much more important to be able to do that with a good quality than trying to force it, moving vehicles around, because you have no physical space. ","And so, we think we\u2019ll have all the inventory cleared up by the end of November. And we feel really good about that. We have plenty of inventory out in the field now for both Explorers and Aviators and the dealerships. A lot of that came on pretty quickly admittedly in the September and October, we\u2019ve been shipping. ","Actually, in the last week, we've shipped a little more than we actually built, because we are actually starting to clear out some of those units. So we are shipping what we are building right now and we feel really good about the flow of that going forward. But we just don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t talk about it, but we\u2019ve leveraged Flat Rock a number of times over the last five or six years on launches. ","But unfortunately, the lost production that we had in the slower ramp up than we expected in Chicago led us people wanting to report on other things as well. So, our first and foremost approach, of course is attack the customers and keep them, yes, keep them well protected. ","And I want to be clear about on your question, we don\u2019t recognize the vehicles as wholesale and in our revenue stream until they are released with good quality and saleable to the dealer and to the customer. So, all those vehicles that I am telling you that are still on hold, they are not wholesaled. We don't wholesale until we are - they're gate released with the quality to be able to be sold.","James Hackett ","In fact, that discipline is really important, because, if we lose one customer, can you imagine the future cash flow loss of losing a customer? So, it's better that we get this right. The other thing, Joe, is if you follow the transit business or the F-150 business, those have multiple factories. ","So, when we're in the middle of launches with those vehicles, there is relief because of the way Joe Hinrichs can move things around. So, I am just echoing what he said to you, is Flat Rock was not evidence of chaos. It was evidence of us making sure things were right.","Joseph Spak ","Okay. On the automotive free cash flow is still higher year-over-year I noticed in the quarter, the Ford Credit distribution was up and I think year-to-date now it's at $2.4 billion, which I think is only slightly below what you sort of kind of previously indicated for the year. So, within that guidance, are you raising the Ford Credit distribution for this year, because maybe the performance of Ford Credit is stronger? ","And then while we're on cash flow, just maybe if you could provide an update on some of the cash with the redesigned cash flow, because again, that looks sort of light, the $1.5 billion to $2 billion you've indicated prior to this year, unless there is a big fourth quarter.","James Hackett ","So, Tim, you can field this.","Tim Stone ","You bet. This is Tim. So as it relates to Ford Credit, the cash distributions tend to track with profitability for Ford Credit and that's been consistent over time. So that will just be a natural flow. We haven't given specific Ford Credit cash flow guidance. But it\u2019s certainly factored into our expectation that we'll have growth in free cash flow, and it's been part of the 80% growth we've seen year-to-date so far this year.","On the special items, the cash thus far in 2019 is in $0.7 billion and we had said in Q2 that we expected $1.5 billion to $2 billion of cash. We've had a deferral in that. Similarly, earlier in the year we expected $2 billion to $2.5 billion in cash. So we continue to refine our estimates of the cash ramifications from the restructuring actions that we're taking and I now expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2019. Again, $0.7 billion of which has already occurred.","James Hackett ","And that's\u2026 ","Joseph Spak ","Just to be clear on the Ford Credit distribution, I guess, versus what you thought after the second quarter, embedded in the Automotive free cash, is the distribution higher than prior?","James Hackett ","Yes, we haven't given any specific commentary on when and how the flows occur. Again, they track with profitability over time.","Joseph Spak ","Okay.","Operator","All right. Our next question is going to come from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays.","Brian Johnson ","Yes, good afternoon. So, a couple questions. First, vis-\u00e0-vis Ford Credit, since a lot of the other questions have been asked, I was a little bit surprised by the cut in - or the improvement in expected decline in auction values. ","Given some softness we saw in Mannheim overall in the quarter, is there something specific to the kind of lease returns that you've been getting? Or, something that makes it a little bit better? And then, kind of as you kind of roll forward into next year, what's your expectation on that?","James Hackett ","Yes, Brian, I'll turn that to David. But I have to smile, because I am really proud of the brand. So I do think the brand carries when you are talking about F-150 pickup trucks and things like that. But David, am I right about that?","David McClelland ","Sorry. Thanks for the question. I think I touched on it a little earlier. So, we look at the performance year-to-date, which is down just short of 2% and then I looked at the performance last year, throughout the year and the trends actually over the last few years and then what happened last year in the fourth quarter. ","And then, specifically and importantly look at the return mix, which is what Jim was getting at and if you look at the return mix, remember Mannheim is off a really historical mix. ","James Hackett ","Yes.","David McClelland ","So if you look at our specific return mix, I feel comfortable that the 2% number is about right.","Brian Johnson ","Okay, good. And he second question, as long as we are going into Ford Credit, there has been a lot of negativity in the press around extended loan terms, subprime, underwater trade-ins being rolled into the loan, which would imply poor loan to values. Can you comment A, just on the general industry trend there? And B, the Ford Credit specific approach to that?","James Hackett ","Well, again, Jim Hackett. I am going to warrant to you, the way we run this company is what I'd like to talk about and there is a lot of integrity in the way we think about this balance sheet and the way we handle customers. I don't really want to comment on the others. There are practices that you would see that we would not accept at Ford Credit. David?","David McClelland ","Sure. Yes, thanks. So that the - again, echoing what Jim said, not to talk about outside of Ford Credit, but I can talk with some confidence about the credit company itself. The business that we're putting on the books remains very strong where our FICO For the quarter is 750 and we're not moving at all on any of the higher risk business that we're doing. ","And then, really to the heart of your question, we are not in the longer terms. We're not, even if the average transaction price is going up. We are not seeing any movement on our longer-term business, which the mix of that, the 84 month is only 3%. ","There is nothing that I'm seeing in the performance in terms of delinquency, even the early, early defaults, non-delinquent defaults are not moving, 30, 60, 90s are fine. In our slides, there is a seasonality on the LTR, but that is simply seasonality. ","Just look at 2Q18 versus 2Q19. Your prior questions about the disposals in terms of the residual values are pretty good. So, I mean we are staying diligent, but I am comfortable and confident that what you're reading about is not what you're seeing in the credit company.","Brian Johnson ","Okay, thank you.","James Hackett ","Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.","James Hackett ","Hi, Adam.","Adam Jonas ","Thanks, everybody. Hey, Jim, how are you?","James Hackett ","Good.","Adam Jonas ","Good. Just two quick questions and apologies for the background noise, just wanted to zone in on the consolidated China business, which my understanding is imported products, it is, I know, very Lincoln heavy from the U.S. into China, calculating an operating margin loss of around negative 25%, negative 30%, that territory. Can you just again justify or explain why would you do that? ","I guess, it doesn't strike me as a business worth doing. Do you have a choice to just stop doing that? Just to stop selling U.S.-made cars into China, which, for a variety of reasons, as a global automaker, you think you've got to make where you sell. Is that something you can stop doing? Or is there a story of, you are trying to keep the blood in the patient, the dealer lifeline kind of going and that can kind of we can cycle out of that and stop doing that stuff?","James Hackett ","Yes. Well, I think your analysis, as always, is really good and I mean, imagine together the way we ask Joe Hinrichs to plan with the tariff structure that is in, it's up, it's out, it's down. And so, I do think that I've been public and said a year ago when I asked about this, I thought there would be a resolution in the way that we'd have certainty and what I would say an equilibrium if you remember, that we could plan our business and Lincoln was responding really well to exports from here.","That is an example where there is blood in the patient, so to speak. The brand was growing as fast as anything in the country, and we've made commitments. People had made commitments to us. I thought where you were going was also about the larger question of participation in China, which is something I am still committed to. I think there is a formula there, a business model that Ford can excel at.","But Joe, I don't know if there is any more. You remember, Joe Hinrichs, who is now President of Automotive, also got us started in China. So he has had some, he was on the ground there and had experience. But the question Adam is asking, you know, of is there false \u2013 are we doing false things here that aren't sustainable?","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes. It's a very fair question, Adam. I recognize our consolidated operations in China are complicated, because we have the Lincoln imported products that, some of the Ford imported products. We also have the cost structure of Ford-owned entities and employees in China and then we have our allocations from the corporation and from engineering, et cetera, are in the consolidated numbers. ","So it's a compilation of a lot of things. Suffice to say, we don't believe in exporting vehicles at a contribution margin loss, as long as we don't have a spike in import duties that are a near-term issue. The solution to this largely is around localization plans for our business in China. We've been very public about, we have five more vehicles being planned to be locally assembled in the near term. ","That includes the Lincoln Corsair and the Ford Explorer. So a number of products are going to be localized over the next year, year-and-a-half, which will really influence this. It will help us be more competitive cost-wise in the business in China, but also will take away some of the exposure we've had, just some of the fluctuations in tariffs. ","So, we feel good about that plan. As you know and you noted, the Lincoln plan has been an import plan until now, when we started localizing Lincoln Corsair and then more to come from there, which will really help with this. So they're contribution margin positive. There is a lot of costs in the consolidated business. But this will largely get taken care of by the localization plans we have going forward. Thanks.","Adam Jonas ","Thanks, Joe and Jim, and if I can just sneak in one more on hybrids. There seems to be this referendum going on in global autos where some companies are kind of canceling their hybrid programs and saying very openly that they view them as kind of regulatory cars and kind of compliance vehicles that consumers don't really fully value, even if on paper they make sense and they are really complicated vehicles. And not a lot of capital to throw around. Others are moving straight to EVs. ","And then some, I'd say like you and Toyota are in a camp of, hybrids are the real deal. They are going to be with us for a long, long time and consumers value them. Maybe Joe, for you, if I were to ask you kind of 5, 10 years out, you are in a long-term business where product you are planning now, some of it won't even be on sale for north of five years and it has to be on the road for 10 or 20 years. ","If I put that longer-term hat on, are you equally bullish on hybrids as you are on EVs? If I force you to pick one, really that 10-plus years, where is the incremental Ford dollar going to invest?","Joseph Hinrichs","Yes, Adam. Thanks. There is a lot there. So, when Jim Farley announced, I think it was now a little more than a year-and-a-half ago about $11 billion commitment to electrification, we were all in on all parts of this discussion. Yes, we see significant growth in our hybrid business over the next five years and part of that is, we think that where consumers are today and where costs are today, that makes a lot of sense for the economic choice of the consumer. ","As you know, we're taking a portfolio approach to this. It isn't just about hybrids or plug-in hybrids, it also about electric vehicles starting with a very exciting vehicle next year and the other ones are coming after that. So I think you are talking about a transition period. We think that hybrids will continue to be part of the equation for a number of years to come. ","But our BEV portfolio will grow substantially over the course of time and we think that ultimately is where this largely goes. But we do see a role for hybrids in the portfolio.","Remember, we get questions all the time about, with the movement of sedans largely out of the North American portfolio, what happens if gas prices spike? Well, again, our portfolio approach, which we've been consistent all along, our new SUVs all have some kind of electrification as part of each nameplate we're launching, so that we can offer solutions to customers, if we should see a spike in fuel prices or other things. ","So there is a number of reasons why it's important to us. But we are bullish on bad electric vehicles. We think it will be toward the end of the decade that will be a significant portion of the portfolio of electrification. But we do still see hybrids as being an important part of the portfolio, especially in the near term, where there is no compromise, no range anxiety for consumers.","James Hackett ","In fact, Adam, I loved when we had this exchange a year or so ago, I was doing the thing where I would bring up the computer industry as a proxy and we were saying can you convert that to thinking about automotive? You remember when computing was \u2013 where we were moving from chip size, Pentium, et cetera, and you would buy the next-generation computer based on that. ","And of course, that's been blown up in terms of the way the markets now respond to computing. You know, what Apple has done in terms of the iPhone. We see the features and virtues, rather than what's inside of it. I think this is going to happen now in automotive. I give Jim Farley and Joe a lot of credit here, as Ford was leading in this way. ","In other words, all the rhetoric was around, do you have electric vehicles or do you have hybrid vehicles? And we've got this exciting thing coming in November that is going to take advantage. ","Adam Jonas ","I can't wait.","James Hackett ","I know and what I want you to imagine with me is the dialogue is going to start to shift, because the nature of the product is going to be what's talked about rather than the propulsion. Of course, we're committed to that. We've got this F-Series coming and of course you know we've been working on a battery electric inside of that. ","Imagine when the Bronco comes, how exciting talking about Ford products is. So, I just want to say that I love where you are going with the question, and I'm really excited about the way Ford is interpreting that.","Joseph Hinrichs","And just a reminder, as battery costs improve or lower, hybrids also become more affordable. It's not just about electric vehicles. So, that becomes also part of the equation for the customer.","Adam Jonas ","As long as the internal combustion part of the hybrid does not increase, does not offset that. But I get your point, Joe and I do appreciate both of you on that - answering the question. Thank you.","James Hackett ","Yes, thank you. And so, let me just close and say the third quarter results do have evidence of the global redesign of Ford. When you heard the news about how Europe persistently now is improving, and so it\u2019s driving these positive shifts. But, make no mistake, humility of the work that we still have to do, I am still very confident in the team here and the progress that Ford Motor Company is making. ","We are focused on improving our fitness and our outcomes. This is driving a winning portfolio, where we're fortifying the strengths. As you heard me just mention a moment ago to Adam improving mix. And we're focused on laying groundwork to improve the trajectory of long-term growth in cash flow and profitability. ","That evidence is really starting to show up in the previous calls. You all asked us, are you sure your structural costs aren't rising? You know, we really have attacked this and I think we have a good handle there. And then a commitment by me personally that things that you would expect us to do better, that we are addressing, and we are.","So thank you very much for your attention this evening.","Operator","Thank you.

Please proceed.George Sharp","Thank you very much, Darcel, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results.Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford Motor; and Robert Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Mark Fields, Chief Operating Officer; Stephen Odell, President, Europe, Middle East and Africa; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.Now before we begin, I need to cover a few things. As you know we are in the process of realigning our African operations with Europe and the Middle East under Stephen Odell to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities and efficiencies. Changes to our business unit reporting to reflect the realigned organization will began next year. The data reviewed today and used by us throughout 2013 will be consistent with our reporting over the past several years.Also copies of this morning\u2019s press release and the presentation slides that we will be using have been posted on Ford's investor and media website for your reference. The financial results discussed today are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-K that will be filed next month.

The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to the US GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Of course, actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our various SEC filings.With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ford's President and CEO, Alan Mulally.Alan MulallyThank you, George, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 business performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our plan. We also share with you today our major plan assumptions and key metrics for 2013. Let's\u2019 start by turning to slide three please.The company had a solid fourth quarter achieving operating profit for the 14th consecutive quarter and the higher fourth quarter operating profit for the total company and the automotive sector since 1999, when trucks and SUVs were a more significant portion of our U.S. product mix. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive and we ended the year with strong liquidity. We delivered year-over-year increases of both wholesale volume and total company revenue, driven by gains in all reasons except Europe.Operating profit and margin in North America set fourth quarter records since 2000 when we began reporting North America as a separate business unit. Ford Credit once again delivered solid performance and results in South America and Asia Pacific and Africa were positive. Europe, on the other hand, incurred a substantial loss.For the full year, total company operating profit was strong with automotive operating profit and margin about equal to a year ago. Within the automotive results, North America delivered record operating profit and margin since 2000. South America was profitable for the ninth consecutive year. Europe incurred a substantial loss in line with guidance and Asia Pacific and Africa achieved record full-year wholesale volume and revenue. At Ford Credit, results were solid. And automotive operating related cash flow is positive for the third year in a row.For 2013, we expect total company operating profit to be about equal to 2012, automotive operating margin to be about equal to or lower than last year and automotive operating related cash flow to be higher as we implement our ONE Ford plan.Let\u2019s look more closely now to financial highlights of the quarter and full year. Slide 4 summarizes our business results for the fourth quarter and full year compared with a year ago. Fourth quarter wholesale volume was 1.5 million units, up 107,000 units or 7% compared with a year ago and revenue at $36.5 billion was up $1.9 billion or 5%. Pretax profit, which excludes special items was $1.7 billion, $577 million higher than a year ago. Earnings were $0.31 per share, $0.11 higher.Net income attributable to Ford, including favorable pretax special items of $160 million, was $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share. Excluding the impact of 2011 changes in our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which we highlighted last year, our fourth quarter net income was $565 million higher than 2011, while our full year net income was $307 million lower than a year ago.We also show the difference in net income, including valuation allowance on the line just below. Automotive operating related cash flow was $1 billion, the 11th consecutive quarter of positive performance. Full year pretax profit was $8 billion, $797 million lower than a year ago and net income was $5.7 billion. Automotive operating related cash flow was $3.4 billion and we ended 2012 with $24.3 billion of automotive gross cash, exceeding debt by $10 billion. Overall, despite many challenges, including the tough environment in Europe, we had a solid fourth quarter and a strong full year, thanks to our ONE Ford plan.During 2012, we continued to execute the ONE Ford plan and providing customers with vehicles they want and value as we undertook one of the most aggressive large schedules in several years and our customers responded. Through the first nine months of the year, Focus was the world\u2019s bestselling nameplate and Fiesta the world\u2019s top selling B car.We also continued to invest for tomorrow by increasing capacity in North America by 400,000 units and opened two new plants in Asia with seven additional facilities under construction. With regard to Blue Oval back after achieving investment-grade ratings. Consistent with our plan to deliver profitable growth for all, we resumed regular dividend payments to our shareholders and just over two weeks ago, we announced that we are doubling it. And finally, we began to implement our plan to achieve profitable growth in Europe, focusing on all parts of the business including product, brand and cost. All in all, this has been a strong year for Ford, including the actions we announced to ensure future success.Now, let\u2019s turn to Robert for a more detailed look at our financial results.Robert Shanks","Thanks Alan and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start with Slide 7 which walks our pretax operating results to net income. As Alan mentioned, total company pretax operating profit was $1.7 billion. Pretax special items were positive $160 million, reflecting a gain on restructuring of our passenger car joint venture in China, offset partially by costs associated with the U.S salary retiree pension lump sum payout completed to date, along with personnel actions mainly in Europe. Additional detail is shown in appendix 3.The provision for income taxes was $246 million and net income attributable to Ford was $1.6 billion. Our operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown, was about 31% in the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year. For 2013, we expect our operating tax rate to be similar to 2012.Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8 and our pretax results by sector. Total company fourth quarter pretax profit of $1.7 billion reflects positive contributions from our automotive and financial services sectors. As shown in the memo, total company pretax profit increased by $577 million compared with last year, more than explained by a $676 million improvement in the automotive sector. Compared with third quarter 2012, total company pretax profit declined explained our automotive sector. Both sectors contributed to our strong full year results. Compared with last year, total company full year pretax profit declined, explained primarily by the expected reduction in financial services.Slide nine highlights the key market factors and financial metrics for our total automotive business. In the fourth quarter, wholesale volume and revenue were higher than a year ago with increases in all regions except Europe. Pretax profit was $1.3 billion and operating margin was 3.8%, both higher than a year ago. As shown in the memo below the chart, total automotive full year pretax profit was $6.3 billion with an operating margin of 5.3%, both about equal to a year ago.Slide ten summarizes the $700 million increase in total automotive fourth quarter pretax profit from 2011 by causal factor. The increase is explained primarily by higher net pricing and non-repeat of 2011 UAW ratification bonuses included in net interest other, offset partially by higher structural cost. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was $0.5 billion lower than the third quarter reflecting higher contribution cost and a seasonal increase in structural cost. Higher volume was a partial offset. More details on the quarter-to-quarter change are included in appendix seven.Slide 11 shows fourth quarter pretax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive. Automotive sector profit of $1.3 billion is more than explained by North America. South America and Asia Pacific, Africa were also profitable, while Europe incurred a loss of $732 million. The loss in other automotive mainly reflects net interest expense offset partially by favorable fair market value adjustment on our Mazda investment.For 2013 we expect net interest expense to be higher than our fourth quarter run rate, reflecting the increase in automotive debt associated with our recent issuance and lower interest income. Slide 12 summarizes the total automotive full year pretax profit compared with 2011 by causal factor. Profit was about equal to a year ago, reflecting primarily higher net pricing and lower compensation cost included in net interest other, offset by higher cost, mainly structural, and unfavorable volume. The structural cost increases includes the effect of higher volume, new product launches, investments to support our future product, capacity, brand building plans, and higher pension expense.Slide 13 shows full year pretax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive. Total automotive pretax profit of $6.3 billion was led by North America. South America was profitable and Asia Pacific incurred a small loss. Europe reported a loss of $1.8 billion. The loss in other automotive reflects net interest expense and fair market valuation adjustments including our investment in Mazda.Let's turn now to slide 14 in our automotive business in North America. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue were up 9% and 13% respectively. Pretax profit was $1.9 billion and operating margin was 8.4%. U.S. industries SAAR increased from 13.8 million to 15.4 units while our U.S. total share was 15.3%, 1 percentage point lower than a year ago. As shown in the memo below the chart, North America full year pretax profit was $8.3 billion with an operating margin of 10.4%. Volume and revenue also were higher.Slide 15 shows the $1 billion increase in North America fourth quarter pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The increase primarily reflects favorable market factors and lower compensation costs reflected in other. As shown in the memo, pretax profit decreased by $400 million compared with third quarter, more than explained by higher cost including a seasonal increase in structural cost. Favorable market factors were a partial offset.For 2013 we expect the strong North America performance to continue with pretax profits expected to be higher than 2012, and an operating margin of about 10%. This reflects a growing industry, a strong Ford brand, an outstanding product lineup driven by industry leading refresh rates, continued discipline in matching our production with demand, and a lean cost structure.Slide 16 shows our U.S. market share in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2012. Our fourth quarter total market share of 15.3% was down a percentage point from the same period last year, while retail share of the U.S retail industry was down 0.9 of a percentage point. The lower share performance in fourth quarter was the result of lower Fusion availability associated with the launch of the new 2013 model and a discontinuation of Ranger. Fourth quarter sequential share growth was largely the result of strong F-Series sales coming from improved full size pickup segmentation and a fast start for our all-new C-MAX Hybrids.For the year, total market share was down 1.3% points, while U.S retail share of the retail industry declined 0.7 of a percentage point. The declines largely came from the discontinuation of Crown Victoria and Ranger, capacity constraints and reduced availability associated with our Fusion and Escape changeovers.Let\u2019s turn now to South America on Slide 17. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue increased by 16% and 11% respectively. Pretax profit was $145 million with an operating margin of 4.8%, both higher than a year ago. South America industry SAAR and our market share were about the same as in 2011. As shown in the memo below the chart, South America full year pretax profit was $213 million, substantially lower than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were lower than last year.Slide 18 shows the $37 million increase in South America fourth quarter pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The increase is more than explained by favorable market factors with higher cost and unfavorable exchange in Brazil being offset. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was $136 million higher than third quarter due to favorable market factors driven by our new products that were recently launched.For 2013, we expect South America results to be about break even, although results will benefit from new products recently launched or to be launched during the year. The competitive environment and currency risk across the region, especially in Venezuela, are expected to impact our profits adversely. In addition, government actions to incentivize local production and balanced trade are driving trade frictions between South American countries and also with Mexico, resulting in business environment instability and new trade barriers.Now let\u2019s turn to Europe beginning on Slide 19. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 16% and 22% respectively, reflecting mainly lower industry sales and lower market share. Unfavorable product mix and exchange also were contributing factors adversely affecting net revenue. Pretax results were $732 million loss.Industry SAAR for the 19 markets we track in Europe decreased by 12% to 13.5 million units, the lowest quarterly SAAR since 1995. Our market share at 7.6% was down 0.3 of a percentage point. We estimate that while our retail market share was in line with last year, our share of the fleet segment was lower in part due to availability of large cars. As shown in the memo below the chart, Europe full year loss was $1.8 billion compared with about break even a year ago. Volume and revenue both were lower than 2011.Slide 20 shows the $540 million decline in fought quarter pretax results for Europe compared with 2011 by causal factor. The decline is more than explained by unfavorable volume and mix. As shown the memo, pretax profit declined $264 million compared with third quarter due to higher cost. Our results are consistent with prior guidance and our European transformation is proceeding according to plan. In the quarter, we started recognizing accelerated depreciation for the plants we intend to close. We also recognized the cost of salary separations which are included in special items.We\u2019re on track to deliver our European transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. This year, compared with last year will benefit from the non-repeat of the stock reduction to the degree that we incurred in 2012. However, consistent with our guidance, we\u2019ll incur higher costs associated with restructuring, mainly investment in new products as outlined in our Amsterdam product event, as well as accelerated depreciation and cost to implement a revised manufacturing footprint.Similar to the successful restructuring of North America, these are the investments we must make now in order to enable the transformation of our European business for profitable growth in the future. While our restructuring related investments this year are consistent with our October guidance, our outlook for industry volume this year has deteriorated. It\u2019s now expected to be at the lower end of the range of 13 to 14 million units. In addition, we are being affected adversely by higher pension cost due to lower discount rates and a strong euro. As a result, we now expect a loss of about $2 billion for 2013 compared with the prior guidance of a loss that\u2019s about equal to 2012.The business environment in Europe remains uncertain. As is our practice, we will continue to monitor the situation and we will take further action as necessary to ensure that we remain on track to deliver our plan. Now let\u2019s turn to Asia Pacific, Africa on slide 21.Fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue improved 41% and 47% respectively compared with a year ago. Each were quarterly records. Pretax profit was $39 million and operating margin was 1.4% compared with a loss a year ago. Industry SAAR increased from 31.3 million 33.7 million units. Our share increased from 2.8% to 3.4% and set another quarterly record driven by a record share for China as we continue to benefit from increased capacity and new products. Since the first quarter, our quarterly market share for the region and for China increased sequentially.In fact volume, market share, and top line revenue increasingly demonstrates the growth underway in Ford\u2019s business in Asia Pacific, Africa. For example, compared with just three years ago, Asia Pacific, Africa\u2019s full year wholesale volume has about doubled. Market share has improved about 0.5 percentage point and net revenue has increased by more than two-thirds even though our reported revenue does not include the impact of our unconsolidated joint ventures in China.Asia Pacific Africa\u2019s full year results are shown in the memo below the chart. The pretax loss was $77 million, largely reflecting investments we are making for future growth while volume and revenue improved compared with last year. Slide 22 shows the $122 million improvement in Asia Pacific Africa fourth quarter pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The improvement is more than explained by favorable market factors offset partially by higher cost associated with new products and investments for higher volume and future growth.As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific Africa pretax results were about the same as the third quarter. For 2013, we expect Asia Pacific Africa to be about breakeven. We expect our volume and revenue growth in the region to accelerate, supported by the launch of the all new Kuga, Ecosport, and refreshed Fiesta across the region, as well as the launch of Mondeo and Explorer in China. This will be offset in large parts by continued strong investment across the region to support our longer range growth plans.Slide 23 covers 2012 fourth quarter and 2013 first quarter production. In the fourth quarter, total company production was about 1.5 million units, 125,000 units higher than a year ago. This is 13,000 units higher than our guidance. We expect total company first quarter production to be about 1.6 million units, up 160,000 units from a year ago reflecting higher volume in all regions except Europe. Compared with fourth quarter, first quarter production is up 72,000 units.Let's turn now to slide 24 and review our automotive growth cash and operating related cash flow. We ended the quarter with $24.3 billion in automotive gross cash, $200 million higher than the end of third quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $1 billion positive and our cash flow before financing related charges and dividends was $1.3 billion. During the quarter we contributed $900 million to our worldwide funded pension plans, which included $0.5 billion of discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plans in line with our previously disclosed long-term pension de-risking strategy.Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $200 million and our full year operating related cash flow was $3.4 billion, gross cash improving $1.4 billion. Slide 25 summarized our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of fourth quarter. Automotive debt at the end of the year was $14.3 billion and we ended the year with net cash of $10 billion, $200 million higher than a year ago and automotive liquidity of $34.5 billion, $2.1 billion higher than a year ago. Not included on the slide is the $2 billion, 30-year automotive debt issuance that we completed earlier this month. This was our first U.S public debt issuance in about a decade and took advantage of favorable market conditions to issue low cost, long term debt. The proceeds will be used to redeem about $600 million of 7.5% callable debt with the remainder being contributed to our funded pension plans during 2013 to support our derisking actions. This action is consistent with our mid-decade target of automotive debt levels of about $10 billion.Slide 26 provides an update on our global pension plans. Worldwide pension expense in 2012, excluding special items was $1.2 billion, $300 million higher than 2011. Special item charges were $400 million, including $250 million associated with our U.S salaries voluntary lump sum payout program. As we previously announced, this program started in 2012 and will continue through 2013. To date, we\u2019ve settled about $1.2 billion of our pension obligations. The 2012 special charge reflects the acceleration of previously unrecognized losses in the plan proportionate to the obligations settled to date.In 2012, we made $3.4 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans of $2.3 billion compared with a year ago. This includes $2 billion of discretionary contributions consistent with our previously announced pension derisking strategy. This year, cash contributions to funded plans are expected to be about $5 billion globally, including discretionary contributions of about $3.4 billion. Worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $18.7 billion at year-end 2012 a deterioration of $3.3 billion compared with the year ago, more than explained by lower discount rates.Asset returns in 2012 for U.S plants were 14.2%, above our expected long term return assumption. Going forward, our expected long term return assumptions for the U.S is 7.38%, down 12 basis points from a year ago.Turning now to Ford Credit, Slide 27 shows the $92 million decrease in fourth quarter pretax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. The decline reflects mainly lower credit loss reserve reductions and lower financing margins as higher yielding assets originated in prior years run off. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit\u2019s pretax profit was $21 million higher than third quarter.Slide 28 provides an explanation of the $707 million decrease in Ford Credit\u2019s full year results compared with 2011 by causal factor. In line with our expectations, the lower profit is more than explained by fewer leases being terminated which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain and lower financing margin. Although not shown, Ford Credit paid distributions of $600 million to its parent during 2012.For full year 2013, Ford Credit projects pretax profit about equal to 2012, managed receivables at year-end in a range of $95 billion to $105 billion, managed leverage to continue in the range of 8 to 9 to 1 and distributions of about $200 million.With that, Alan will cover our key metrics for 2012, the 2013 business environment and our key planning assumptions for this year.Alan Mulally","Thank you, Robert. Slide 30 summarizes our 2012 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics compared with the plan we shared at the beginning of the year. We delivered strong results in 2012, although some of our metrics were mixed compared with our plan. Despite a challenging environment, particularly in Europe and South America, we delivered our third consecutive year of total company pretax profits of about $8 billion or more. We aggressively responded to the deteriorating environment in Europe, defined and began to implement the steps that will return our business to profitability by mid-decade.We are pleased with the proof points of growth in Asia Pacific and Africa, record volume revenue and market share as we continue to invest heavily in the region to support profitable growth in the years ahead. And importantly, we continue to generate positive automotive operating related cash flow, even as we invest at an increased level of capital spending to grow our business. Again, all in all, 2012 was a strong year for Ford. Now let's turn to 2013 business environment on slide 31. Summarized on slide 31 is our view of the business environment going forward. Overall, we project 2013 global GDP growth to be to 2% to 3% range. Global industry sales are projected in the 80 million to 85 million unit range. U.S. economic growth is expected to be in the 2% to 2.5% range with industry sales supported by replacement demand, given the older age of vehicles on the road.In Brazil, easing fiscal and monetary policies such as sales tax reductions and policy interest rates cuts to historic lows, are setting the stage for renewed economic growth. But in Venezuela risks to the economic outlook are rising given uncertainty with the government. In Europe we expect weak conditions to continue, especially in countries undergoing fiscal and austerity programs. Recent policy moves are positive steps but not yet enough to resolve the crisis and restore business and customer confidence.In Asia Pacific and Africa, latest data suggests that the economic recovery is underway in China, while the economic slowdown is bottoming out in India. Although countries are at different stages of economic cycle, better growth is expected in 2013 across the region. Overall, despite challenges, we expect global growth, economic growth, to continue in 2013. Our planning assumptions and key metrics for 2013 are as follows. We expect full year industry volume to range from 15 million to 16 million units in the United States. Europe to range from 13 million to 14 million units, and China to range from 19.5 million to 21.5 million units. We project full year market share to increase compared with 2012 in the U.S. and China, and to be about equal to last year in Europe.Our expected share improvements reflect our strong products and Ford brand as well as an expanded product portfolio covering more segments in some markets such as China. We expect our quality to further improve from our best ever results last year in South America, Europe and Asia Pacific and Africa. We also expect to improve in North America where we are making progress addressing the concerns of our customers. We expect our 2013 financial performance to reflect the following.Pretax profit excluding special items, for total company to be about equal to 2012. Automotive operating related margin to be about equal to or lower than last year, and automotive operating related cash flow to be higher than 2012 including capital spending of about $7 billion. Overall we expect 2013 to be another strong year for the Ford Motor Company as we continue to work towards our mid-decade outlook.Finally, on slide 33 we summarize our ONE Ford plan, which is unchanged. We will continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at current demand and changing model mix. Accelerate development of new products our customers want and value. Finance our plan and continue to improve our balance sheet and work together effectively as one team, leveraging our global asset. We delivered strong results in 2012 led by record performance in North America and solid performance at Ford Credit. We also began to transform our European business. Investing now to return our European operations to profitability by mid-decade.We see the results of our ONE Ford plan taking hold in Asia Pacific and Africa with a record volume, revenue and market share increasing as investments in new facilities and products gain traction. We also executed on our ONE Ford plan in South America expanding our product portfolio with new global products while looking at all areas of our business to improve operating results. Our plan will continue to guide us as we address head on both challenges and opportunities. In 2013 we are focused on working to sustain and grow our strong North American operation, improving results in South America, transforming our European business to return to profitability, accelerating growth in Asia Pacific and Africa, further leveraging the value of Ford Credit, and revitalizing the Lincoln brand.We have made tremendous progress in recent years by executing the fundamentals of our ONE Ford plan and have significant benefits ahead, as we leverage our global assets and as we benefit more fully from today's investments for future profitable growth. We continue to work towards our mid-decade guidance, remain confident in our plan and our ability to deliver profitable growth for all. Now we will be happy to take your questions.George SharpThanks, Alan. Now we will open the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community, then take questions from the media. In order to allow as many questions as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief. Dorsal, can we have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please proceed.Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays CapitalGood morning. I want to ask a half financial half management strategy philosophy question. And it really is around the North American margins which are great. But I think there\u2019s always an expectation out there that as revenue grows we should see, one might see incremental margins above current margins and hence margin expansion. So if I look at your guidance for 2013, you\u2019re implying revenues were up (inaudible) market share and a rising market. You\u2019re implying profits are up, but you\u2019re implying margins flat. So I guess the question for Robert is how do you\u2014just what is mechanically going on with the incremental margins? And then really for Mark and Alan it\u2019s how do you think about bringing incremental revenue to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the brand and the product line and future technologies?Robert ShanksOkay, Brian. I think first of all let\u2019s all acknowledge 10% is a great margin and I think the consistency that the business has demonstrated through all four quarters of 2012 shows the strength of the business which as we\u2019ve indicated in the guidance will continue into \u201913. Now we are expecting growth both from an industry perspective and from higher share. So your premise is correct that you would expect then leverage to generate an even higher margin. The main thing that\u2019s affecting North America and I\u2019ll say relatively capping the margin at about 10%, is what I touched on in the third quarter. We have about three quarters of a billion dollars of non-cash structural cost increase around three areas. Back in \u201905 we amended our healthcare plans and generated substantial cost savings.We amortized debt through 2012. That ran off last year and this year as a result \u2013 we pick up if you will or we lose the benefit of that amortization to the tune of about $275 million. Secondly, in 2008 we impaired our assets in Europe. That also was amortized in North America, amortized also through 2012. That ran off last year. So the effect of that going away is over $200 million. And then lastly, pensions. We have increasing pensions of over $300 million related to record low discount rates last year. I\u2019d also mention that we\u2019re continuing to invest in even more growth in the future. So as the year progresses you\u2019ll start to see higher engineering expense. We also had the 400,000 units of additional capacity that we put on-stream last year.So that\u2019s several \u2013 it\u2019s four different shifts that we added last year which brings cost as well \u2013 of course it\u2019s bringing the revenue that you talked about. So the results of all that is what essentially is keeping that margin at 10% and I just would remind you that all those things I just went through with the exception of the shift effects are non-cash which is one of the reasons why the profits are guided to be about flat. We do expect our operating related cash flow to be even stronger this year than it was last year. Mark, anything else?Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please proceedJohn Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchGood morning guys. Had a couple of quick questions, first, on Europe. If you could just run through the same thought process you just went through for North America because you highlighted that accelerated DNA was a bit hit in the fourth quarter and will be through 2013. Just trying to get an idea of what that is and if there are any other costs that might be loading into that $2 billion loss number for 2013 that you\u2019re forward.Robert ShanksI think and maybe Steven can add some color and texture when I\u2019m finished. Just to give you a feel about what\u2019s going on there and how we\u2019re looking at it. First of all I think we have to remind ourselves that we\u2019re looking now at an industry that\u2019s probably in the lower half of the range that we\u2019ve provided of 13 to 14. So let's say 13 to 13.5 and we did 14 million last year. So the industry is continuing to decline. We think 13 will be the trough and our expectation is that we will start to improve after 2013 but it is going down. And so that clearly is -- and that\u2019s a bit new news to us versus what we said in October and one of the key issues behind the increase in the loss that we are guiding to for 2013. In addition, we have got restructuring related costs on a year-over-year basis of $400 million to $500 million in 2013 versus 2012, and we also are seeing higher pension expense of probably about $200 million related to the low discount rates which were even lower than they were in the U.S.So those are some of the big things that are happening. The other thing that we probably have not mentioned and you may not be aware of, we need to roll investments in the business to turn it around because we do believe that the industry will turn around and with the actions that we have outlined we are going to get to a profitable growing Europe for Ford Motor Company. As part of that and to reconfigure our plans, now there is an opportunity costs that\u2019s sort of underlying the 2000 results in that we had to defer the launch of the Mondeo a year. It would have launched in 2013, it\u2019s now going to launch in 2014. And that has the effect of; I guess it\u2019s an opportunity cost of about several hundred million dollars.So all these things are what\u2019s generating the loss that we are guiding to next year. But again, John, looking at all this as investment in a stronger, better business for Europe just as the same way that we look at similar type of actions in North America.John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchMaybe just to ask a broader question. Because it sounds like there is a lot of incremental investment for future growth, it\u2019s coming in in 2013. And we have seen this benefit actually come through in North America and actually realized the margins you have been talking about. As we think about these margins internationally, I think you guys had in your mid-decade targets are looking around for about an 8% international margin. Obviously, you are going to be far off of that in 2013. I mean do we hit a point in \u201914, \u201915, or \u201916 where all this investment starts to tail off relative to the size of the revenue base and we just get this real step up. Because I think that\u2019s kind of what we are struggling with here. We understand the pressures in short-term but just want to really understand when we might see that real benefit. You had clearly illustrated you can do it, you did it in North America. I am just trying to understand when this kind of pressure, forget about market forces, but this pressure from investment in growth really kind of tails off.Alan Mulally","That\u2019s a good point. And I think, you have made the point about North America, let's talk about Asia Pacific which is sort of like along the path. Because we are seeing tremendous improvement in wholesale revenue and share in 2013 and yet we are still looking at sort of breakeven-ish type results, small loss. And we are saying the same thing for -- I am sorry, for \u201912 and we are saying the same thing for 2013. But you are seeing the top line growth. We have got seven plants under construction right now in Asia Pacific and we have got a lot of new products that will be new to the market that we are in the process of developing that clearly are effecting us in terms of cost but the revenue is yet to come.So that -- think of Asia Pacific as on the way and we are seeing the top line results, and we do expect to have meaningful contribution in terms of profitability to the company by the time we get to mid-decade. And they certainly will be contributing to that guidance that we have given around the company's operating margin. You have got Europe that\u2019s starting. You have got an economic environment on top of that, as I just mentioned, that\u2019s in recession, likely to be recessioned for the full year. And extremely low industry volumes. So we are just starting that journey as you know and as we said, these things don\u2019t happen in three months, six months or even a year. But we will get there and these costs that we are incurring, we think of them as investments, will give us the ability to be profitable.Now by mid-decade are we going to be getting an 8% or 9% margin in Europe? No, we think that\u2019s a 6% to 8% margin that further out. But we do think we will be above the zero line starting to generate some profit back to the company. And in South America a little bit different, I think we are starting to see some stability, we think for the moment, around the changing trade policies that we saw last year. But this year we are expecting very substantial adverse exchange effects from an expected significant devaluation in Venezuela and we\u2019re also thinking that we\u2019ll see a substantial weakening of the currency in Argentina that\u2019s going to affect us. So the story in South America is a little different. We are starting to see some stability around some of the issues that affected us last year, but this year we\u2019re going to see big impacts from currency. So each business unit in a different place, but I think things are starting to come together and we certainly see the ability to generate the types of margins that we\u2019ve talked about in the years ahead.Operator","(Operator instructions).George SharpDo we have any further questions at this time Dorsel from the investment community? Okay. Can we put them through?Operator","Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.Good morning guys. I had maybe two here. One on just following up on the South America comments that you just made. So to understand it, is it that you have a run rate of profitability in South America that\u2019s similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter using things \u2013 looking at things simplistically. But at some discrete time in 2013 there will be a big adjustment to be made because of the Venezuela devaluation that\u2019s going to offset that. Is that the way we should be thinking about how the pattern of profitability in that region is going to play out? And then my second question is just on market share. On slide 32 in the U.S you have an expectation for an increased market share in the U.S and I know that it\u2019s a quieter launch period for you guys this year in 2013 than it was last year. So maybe a little bit more color on which segments you expect to see the tailwinds for that?Robert ShanksOkay. In terms of exchange in South America, as I mentioned, I think we are starting to see some stability around the trade policy issues and we have responded to the extent that we can in the shorter term and we\u2019ll do more longer term. So I think we\u2019re seeing that effect in terms of what we\u2019re seeing when we look internally at Brazil for example. But in the case of Venezuela primarily but secondarily Argentina, we are expecting very substantial devaluations. In the case of Venezuela it would be a onetime nature for the most part because as you know the currency doesn\u2019t trade freely, controlled by the government. So we are expecting a significant onetime effect as well as then an operating impact once that occurs and we\u2019re reflecting that in our forecast for the full year. In the case of Argentina, they\u2019re having issues as well and we expect to see devaluation there. We\u2019ll try to price for as much of that as we can, but sometimes when it\u2019s this significant you can\u2019t recover all within one year. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing South America.In the case of market share in the U.S, we did launch Escape and Fusion late last year and those are two of the largest segments in the industry and we expect to have significant gains from both those products in 2013 versus 2012 in terms of a share contribution. We also think there\u2019s a possibility that the full size pickup segment could be somewhat stronger as we look at 2013 versus \u201912, housing construction, the impact of oil, the number of rigs and so forth. All of that is going to contribute potentially towards better contribution from that segment to the total industry and of course you know our strength in that particular part of the business. ","We also have the 400,000 units of added capacity that we put in progressively in 2012 that\u2019s fully available now as we start the year and with an even stronger industry, that will also give us opportunities as we look at the year. And then I guess the last thing I would mention is, we are getting great contribution from C-MAX. It\u2019s been extraordinarily well received. Flying off the showroom lots and we think that will also help us although to a relatively lesser degree just because of the capacity that we have got for that product. But that\u2019s certainly kind of a very pleasant performer in the market for us since we introduced it. So I think all those things, Patrick, are what we see behind our share increase in the year.Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please proceed.Emmanuel Rosner - CLSAJust two quick questions. The first one is on your structural costs. You have done a great job in 2012 maintaining the increase in check, it\u2019s only 1.5 billion. What are you expecting for 2013 on a global basis in terms of the increase in structural cost? And then my second one is on your expectation for your U.S. performance. How do you see the pricing environment shaping up for this year and obviously the volume growth continues for the industry and you guys are expecting also a higher share but at the same time the pace of growth seems to be slowing down somewhat here in the U.S., and then obviously some of your competitors are back with either some fresh product or just better availability in general. So how does that play out in terms of your margin guidance for this year?Robert Shanks","Well, as you just pointed out, we have provided margin guidance and that\u2019s why we did this -- we elected not to provide specific guidance on structural cost because obviously it\u2019s included in the margin. And I touched on one element of that in the earlier question on North America. I guess, and again I don\u2019t want to provide terribly specific guidance because I would like it to kind of stick to the margin if you will, but because lots of things that effect it, it is just one. But I guess I would expect the structural cost to be higher on a year-over-year basis, the increase to be higher in 2013 versus \u201912 and it\u2019s really around the types of issues that I just talked about in terms of those unique one time impacts in North America in terms of the run off of some of the favorable amortization from some impairments in OPEB and so forth, along with the pension increases. All of them non-cash.I think all of that along with probably the restructuring elements that are in structural cost for Europe contributing to in total a greater increase than we saw in 2012, but I wouldn\u2019t want to put a number on it. In terms of pricing, globally we expect to see favorable pricing for the company in 2013 and we expect to see that come from all three regions -- all four regions with the exception of Europe. I think Europe will still probably suffer some negative pricing in the year just given the overall economic environment. But the team has done a really, really good job in \u201912 of containing that to the degree that they have. And I would expect they would do the same next year.And that will be driven largely around new products, new equipment and will be a contributing factor to us being able to maintain the margin at sort of about the same level in the aggregate as 2012 or just slightly lower. But we do think it will be a positive contributor to the business.Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseA couple of items. In the North America business when you walk through the profit progression from last year to this year, I notice the $200 million favorable in volume and mix. If I can pair that to the 62,000 unit increase in wholesales that suggest a relatively modest contribution on a per unit basis. Can you talk to why that is? Is it a function of mix or is there something else in there?Robert Shanks","There is nothing funny going on in there, I guess. It\u2019s probably, we did have adverse product mix driven largely by C-MAX, Fusion, and also we had some fewer Expeditions. But we still had a very strong margin per unit in North America. I think it was probably mostly around product mix, Chris.Chris Ceraso - Credit SuisseOkay. And then thinking about 2013, the gains that you\u2019ve been booking on warranty throughout 2012. Did those turn around in light of some of the recalls and other quality issues that you faced in 2012? Will you start to see that become a headwind instead of a tailwind?Robert Shanks","No. We don\u2019t see warranty having too much impact on North America in 2013 on a year-over-year basis.Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorganThanks for taking my call and thank you for all the color you\u2019ve provided on Europe this far. Can you just help me understand the softer 2013 automotive pretax guidance within the context of your seemingly pretty strong first quarter production schedule in Europe; I think 405,000 which is quite a bit higher than IHS expectations. It\u2019s stronger than you did \u2013 the 331,000 you did in 4Q and not too far off the 418,000 you did in the first quarter of \u201912. Does this mean that the year-over-year softness will be backend loaded? Just surprise me a little given that comps should improve as the year progresses and particularly against maybe 4Q which was I think impacted by some inventory drawdown?Robert Shanks","Yeah. The issue in 2013 versus \u201912 on a bottom line basis is really around the restructuring costs that we\u2019re incurring in the year versus 2012. It\u2019s not so much coming from the type of things that you\u2019re referencing. It\u2019s around the amount of cost that we\u2019re going to be investing in the business in order to restructure it.Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorganOkay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.Stephen Odell","Sorry. This is Stephen Odell. Just to add a little color to that. In the first quarter of this year we\u2019re also ramping up because we are just now in the process of launching new Fiesta and new Cougar. Even though we started building them in the fourth quarter of last year, we\u2019re starting to system fill and the fourth quarter of \u201912 versus the first quarter of \u201913 principally reflects building out stock for the very large March market in the U.K.Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorganOkay. I can appreciate that. And then just last question. I know you\u2019ve guided to a longer term mix headwind in North America, but I\u2019m just curious how you see this playing out near term as your truck sales seem to have been tracking a bit stronger recently actually. Perhaps you can just talk about your outlook for industry pickup sales in 2013 within the context of a seeming housing recovery and also just maybe talk directionally about penetration of EcoBoost or platinum Trim levels, however high level you can which could also be beneficial to mix. Thank you.Robert Shanks","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re expecting at least the possibility of there being somewhat higher penetration of the industry from full-size pickups this year. Again it\u2019s around housing which you mentioned and oil and construction and so forth. So we agree that we probably will benefit from that and that was also one of the reasons why we are calling for a higher share in 2013 versus 2012. We will probably see in 2013 adverse product mix and again because even though we\u2019ll have the potential for more pickups, we\u2019re going to have a lot more Fusions, a lot more Escapes, a lot more C-MAX\u2019s and so forth which is really contributing towards the share, but obviously the margin that we get on those products isn\u2019t the same as the F-Series.And I forgot to answer your question on EcoBoost. We\u2019re seeing extremely favorable market reception from it. We\u2019ve got over 50% of V6\u2019s and I think 80% of that is EcoBoost. And it\u2019s spreading across our lineup around the world. So it\u2019s certainly an important part of our power \u2013 the power of choice that we\u2019re offering to consumers. Another example, on Escape for example, over 91% are being sold right now with either the 1.6 or the 2 liter EcoBoost. So customers love it. It provides great performance and fuel economy. It\u2019s a win-win and you\u2019ll see it spread even further across our product lineup.Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks, everyone. So Alan, Mark, Robert, what is Ford's assessment of the competitive threat, if any, from the recent sharp weakness of the Japanese yen versus the US dollar and is this important to you?Alan MulallyAdam, this is Alan. Really an important question and clearly we really do believe that the markets should establish the exchange rates and as you know, so does the U.S. government. So we are really pleased with those conversations that are taking place because it\u2019s just so important for the global free trade and real estate that we let the markets decide.Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So how much of an issue has this been to date or do you expect it to be if assuming that this continues?Alan Mulally","We can't specifically give you a quantitative answer to that but clearly the right thing to do is to let the markets establish the currency and the exchange and that\u2019s why we have been pleased in the past that the leaders around the world have continued to work towards that end and we are confident that they will continue to do that.Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And just a question for Stephen Odell. On Europe, can you comment on inventory levels in the market either in terms of stock or days supply for year for the market. And can you also give us a guide on where you saw pre-registration activity heading towards the end of the year and maybe how the year started there so we get a sense of the quality of the market. Thank you.Stephen OdellI can't give you competitive inventory because that\u2019s not available in Europe.Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","You can guess.Stephen OdellI\u2019d rather not. As you know our, part of our plan in the fourth quarter was to reduce inventory and to reduce stocks. In fact our dealers stocks came down by 10 days from about 56 to about 47 days. So a significant reduction in dealer inventory which helps them actually finance the business and trade through the difficult times. I think the mix of demo, we still haven\u2019t got all the final data in December for Germany in particular, but I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the demo mix went up in the fourth quarter, particularly in December. And as Robert alluded to earlier on, we held our retail share. We didn\u2019t participate fully in the low margin demo business which partially explains our lower share in December.Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Just a clarification on that. So on Europe, is the inventory destocking now behind you or is there more that you are intending to take out in 2013.Alan MulallyStephen, do you want to cover?Stephen OdellYes, will do Alan. It\u2019s principally behind us. We still have a little bit of an imbalance because obviously we didn\u2019t release any vehicles from our Genk plant. We are starting to now. Very good progress with the Genk unions. So we will address that imbalance through the first quarter and we are a little bit lighter than we thought we would be in December. So we will address that during the course of the year. But the majority, the vast majority of the destocking is behind us.Rod Lache - Deutsche BankAnd just given the guidance that you have got for Europe and South America, it sounds like North America probably has to improve by $400 million-$500 million to get to your flat operating earnings, which you are saying is despite a $750 million increase in structural costs. So it\u2019s really $1.2 billion or so of underlying real earnings improvement. It sounds like you're suggesting volume would be at least half of that and you are also including some pricing. Is there anything that happens aside from those two factors that happened in 2012 that wouldn\u2019t recur in 2013? Did you accrue for the UAW 2012 profit sharing in 2012 or does that happen in -- is there a further inventory increase in North America in 2013?Robert ShanksRod, I think you have hit the key points. In fact on your last point, we don\u2019t think that stock changes will actually contribute to bottom line on a year-over-year basis. So it is the fact which you talked about. It\u2019s volume growth, we do expect positive pricing. We will have higher structural cost. May have some good news on material cost, we will have to wait and see how that pans out. And then of course there is going to be a deterioration from mix that I mentioned earlier. But you are right, I mean we are going to have a very strong performance from North America because we are essentially guiding to breakeven on two of the other three business units, and we have been very specific about the loss we are expecting for Europe.Now in terms of -- the last thing, you asked about the accrual. We accrue profit sharing all throughout the year. Each quarter we true up based on what we think the full year result will be. But we accrue each quarter.Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And just one other clarification, you had a $2 billion drag from working capital in 2012, any sort of thoughts on how we should be thinking about that going forward?Robert Shanks","Yeah. Some of that is just from growth. We\u2019ve got more plants and so forth. But we did end a bit heavy on inventory at the end of the year, finished vehicle inventory and we think that represents an opportunity for us which is one of the reasons why we\u2019re guiding to the higher operating related cash flow.OperatorAt this time we would now like to take questions from the media. (Operator instructions). You first question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey with Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street JournalGood morning. I\u2019m interested in the pension situation and Robert, I know I talked to you a little bit about it earlier, but it just seems like a very significant amount of your cash is going to the pension situation. I was hoping you could explain when do you catch up? You mentioned maybe by mid-decade you hope to have this taken care of. Could you elaborate about how significant it is, not just for your business but maybe across industries that the discount rates are so low?Robert ShanksWell, I\u2019ll just start with that point first. Clearly anyone that\u2019s got a defined benefit plan is suffering if you will from these record low discount rates because it inflates if you will in the current period what your future expectation is around your obligations because you\u2019re discounting the much smaller than what we did several years ago. And we did go backwards in terms of the funded status from $15.4 billion to $18.7 billion and that was more than explained by those low discount rates. Now in terms of contributions, we contributed $3.4 billion last year to our funded plans. We\u2019re expecting essentially the same amount in 2013 plus the $1.4 billion from the $2 billion debt issuance that we\u2019re going to put into the plan. So we are continuing to work very deliberately our long term pension derisking strategy.We do expect discount rates to start to increase as we move forward and we are factoring that into our planning and that will be a contributor towards us getting these funded plans fully funded by probably around mid-decade or so. But when you\u2019ve got this much of a gap and you\u2019re trying to get to a point where you can reduce the volatility which you can clearly see in terms of what\u2019s happened from \u201911 to \u201912, the volatility exposure that we have, it\u2019s extremely important that we address this and that\u2019s what our derisking strategy will do. In addition, you didn\u2019t mention it, but we did reduce obligations by $1.2 billion from the U.S lump sum payout program and that will continue into this year and that should help a bit as well and we\u2019ll report on that each quarter.Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street Journal","And can I ask you real quick, can you change your investment strategy at all? Have you or you pretty much stop from doing that to invest in other things and treasuries or other government instruments?Robert Shanks","We do \u2013 we have a very well thought out investment strategy. In the past we were more heavily weighted towards equities in growth assets than fixed income and our strategy is to progressively get to 80% fixed income and 20% other growth related investments and we\u2019re on the way to that. And it\u2019s different by plan because each plan is in a different place in terms of its funded status. But that\u2019s part of the strategy is to get to that 80-20 mix because then your obligations will be more or less matched in terms of characteristics with your assets and that reduces the volatility. That\u2019s the golden grail that we\u2019re going after.Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Trudell with Bloomberg News. Please proceed.Craig Trudell \u2013 Bloomberg NewsGood morning. I wanted to follow up on the comment that Ford will keep monitoring the business environment in Europe and take further action as necessary. How much more deterioration in the environment in Europe would we need to see to warrant more action beyond the plan that you laid out in October?Robert ShanksWell, I think, Craig, that depends as well on what we see for the future. We don\u2019t think for example that the extremely low industries that we\u2019re likely to see this year is what we\u2019re going to see year in and year out. In the years ahead we think it will start to come back. So as you do these restructuring plans you have to make a call, not just on the current year, but where are you going. Where are you heading? And so I think as long as we believe that the industry is likely to begin to recover and then to grow modestly, which is why our assumptions are over the next several years. Then I think that would be an important factor that would affect our thinking in terms of more or less actions than what we have already described. But it\u2019s just how we do our business, everyone in the world. It\u2019s not just Europe but we are always looking to understand what's happening in the external environment. Good or bad. Good, we want to take advantage of it. If there is a challenge, we react to it. And that\u2019s exactly what we will do in the case of Europe.Craig Trudell \u2013 Bloomberg NewsAnd just a quick follow up to that. I mean what would those actions possibly look like? Is everything on the table in terms of taking out more capacity or pulling back on investment, or is it a later option not necessarily one that you want to take given your expectation that the market will continue to be a substantial one in the global scheme of things.Robert ShanksWell, I wouldn\u2019t want to get into hypotheticals. We know what it takes to run and have a good business model that generates appropriate returns to investors. And so based on what we would call the external environment to be as well as our own performance, we would take whatever the appropriate measures are. But we are very, very satisfied with the progress that we have made to date and it\u2019s very, very early, we really announced in October. But we are making progress, we are on track and we are just going to work that plan.Alan MulallyI might just add to what Robert just said to your question about the investment. I think it\u2019s really insightful to continue to look at the way we transform the business in North America when we think about Europe also. Because the most important thing is to continue to invest in the products that people obviously want and value, and then have them made available in the quantities that they really want and on the economy. So the neat thing about the forward plan is that, with our ONE Ford vehicles we can bring, continue to invest and bring the very best of cars and trucks to Europe even through the current slowdown, but also be there with the complete family as the recovery starts to happen. So the number one thing is to continue to invest also not only in the product but also in the brand while we work the cost side too. Just like we did in the U.S.Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel from Detroit News. Please proceed.Karl Henkel \u2013 Detroit NewsI have a question on Europe and, Robert, you talked about the trough kind of being in 2013. I am curious as to what you guys think that\u2019s going to be kind of a 12 to 18 month trough or is it going to be kind of similar to what happened this year, where losses kind of escalated as the year went on? Or whether it\u2019s more of a matter of how long the trough is and not so much when we are going to get there?Robert ShanksWell, I think I would just leave it at the year. We are not going to get into quarterly calendarization of it but we do think that this will be the trough not only for the industry but our profitability, if you will, for Europe. We would expect the industry to begin to recover and \u201914 and we would expect our losses to begin to reduce in \u201914, on the way to profit by mid-decade.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Veronique Dupont with AFP. Please proceed.Veronique Dupont - AFPOn Europe I would like to know if you think, you talked about that you needed to take further action. Are you considering more capacity reduction or are you think the profitability can come back with those you already announced. And still on Europe, do you consider the possibility of an alliance with another carmaker, Fiat or kind of, looking for possible alliance. Would that be something of interest?Alan Mulally","Sure, on your first question. We have no additional plans announced today. The new news of course is that we think the market is going to be a little bit softer than we thought a few months ago but we have already announced the actions to deal with that. And on the alliance, we have many technical alliances around the world on enabling technology. But the most important thing that we want to do is focus on building on ONE Ford plan around the world. So no alliances at the company or the vehicle level.Operator(Operator Instructions)George Sharp","Darcel, if we don\u2019t have any other media questions we could take another analyst question.Operator","And we do have another question from the line of Veronique Dupont with AFP. Please proceed.Veronique Dupont \u2013 AFP","Since there were no more questions I\u2019m going to do a couple of follow ups. I wanted to know if in Europe still main issue was still on production capacity or do you think there\u2019s still a wage issue and a cost of labor issue there? Also could you a bit summarize what\u2019s the biggest difference in fixing Europe compared to what you need to fix U.S four years ago when it was in crisis. Thank you.Alan MulallyWell, I think the approach we have used around the world is absolutely the appropriate approach for Europe and that is that \u2013 the number one thing is the size of our production to the real demand. And so we\u2019ll continue to do that. In addition, we will continue to invest and even accelerate the investment in the new products people really do want and value because even with the slowdown it\u2019s just still a tremendous market for us and Ford as you know is the number two brand in Europe. So very similar plan around the world and we\u2019re going to continue to size our production world demand, continue to invest in the new products that people really do want and value.Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.Colin Langan \u2013 UBSThanks for taking my question. You mentioned before that you\u2019ve taken some actions in the short term in South America, but what things can you do long term to address some of the trade barrier issues and if there\u2019s anything you can do around the FX issue?Robert ShanksColin, the most important thing that we\u2019re doing longer term is completely revamping our product portfolio from 100% legacy products to 100% -- I will call them ONE Ford products. We\u2019re also going to be in more segments than we are and today we\u2019re going from about, 67% or so up to over 80% in terms of market participation. So the breadth of the market that we cover will be broader than today. And then of course always working on the \u2013 I\u2019ll call it the operating efficiency side of the business, continue to do what we can there to strengthen the business from an efficiency standpoint.Colin Langan \u2013 UBSAnd do you need to relocate some facilities in terms of parts to certain regions based on some of the trade barriers over the next few years?Robert ShanksWell, we have had to reduce the number of units that we bring in from Mexico. If you remember, Mexico had a free trade agreement with Argentina and with Brazil, Mercosul. That was essentially suspended if you will and replaced with quotas \u2013 that we can import from Mexico but at much lower volumes than we had the ability to do in the past. So that\u2019s one of the things that is constraining us if you will in the shorter term because we\u2019re just limited by what we can bring in. otherwise it incurs very high duty rates that would make the vehicles essentially uncompetitive in the marketplace. But we will continue to optimize the footprints that we have and we will respond to this new environment in terms of limited imports from Mexico. But it will take time to do that.Alan MulallyAnd Colin, I will just add that over time South America really has been committed to free trade and clear they\u2019re each dealing with their trade imbalances right now. But I think over time we continue to see them move back towards free trading for the benefit of everybody.Colin Langan \u2013 UBSOkay. And if I could just get one quick one in, a clarification. Earlier you mentioned that Europe would incur about $400 million to $500 million of restructuring. Is that the same as the accelerated depreciation or is that \u2013 and if not, why wouldn't it be just like a one-time item?Robert Shanks","A lot of that is restructuring around our other accelerated depreciation, but it\u2019s also operating related effects both in the U.K and Belgium. But I wouldn\u2019t want to get into details.Colin Langan \u2013 UBSBut those wouldn't be one-time in nature? They wouldn't be pulled back?Robert Shanks","No. They\u2019ll be costs that we incur until the facilities are closed but not afterwards.Operator","And that question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup. Please proceed.Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning. Just wanted to go back to some of the non-cash expenses for 2013 since a lot of investors do value the company on EBITDA and EBITDAP. But I was hoping you can share just what the global auto pension and depreciation amortization headwinds are, 2013 versus 2012?Robert ShanksYeah, I mean all those types of things that I talked about earlier, Itay, are, it\u2019s probably about 1.2 billion on a year-over-year basis. You know $400 million to $500 million of pension cost due to discount rates and that will be in North America and Europe. Accelerated depreciation of $250 million to $300 million on a year-over-year basis in Europe. The asset impairment in North America, that good news ran off of over $200 million, and the OPEB amortization good news ran off, that\u2019s probably about $275 million.Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. And $1.2 billion, that\u2019s....?Robert Shanks","Yeah, all that\u2019s non-cash.Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great. That\u2019s helpful. If I heard correctly, you are guiding for CapEx in 2013 of $7 billion, that\u2019s a pretty substantial increase and I think actually 1 billion above the mid-decade goal. Did I hear that correctly and what's driving that?Robert Shanks","You are right and what it is, it\u2019s our growth plans. Products and also capacity.Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. Is that sustainable at the new level going to mid-decade or does that come back down to 6 billion by mid-term?Robert ShanksI think I would just leave at the level that it\u2019s at.

My name is Shinal and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","George Sharp","Thank you, Shinal, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our third-quarter financial results. Of course our thoughts are with everyone impacted by Hurricane Sandy.","We considered delaying this call, but after much consideration we concluded that given our large and diverse worldwide investor base, changing the timing right before the planned date could cause significant confusion. Therefore, presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also in attendance are Stephen Odell, Chairman and CEO of Ford Europe; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. ","Now before we begin, I need to cover a few items. Copies of this morning's press release and the presentation slides that we will be using have been posted on Ford's investor and media website for your reference. The financial results discussed today are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q that will be filed shortly. The financial results presented are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to the US GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck. ","Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Of course, actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings including our annual, quarterly, and current reports. ","With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ford's President and CEO, Alan Mulally.","Alan Mulally ","Thank you, George, and good morning to everyone. Before starting, we would like to express to all of those affected by the massive storm that struck the East Coast that our thoughts and our prayers are with you all. For those of you in the region who are joining us today from your home, wherever you may be thank you. We hope that everyone who may have been unable to dial into today's announcement will utilize the replay on our website at their convenience. In addition, our investor relations team stands ready to assist investors with their questions. ","Let's begin by turning to slide 3 please. To start, we achieved record total company and Automotive pretax results for the third quarter with the total company results also representing our 13th consecutive quarterly pretax profit. In addition, we generated positive Automotive operating-related cash flow and ended the period with strong liquidity. The results were achieved at wholesale volumes and total company revenue that were lower than a year ago. North America achieved its highest quarterly pretax profit and operating margin since at least 2000, when we began reflecting it as a separate business unit. ","Ford Credit results were once again solid and South America and Asia Pacific were profitable. Europe as expected incurred a substantial loss. Last week we announced our strategy and plans to accelerate the transformation of our business in Europe, projecting a return to profitability by mid-decade. Although the external environment continues to be dynamic and uncertain, we are continuing to implement our ONE Ford plan across the entire business and working towards our mid-decade outlook. ","Let's look more closely now at the financial highlights of the quarter. Slide 4 summarizes our business results compared with year ago for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. Third-quarter wholesale volume was 1.3 million units, down 17,000 units compared with a year ago. Revenue was $32.1 billion, down $1 billion. Pretax profit, which excludes special items, was $2.2 billion, $200 million higher than a year ago. Earnings were $0.40 per share, $0.06 higher than last year's earnings per share adjusted for the tax valuation allowance release. ","Net income attributable to Ford including favorable pretax special items of $83 million was $1.6 billion or $0.41 per share. Both were about the same as last year. Automotive operating related cash flow was $700 million, the 10th consecutive quarter of positive performance. We ended the quarter with $24.1 billion of automotive gross cash exceeding debt by $9.9 billion. This is a net cash improvement of $1.8 billion compared with a year ago. In the first nine months, vehicle wholesales and revenue declined from year ago. First nine months pretax profit was $6.3 billion, a $1.4 billion decrease. Net income was $4.1 billion, a $2.5 billion decrease. ","Slide 5 summarizes our third-quarter business highlights including the launch of seven new vehicles across three regions. The all-new Transit Custom was voted International Van of the Year and the Ranger pickup, not shown in the slide but launched earlier this year, was the only vehicle in its class to be awarded a Five Star Euro NCAP safety rating. Ford Focus was the world's best-selling single car nameplate through the first half of the year based on IHS Automotive Data. ","In North America, we assumed control of the AutoAlliance Manufacturing Facility in Michigan and renamed it Flat Rock Assembly Plant. Flat Rock will be the U.S. production home of the all-new Fusion, leading to the addition of a second shift and the creation of 1,200 new jobs. ","In late September, the Canadian Auto Workers ratified a new four-year agreement for our 4,500 unionized workers in Oakville and Windsor, Ontario. This improves our competitiveness, provides operational flexibility, and creates jobs. ","In China, we broke ground at two new manufacturing facilities, Chongqing #3 and Hangzhou, which will take Ford's production capacity to 1.2 million passenger cars by mid-decade. And in the third quarter, we achieved our highest quarterly market share in Asia Pacific and Africa as well as in China. This was driven by strong sales of Focus and the Ranger pickup. ","Finally, we announced in late August that we will launch Lincoln in China in 2014. Now I will turn it over to Bob Shanks, who will take us through more details of our financial results. Bob?","Robert L. Shanks ","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with slide 7, which walks our pretax operating results to net income. As Alan mentioned, total company pretax operating profit was about $2.2 billion. Pretax special items of a positive $83 million reflect a one-time gain on consolidation of the AutoAlliance International joint venture, offset partially by personnel and dealer actions. Additional detail is shown on appendix 3. The provision for income taxes was $613 million and net income attributable to Ford was about $1.6 billion. The provision is about $400 million higher than a year ago simply due to the fact that we no longer have in place most of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Recall that this was largely eliminated in the fourth quarter last year. Although not shown, our operating effective tax rate was lower in the third quarter compared with the prior two quarters reflecting one-time tax items. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect our full-year operating effective tax rate to be similar to 2011. ","Let's now turn on slide 8 to our pretax results by sector. Total company third-quarter pretax profit of $2.2 billion consists of $1.8 billion for the Automotive sector and $388 million for Financial Services. As shown in the memo, total company pretax profit was $219 million higher than 2011, reflecting higher profit on the Automotive sector offset partially by Financial Services. Compared with the second quarter 2012, total company pretax profit increased by $334 million, more than explained by higher Automotive results. ","Slide 9 highlights the key market factors and financial metrics for our total Automotive business. In the third quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased slightly compared with the year-ago period, more than explained by Europe. Pretax profit was about $1.8 billion and operating margin was 6.3%. As shown in the memo below the chart, total Automotive first nine months pretax profit was $5 billion with an operating margin of 5.9%, both lower than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were lower.","Slide 10 summarizes the $0.5 billion increase in total Automotive third quarter pretax profit from 2011 by causal factor. The increase is explained primarily by higher net pricing and lower contribution costs offset partially by higher structural costs and unfavorable exchange.","During the quarter, we incurred a favorable absolute commodity hedge adjustment of about $100 million. In the third quarter 2011, the absolute hedge adjustment was about $350 million negative. The difference in the adjustments between these two periods is the primary factor driving improved contribution costs in the present quarter compared with the year ago.","As shown in the memo, pretax profit increased by $400 million compared with second quarter, reflecting higher net pricing and lower cost, offset partially by lower volume. More details on the quarter-to-quarter change are included in Appendix 6.","Slide 11 shows third quarter pretax results for each of our Automotive operations as well as Other Automotive. Automotive sector profit of $1.8 billion is more than explained by North America. South America and Asia Pacific Africa were also profitable while Europe incurred a loss of $468 million. The loss in Other Automotive mainly reflects net interest expense.","For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be about $500 million, consistent with the low end of our prior guidance. Let\u2019s turn now to slide 12 and our Automotive business in North America. Third quarter wholesale volume and revenue were up 3% and 8% respectively.","Pretax profit was $2.3 billion and operating margin was 12%. This was the third consecutive quarter that North America\u2019s profit exceeded $2 billion and its operating margin exceeded 10%. U.S. industry SAAR increased from 12.7 million to 14.7 million units while our U.S. total market share was 14.8%, 1.5 percentage points lower than a year ago.","As shown in the memo below the chart, North America first nine months pretax profit was $6.5 billion with an operating margin of 11.2%, both higher than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were higher. It\u2019s worth noting that the first nine months pretax profit exceeded last year\u2019s full-year profit.","Slide 13 shows the $700 million increase in North America third quarter pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The increase is more than explained by favorable volume and mix, higher net pricing, and lower contribution costs, mainly favorable commodity hedging effects. Higher structural costs and unfavorable exchange are partial offsets.","As shown in the memo, pretax profit increased by $300 million compared with second quarter explained by higher net pricing and lower contribution costs offset partially by lower volume. Our full-year outlook for North America is unchanged. We expect significantly higher pretax profit and operating margin compared with 2011 as consumers continue to respond to our strong product lineup while we maintain our competitive cost structure as we grow our business.","Slide 14 shows our U.S. market share. Our total market share in the third quarter at 14.8% was down 1.5 percentage points from the same period last year. The lower total share primarily reflects the impact of discontinued products such as the Ranger and Crown Victoria as well as lower full-sized pickup segmentation changes. FSeries share of the full-sized pickup segment was higher compared with last year. Our retail share of the U.S. retail industry at 12.9% was unchanged from second quarter.","During the quarter, we added a third shift to our Louisville Assembly Plant where we produce the new Escape. This is the last major action in our plan to add 400,000 units of annual incremental capacity by the end of the year.","Let\u2019s turn now to South America on slide 15. Third quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased by 12% and 23% respectively. In addition to the lower volume, unfavorable exchange was a factor affecting the net revenue decline. Pretax profit was $9 million with an operating margin of 0.4 percentage points.","South America industry SAAR increased from 5.4 million units to 5.8 million units while our share declined 8.4%, reflecting low availability of recently launched products. As shown in the memo below the chart, South America first nine months pretax profit was $68 million, substantially lower than a year ago. Volume and revenue also were down compared with last year.","Slide 16 shows the $267 million decrease in South America third quarter pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The decrease is explained primarily by unfavorable exchange, mainly a weaker Brazilian real, unfavorable volume and mix, and higher costs. Volume was affected in the quarter by the launch ramp up of new products and production reductions in Venezuela related to currency restriction.","Although net pricing was higher, it was constrained compared with prior years by a more intense competitive environment. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was about the same in second quarter. We continue to expect South America to be profitable for the full year, but substantially lower than 2011, which is consistent with prior guidance.","Now let\u2019s talk about Europe beginning here on slide 17. Third quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 17% and 26% respectively, reflecting primarily lower industry sales and market share along with corresponding dealer stock adjustments. Exchange was also a contributing factor adversely affecting net revenue.","Pretax results were a $468 million loss. Industry SAAR for the 19 markets we track in Europe decreased by 9% to 13.7 million units. Our market share at 7.8% was down 0.7 percentage points, reflecting primarily a reduction of low-margin demo sales and dealer self-registrations, what are also called short-cycle sales, as well as fewer sales to rental fleets. As shown in the memo below the chart, the Europe first nine months loss was $1 billion compared with a profit a year ago. Volume and revenue both declined compared with 2011.","Slide 18 shows the $162 million decline in third quarter pretax results for Europe compared with 2011 by causal factor. The decline is more than explained by lower volume including lower industry, lower share, and unfavorable dealer stock changes. Lower cost and favorable exchange are partial offsets.","As shown in the memo, pretax profit declined $64 million compared with second quarter more than explained by lower volume. It is noteworthy that despite a very difficult pricing environment, Ford Europe achieved positive net pricing on both a year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter basis as we continue to focus on profitability at the expense of lower margin sales. Last week, we announced our strategy and plans to restore our operations in Europe and profitability by mid-decade.","Shown here on slide 19 is our strategy, one that\u2019s based on three equally important fundamentals of our business. First, an unprecedented product and technology acceleration delivering a model lineup that will be among the freshest in the region to drive both revenue and margin improvement. Secondly, a comprehensive series of initiatives to strengthen further our Ford brand, emphasizing class-leading quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart technology, and value. And finally, a more efficient cost base including a more optimized manufacturing footprint that significantly improves our utilization. All three elements of our strategy are facilitated by leveraging the global asset of the ONE Ford plan.","Shown here on slide 20 is the summary of the plans that we announced focused on the three elements of our overall strategy, an aggressive new product rollout with 15 global vehicles launched within five years along with the introduction of a broad array of smart technologies, new initiatives to continue strengthening the Ford brand including strategic de-stocking of dealer inventories, actions that we expect to largely conclude in the fourth quarter, and finally, a plan to close three facilities and relocate production for a more efficient manufacturing footprint. This also includes leveraging ONE Ford operations outside Europe for some of our products.","Our plans reduce our installed vehicle assembly capacity excluding Russia by 18% or 355,000 units. It affects 13% of our European workforce and it yields gross cost savings annually of $450 million to $500 million once completed. Some of these actions are subject to an information and consultation process with employee representatives in Belgium. We continue to achieve, to project rather, profitability in Europe by mid-decade and are targeting long-term in operating margin of 6% to 8%. and as is our normal process, we\u2019ll continuously monitor the current reality we\u2019re facing and consistent with our ONE Ford plan, assess further opportunities to strengthen our business for profitable growth. As a result of the deteriorating environment in Europe as well as elements of our own transformation plan, we now expect Ford Europe's pretax loss for 2012 to exceed $1.5 billion. ","Now let's turn to Asia-Pacific Africa on slide 21. Third-quarter wholesale volume and revenue improved 21% and 13% respectively compared with a year ago. Pretax profit was $45 million and operating margin was 1.7%. Industry SAAR increased from 30.6 million units to 32.7 million units and our share increased from 2.7% to 3.1% as we began to benefit from increased capacity and strong sales of the recently launched Focus in China as well as from the Ranger pickup. This was our highest quarterly market share for the region as well as for China. As shown in the memo below the chart, the Asia-Pacific Africa first nine months loss was $116 million compared with a $9 million loss a year ago. Volume and revenue were higher than the year-ago period. ","Slide 22 shows the $88 million improvement in Asia-Pacific Africa third-quarter pretax results compared with 2011 by causal factor. The improvement is explained primarily by favorable volume and mix, higher net pricing, and favorable exchange. A partial offset is higher costs associated with new products and investments to support higher volumes and future growth. As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific Africa's pretax results improved compared with second quarter explained primarily by favorable market factors. For the full year, we expect Asia-Pacific Africa's results to be a loss roughly in line with 2011. ","Slide 23 covers 2012 third-and fourth-quarter production. In the third quarter, total Company production was about 1.4 million units, 24,000 units higher than a year ago. This is on the other hand 45,000 units below our guidance, reflecting primarily part supply issues on several of our products. We expect total Company fourth quarter production to be about 1.5 million units, up 112,000 units from a year ago reflecting higher volume in all regions except Europe. ","Lower production levels in Europe reflect lower industry as well as the strategic de-stocking initiative to generate ongoing benefits for ourselves, our dealers, and our customers. Compared with third quarter, fourth-quarter production is over 100,000 units higher reflecting our seasonal operating pattern as well as added capacity in North America and Asia-Pacific Africa. ","Let's turn now to slide 24 and review our Automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. We ended the quarter with $24.1 billion in Automotive gross cash, an increase of $400 million from the end of second quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $700 million positive reflecting Automotive profit offset partially by net spending and changes in working capital. Our cash flow before financing-related changes and dividend was $1.3 billion including $300 million in receipts from our Financial Services sector and cash received from the consolidation of AutoAlliance International. ","During the quarter, we contributed $600 million to our worldwide funded pension plans in line with our previously disclosed long-term strategy to derisk our funded pension plan. This includes $0.5 billion of discretionary payments to our U.S. funded plan. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled $200 million and in the first nine months, our operating-related cash flow was $2.4 billion and gross cash improved $1.2 billion. ","Slide 25 summarizes our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the third quarter. Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $14.2 billion, unchanged from second quarter. In August, we completed the final drawdown of low-cost loans for advanced technologies and we began repayment of the loans in September. We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.9 billion and Automotive liquidity of $34.4 billion, both increased when compared with second quarter. ","Turning now to Ford Credit, slide 26 shows the $188 million decrease in third-quarter pretax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. The results are more than explained by fewer lease terminations which resulted in fewer vehicles sold at a gain; lower financing margin as higher yielding assets originated in prior years ran off; and the non-recurrence of credit loss reserve reduction. As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pretax profit decreased by $45 million compared with second quarter. Ford Credit remains a strategic asset for Ford, delivering high levels of quality and customer satisfaction with operating efficiencies that are among the best. ","For full year 2012, Ford Credit now projects full-year pretax profit of about $1.6 billion and total distributions to its parent of about $600 million. For full year 2012, Ford Credit continues to project managed receivables at year-end to be in the range of $85 billion to $90 billion. ","And with that, I would now like to turn it back to Alan, who will cover the business environment and our 2012 planning assumptions.","Alan Mulally","Thank you, Bob. Summarized on slide 28 is our view of the business environment. Overall we now expect 2012 global GDP growth to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%. Global industry sales are projected to be around 80 million units, up nearly 5% from 2011. US economic growth is expected to be in the 2% range this year with industry sales supported by replacement demand given the older age of the vehicles on the road. ","In Brazil, easing fiscal and monetary policies such as sales tax reductions and policy interest-rate cuts to historic lows are setting the stage for renewed economic growth. In Europe, we expect severe conditions to continue especially in countries undergoing fiscal austerity programs. Recent policy moves are positive steps but not yet enough to resolve this crisis and fully restore business and consumer confidence. ","In Asia-Pacific and Africa, China and India have experienced slowing economic growth which has prompted some policy easing including interest-rate cuts, liquidity injections, and increased government spending. More policy actions are necessary to stabilize economic growth and facilitate recoveries in these countries. Overall, despite the challenges, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2012. ","Slide 29 summarizes our first nine months results and our planning assumptions and key operational metrics in 2012. Our industry projection for Europe is unchanged and we now protect U.S. industry at about 14.7 million units. As guided previously, we expect U.S. and Europe full-year market share to be lower compared with 2011 and quality is mixed. ","We continue to expect Automotive pretax profit and operating margin to be about equal to or lower than 2011. This includes our continued expectation of an increase in Automotive structural costs of less than $2 billion. We continue to expect Automotive operating-related cash flow to be positive for the full year including capital spending of about $5 billion in line with past guidance. We still expect total Company pretax profit to be strong but lower than 2011. This includes a profit of $1.6 billion for Ford Credit. ","Finally, slide 30 summarizes our ONE Ford plan, which is unchanged. We will continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at the current demand and the changing model mix, accelerate development of new products our customers want and value, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet, and work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets. We have delivered strong profits in the first nine months driven by outstanding results in North America and solid performance by Ford Credit. We also announced significant actions to transform our European business, projecting that Ford Europe will return to profitability by mid-decade. ","We see the results of our ONE Ford plan taking hold in Asia-Pacific and Africa with market share increasing as investments in new facilities and products gain traction. We also are executing our ONE Ford plan in South America, expanding our product portfolio with new global products while looking at the areas of our business to improve operating results. Our plan will continue to be our guide as we work to sustain our strong North American operation, grow our important Ford Credit business, and decisively address the diverse challenges and exciting opportunities we have in all the other parts of the world. ","We have made tremendous progress in recent years by executing the fundamentals of our ONE Ford plan and there are significant benefits ahead as we leverage our global assets. We will continue to work toward our mid-decade guidance and remain confident in our plan and our ability to deliver profitable growth for all. Now we would be happy to take your questions.","George Sharp","Thanks, Alan. Now we will open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We will begin with questions from the investment community, then take questions from the media. In order to allow as many questions as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief. Chanel, can we have the first question please? Question-and-Answer Session","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso, Credit Suisse.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, good morning can you hear me?","Alan Mulally","","Morning Chris, it sounds good.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, terrific. Maybe on Europe, you mentioned that you were going to be doing some destocking in Q4. Can you give us an idea where inventories stand today either in terms of the number of units or days supply and where you are targeting that to be? Is this something that you feel like you can get done in Q4 or is the destock going to carry into Q1 of next year?","Alan Mulally","You bet, Bob?","Robert L. Shanks","Actually the inventory has been managed very, very effectively by the Ford Europe team throughout the entire downturn. So we go into \u2013 we came into the quarter with very healthy levels of days supply, and in fact we ended days supply in the quarter at, let's see, it was about 39 days supply. We would normally run the business at about 50, but in the third quarter, it always runs down because of the summer plant shutdowns. Then what would normally do, Chris, is we would build the stock back up in the fourth quarter, back up to about that 50 days supply or so. We are not going to do that. We are going to effectively pass on that and leave the days supply at about 40 or so and that's what we would like to target on a go-forward basis, because we think there are benefits as we mentioned in the comments to everyone involved. And so as result of that, we will take a hit in the fourth quarter probably to the tune of around $300 million because we do that, but we think it puts the business in a much, much healthier position going forward and so that's what we will do.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, that makes sense. The $450 million to $500 million that you anticipate from savings of the restructuring there, when does that kick in? Is that second half 2013 or not until 2014 or when does that start?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, obviously it's associated with the facility reductions and the way that's going to work is the UK facilities are projected to close around the middle of 2013 and those were the smaller of the three facilities that we talked about closing. Genk, which is the larger one, won't close until the latter part of 2014, so you will see not that much in 2013 and frankly, a little bit more in 2014 as you get the full year effect of the UK actions. But then Genk doesn't occur and start to generate the associated savings until the latter part of 2014.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then on the accelerated depreciation, is that something that will run through normal course of results or are you going to call that out as a special item?","Robert L. Shanks","No, that will go through operating results. It is the same way that we handled \u2013 the same types of financial effects in North America. The only thing at the moment that we\u2019ve identified that would go through special items would be the costs associated with the separations.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you very much.","Alan Mulally","You bet Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli, Citi.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. ","Alan Mulally","Thank you, good morning.","Robert L. Shanks","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Just want to talk on the fourth quarter outlook. Given the wide range of losses potentially in Europe, are you expecting North America to be lower sequentially? It looks like I mean Q3 kind of broke the seasonal trend and was higher sequentially, I'd like to get a better sense of the walk given that you do have some tailwinds from products and pricing, but also the typical seasonal behavior with some of the inventory actions in December, just want to get a better sense of the North America walk.","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we expect in the fourth quarter, Itay, that we will have a lower company result, which is not unusual because we always have, as you mentioned, that seasonal cost increase going from Q3 to Q4. And then on top of that, as we were just discussing with Chris, we will have the effects in Europe, so we would expect to have a somewhat higher loss there as well. So I think you will see those normal factors kick in and we will have a good quarter, it just won't be as strong as the current quarter.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Is that sequentially lower outlook also applicable to North America or is it possible that Europe could really account for most of it, just given the guidance for the full year is a European loss of above $1.5 billion, which I guess could mean maybe up to $2 billion? But just want to get a sense of what you are expecting specifically for North America directionally?","Robert L. Shanks","At the moment, we would expect North America to be down, largely driven by the seasonal cost changes.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","Great, then just as a follow-up, on the mid-decade outlook in Europe, you did mention that you expect market share to be a little bit higher. I was hoping you can quantify that a bit. And then also if you can maybe talk about what you are expecting the European contribution margin to look like by mid-decade relative to perhaps 2006, 2007, just want a historical comparison of what the mid-decade contribution margin that you are expecting in the plan looks like relative to years past?","Robert L. Shanks","Just a couple\u2019s comments there. One is we do expect the share to grow. In fact, this is a growth plan for Europe not only because we expect the industry to come back, but we expect to grow our share. In addition as you know, our share is the 19 markets that we traditionally track as Europe, but we\u2019ve got very aggressive plans in Eastern Europe and Russia as well and those are actually quite robust growth markets in the regions. So that will be a good story going forward. ","But in terms of share, we expect the share to grow largely driven by all the products that we talked about last week, but in particular the commercial vehicles. We're dramatically expanding the commercial lineup, introducing the people carriers in addition to the normal commercial vehicles. And in addition, what we're doing is we're focusing much more on sort of the retail and the commercial fleet channels at the expense of the lower margin rental and demo sale channels that we actually saw some progress on in the third quarter. ","So that will be kind of what is taking place in terms of share. It will grow and we expect the mix of the share to change, which actually leads to the other point that you made around the margin. We do expect the margin to improve as we move towards mid-decade. That will be because of the change in focus in terms of the business channel mix, but also the product mix should improve. Commercial vehicles are quite profitable for us. We also talked about a number of \u2013 I guess I would call them higher revenue, higher margin products that we will also be bringing in that should strengthen the brand. And in addition to that, what we'd expect to happen is that the overall industry as the industry comes back a bit from the very low levels that we are at, somewhat modestly I would admit, but we would expect that the discounting would peel back a little bit from where it is today and all that will generate a higher contribution margin.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","That's great. Just lastly back to North America, just a question on the sustainability of margins the next maybe 12 to 18 months. You have some great product launches coming, commodity costs appear to have eased and the housing recovery can certainly help your pickup truck mix. But assuming consumers continue to respond well to your product, is there anything that's occurring this year on the margin side the mix it sort of nonrecurring or more difficult to continue under those assumptions the next 12 to 18 months?","Robert L. Shanks","I think that's a very good point you just made. I think it's important not only to look at the pretty spectacular results of North America in the quarter but to put it in the context of what they've done over the last three quarters. So they have been incredibly consistent in generating a profit of over $2 billion the last three quarters and an operating margin in excess of 10%, which as you know is extremely strong. ","As we go forward, we do expect North America generate very, very healthy margins going into next year and beyond, but obviously it always depends upon the business environment and competitive activity. But I think the business is in a good position and will do quite well in the future, but I wouldn't get into any specific numbers at this point in time.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","That\u2019s great. Thanks so much, guys, and congrats again.","","Robert L. Shanks","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold, Jefferies.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning. ","Alan Mulally","Hi, Peter.","Robert L. Shanks","Good morning.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","I was hoping to maybe bridge the European walk a little bit more or more specifically the guide. I'm not trying to get too precise, but just trying to understand if there's any messaging going on there? So you said previously you expect losses in excess of $1.5 billion for the year. You've lost $1 billion so far. You said earlier $300 million comes from the inventory adjustment of 4Q, which sort of leaves $200 million plus of underlying losses in Europe. If it were $200 million I think we would probably all be pleasantly surprised because that would pretty dramatically narrow the loss from what we have experienced on a quarterly basis year-to-date. Is that sort of what you are suggesting or should it really be consistent underlying operating losses consistent with what we have seen on average the first three quarters of the year?","Robert L. Shanks","I think what you would expect in the fourth quarter consistent with the guidance that we gave of a loss for the year that exceeds $1.5 billion is that we will have a larger loss in the fourth quarter than in any of the preceding three quarters. What we were talking about is that that loss would normally have been less if we had rebuilt our stocks in the fourth quarter along the lines of what I was talking with I think it was Itay or Chris about. But we're not going to do that, so therefore, we kind of pass by on that what would have been a normal profit improvement in the quarter.","In addition, Peter, what we\u2019re going to see in the fourth quarter because we have announced the facility closures in the UK and Genk, we start the accelerated depreciation of those facilities and so that will add about $100 million in the fourth quarter of accelerated depreciation, which would affect the results as well.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then forgive me if you addressed this, I can go back to the transcript if you did. On the European profit bridge, the contribution costs improved by about $248 million year-over-year in the quarter and about $236 million sequentially. What were the key drivers of that? Is that something that you think can continue for the next several quarters? Thanks.","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, of the year-over-year change about $100 million of that was commodities including hedging effects and almost all of that was actually hedging effects, so that is clearly just one-time. It depends on what the mark-to-market rates will be at the end of the quarter.","We also had some favorable good news on material costs, excluding the commodities driven largely by our cost reduction efforts. And then we had lower freight and lower warranty costs. In terms of the quarter-to-quarter, we had a similar improvement of about $236 million. Again most of that was the commodities including hedging effects.","Peter Nesvold \u2013 Jefferies","Great, okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, everybody thanks. A couple questions, can you give us an update on the Fusion launch to-date and in terms of specifically any start-up or ramp-up costs that might have impacted the third quarter or could impact the fourth quarter?","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, of the Fusion, the launch is still underway. We had some parts supply issues that we\u2019re working our way through. But we\u2019re starting to get better supply of the product. In terms of the market reception, it\u2019s been pretty phenomenal. It\u2019s turning very, very quickly an average of only nine days in dealer stock on average so far. We\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re attracting younger consumers, so a significant portion of those are actually under 35 years of age. It\u2019s the highest in that segment in terms of our performance.","And what we\u2019re also seeing is that we\u2019re getting very good demand from the coasts, about 51% of our sales so far have been on the coasts versus about 44% for the outgoing models. So we\u2019re kind of hitting on all cylinders in terms of how the consumers are responding. So we\u2019re still working through the launch and progressing, but supply little by little is improving and it appears like it\u2019s going to be quite a hit with the consumers.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","But in terms of costs though, does the delay with supply, did it put more pressure on 3Q or does it delay costs that are then going to be a greater burden on 4Q in North America?","Robert L. Shanks","No, we had some launch costs in the third quarter associated with the acceleration of the plant. As we move into the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll start to see higher advertising and sales promotion as we start to spend for the product once it hits the dealer\u2019s showrooms.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Can you quantify any costs at the additional shifts had on the third quarter or could in the fourth quarter as well?","Robert L. Shanks","I don\u2019t have a specific number, but clearly as we\u2019ve talked about the increase for the full-year of structural costs just under $2 billion, a portion of that is manufacturing costs and it is driven not only by launch, but also driven by the added shifts not only here, but in Asia-Pacific, Africa as well.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So moving to South America, the product availability issue obviously led to pretty big relative under performance given the overall market growth. Can you give us an idea going forward the cadence of improvement, when we could be at an all clear in terms of full availability where you could participate with the market?","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, I guess the first I would say about South America is if you look at the results back on slide 16, I mean we are really getting hammered by exchange. The Brazilian real in particular is much, much weaker than it was a year-ago and we\u2019ve seen this all year long. And of that $223 million of adverse exchange, about $200 million of it was operating and most of that was the Brazilian real. So that\u2019s having a big impact on us.","And even though we\u2019ve got some positive pricing, when you factor in the local economics that we\u2019re incurring, which are spread through our cost factors. We\u2019re just not getting the type of pricing recovery for all of that that we would have seen in the past because of the environment that we\u2019re in.","Having said that, there were two things that happened in the quarter that affected volume; one is the ramp up of the EcoSport in Brazil, which is a very, very important product with good margin. And just as I mentioned with Fusion, that launch is progressing and we\u2019re getting better and better supply as we go now into the fourth quarter. But it certainly was an issue for us in the third quarter. Ranger is coming on stream. That\u2019s produced in Argentina and that one also was improving in terms of supply, but it was a bit of an issue in the third quarter.","And then the last thing that affected us as we mentioned, actually had much lower production in Venezuela than we normally would have because of issues of gaining access to dollars, because of the currency restrictions in place in the market. So we just didn\u2019t run the plant for a couple months.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for that color. Bob, just one last one on Europe. Have you isolated the balance of the gross costs savings of $450 million to $500 million versus the projected increase in structural costs as you ramp up all the product? Is the balance of just those two items expected to be positive or neutral? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense or how much of the return to break-even mid-decade is contingent on improved share, volume, market size. Thanks, that\u2019s it.","Robert L. Shanks","I think that\u2019s a good question. We clearly will see the benefits in our manufacturing costs that we talked about that we\u2019re also maybe growing the business, investing heavily in products. We\u2019re growing in parts of Europe that I talked about earlier outside of the area that we talk about in terms of share in industry and so forth.","So I would expect as we go forward that our structural costs in the aggregate probably will increase as we continue to invest heavily in the business. This is not a cost cut your way to profitability plan. This is a growth plan partially around the industry coming back very modestly around a stronger brand, around a repositioning of the product lineup and an expansion of the product lineup and then of course, cost efficiencies, as I mentioned.","Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning. I just want to focus on these strong North American results. I think two or three questions. First, given you have the longer-term guidance that you gave us a year or so ago around 8% to 10%. Does this level of profitability recognizing it\u2019s just one quarter, but year-to-date over 10%, mean that you could go above that range for a while?","Second question, if we look at more detailed, if we look at the warranty freight that was $300 million positive, was that a lack of spend this quarter versus last quarter or is that just a perhaps a one-time reduction? And another detailed question, if I take industry minus share, it\u2019s about $200 million of volume. You had about 17,000 wholesale as well as production difference. That implies incremental profits per units sold of $11,000, which is higher than you typically report. Was there something going on there? Is that the kind of incremental unit profitability we could think about going forward?","Robert L. Shanks","Okay, if I can remember all that, I get a gold star.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","8% to 10% guidance, warranty freight, incremental volume.","Robert L. Shanks","I think that\u2019s a very good question and let me put it in context the third quarter. The third quarter is a very, very clean result. It\u2019s a very strong result. But as always in every single quarter, and I always kind of mention this, quarters are variable because it\u2019s a big business and things move differently quarter-to-quarter.","In this particular quarter, I would just highlight I guess a couple of things. One is we did benefit from the $100 million absolutely of the positive commodity hedging effects and so clearly that may or may not repeat. It depends on what the spot rates are at the end of the fourth quarter.","And then the other thing is that we had about maybe about $200 million of warranty adjustments associated with the 2012 model year coverages that were sort of a true up of, now we\u2019ve got more mature data as the model year is getting longer intuit. We\u2019re able to go back and adjust reserves in a positive way, which doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s one-time, and actually it suggests that if we knew in the past what we know now, we would have had probably better results in the first quarter to second quarter. So it\u2019s kind of a lumpy change that we\u2019re kind catching up on here in the third quarter.","And so if you take that plus that $100 million, maybe there is $300 million that $100 million clearly is just what it is and $200 million that would have spread out over the previous quarters in which we were selling the 2012 model year vehicles if we knew what we know now.","Going forward, I think North America is going to have very, very strong shares. As we do look at next year, there\u2019s a few things to keep in mind. One, it's likely that our pension expense is going to go up as we look at where our discount rates are likely to come out and that would have a negative impact on their results. Secondly, there is some favorable adjustments in OPEB from the actions that we took in the restructuring of North America over the last five, six, seven years that essentially run out as we go into 2013, and so that will no longer be a benefit to them.","And related to that, our depreciation and amortization next year no longer has any of the benefit of the impairment that we took on assets back in 2008 as part of the restructuring, so that kind of runs out. All of those will be, headwinds in the North American results as we move into next year as well.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","And in terms of just my math on $200 million volume industry minus share gain divided by 17,000 wholesales?","Robert L. Shanks","In fact, one other thing I did not mention also as we look ahead and we've talked about this quite a bit. As we do start to sell more and more smaller vehicles as opposed to larger utilities and trucks, we would have an adverse sort of mix effect on the business as well from a margin standpoint, okay.","As we go down to the third question, which was what? Oh yeah, the other one, what you're seeing here on U.S. industry and U.S. share, that's just obviously the U.S. We also had some volume changes in some of the other markets like Canada and Mexico and that's covered down in sort of mix and other. And also it depends on the product mix too.","Brian Johnson","But still is a very high number, 11,000, I mean if you add in mix and other, it would be even higher.","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, yeah, there is some rounding in there as well, but I mean the margins in North America are very healthy as you know.","Brian Johnson","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Langan, UBS.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks for taking my question. Could you have any, give any color on getting South America back to profitability? It used to be a double-digit business. It sounds like FX has been a big headwind. I mean, how long does it take to address some of those issues? Or is this now just a structural issue and we can't get back to that 10% that you had back several years ago?","Robert L. Shanks","That's a good question. There's probably a couple things to think about. Going back to what I mentioned earlier, I mean there has been a very quick and sharp weakening of the local currencies. And if you take that $223 million we're seeing this quarter and annualize it, I mean you're looking at like a $600 million impact for the full year.","And if you think about last year, we made about $860 million, a lot of this is exchange-driven, some of which we are pricing for, but as I mentioned earlier, not as much as we could have in the past. Now going forward, everyone is affected by thus and you would think that over time the industry would try to restore margins and pricing opportunities with either of force, but that\u2019s what we have yet to see.","The main thing that\u2019s going to help us going forward is basically the investments that we are putting into product, because what we are doing is, we are basically taking a product line up that is largely legacy products going to all global products. And so for example, the ranger that we just talked about that\u2019s a global product that we just launched the eco sport is a global product coming off of the just the platform if you will. And next year, we will launching that in China and in India.","So you are going to see that phenomenon across your portfolio and in fact we expand the portfolio, so the number of segments that we cover is going to go up substantially as well. At the same time we are going to continue to work on operating efficiencies across the business and see if we can't recover some of that margin as I mentioned through pricing if competitors need to do the same.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay. Just one last question, commodity costs, it seems like there is still, if I'm reading this right, there is still a bit of a headwind even though some of those prices have come down. Should that improve over the next few quarters or is that still going to be a headwind? And any color on how it may look for the full year as a headwind or tailwind?","Robert L. Shanks","I wouldn't even try to forecast commodity costs. If you look at the quarter on a year-over-year basis, putting aside the hedging, it's actually pretty flat. It's almost all hedging effects that you are seeing. So at least in the quarter, they were largely stable in terms of what we were kind of buying. It was the commodity effect that we actually, the hedging effect that we benefited from.","So as we move ahead into the next quarter, we will have to wait and see. The spot rates are down. Steel is lower. Aluminum is lower. Palladium and precious metals and so forth are lower, so we will see if that is sustained as we go into the fourth quarter. But as you know, those things change every single day so it\u2019s kind of hard to predict.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","But the commodity hedging, was that just the reversal of that $350 million headwind that you had last year, or is that a completely separate issue?","Robert L. Shanks","No, it was two things. It was the non-recurrence of the $350 million bad news last year, but then we picked up good news against the hedging we had an effect of $100 million absolute this year. So on a year-over-year basis, we picked up about $450 million of good news on hedging. If you put hedging to the side, just the basic commodity cost changes themselves were basically flat year-over-year.","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Robert L. Shanks","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Patrick, your line is open. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question, it comes from the line of Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everyone. Just a couple points of clarification first just on your comments on commodities. Would you be able to say at this point, if you were to assume the spot prices were to kind of prevail over the next several quarters, would you expect that the commodities would be a positive on a year-over-year basis as you look out to 2013 offsetting some of those structural cost increases?","Robert L. Shanks","I wouldn't get into 2013 at this point. I would just say as we look at going into the fourth quarter where we are sitting at the moment, it looks like it would actually be some headwinds going into the fourth quarter. But I would be cautious about that, because it really depends on where we are at the last day of the quarter in terms of what's going to happen on the hedging effects.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And I was also hoping you can clarify a little bit your comments on the structural costs outlook for Europe. So we've got the $450 million to $500 million of savings. You commented that structural costs go up, though, over time. Are you suggesting that the costs will not decline on a net basis as you look out to 2014 or 2015 if the volume outlook comes to fruition? Is there any way for us to frame that?","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying that our structural costs in total probably would increase as we go out through 2015 net of this $450 million to $500 million as we continue to invest more in engineering, as we invest more in advertising sales promotion, because you can understand in the environment that we are in, we're not spending hardly anything on advertising and sales promotion. And with the expanded portfolio that we are going to be putting into place, we clearly want to communicate that.","Jim Farley and Stephen Odell and the teams will be working also to strengthen the brand and so in the aggregate, it probably will go up, but we will have substantial efficiencies coming from our footprint. We've got Stephen Odell on line, so maybe Stephen could comment.","Stephen T. Odell","I think one of the key points, this is Stephen, that has been made about the destocking although it's a one-time profit impact, it really gives us some better choices. It enables us to, one, reduce dealer costs and at a time when dealers could be finding it difficult to fund inventory, it means that that cost comes down plus of course we've got Ford Credit providing support to our dealer body across Europe that means those costs come down. But it also allows us to look at our channel mix differently because we've got leaner inventory. We don't have to respond perhaps as we have in the past to short-term business. That itself is a benefit to the residual value which in of itself benefiting cycle.","But clearly as we have more products come on Board and the industry starts to improve albeit modestly, there is an opportunity for us to communicate not just more but more effectively and really there we can leverage the things that we have learned from our ONE Ford plan in North America, because actually quality, green, safe, and smart, the same elements that our customers are interested all around the world will leverage that learning in Europe as well.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Robert L. Shanks","Rod, I would just add that we are taking a lot of the learnings from North America to Europe, but it is important to understand Europe isn't North America. Europe is a much, going into this a much, much leaner organization. It clearly has excess capacity which we are addressing, but if you look at the other areas of the business, it's very lean. So as we come out of this and we invest in product and we want to grow the business, we will see the efficiencies from addressing the excess capacity, but we actually want and need to invest in other areas of the business to drive the top line both in terms of volume and net revenue.","Robert L. Shanks","","Rod, I would just add that, we are taking a lot of the learnings from North America to Europe, but it is important to understand Europe isn't North America. Europe is a much \u2013 going into this, a much, much leaner organization. It clearly has excess capacity which we are addressing, but if you look at the other areas of the business, it's very lean. So as we come out of this and we invest in product and we want to grow the business, we\u2019ll see the efficiencies from addressing the excess capacity but we actually want and need to invest in other areas of the business to drive the topline both in terms of volume and net revenue.","","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, maybe just switching gears here to North America, your wholesales year-to-date are about 58,000 units lower than your production. Are those units in inventory at this point? Is that related to some of these launch issues that you commented on and are the launch issues largely behind you at this point so that just availability of launch products starts to help market shares as we go out over the next quarter or two?","Robert L. Shanks","Yeah, in general, that's correct.","Rod A. Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, and lastly the \u2013 you initiated a dividend about this time last year. Is there a point in the year when you typically, at the Board level kind of reassess the dividend policy?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we review our policy regularly as part of ongoing reviews of our cap strategy, and as we have said, our strategy is to pay an appropriate level of after-tax earnings that allows us to maintain a dividend during the downturn and we\u2019re kind of comfortable with where we are right now, but always reassessing and at the moment don't have anything else to say on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault, Goldman Sachs.","Patrick K. Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Alright, thank you. Sorry, I got cut off there, two questions from me. Number one, just another one on South America, I think at one point there was an issue with the trade agreement between Brazil and Mexico that was preventing you from sort of maximizing your throughput I think of the Mexico plant which I think had some stuff, that was destined for Brazil. Can you just update us on that? ","And then, my second question is on the variable cost side in Europe, one would have expected that the implementation of global platforms would have obviously brought variable cost savings every year as you refresh, but now you sort of moved things around and I think delayed the Mondeo. And so is that something that is going to take a little bit of a pause or do you expect to continue to see variable cost improvement even into next year from global platforms in Europe?","Robert L. Shanks","First on South America, the results all year have been affected by the government policy changes in addition to the issues that I referenced earlier, not only in Venezuela but also in Argentina on currency access. Yeah, we\u2019ve been affected. The team is responding as quickly as they can to that in terms of what happened between Brazil and Mexico. They essentially suspended the Free Trade Agreement, and have in place now quotas which are lower than what free demand would have been. And so that is having an effect in the short-term. ","We also have the same situation occurring now between Argentina and Mexico, where I think we\u2019re still working to try to put in place an agreement that could result in something like a quota but at the moment, we just have higher tariffs that have been put in place by both parties since the Argentinians decided to suspend the Free Trade Agreement. So that is still a bit of a work in progress. ","When you think about global platforms, I mean, all the business units are beneficiaries of our strategy around global platforms. Europe, of course, most of the products that Europe has were the products that ultimately became global products elsewhere. So, in terms of benefits for them, they clearly have been a great beneficiary of that not only on variable costs, but equally so on the investments in terms of engineering and also in terms of to some extent, the investments we put into the facilities. And we expect that to continue going forward and to be one of the contributors to the turnaround in Europe.","Stephen T. Odell","Okay, Bog just to add to that, if I may. This is Steven. Even with delay of one day which we said is out in 2014, the vast majority of that products in Europe will be global. So one of the reasons we showed the products in Amsterdam was to give people a physical representation of the products that were coming rather than 15 vehicles within five years and just talk about it. We physically showed the product that was there and coming and the vast majority that goes global. The actual volume of course is see the products in Europe was important to us, is on the relatively on the slow side, so we believe we can compensate for it and of course when the new Mondeo and the new S-Max and the new Galaxy come through, then we\u2019ll continue to the leverage of the One Ford plan. ","","Patrick K. Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Okay, that\u2019s very clear, thanks for taking my questions. ","Stephen T. Odell","Welcome. ","","Operator","And now we will take media questions. (Operator Instructions) Alisa Priddle, Detroit Free Press.","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Good morning, gentlemen. ","Stephen T. Odell","Good morning. ","","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","","I just wanted to check. Obviously North America has been the big driver in all of this. I am just wondering, I guess in a perfect world, how much contribution do you want from North America versus the other regions?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, you would want everybody generating \u2013 our guidance is that we\u2019d like to achieve an 8% to 9% operating margin for the total company. We said that, we\u2019d like to have North America at sort of 8% to 10%. So, given the size of North America relative to the others, you would like to see North America representing 55%, 60% of the Company that's generating an 8% to 9% operating margin. Clearly it's more than explaining all the profits, but that simply reflects the opportunities ahead of us in transforming our business in Europe, addressing the issues in South America that we were just talking about, and then getting Asia Pacific to the point where it is meaningfully contributing to the bottom line. We are confident that in all three of those areas, we are on track to do that. ","Alan R. Mulally","This is Alan. Just one comment to Bob's, one of the neat things about the ONE Ford plan is that balance between the service geographically to the customers also in addition to the balance on the portfolio of products. And of course the neat thing about the United States is the transformation to include all the small and medium-sized vehicles along with our strength and leadership in the larger vehicles. When you add that with the balance of serving the customers and as you know Asia-Pacific is going to be a very significant contributor in addition to America's and to Europe, but I think it's that balance of the service around the world but also the complete family of vehicles. I think you are seeing the leadership of that transformation here in North America.","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Okay, Bob, I just wanted to clarify one thing. You had said earlier about that this is the third quarter in a row with over $2 billion and an operating margin of 10%. But were you talking total Company or just North America or were you talking net income or?","Robert L. Shanks","No, I was talking about North America, so on a pretax operating basis, they've made more than $2 billion first, second, and third quarter and on an operating margin basis, they have exceeded 10% in the first, second, and third quarters.","Alisa Priddle \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin, The Associated Press.","Dee-Ann Durbin \u2013 The Associated Press","Hi, Alan, I was hoping that you could quickly discuss the Consumer Reports ranking yesterday. I know we\u2019ve heard time and time again from Ford that you are fixing the issues with MyFord Touch. You are fixing the transmissions, but it just still seems that consumers are giving you pretty hard knocks for those problems and I'm wondering what you are going to do?","Alan R. Mulally","Well you bet. Well good morning to you Dee-Ann. I think that clearly it's disappointing although we really do know the issues as you know and in some of them, especially the ones that are really contributing to the latest report, is led by not so much SYNC, but the MyFord Touch on the information and entertainment side and also the new six-speed fuel efficient transmissions that we know what needs to be done on the redesign of those. We have a number of the fixes already in on both. We have more to come and as you know it takes time to get it through the product line. ","So what the customers are saying and the feedback we've gotten with the new technology is really important to us and we're going to continue to continuously improve them going forward.","Dee-Ann Durbin \u2013 The Associated Press","Thank you.","Alan R. Mulally","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey from Wall Street.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street","Good morning.","Alan Mulally","Hi, Mike.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street","And nice job on the results. I wanted to ask kind of a follow-up on Patrick\u2019s question. How much is your integration of all of your platforms affecting \u2013 can you quantify how much of the profit margin in North America is affected by the collapse of these global platforms or is it too early to have a big read through on that? Because it just seems like your cost-cutting is one thing but \u2013 and this seems like a longer-term thing and I am wondering how much that has come through on North America and how much it might then flow through the rest of the world?","Alan Mulally","Absolutely, a really important question and I think it starts \u2013 the first part of the answer to your question starts with the efficiency on developing the products, both in engineering and manufacturing. And clearly North America and the rest of the businesses are really appreciating the benefit of that scale and the efficiency of developing the global platforms and you can really see that in the capital expenditure too, Mike. You can see the amount of product that we are doing compared to the past with the investment that we updated also.","I think going forward, we are at the front-end of really appreciating the value of the products when they go into manufacturing and into service, which as you know, we are at the relatively start of that around the world and of course led by North America. So when you look at it, what's going on right now is the Focus, the Fusion, the Fiesta, the Escape, the C-MAX, the Transit, the Transit Connect, all of those are right at the front-end of moving to that world where nearly 80% of the volume will be off of those five platforms. And right now, they are off of nine platforms. So I think we are seeing the efficiencies and we're very pleased about it on the development and I think we have a lot more benefit to see going forward as they go into production, especially, aligning with our supply base.","Mike Ramsey \u2013 Wall Street","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan Mulally","You bet, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Schoenberger, Plain Dealer.","Robert Schoenberger \u2013 Plain Dealer","Looking at the profit margin for the quarter, I was somewhat surprised to see such a high number when the mix has been away from pickups and SUVs and some of the more profitable vehicles. So are you just seeing enough of a margin in some of the newer cars and crossovers to make up for the lack of the F-Series?","Robert L. Shanks","I think what you're seeing is a very, very healthy cost structure. As I mentioned earlier, Robert, we can be breakeven at 10 million industry or slightly below that and the industry in the quarter on the SAAR basis was about 14.7 million. So we are getting good -- obviously we have healthy margins on F-Series, but we are also seeing good margins across much of the lineup.","And in fact if you look at the pricing in the quarter for the Company, we generated about $800 million of year-over-year good news on pricing and about half of that was in North America and the majority of that was actually in carryover vehicles, which shows the work that the team has been doing on strengthening the brand, but also managing very effectively our production to our demand. So we\u2019re able to really get every single dollar out of each sale that we possibly can.","Robert Schoenberger \u2013 Plain Dealer","And when \u2013 you've talked about the mix improvement as well, is that mainly people choosing more contented versions of vehicles or are people choosing more Fusions over Fiesta, Focuses, more Focuses over Fiestas, that sort of mix?","Robert L. Shanks","In the quarter on kind of a year-over-year basis, it was pretty much equally split between favorable performance in terms of the product mix of the vehicles and also favorable performance on a series and option mix basis. So we clearly are seeing people as you suggested putting more on their vehicles, but we are also seeing favorable product.","Robert Schoenberger \u2013 Plain Dealer","Great, thank you.","Robert L. Shanks","You are welcome.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel, Detroit News.","Karl Henkel \u2013 Detroit News","Good morning.","Alan Mulally","Good morning, Karl.","Karl Henkel \u2013 Detroit News","I know you guys didn't want to get too speculative on the operating margin North America and what you I guess project, whether it can stay up above 10% for how long necessarily. But is that going to be expected to I guess make up such a huge portion of the overall operating margin, which I think it was 6.3% for the quarter or do you see some of the other regions I guess contributing a little bit more than that because 12% does seem like a really good but also really high number to continue?","Robert L. Shanks","Karl, that's a good question. I mean 12% is a very, very high number in our industry and that isn't a number that in general you would expect to be able to sustain over a longer period time. But that's why we keep calling out the fact that North America has been able to do so well for three quarters in a row. I would not expect them to have that level of margin in the fourth quarter for the reasons that we talked about. They will still have a good margin and a healthy margin. It wouldn't be quite that high, I don't think.","So as we go ahead, as I mentioned earlier, I think North America will continue to carry the load. They will have a very healthy margin as we continue to work on transforming our business in Europe and strengthening South America and as we start to see Asia-Pacific more and more come back online in terms of delivering a stronger profit as it continues to grow. And as we get towards mid-decade on a trend basis, we would expect the Company on average to be generating an 8% to 9% margin and North America 8% to 10%, but are we going to have quarters where they do better? Sure we will.","Karl Henkel \u2013 Detroit News","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lassa, Motor Trend. Todd, your line is open. Once again, Todd, if you can please unmute your line.","Todd Lassa \u2013 Motor Trend","Hello.","Operator","Yes, please. Go right ahead.","Todd Lassa \u2013 Motor Trend","Thanks, sorry. Yeah, my question is along the line of kind of the product mix, trucks versus small cars. Just to kind of follow up on that, can you give any kind of indication of how the percentage of profit from small cars has improved or changed in the past five years, say how much of that you get from small cars versus F-Series now compared with five years ago?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, I think if you go back five or six years ago, I mean, we used to lose a tremendous amount of money on small cars and we made a whole lot of money on trucks and what we have seen over time is the truck margin has remained very, very strong, maybe a little bit less in an absolute sense than it used to be as we have had to address more and more stringent fuel economy requirements and that sort of thing. But we have seen a dramatic improvement in the margins that we get on the rest of the portfolio.","And that\u2019s what Alan was talking about earlier is that the secret to success in this business is serving customers everywhere and serving them in all segments and to do that and to be profitable consistently, you\u2019ve got to make money on everything that you sell. Does that mean you will make as much on a Focus as an F-Series? No, not in today's environment, but you still need to make something. I think that has been one of the secrets in the turnaround of North America.","Todd Lassa \u2013 Motor Trend \u2013 Media","How dependent is that regarding the small cars on not just the mix, but how well equipped they are, say, a titanium level Focus versus a lower level? Would a larger portion of base models put your profit in jeopardy?","Robert L. Shanks","Well, we make more on higher series products that we do on lower series. Your supposition is correct there, but the thing that\u2019s interesting that we are seeing is as customers are becoming more conscious of fuel economy and it becoming a greater reason to buy, as they are buying more fuel-efficient vehicles, they are buying higher series because they're downsizing, if you will, but they don't want to downsize in terms of their feature comforts. And so more and more are going towards the higher series, which of course helps our bottom line.","Todd Lassa \u2013 Motor Trend \u2013 Media","Okay, thanks.","Robert L. Shanks","You bet.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Tom Walsh from Detroit Free Press.","Tom Walsh \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Hello, gentlemen.","Robert L. Shanks","Hi, Tom.","Alan Mulally","Hello.","Tom Walsh \u2013 Detroit Free Press","Just one question and this goes back to the stark contrast which has been going on for many quarters, a couple of years now between North America and Europe. And I just wonder to the extent that from a macro standpoint you've got a U.S. market with decent growth and definite pricing power versus the mess that Europe has become, how much of that do you attribute to policy actions or inactions in the United States and Europe and how would you contrast that over the period since the 2008, 2009 crisis?","Alan Mulally","Tom, it\u2019s Alan. I will get Bob's thoughts too but I think it's a really important question. The way you have asked it because clearly in the United States over the last few years, we have taken very dramatic action to size our production to the real demand to accelerate the development of the new products that people really do want and value to cover more of the market segments.","And so we know this is exactly the right thing to do and you can see the results today with this balanced portfolio and our productivity that goes along with that. And clearly that's really what we announced last week with our plan to accelerate the transformation of our business in Europe. And I think this is the time to do it there. No business is sustainable if it continues to lose money because you are just not able to continue to invest in the products and serve the customer. So we know it works.","We know it's not just a cost story. That's why as Bob pointed out that in addition to restructuring ourselves to utilize our facilities, we are also accelerating the development and the introduction of all the new vehicles based on our global family of Ford vehicles. So it's improving the brand which we have done. It's the new vehicles that people want and value as well as restructuring ourselves to operate profitably and use our capacity. Bob? Any additional? Or Stephen, any other comments from your European thought?","Stephen T. Odell","Ford Europe I think you summarized it very well, Alan. It is I think and contrast the fact that during the global recession, the North American car industry took action to reduce surplus capacity and unfortunately during the global recession, Europe didn\u2019t. Over a period time, that's just not sustainable.","Tom Walsh \u2013 Detroit Free Press","But I guess the larger point is from a policy standpoint of the governments, have we seen the kind of change in the European government\u2019s posture relative to what the U.S. government did or allowed to happen? Is there anything in the European policy area that gives hope that that is going to get any better?","Alan Mulally","I sure think so. We will get Stephen\u2019s thoughts, too, but look at how the discussion and the debate has really changed. And you can see very clearly with everybody now talking about what does it take to create a viable automobile industry in Europe and the discussions now centered around having the business sized for the real demand, making the vehicles that people really do want and value and letting the market really decide.","And so I think it's a very \u2013 the discussion and the debate has moved to a very healthy place on what it really takes to create a long-term viable industry. And as you know, as hard as this is and it is really hard, that's why we are moving so decisively because the most important thing you can do is to size your production to the real demand and provide the vehicles that people really do want, because if not, you don't have a chance to create an exciting growing company. But I think a lot of people are coming to that same point of view and I think it will result in actions to reduce the overcapacity in Europe for the good of everybody.","Tom Walsh \u2013 Detroit Free Press \u2013 Media","Great, thanks.","Robert L. Shanks","You are welcome Tom. Thank you.","George Sharp","Well, thank you, everyone. That concludes today\u2019s presentation. We are glad that you were able to join us."]}}
