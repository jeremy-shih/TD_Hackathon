At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. A Question-and-Answer Session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Geisler, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you Mr. Geisler, you may begin. ","Ted Geisler ","Thank you, Manny. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings, recent developments and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy; and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from our expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our full year 2016 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 3.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks Ted and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West concluded a productive 2016 with earnings in line with our expectations. Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another record year. Our employees set a new companywide safety record and we continue making progress on our regulatory initiatives. ","Our capital execution program is on track with several noteworthy projects recently placed in the service and our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results in a moment, my comments will focus on our 2016 highlights and the year ahead.","Our fleet performed very well in 2016 highlighted by Palo Verde's 25th consecutive year as the Nation's largest power producer. Total production reached 32.2 billion kilowatt hours of carbon-free electricity. In fact, the fall refueling outage for Unit-3 set a station record for the shortest outage ever and set an unclear industry record for radiological safety. ","Before I continue, I want to recognize Randy Edington for his significant positive impact on our company as Chief Nuclear Officer. Randy will be retiring from APS in March and I want to thank him for the great service to our company and the nuclear industry as a whole during his decade of leadership here in Arizona. Because of his skill and experience as well as his ability to develop strong leaders and sustainable processes he's left a lasting legacy of excellence at Palo Verde.","In 2016, APS also achieved the safest year with the fewest reportable injuries in our history. I consider the safety of our employees the top priority, and I also believe safety metrics are good indicators of management's ability to lead an organization. These just aren\u2019t statistics, but the result of a continued commitment from all our employees and management team to drive operational excellence.","Turning to the regulatory front, we've had a busy few months with the ongoing progress of our rate review and the conclusion of the value and cost of distributed generation proceeding. I'll provide an update on these important items in a moment, but first, I want to thank Arizona Corporation Commissioner, Bob Stump whose term ended in early January this year. We appreciate his commitment to the state over his many years of public service and for driving the dialog on several complex regulatory issues. Commissioner Bob Burns, Andy Tobin and Boyd Dunn were sworn in on January 3rd to four year terms. Commission Tom Forese was also selected by his fellow commissioners as Chairman succeeding Commissioner Doug Little who lead the commission through a challenging period.","I'll now provide an update on two important regulatory dockets. The value and cost of distributed generation decision and our 2016 rate review filing. On December 20, the corporation commission completed its proceeding on the value and cost of DG. The commission approved the recommendation to replace the current net metering tool [ph] with a more formula driven approach. The formula will use inputs from utility scale solar power cost and eventually transition into an avoided cost mythology.","In addition, the ACC made the following determinations, first banking of energy produced by DG solar systems has been eliminated. Second, customers with DG Solar maybe considered a separate class of customers for rate making purposes, and third DG solar customers who have interconnected systems prior to the decision in APS's pending rate view will be grandfathered for a period of 20 years. This decision marks an important milestone in our commitment to modernize customer rates, while minimizing subsidies among customer classes.","Although other jurisdictions have attempted to make similar changes. This was among the first of fully litigated cases in the country and was founded on our actual evidence sworn testimony and a judge's order. Moreover, the decision was embraced by a wide variety of stakeholders including local solar installers who shared our vision for creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona.","I know APS's rate view is top of mind for many of you and we continue making good progress with this proceeding. Since our last call, the ACC's staff intervene filed testimony in response to our initial proposal. This provided a foundation for us to engage a meaningful settlement negotiations in January and earlier this month. We continue working with parties towards a constructive settlement proposal to be filed no later than March 17th.","Last month The Administrative Law Judge revised the procedural schedule for this case, in order to provide staff with sufficient time to incorporate the recent value cost of -- excuse me, value and cost of DG decision. As a result, the time clock was extended by 33 days and the new hearing date is April 24th.","2017 marks a period of unprecedented capital investment of our company as we manage more than 1.3 billion in projects and planned to spend more than 3.4 billion in capital over the next three years. Our focus continues to be modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation and advancing our customer experience. We're well positioned to be a leader in grid automation and technology integration. The EPS Solar partner program recently won the award for Renewable Integration Project of The Year at the Annual DistribuTECH Conference. Through this program our employees are studying the applications of smart inverters to integrating rooftop solar and battery storage on the distribution grid. In addition, we've recently placed into service an industry leading advanced distribution management system.","Next month we'll launch a new state-of-the-art customer information system. Both systems are innovative forward thinking and bring greater value to our customers while preparing for the future. These investments drive operating efficiencies through leveraging technology on the grid which results in continued cost management and improved reliability for our customers. We also remain committed to upgrading our generation portfolio with more flexible gas generation as the Ocotillo modernization project its whole stride this year. Finally, our traditional generation and transmission business continues to drive meaningful investments as we further expand our high voltage transmission system and install environmental control technology at the Four Corners Power Plant.","Recently the owners of Navajo Generating Station announced the decision to retire the plant by 2019 in which APS has a 315 megawatt stake. This generation shortfall is in addition to the existing shortfall of 3,500 megawatts by 2022 as outlined in our 2017 preliminary integrated resource plan which I described for you last quarter. Although a portion of this resource gap will be filled by Ocotillo project and our recent 565 megawatt power purchase agreement. The remainder will be procured through additional market opportunities, customer conservation and the distributed generation.","In addition to our changing energy mix, we continue to embrace the growing western marketplace for wholesale power. In October we joined the Western Energy imbalanced market which produced $6 million in savings for our customers in the fourth quarter 2016 alone. We expect continued savings throughout 2017 which reduces cost for customers and improves the competitiveness of our retail rates.","In summary, we delivered on our commitments in 2016 and are well positioned for 2017 in the long-term. We have a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place in place to deliver on the plan. The priorities we have for the year ahead in particular completing the rate review and executing on our capital investments and laying the foundation for APS to be a sustainable leader in an evolving industry.","We remain focused on creating value through our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you John and thank you everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we\u2019ve reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. As you can see on Slide 3 in the materials, we had a good year and ended on a strong note. Before I review the details of our 2016 results let me touch on a couple of highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we earned $0.47 per share compared to $0.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. ","Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Gross margin was flat including lower sales which were offset by higher LFCR revenues. Lower operations on maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 improved earnings by $0.06 per share largely due to lower employee benefit cost driven by the adoption of a new stock compensation accounting guidance.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to Slide 5. Let\u2019s review some of the details of our full year results. 2016 results were in line with our expectations earning $3.95 per share compared to $3.92 per share in 2015, translate into an earned consolidated ROE of 9.5 on a weather normalized basis. Gross margin was the fastest driver for the year contributing $0.33 per share including favorable year-over-year weather. Sales in 2016 compared to 2015 added $0.05 to gross margin, weather normalized retail flow of our sales [ph] after the effects of energy efficiency program and distributed generation were flat year-over-year, but similar to the pattern we saw throughout 2016, the usage trends and related pricing by customer class or mix and generated a positive gross margin effect.","Transmission LFCR revenues also continued to add incremental growth in our gross margins as designed contributing $0.17 per share respectively. Looking at the operating expenses, as expected higher operations to maintenance expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was a primary offset to ongoing results. Decrease in earnings by $0.37 per share. With the major planned outages at the four corners units 4 and 5 serving as a largest headwind. Higher transmission, distribution and customer service and higher employee benefit cost also contributed to year-over-year increase in O&M.","Our depreciation and amortization expense in 2016 versus 2015 reduced earnings by $0.03 per share including higher deprecation due to additional plant and service. Interest expense net of AIPDC was $0.02 per share benefit to earnings in 2016 compared to 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher debt balances which were more than offset by higher construction work in progress benefitting AIPDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances excluding amounts related to our renewable energy and demand side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and G&A variances exclude operating revenues and expense related to the Palo Verde Unit-2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefit charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on full year results.","As you know Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the next trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particularly in the Metro Phoenix area. In 2016 the Metro Phoenix region continues to add job growth above the national average. For the full year employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.7% compared to 1.7% for the entire United States. This above average job growth is seen in virtually every major industry sector although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction and financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to add a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets.","As seen on the upper panel of Slide 6, the net absorption of vacancy office and regional space has been growing steadily since 2010. Vacancy rates in both markets are falling to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. we expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in our Phoenix market which will in turn support continued commercial development. ","Metro Phoenix has also growth in the real estate market. As you can see in the lower panels of Slide 6, housing construction in 2016 was at its highest levels of 2007. This trend is expected to continue in 2017 as housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000 driven largely by single family permits. Several factors are driving this increase, vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single family homes is providing meaningful support to loan prices which have return to levels last seen in early 2008.","We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to households to separate from closures during recession and should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to expand over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% in 2016. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appears to be in place. ","In closing, I will review our financial outlook and financing plans. As previously indicated we will not be issuing 2017 earnings per share guidance at this time, but we'll continue to evaluate appropriate time to do so as our rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimate, a list of the key drives that may affect 2017's ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to the today's slides. One item worth nothing, we expect plant outage spend in 2017 to be comparable to 2016 and part driven by preparation for the LFCRs installation of four corners. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APSs spend to average of our 1.1 billion annually from 2017 and 2019 which will be primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. We continue expanding our rate base to grow at an average of annual rate of 6% or 7% through 2019.","Turning to 2017 financing, we expect to issue up to 850 million of long-term debt including the refinance with Pinnacle's 125 million term loan. Overall our balance sheet and liquidity continues to remain very strong. A quick note on pension [ph], our funded status remains steady at as of yearend 2016. The continued implementation of our liability driven investment strategy has helped to keep cost down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our outlook.","Lastly, I\u2019ll share a few thoughts on proposed tax reforms. We are actively accessing the tax reform scenario and are working closely with our EEI peers. Overall, we view the proposed changes as beneficial to customers with the potential to release some rate pressure. We generally view the potential company impact as mild, especially given Pinnacle minimal parent level debt. With so much uncertainty at this point, it's difficult to speculate with any agreed certainty. We will continue to monitor discussions closely as they develop.","This concludes our prepared remarks and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a Question-And-Answer Session. [Operator Instruction] our first question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","It's Jeremy [indiscernible] on. Just on the first off on the Navajo plant it's been kind of a fluid situation and I guess one, is there any sense to think that it wouldn\u2019t shut down at this point or is that pretty clear and two, can you just clarify what exactly that might be backfilled with, as I understand it not -- the shutdown is not included in your IRP?","Mark Schiavoni","This is Mark Schiavoni, and yes, as far as your first quarter about shutdown. The owners led by SRP who is the operating agent has made decision at 2019 which is a current exploitation of the existing lease either as a year to lease [ph] and move forward beyond 2019 with the current owners structure or a changed owner structure. Couple of owners have made it clear they do not want to operate beyond 2019. But in the meantime, department has interior and our ACC as well as others that pull all the party together and are looking forward some sort of resolution post 2019 in order to continue the operating of the facility.","The economics or the facility as it stands today would not warrant continued operation without some significant changes. So that\u2019s an ongoing issue still to be resolved. As far as the impact of the generation we will update our [indiscernible] as we go forward. But the current expectation is, we have the resources until at least 2019 potentially longer, and we will put it into our future finance and what we do from an RP [ph] or some more other positions with regards to Navajo generating station. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And just to clarify that, will that be traditional generation or something more along the lines of storage or even solar since you guys, I believe just passed the 1 gigawatt mark in solar or it [technical difficulty].","Don Brandt","It would be any amount at this point, so.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then just one other question on tax reform. If we had a lower tax rate and obviously that's a pass through. Would you expect that to be changed in the rate case following the tax reform or would there be any chance of that happening sooner?","Mark Schiavoni","Well I think lower overall corporate tax rate will be passed on to customers. I don't think it never going to wait till the next rate case. I think the [indiscernible] maybe something that hurt the company, so you want to put it all together and do it all at once. But we'll just have to wait and see there is at least two proposals out there. The treasury secretary spoke yesterday. I think the issue is further clouded and we'll just have to wait and see ultimately what happens ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. the next question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Ali Agha","First question it looks like the weather normalized electric sales for the year at flat or below of what you'd been projecting for the year, if I recall correctly. What do you think was causing that and any further visibility both in terms of the growth on customers and sales that you're projecting looking over the next three years given where we've been running last four or five, six quarters? Anything it is important to give us that more optimism. I know you've talked about the economic indicators. But why did '16 coming below what you had been expecting?","Mark Schiavoni","Well I think well first of all. No question we had a weak fourth quarter, heading into fourth quarter we had positive sales. So don't know that that's necessarily a trend and I'm not going to the to the first and fourth quarters to look at the trend with us being waited till second, third quarter. But I will say we have a lot of business sales were up last year for example State Farm [ph] started filling their buildings in 2015 that wasn't complete until October of this year. So you'll have a full year impact of that, and we just see a lot of construction, especially multi-family homes going on into Downtown Phoenix. So all the signs are pointing towards modest sales growth in 2017, we're projecting between of 0% and 1%. So we will ultimately see what happens.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then second over this next three-year cycle '17 through '19, do you have a sort of an earn ROE goal given like you had in the last cycle minimal was 9.5% and you got higher. I mean should we think about similar goals or different goals over this cycle period?","Mark Schiavoni","I think I'll defer that until we talk about \u201917 guidance.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then on the rate case itself, I guess you know is the confidence level still pretty high on reaching a settlement on or before March 17th and what remains in your mind the most contentious issues at this stage?","Don Brandt","Ali, this is Don here and we continue engaging with the parties in a constructive settlement discussions and in generally speaking, we believe that parties are motivated to settle. It\u2019s really difficult to go in any detail at this point.","Ali Agha","Okay. But Don, is it fair to say I mean the usual ROEs et cetera. all would be up for negotiation I guess?","Don Brandt","Everything is up for negotiation. ","Ali Agha","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Geisler for closing remarks. ","Ted Geisler","Thank you Manny, this concludes our call. Thank you all for joining today. ","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.

A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 7.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald E. Brandt","Thank you, Paul, and thank you, all, for joining us today. The management team and our entire workforce continued to deliver solid operational and financial results. Our results this quarter provide one example of delivering solid results, although our focus is always on the long term. The track record of our improving financial strength and regulatory clarity are also why we recommended and the board approved a 5% dividend increase last week, effective with the December dividend payment. The 5% increase takes a measured step forward from the 4% increases in each of the last 2 years. Jim will discuss the dividend and the third quarter results in more detail. But first I'll update you on the regulatory progress and provide a few operational highlights.","In that regard and building on the theme from the last few quarters, I will outline the progress that is being made in Arizona to address rate design. We continue to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and other stakeholders to take positive steps forward and shape the conversation for the industry. At a July 22 meeting, the ACC voted for a limited reopening of the 2013 net metering decision to consider removing the requirement for APS to file a rate case in 2015 to allow for the possibility of developing rate design options in possible generic proceedings. The ACC took the next step in an August 12 meeting by voting 5 to 0 to lift the requirements that APS filed its next general rate case by June 2015.","The commissioner has also agreed to discuss possible next steps for considering rate design issues in the September open meeting. As expected at the September 9 open meeting, the commission and staff outlined a conceptual proposal of how a company would proceed to address rate design. Commissioner has asked staff to provide additional details in writing to be discussed at a future open meeting. The staff submitted a draft outline to the docket on September 29, describing a potential procedural option that would allow interested parties to have the commission consider and vote on rate design issues prior to starting the rate case time clock in addressing revenue requirements. Several stakeholders submitted reply comments on October 20, which are now being reviewed. We agree with several facets of staffs rate design proposal and are working with staff and other stakeholders to make it more efficient. The staff's proposal was based on an assumed June 2016 revenue requirement filing. We will determine the exact timing of our filing as the process is finalized, but let me remind you of 2 drivers of how we are thinking about rate case timing.","First, our priority is to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders by managing our cost and the rate gradualization, enabled by the adjustors we have in place. Second, we have a peak investment period from 2016 through 2018, driven by the Ocotillo plant modernization project and the environmental upgrades at Four Corners Units 4 and 5. So we will need to update our revenue to ensure we meet our commitments in 2017 and beyond. The ACC also has several resource related decisions pending in the coming months. The certificate of environmental compatibility for the Ocotillo modernization project received approval from the line siting committee last month, and now goes to the ACC for approval.","Second, the ALJ is expected to issue her recommendation for the Four Corners rate rider. The ACC is expected to vote on this before the end of the year. Our third item in front of the ACC is the last 20 megawatts of AZ Sun. The staff is expected to issue their recommendation, then the ACC will review and vote on the need for the last 20 megawatts and whether the project should be utility scale or rooftop. We also announced, in September, our proposal to shut down the 260 megawatts of Cholla Power Plant Unit 2 by April 2016, and stop burning coal at Units 1 and 3 by the mid-2020s. If the EPA approves a compromised proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and omission standards and rules. We've requested the ACC approve this plan as well.","Turning to our operations, our fleet in electrical grid performed well this summer. Despite multiple extreme monsoon-related events, where we saw flooding in the Phoenix Valley, our generated units were not at risk, although we did have as many as 50,000 customers lose power at one point in time. We worked quickly and safely to get customers back online in the storm restoration efforts, especially our transmission and distribution and customer service teams.","The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had an excellent third quarter. The site capacity factor was in line with the third quarter of last year at 100%. Unit 1 entered its planned refueling outage on October 11. Also, in early October, 10 Japanese chief nuclear officers toured Palo Verde, as well as the nuclear industry's emergency response center located in the western suburb of Phoenix. This was the reciprocal visit following the U.S. chief nuclear officers' visit to Japan last September, continuing the dialogue of lessons learned in the nuclear industry.","Lastly, the joint venture we formed with mid- American transmission in July trans-Canyon will be submitting a bid for the Delaney-Colorado River transmission project by the November 19 due date. There are a few key checkpoints over the next year, but the winning bidder is expected to be announced by the California ISO in the summer of 2015. Let me conclude where I started. We continue to meet or exceed our financial targets with the objective of growing the dividend each year. It's not by accident that we are on track to deliver on our targets again this year even as we have had several drivers work against us. Over the next few years, we see stronger economic recovery as an upside, but we are not relying on that upside to deliver on our goal of earning more than a 9.5% return on equity. Simply put, we make our numbers. As I mentioned earlier, the board and the management team focus on the long-term and creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona. I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James R. Hatfield","Thank you, Don. Slide 4 outlines the topics I will discuss today. I will begin with a review of our third quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year's third quarter, followed by an update on the Arizona economy, and I will conclude with an update on the guidance and our financial outlook, including -- introducing 2015 guidance.","Slide 5 summarizes our GAAP net income in ongoing earnings. As usual, my comments will refer to ongoing earnings. For the third quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $244 million or $2.20 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $226 million or $2.04 per share for the third quarter of 2013.","Moving to Slide 6. You see the variances drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share, which were all positive. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.01 per share compared with the prior year's third quarter. I will cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","Lower operations and maintenance expense added $0.02 per share, largely driven by the favorable impact from lower pension and postretirement expense that has been positively impacted each quarter this year. Lower depreciation and amortization expenses increased earnings by $0.02 per share in part due to the Palo Verde Unit 2 lease extension we announced in July, offset by additional plant in service. Lower taxes, other than income taxes, contributed $0.02 per share due to lower property tax rates. We've generally been experiencing higher property taxes. However, the rates on the property bills we received in September were lower than we had estimated, resulting in a favorable adjustment. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at a lower rate. A lower effective tax rate added $0.02 per share, primarily driven by tax credits related to our renewable facilities. The net impact of other items increased earnings by $0.03 per share. As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjusted mechanisms.","Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction and the impacts to our noncontrolling interest for the Palo Verde lease extension are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on the third quarter 2014 results.","Turning to Slide 7 and the components of the net increase of $0.01 in our gross margin. The main components of this were as follows: the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.02 per share, which, as designed, offset some of the impacts from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy; higher transmission revenue increased earnings by $0.01 per share. We continue to expect transmission revenue to be relatively flat on a full year basis compared to 2013. The Arizona Sun program benefited earnings by $0.03 per share, primarily driven by the Gila Bend project that went into service. The effects of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's third quarter was unfavorable versus normal, and milder than the third quarter of 2013. Cooling degree days were 8% below normal, and 6% lower than the comparable quarter a year ago. The net impact of other miscellaneous items reduced gross margin by $0.02 per share.","Usage by APS customers compared to third quarter a year ago were flat. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were on par in the third quarter of 2014 versus 2013. Beginning on Slide 8 is a look at Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continued its steady improvement in the third quarter of 2014. Absorption of vacant housing in APS's Metro Phoenix territory is averaging between 3,000 units and 5,000 units per year and the number of vacant units is at it's lowest level in 7 years. The steady absorption is providing support to prices for retail homes, and we expect a normalization of this market to continue through the near future. As we indicated a quarter ago, overall housing demands continue to increase. Total housing permits and multifamily permits are expected to reach their highest activity levels in 2014 since 2007. The picture is similar for commercial buildings. Vacant space continues to be absorbed in the office and retail sectors, yielding steadily declining vacancy rates as shown in the upper right. Vacancy rates for industrial space reflects some sizable new developments, which have just recently come online. These trends are indicative of the steady job growth in the Phoenix Metropolitan area and Arizona have been experiencing for the last 3 years. Arizona has added jobs year-over-year on a very consistent 2% rate since the end of 2011 as seen on the lower right-hand side.","Business services, tourism, healthcare, wholesale trade and financial activities have all been source of growth in recent quarters and highlight the sources for continued occupancy gains in the available commercial floor stock. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and a gradually steady recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely that each successive year in the near term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% compared with the third quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.","Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population and job growth in Arizona appear to be in place. Finally, I'll review our earnings guidance and the financial outlook on Slide 9. We continue to expect that Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2014 will be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per share, despite a headwind of $0.06 per weather year-to-date through September and load growth, somewhat slower than we expected. We are introducing 2015 ongoing guidance of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. Cost control and the rate adjustors remain important drivers. So let me highlight a few key assumptions in 2015 guidance. The impact of Four Corners expected in race, and therefore, no longer being deferred is a key driver on most line items. Depreciation and amortization, in particular, has a largest increase year-over-year, accounting for nearly all of the change in other operating expenses on the guidance slide. This is driven by the Four Corners deferral that occurred in 2014 along with ongoing plant additions in 2015. We continue to see customer growth. We are assuming 1.5% -- 2.5% in 2015 translating to flat -- to 1% sales growth. a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides.","On a related note, we have updated our 3-year customer growth and sales forecast, essentially pushing out the recovery a year. The company's goal continues to be an annualized consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2016. This is driven by our 6% to 7% rate-based growth outlook and the recovery due to adjustors for our capital investments in addition to ongoing cost management efforts. Lastly, as Don discussed, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend last week by $0.11 per share or approximately $0.05 -- 5% to $2.38 per share effective with the December payment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about kind of the what the response rate has been on your adapted Arizona Sun solar project? And do you think this is something get resolved with the current commissioner or do you think with the elections till the next year to get new the commissioner's sign off on it?","Donald E. Brandt","Well, I've got Jeff Guldner sitting next to me, I'll let him handle it.","Jeffrey B. Guldner","Sure, Dan. We've had some interest from customers, and so obviously, there are 2 pieces to this program. One of it is to address some customer interest. The other is to give us some -- inform us on what happens when we put west-facing solar what happens when we take control of inverters on rooftop solar systems. And so all that's have generated a lot of discussion. I do expect the commission is likely to -- staff report will come out shortly and that's probably going to be on -- I would expect it to see on the December open meeting.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, with the dividend increase, Don, kind of the 5% level on earnings growth, midpoint at 5% growth. How should we be thinking about the sustainability or trajectory of the dividend? Is there a room on the payout ratio or do you guys kind of keep things tamped down where they are?","Donald E. Brandt","Not quite sure of what you mean by tamped down, Dan, but let me comment, one, we think there's adequate payout ratio and just the improvements in our financial position and some of the regulatory certainty, we felt comfortable and the board agreed moving from a 4% to 5% growth rate. That's not necessarily locked in. We will look at it each year, but as we can -- continue to grow confidence and our ability to deliver our results, we'll take a look at that on a periodic basis.","Daniel L. Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess just one last question. It wasn't in the slides, I don't think, but can you talk about where the residential solar permitting activity as in the installations are so far this year relative to last year?","Donald E. Brandt","Yes, Jeff, do you want to [indiscernible]?","Jeffrey B. Guldner","Yes, we're monitoring it closely. We filed quarterly, so you can get copies of the quarterly filings. I think we're seeing installations coming in right now just a little bit below last year's trajectory, but we also had the highest months or the second highest months we've seen in September. And that's been increasing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions guys. First, Jim, going back to your -- a couple of presentations ago, when you laid out your financial outlook. You said, you expected retail customer growth to get to about 1% in October sales growth, net of 2.5% customer growth by 2016. So based on your statement that you made at the end of your presentation, you basically -- you pushed that out to 2017, is that right?","James R. Hatfield","Well, we sort of pushed the growth out a year. I would say that we continue to see positive signs of activity. As I look out of my window, there are 3 construction projects. The U of A cancer center is nearly complete. The bioscience center is undergoing expansion and ASU is moving their law school downtown, and we'll repurpose the current law school on their Tempe campus. We also saw, last week, the first major buying of land by a homebuilder by Shea homes with their intention in Northscott, They'll begin to sell houses at the end of 2015. So we're continuing to see that. It has been a little sluggish, but it's a matter of when, it's not a matter of if.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But your business plan for '15 and '16 doesn't presume a massive pickup in growth.","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That would just be gravy.","James R. Hatfield","That would be upside.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The other thing I wanted to ask is I think you ended the third quarter with an equity ratio at APS still almost 57% and I know you carry minimal to no parent debt. So can you talk about what your financing plans are because as I look out to 2016, '17, that seems like the time frame when you might need to file a rate case because that's when you'll have a big CapEx plan, but on the other -- and then you usually issue equity to make sure your ratios are in-line with your regulatory capital structure around those times. But given that you are over equitized and given that you have practically no leverage at the parent, is it a foregone conclusion that you will need equity?","James R. Hatfield","I don't think it's a foregone conclusion. In the interim, because we have such a strong equity ratio, we will finance through fixed income security. And so we'll evaluate that when we look to file a rate case what our capital structure is and how we finance that going forward.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. I would make the observation that a lot of your peers that have utility holding companies have used a little bit of that financing capability to fund their equity needs at their operating companies, and you guys have no -- have not demonstratively used that capacity. Is there any reason why we should presume you could not use that capacity?","Donald E. Brandt","There's no reason you should presume we couldn't use that capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Julien here. So kind of following up on the tone of the last few questions here. In terms of keeping your earned ROE in line with your target, how much of this is dependent upon cost-cutting and ongoing O&M efforts versus just the sales targets holding itself up. And to that effect, can you maintain your earned ROE beyond just the current period with a slower growth that you are projecting now?","James R. Hatfield","So let me answer that this way. One, it's not that dependant upon growth as we've seen in the last 2 or 3 years. It's really dependent upon the adjusters and our ability, I would say less cost-cutting and more cost containment as we move forward. And we entered this settlement in early 2012, late 2011, we looked at the sales outlook and really said, we can manage to the stay out period because we had the adjusters, which give us gross margin growth. And those adjusters continue to get bigger as we move forward. And we have to control costs and we've been able to do that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Perhaps, as a follow up, you mentioned the adjusters here, is it your expectation at present that you would continue to hold onto those adjusters through the next rate case? Or is that something in your mind that's up for a review in the next case?","James R. Hatfield","So, certainly, to the next rate case. At that point, and we'll have to look at our situation, do we keep the same adjusters, do we get different adjusters that'll all be part of conversations we'll have at that time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then lastly here, energy storage, obviously, there has been a little bit of noise in the state around this of late, what's the opportunity for you all? Is there an opportunity in rate base or otherwise to invest and what's the time line there, if there is?","Donald E. Brandt","There is some discussion that's going to be held next week, I expect, at the open meeting around Ocotillo project where we've got a proposal to do some pilot work on energy storage in association with that. And obviously, if you look at our system and some of the changes we are expecting in the future with the need to have more fast ramp in the afternoon, that's going to be something that I think you're going to see a lot of discussion that in the southwest. So the proposal that we're talking about next week with Ocotillo would be a rate-based proposal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First question, Jim, just to benchmark this goal that you have of earning 9.5% or higher ROE. And I know you folks calculate that a little different because you look at book numbers, not just at the utility numbers. So can you just let us know on a, let's say, an LTM basis, what is that earned ROE, the way you guys are calculating it right now?","James R. Hatfield","Well, at the middle of our guidance, I believe the ROE is about 9.7% or so roughly.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's the middle of the '14 guidance?","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, I think you also alluded to the fact that in the quarter-over-quarter pickup, I think there was about $0.02 benefit on DNA from the nuclear lease extensions.","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Can just remind us, as I recall from your 8-K filing, the lease expense has cut in half about $28 million or so. And as long as your out of rate case, starting in '16, does that all fall to the bottom line? Is that the way that we should be thinking about that?","James R. Hatfield","So all of the lease reduction will fall to bottom line until the next rate case, in which case we'll get that back as a part of our rate, which is not necessarily a bad thing since it reduces our ask to customers. That will hit in '16. But you have to also remember, that would be a positive change. It will be offsetting other drivers that will go to offset that. So I wouldn't look at it necessarily as indicative of in and of itself being a big item.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. But the other item and another cost pressures and so on, right. But that on a stand-alone basis is a positive for your bottom line?","James R. Hatfield","That's a positive. That would be one of the many items that would go plus and minus as we go year-over-year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right, right, understood. And my last question. If you look at your relationship between customer growth and weather-normalized sales growth, are you seeing any differences there? I mean it's been a little difficult to benchmark as you've been hitting that 1.4% growth on customers and yet weather-normalized sales were negative second quarter or flat right now. Can you give us some more insight on how we should be thinking about that relationship and what's -- is that a consistent rule of thumb looking forward there?","James R. Hatfield","So DE is about 0.5%, and then EE is about 1% roughly. So we would think that as growth accelerates, that would be positive for sales growth. And then the interim, also keep in mind, we have a LFCR, which, as designed, is offsetting some of that reduction.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","But that relationship of DE and EE, has that been consistent throughout or is that ...","James R. Hatfield","It's been fairly consistent.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","As I compare your new capital expenditure plans with previous, there is an increase in traditional generation. Does that still over the end of the plant?","James R. Hatfield","Excuse me. Charles, we...","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Increase in generation, just traditional generation of CapEx, just approval.","James R. Hatfield","Charles, just changing cash flows as it relates to Ocotillo. It's been accelerated a little bit.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry for butchering the name of the plant. Then my second question is on the mid-America proposal on joint venture with the transmission, is that just one of its news put 1000 programs?","James R. Hatfield","Essentially, it's a network resource to Cal-ISO under their Cal-ISO tarrifs. So it's a competitive bid project that we intend to bid on.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","We have seen other projects like this, we're certainly an incumbent and it's right away has a leg up. Is there anything that you confidence, you and your partner, that won't be the case here?","James R. Hatfield","Well, it's a 116-mile line with 98 miles of it in Arizona. So we know the terrain, we know the governing bodies, great relationship. So we think that gives us a leg up.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Citi.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the 20 megawatts that's remaining under AZ Sun, whether the commission goes utility scale or DG, is it fair to assume or is it a possibility that the commission is in favor of you doing distributed generation in the lieu of utility scale that they could potentially open the door for you to take on more DG?","Jeffrey B. Guldner","This is Jeff. So one of the things just to keep in mind, let's say, on this program is this was a compliance program. So we had a 200-megawatt target with AZ Sun project. We've got 170 megawatts of it built-out. And so we're really looking at filling this niche and looking at what we could get from a pilot. Some advantages or some information we can get from pilot standpoint. So we're not really looking at this as an expansion project at this point.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So that's that I'm trying to get out. So if you do the distributed generation, it can be seen as a way for you to eventually expand and compete with some of the leasing models in the state?","Donald E. Brandt","I wouldn't say it competes with those. I think it's just another alternative for customers to consider, and in the case of our proposal, virtually, any customer relative to economic or credit standards can avail themselves, do it all that they need as a structurally sound route. And while we haven't promoted it yet because we haven't received approval. We last heard and this is 10 days old like 1,300, 1400 customers have called to sign up for it. So I think there is a lot of interest from our customers.","Jeffrey B. Guldner","If you look at multifamily right now, there's not really an opportunity for a multifamily unit to move to solar. And so some of this is looking at how do you feel some of those gaps.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And that's what I'm trying to get out is the proposal that you have in front has a very strong value proposition for rate pair. So the question is, could you leverage this and increase the program and compete with some of the leasing models or provide an alternative beyond the 20 megawatts?","Donald E. Brandt","Maybe, a big maybe is the -- what we're looking at now is part of the compliance program. And obviously, we and our regulators and our customers will learn a lot from that experience, and I think based on that, we've always done a good job of listening to our customers and what they want.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just one last question on the 1% -- 0% to 1% growth assumption for next year. Is that net of energy efficiency in DSM?","James R. Hatfield","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just I want to follow up on Greg Gordon's question regarding leverage of the parent. If I understood the Q&A there, I mean it got interrupted, I apologize. But it sounds to me like you guys were indicating that there was some flexibility that you saw there in terms of perhaps some -- funding some -- using some leverage of the parent. And I guess what I was wondering is, any sense as to when one hears that one thing of all sorts of opportunities financially speaking, given your situation, your metrics and what have you. And I was just wondering, can you quantify as to what maybe potentially you guys might be contemplating on that?","James R. Hatfield","No, I would just say that it's an A- credit rating. We feel very good about our financial strength, and we're pretty conservative management team as well. Anything is possible, but we're not out to the lever of the holding company with just APS as a sole provider of dividends to the parent.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I want to follow up on Paul's question and Greg. It's more of a cousin question to it. If I look at your cash flow statement, there is a mismatch of about $60 million in deferred taxes this year between the consolidated parent versus what you did -- or the consolidated numbers versus what you did at APS. How should I think about, one, deferred taxes on a go-forward basis? And two, what's your view of bonus depreciation if Congress will actually extend? And if so, what's the cash benefit to you on an annual basis, given your slightly revised CapEx guidance that you provided?","James R. Hatfield","View on bonus appreciation is, it's not going to change our view on our CapEx program. I mean we have obligation to serve and what we spend is required to serve. We have not been a taxpayer. Well, that will turn around in the fourth quarter of '14. We'll begin to pay taxes. And if bonus appreciation is not continued, we'll begin to turn around that deferred tax balance and begin to pay taxes again.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So then -- but if it is continued what's the cash impact to you in the event that it is continued?","James R. Hatfield","The cash impact for us will be -- will push off the ITC been able to realize that from 2015 to 2016. And depending on what they do on bonus appreciation, it could be $50 million to $125 million, whether they do $50 million or $100 million.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Julien here again. I just wanted to tie things back together, if you will. You've talked about a 4-ish percent EPS growth previously, I'm noticing in the slides here kind of an acceleration, I think in the dividend growth. You're now saying kind of an approximate growth rate of 5%. How are you thinking at EPS trajectory, especially given your ability to continue to earn your ROE? Is that itself accelerating here as we look at the step-up in CapEx in '16 and '18? What are the potential offsets, if you will? I mean how are you thinking about it?","James R. Hatfield","We always describe it as rate based growth of 6% to 7%. Before dividend growth of 4% and earnings somewhere in between, and I think the 4% to 5% just represents our confidence and our ability to execute. Those would still be your bookends from a financial performance perspective.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. But from actually materializing that earnings trajectory, do you think there is an ability to continue to spend at an accelerated rate beyond kind of that '16 through '18? Or is that kind of a one-time bump? Any of....","James R. Hatfield","With our outlook, Phoenix and Arizona continue to be a growth state and provide appropriate regulatory recovery. I think we'll have continued opportunity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right, got you. I mean, in fact, could we hassle a little bit what is the discrepancy between that higher rate base and the lower EPS trajectory, if you could kind of talk to that a little bit?","James R. Hatfield","It's just a little bit of a regulatory lag. I think we have about 80% of our CapEx is through some sort of an adjustor -- 40% through an adjustor -- roughly 40% through depreciation. And so we are losing recovery on about 20% of our rate base growth and that sort of your lag going forward, as well as test year expenses versus current year expenses, which represent primarily the increase in DNA property tax and things of that nature.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Paul J. Mountain","All right. Thanks, everyone. We look forward to seeing you [indiscernible].

Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 8.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald Brandt","Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Despite mild weather, we\u2019re off to another solid start this year. Our operations are running well and preparing for the summer peak. Palo Verde nuclear generating station continues to deliver excellent results, and it\u2019s also preparing for the summer with Unit 3 in a planned refueling outage that began Easter weekend.","Before Jim discusses the first quarter results and our updated financial outlook there are few regulatory and strategic developments I\u2019ll update you on.","First, rate design continues to be a priority for APS and it is so increasingly across the country. We\u2019ve seen progressive steps in other states, as well as by our peer utilities here in Arizona. Salt River Project\u2019s board approved a broad rate design change in February, while Trico, Sulphur Springs, UniSource, and TEP all filed for net metering related changes earlier this year.","The steps each utility is taking varies but appropriately addressing the cost shift and lining the fixed and variable cost discrepancy as a top priority. On April 2, APS asked the Arizona Corporation Commission to increase the grid access charge for future residential solar customer from $0.70 per kilowatt to $3 per kilowatt or approximately $21 per month. We\u2019ve asked the ACC to have this effective August 1. In its 2013 decision, the ACC found that an interim monthly charge of $3 per kilowatt was reasonable to cover the cost to operate and maintain the electric grid but decided to begin with a smaller charge of $0.70 per kilowatt and monitor the issue.","APS is simply asking the Commission to implement its 2013 decision. Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but it\u2019s rather intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case or another proceeding. RUCO agrees that this interim solution should be approved to help mitigate some of the cost shift before the issue can be dealt with more fully in a rate case. New solar customers would have the option of selecting an existing rate that includes a demand charge.","Other components of the future of rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of use rate structures. Since 2013, rooftop solar has seen steady growth. Now over 31,000 customers in our service territory have a rooftop solar system installed. This level of activity reinforces our commitment to modernizing our grid and updating our pricing structures to give customers the platform they need to support the different types of energy and services they want.","Our APS Solar Partner Program, where APS will be installing and owning rooftop solar on about 1,500 homes, equal to about 10 megawatts, is now being rolled out. We\u2019ve completed two of the three scheduled RFPs to select the Arizona-based companies that will be installing the systems. And we\u2019ve begun soliciting customers on the first group of feeders we\u2019ve chosen for the program. This innovative program allows us to partner with the Electric Power Research Institute to conduct research on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation and its interaction with the grid.","In working with various stakeholder groups for this pilot, including the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance, which represents Arizona-based solar installers, we\u2019re helping Arizona maintain its solar leadership while ensuring our customers are served well. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun, has two projects under construction in the Phoenix metro area that will bring that program to 170 megawatts. Those projects are expected to be online this summer. In fact, our AZ Sun program has largely contributed to another strong showing by APS in Arizona in the Solar Electric Power Association\u2019s Annual utilities solar rankings that were published this week.","APS was ranked in the top five in four categories including cumulative megawatts and annual and cumulative interconnections. The Ocotillo modernization project is an important investment to maintain reliability in the Valley and support the growth in renewable generation. We issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity at our Ocotillo peaking facility, equivalent to three of the five new units. Bids were received in March and have been evaluated. The RFP affirmed that APS\u2019s bid at the existing Ocotillo site is the most cost effective.","Additionally, our analysis of the project, which was reflected in the bid, determined that it was optimal from a customer impact standpoint to have the project completed in 2019 instead of 2018. And Jim will discuss the financial implications of this change.","There are couple of transmission-related items to update you on also. First, we recently completed construction of the, what we call the Hang 2 line, or the Hassayampa-North Gila #2 500 KV transmission line. The project remains on schedule and is expected to be energized in the second quarter this year, after testing and commissioning of both the Hassayampa switch yard and the North Gila substation is complete. In total, the 112-mile-long line into Yuma required construction of 390 steel towers through some extremely difficult terrain.","This is a very important project for our company to meet customers\u2019 energy needs in southwestern Arizona. And second, the Delaney Colorado transmission line decision is expected by the California ISO this summer. During the bidding collaboration period, TransCanyon and Southern California Edison submitted a joint proposal to the Cal ISO for this project. That replaces the individual bids both parties submitted in November of last year. The collaboration brings together the experience, expertise and proven track record each organization has in their respective states, TransCanyon in Arizona and Southern California Edison in California.","Let me conclude by saying that our focus will continue to be to make decisions and investments that position APS in Arizona for sustainable success in a changing energy world.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3 and included [Technical Difficulty] quarter financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, and a review of our financial outlook. For the first quarter of 2015 we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16.1 million or $0.14 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $15.8 million or $0.14 per share for the first quarter 2014.","Slide 4, outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I\u2019ll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. An increase in gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I\u2019ll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, largely due to fossil generation plant outages. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price. G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. These higher costs were partially offset by the Palo Verde Unit 2 lease extension we announced in July of last year.","As included in our guidance, G&A will be higher all year largely due to Four Corners. Lower interest expense net of AFUDC benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinanced long-term debt at a lower rate. Turning to Slide 5, and the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin, collectively the revenue adjustors continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin, as designed, including the Four Corners rate change that went to effect on January 1 and contributed $0.06 per share.","Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A which I mentioned earlier. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. Although weather on both the 2015 and 2014 first quarters were less favorable than normal, the first quarter 2015 benefited from an unseasonally warm March compared to the same month in 2014.","While residential heating degree days, a measure of the effects of weather, were 6% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter, heating degree days were 51% below normal 10-year averages. As a result, weather negatively impacted 2015 first quarter by $0.06 per share compared with the historically normal conditions. Lower usage by APS customers compared with the first quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation, were down 0.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus 2014.","The expiration of a long-term wholesale contract at the end of 2014, which is included in guidance, lowered earnings by $0.02 per share. There will be a similar variance each quarter this year. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency, and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.","Also the impact of our non-controlling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on first-quarter results. Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona\u2019s economy continues to grow much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in Arizona and the Phoenix metro area remain above the national average as they have for the past 15 quarters. As seen on the lower right hand side of Slide 6, Arizona added jobs at 2.6% year-over-year rate in the first quarter, the fastest rate of job growth since Q4 2006.","Notably, this job growth has occurred without relying on the construction sector. Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth and highlighted diversity of Arizona\u2019s economy. Additionally, several sources have recently ranked the greater Phoenix area as one of the top places for small business and entrepreneurs. The requirement for small business start-ups is very strong.","As I indicated before, we believe that job growth we are seeing reflects the attractiveness of metro phoenix and Arizona as a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets but with a much lower cost structure.","Of the 15 largest US metropolitan areas, the Phoenix metro area ranked second in population growth in 2014. This healthy population and job growth is providing continued support for an improved real estate market. As seen in the upper right hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates for commercial space continue to edge down, and activity in these sectors has picked up with 2.8 million square foot of industrial space and 4.3 million square feet of office space under construction in the first quarter of 2015.","Residential housing demand in metro Phoenix also continues to increase. As I mentioned on our last call the increase in demand is primarily being met by multifamily development. Housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity.","The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question and it\u2019s largely dependent on the degree of strength in existing single-family home market. As you can see in the panel up the upper left, existing home prices have recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-over-year.","Recovery in prices and rents reflects a continual absorption of vacant homes and apartments in metro Phoenix. On balance we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and continued recovery. We expect each successive year in the near-term will be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement in economy conditions, APS\u2019s customer base grew 1.2% compared with the first quarter of last year. We expect this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support future population, job growth, and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West\u2019s consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015, will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustors and cost management remain important drivers. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 7, which are unchanged from our last confirmation of guidance.","Looking ahead to 2015 debt issuance, we plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in the second quarter and raise up to $325 million of additional long-term debt as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, the Parent Company had no short-term debt outstanding and APS had $45 million of commercial paper outstanding.","Included in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation are our updated capital expenditures and rate base slides. Based on our revised projections, the total CapEx for the Ocotillo modernization project is now about $500 million, which reflects a 2019 in-service date and a refined estimate from our previous total of $600 million to $700 million. Our rate base growth outlook is still 6% to 7%.","As we continue to refine our forecast, we currently expect the equity component of the capital structure for APS will be approximately 54% at the end of this year. Therefore, we will not need to issue equity to support the capital structure for this rate cycle. We now forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the earliest.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Eggers","Hey, good morning, guys.","Donald Brandt","Good morning, Daniel.","Daniel Eggers","On the equity delay, can you just walk through the math of - maybe help us to make sure I understand where the cash is coming in to let you push that out, and then what effect that may have on the math behind the rate case as far as what your equity issue is going to be?","James Hatfield","It will not affect the math on the equity issue - issuance. What we have is really the ability to finance our capital structure within the 54% equity component through the issuance of fixed income securities.","Daniel Eggers","So are you guys going to use a layer of Parent level debt to substitute as equity at the utility or is it just the underlying cash flow?","James Hatfield","The underlying cash flow. We currently project that the equity component for rate-making purposes at APS will be 54% at the end of the year, which is consistent with the capital structure in our last case.","Daniel Eggers","And then probably given the likelihood of the ideal stay out in the next case, is there - is 2017 just a place marker for a future rate case or is there some other reason why you can\u2019t issue equity then?","Donald Brandt","No. But Dan, I\u2019d - good question. I\u2019d emphasize Jim\u2019s qualifier on 2017 at the earliest. Without - no, that\u2019s not a placeholder for rate case at that point in time. And it probably would be, if there was equity in 2017 or beyond, it would be to true-up the cap structure for rate case, which conceivably could be beyond 2017, but maybe a year or two.","Daniel Eggers","Okay, got it. And then on the rate base growth at Ocotillo coming later and less, are there some other things that are filling in capital-wise we should be paying attention to?","Donald Brandt","Well, we have obviously Four Corners. As we go out into the other years, you have pickup in transmission and distribution spend for the most part.","Daniel Eggers","So, you\u2019re comfortable back-filling for that delay?","James Hatfield","Oh, yes.","Donald Brandt","Yes.","James Hatfield","Yes. We see real visibility into our rate base growth.","Daniel Eggers","Okay, very good. And then I guess one last question on kind of the net metering proposal change, the fixed charge element. What does that do to the cost attractiveness of solar if you guys were to go to that $21? I know that some of your peers in the state, the numbers they\u2019ve gone to have effectively shut down solar development. Does that - does yours have a similar impact or lesser so?","Jeffrey Guldner","Dan, this is Jeff Guldner. We obviously don\u2019t think it will. One of the things to consider with that is, when we went to the $0.70 charge that was static. And there was originally a proposal in the recommended order they were considering at the time that would step that up as installations continued, and we continued to meet the distributed energy carve-out in the RPS. And essentially, if we would have followed that, if that would have been adopted and we would have followed that, we would be at the $3 charge.","So the challenge right now is that, when you don\u2019t adjust that charge and you\u2019ve got no upfront incentives, every time there is a cost reduction on the installed cost to solar we are not able to capture that. And so we\u2019re paying too much today for the solar that\u2019s going in our territory.","Daniel Eggers","Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Donald Brandt","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Jim, just to understand the chronology of events as they take place, you filed this fixed charge increase. I guess staff, by the way, came out against it. But in any case, how do you anticipate the process playing out? You\u2019ve asked for this to be implemented by August. There is the rate design proceeding going on and then there is the rate case that you will file, I believe still next year. So can you just help me understand how all of these things sort of play out from here as you expect them to?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes. So, Ali, this is Jeff Guldner. So the grid access charge was an interim step. And so, the filing that we made was fairly limited and it was within the context of the case that was addressed in 2013. And so we stayed within that framework and went up to the level of a grid access charge that was supported in that decision, which was the $3 a lot level, all that is interim. All it does is, when that - revenues are collected under that, they go into a balancing account that reduces the amount of the cost shift, and that basically offsets about four times the cost shift that we are seeing today.","That\u2019s different from the structural rate design issues, which is a more long-term issue. So that we expect to be addressed in the rate case, and we expect there to be continued discussions around rate design, as we lead up to the rate case. And you are also seeing now more debate around the region. California has got a proposed decision out. All those are talking about the long-term ways to address the cost shifting issue. But that\u2019s very different from the grid access charge.","There is an oral argument that will be heard in our case in June, on June 12, and we\u2019ll get more visibility after that oral argument as to how that case will proceed. Staff is recommending that nothing happen in a - occur in a rate case, but we\u2019ve pointed out that what\u2019s happening is, we\u2019re continuing to see that cost shift and it\u2019s building up in front of that next rate case. And without doing something like this, you are not going to see the cost shift addressed until you come out of the next rate case.","Ali Agha","Okay. And so just to be clear, on the rate design proceeding and the timing of your rate case filing, can you just remind us what time frame we\u2019re looking at?","Jeffrey Guldner","So what we\u2019re looking at right now is, we would be beginning stakeholder outreach here in the summer, working towards filing with a 2015 test year, making the filing in mid-2016.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then separately, Jim, I know the first quarter is obviously not the biggest quarter by far for you guys, but when I look at the customer growth of 1.2% and the weather-normalized negative 0.8%, both of those numbers have come down relative to what we were trending at the end of last year, any concern with that as you\u2019re looking forward for the year?","James Hatfield","No.","Ali Agha","Okay. So, those are still anomalies in your mind.","James Hatfield","Well, I think, with more multi-family homes and then the housing, you have a longer lag between sort of permits and actual customers. So, we still believe the pipeline is robust and we\u2019ll hit our numbers.","Ali Agha","And last question - now with the later need for equity issuance, when we look at that 6% to 7% CAGR for rate base you\u2019ve laid out for us, what kind of EPS growth rate should we be thinking about that\u2019s supported with that kind of a CAGR?","James Hatfield","Well, as you know, we haven\u2019t talked specifically about earnings growth except you would expect it somewhere between rate base growth and dividend growth. So again 6% to 7%, to 5% the total would be your parameters.","Ali Agha","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. This is Mike. I\u2019m a little confused. I\u2019m looking at your fourth quarter slide deck, and I\u2019m looking at today\u2019s slide deck, and I\u2019m just looking at the capital spending levels. The - today\u2019s 2015 estimate is down $30 million or $40 million, 2016 is down almost $200 million, 2017 is up about $30 million or $40 million. How do you - how does - given that\u2019s a net decline in capital spending, how do you maintain rate base growth? I understand you\u2019re going to have growth. How do you maintain the same growth rate, I guess, or a similar growth rate?","James Hatfield","Well, 2014 dropped slightly so that\u2019s your starting point, and you have Ocotillo pushed to 2018 and 2019. So all you\u2019ve really done is changed the timing of your cash flows on a year-over-year basis, you end up at the same spot.","Michael Lapides","Meaning by 2019 you wind up at the same growth rate, but it\u2019s kind of very back-end loaded with Ocotillo. And the front end, the three-year growth rate is a lower growth rate relative to the five year?","James Hatfield","Correct.","Michael Lapides","Okay. I wanted to think about the rate case timing and cycle. When do you expect new rates to go into effect?","Jeffrey Guldner","Well, we\u2019ve sort of assumed, again, getting a rate case done within that 12-month window that we\u2019ve been able to do, that we were able to accomplish in 2011 and 2012 when we actually did it in 10.5 months.","Michael Lapides","So you would file mid-2016-ish time frame for mid-2017 rates, or something later than that?","Jeffrey Guldner","No.","Michael Lapides","Yes.","Jeffrey Guldner","That\u2019s sort of our planning assumption at the moment.","Michael Lapides","Any chance you could stay out?","Jeffrey Guldner","Well, we\u2019ll certainly look at what we earn and where allowed ROEs are. But I think one key component of 2016 is really addressing the cost shift. And so you\u2019d have to look at the pros and cons and the con would be you are just - you are not addressing the cost shift.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then, Don, just a bigger picture question about Arizona and utility regulation. If you had to look at the Commission today and some of the actions today, what do you think is different versus the last three or four years, two or three years in terms of goals, directives, focus areas for this Commission versus the last couple years?","Donald Brandt","I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a dramatic difference. I think the Commission today is focused on the current environment and creating a sustainable energy future for Arizona, and working with us and the other utilities in a constructive fashion. Times change and the Commission is adapted to it, and I think they are doing it in a very constructive way.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Don. Much appreciated.","Donald Brandt","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Chin","Hi, good morning.","Donald Brandt","Hi, Brian.","Brian Chin","Given the Tesla battery announcement last night, does it make sense for APS to propose a storage solution kind of like the successful AZ Sun program? What are some of the considerations around that? How do you think about that?","Mark Schiavoni","Brian this is Mark Schiavoni. We do have, as part of the 10-megawatt program we talked about that, we have a component in there of a little over 2 megawatts of storage that we are looking at as part of that. So we are continuing to look at the technologies, so not just solar but also battery storage and other technology that may help the grid perform in the long-term.","Brian Chin","Gotcha. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Donald Brandt","Hello.","Michael Weinstein","I was wondering if you look at the slide on PD residential applications, it\u2019s obvious that quarter-over-quarter it\u2019s a pretty large increase. But sequentially, if you look over that - since July it\u2019s been kind of the similar numbers, and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s sort of you expect it to flatten out for the rest of the year or are we going to see that number continuing to double with every month?","James Hatfield","I don\u2019t know that we could actually predict what\u2019s going to happen the rest of the year. I think we don\u2019t - certainly we certainly don\u2019t see any slowdown in residential rooftop in Arizona at this point.","Mark Schiavoni","Yes, Mark Schiavoni. I think that our application rate has gone up over time, but it does not necessarily mean complete installation down the road. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to better understand, will those applications actually turn into installations.","Michael Weinstein","All right. And in the multi-family home versus single-family home category in that chart that you have, on page 6, it looks like your prediction is for a big decline in multi-family versus single-family. I\u2019m just wondering what drives that and why do you think that\u2019s going to happen?","Jeffrey Guldner","Well, if you look at home affordability right now, you have very low interest rates and very high rents. That tells us that homebuilding will begin again, home buying will continue to go up. And I think that would echo what the local homebuilders are also saying. Traffic is up significantly, rebates have stabilized. And so we see that cycle beginning to pick up a bit.","Mark Schiavoni","Yes, I\u2019ll add, I believe we talked about it on the second quarter call, last year, in our discussions with home builders, they\u2019re predicting, and they\u2019ve got a pretty good plot, of the customer, the potential home buyers that walked away from homes and foreclosures and bankruptcy. And depending on what kind of financing they\u2019re using, they couldn\u2019t buy a home up until the point that burns off their credit rating. And they\u2019re expecting that bubble to occur in late 2015 and going on into 2016, 2017 - again, depending on whether it\u2019s conventional or FHA financing.","Michael Weinstein","And one final question. Is the - for the net metering fee increase, what percentage of the actual cost shift in your latest calculation is that? In previous filings you talked about maybe a $64 to $74 cost shift per month. I\u2019m just wondering what the latest numbers are.","James Hatfield","Yes, I mean that\u2019s essentially what you\u2019re seeing, and so you\u2019re going to continue to see the rate making cost shift be around that $65 to $70 range. And so this is going to mitigate a relatively small proportion of that. But right now, within that framework, that\u2019s the mitigation that we\u2019ve got between now and the next rate case because the additional cost shifting, if you\u2019re going to pick that up is more than likely going to be in the context of a rate design change than a rate case.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Donald Brandt","Shar.","Operator","Shar, your line is live. Perhaps, you got yourself on mute.","Shar Pourreza","Sorry about that, I have been on mute. Good morning. With the current - under the assumption that you get approval of the current fixed charge, which is still obviously materially lower than what your real fixed costs are, is there an opportunity in the upcoming rate case to adjust the decoupler, the partial decoupler to also include distributed generation and loss load?","Jeffrey Guldner","This is Jeff again. So the partial decoupler in there includes distributed energy right now. So, what we\u2019d be looking at in the next case is how do we adjust that. Our proposal would be to adjust that to pick up more of it, make sure that we\u2019re fully capturing it. Right now it doesn\u2019t pick up the full effect.","Shar Pourreza","Okay. And that\u2019s in addition to the fixed cost that you\u2019re currently requesting.","Jeffrey Guldner","Right. So, if you change the fixed cost and grid access charge, right now it just credits that account. So it credits the revenues that come under that lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, is what it\u2019s called. If you go out into future rate case, if you do rate design changes that changes the effect of the decoupler. So, if you\u2019re decoupling but you\u2019re recovering more fixed costs, your variable costs are what drives the coupling mechanism, those would be lower.","Shar Pourreza","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the 10 megawatt distributed generation program you have, can you just remind us what the waiting list is or how much it was oversubscribed?","Mark Schiavoni","This is Mark. Right now, we\u2019re in a process of looking and vetting various customers that are going to be potential for this program. If you recall, part of the program was technology and we want to look at it from an operational side, as well. We\u2019ve been going through the selection process on our feeders, which ones we want to address. We\u2019ve been starting to get in contact with customers - a little over 3,000 customers that we\u2019ve reached out to for potential subscription.","The last hurdle we have is working through our inverters and getting a UL listed inverter for this system and we expect that in the next month or so. So from an actual subscription, we\u2019re just in initial phases. We have about 3,000 we\u2019re addressing currently.","Shar Pourreza","Got it, got it. And then just on the PV application, I know it\u2019s a little preliminary but do have you the April data?","Donald Brandt","No, have not seen it yet.","Shar Pourreza","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the lines of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Don, I was wondering if I could go back to a comment you made as part of your opening comments. When you said - I believe you said - that the ultimate solution of the cost sharing between solar and non-solar customers is some type - is a broader use of a demand charge. And I was just curious what your technical capability is of that. I would assume all your industrial customers have demand meters. What percentage of your commercial customers have demand meters?","And I\u2019m assuming very few, if any, of your residential customers have demand meters since I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve had a smart meter installation program to date. Could you address that?","Donald Brandt","Yes, I actually, I\u2019ll start with the last first. We\u2019ve had one of the largest smart meter deployments in the nation on a per customer. We have all but a small fraction of our residential customers on smart meters.","Charles Fishman","Do those have demand - are you able to measure demand with those?","Donald Brandt","Yes. Metering is not an issue. And I think 99.9% of commercial customers have demand reading meters, also.","Charles Fishman","So, really, from a technical standpoint, you\u2019re ready to go, it\u2019s just getting the regulators to see the light.","Donald Brandt","Not the way I\u2019d say it, but the metering will not be an issue.","Jeffrey Guldner","Charles, we also have over 100,000 customers on really a demand charge now - residential. So, we probably have one of the largest deployment of residential demand in the country.","Donald Brandt","I believe we\u2019re one of only two utilities in the nation that had a demand rate for residential customers before recent times. I think it\u2019s like 110,000 customers are on that.","Charles Fishman","What I think your smart meter deployment was so long ago I forgot about it. You were one of the first.","Donald Brandt","I believe that\u2019s correct.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Brandt","Okay, Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Eggers","Hey, just circling back on a couple things, I guess first of all., as you think about the discussion process of stakeholders on the next rate case filing, is there going to be anything regulatory design wise that you guys are going to look to test out, if more forward-looking mechanism, more clauses? Is there anything we should be thinking about maybe getting put into the next case?","Jeffrey Guldner","Dan, this is Jeff. We always look at both what\u2019s happened around the country and what other mechanisms are working. Just remember, in some of the post test year plan adjustments and other things that the Commission staff, RUCO and others here have been very forward-looking with, have been very effective in terms of actually bringing more certainty than in some cases you would get with a future test year where you start looking at predictions. So we\u2019re able to do really well, I think, in catching those mechanisms up to plan at the end of the conclusion of a rate case. But obviously we continue to look at that. And that\u2019s part of these process with stakeholder dialogue, to see what kind of engagement we get from stakeholders on things like that.","Daniel Eggers","Okay. And then, I guess, the other question, Don, what\u2019s going on maybe in the solar market for these other territories where they\u2019ve raise the fixed charges a lot? Is it really shutting down solar, as some of the stories have said, or are people getting a little more creative?","Donald Brandt","I don\u2019t know much about other\u2019s territories other than what I read in the paper on that here locally. But, right after - shortly after the SRP decision, which shifted from, I\u2019ll say, the conventional metering protocol to more demand based, there was an article in our local paper - and Jim or Paul could shoot you the link to that - about some of the local installers who, I know from my conversations with them, knew long term the current construct was not sustainable. And they came back, and they\u2019re looking at using batteries to install in customers\u2019 homes along with solar, and to be able to shift the solar production from maybe midday, just a few hours, to cover the real peak hours, which is the issue we have.","The reality is that solar production\u2019s more towards the midday and diminishes significantly by about 4 o\u2019clock. Our actual peak and the peak in the area - so, it would be the same for a solar project - is typically in the 4:30 to 7:30 timeframe. Mark can probably add a little more to the technical side of that.","Mark Schiavoni","Yes, Don stated it correctly. With the solar installations being mostly southward facing to maximize the advantage they have over the current rates and that metering program. That\u2019s why our pilot has been so important, is to look at these 10 megawatts that we\u2019re putting on roofs. We\u2019re using westward facing to better understand our distribution system operations going forward to enable all of the technologies that we may be looking at in the future.","Daniel Eggers","What\u2019s the effect on utilization when they go from west to south, total productivity of the solar panel?","Mark Schiavoni","What everybody\u2019s heard about is the duck curve. That duck curve is lessened, and so depending on the size or how much you have in that direction. But you can gain about 20% from a production standpoint if you face it westward versus southward.","Jeffrey Guldner","But the challenge, then, is that customer, they\u2019re losing 20% of the energy production, which is the credit in that metering. And there\u2019s no price signal given to shift it to later in the day for capacity value.","Daniel Eggers","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Fallon","Hi. I just wanted to go back over the timing of the equity. Is equity off the table for the upcoming rate case and wouldn\u2019t be in play until the following rate case after that? Is that what you\u2019re saying?","Mark Schiavoni","What we\u2019re saying is, based on where we believe the rate-making capital structure will be at year end for APS, it\u2019s at approximately 34%, which is consistent with the equity of our last case. Therefore, the premise that we need to issue equity to support this capital structure has changed. Couple of factors; one is moving Ocotillo out changes our cash flows, so we don\u2019t need to issue equity until 2017 at the earliest. And then in that case, it would really not be tied to a rate case as much as it would be tied to a source of capital to maintain our rating.","Kevin Fallon","Assuming you\u2019re going to file in 2016, would 2015 be the test year?","Mark Schiavoni","Correct.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. So, for that rate case, at the end of the year you would be equal to what you\u2019ve had in the last rate case in terms of equity ratio, so you wouldn\u2019t need to issue equity to be in compliance with that if that\u2019s the same equity ratio you\u2019re going to seek?","Mark Schiavoni","Yes. That\u2019s correct.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And the other question, just in terms of weather-normalized sales, it\u2019s just been so volatile quarter-to-quarter. Could you give a little bit more color in terms of how things are going?","Mark Schiavoni","We think, we\u2019re going to hit our forecast for the year, which is slightly positive sales growth and customer growth around two. We see a pipeline certainly in the multi-family. And believe, based on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of oil prices, and talking to local builders, that there will be a pickup in activity later this year that will be reflected into - and is incorporated in our forecast.","Kevin Fallon","Has the volatility in\u2026","Mark Schiavoni","Kevin, I wasn\u2019t worried. I mean, the first quarter is a shoulder quarter. We\u2019re really going to look to second and third quarter and see is there any trends here that we need to adjust to. So, I think its wait and see in terms of the volatility.","Kevin Fallon","Do you think that there\u2019s some anomaly in terms of the weather normalization and the fact that you guys are so third quarter driven in terms of results, that that may give a little bit more volatility than the actual underlying? Is that kind of where you see things?","Mark Schiavoni","Yes, I think you always see that in the first and fourth quarters, where any sort of anomaly in weather has such a big impact on what we consider normal, that we tend to look at the second and third quarter for - as more trends than the first and fourth, which is consistent with a lot of our numbers in the first and fourth quarter.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mark Schiavoni","Thank you.","Operator","Mr. Mountain, we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Paul Mountain","Thank you. Thanks for joining us today that concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter 2014 earnings, recent developments, and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Senior Vice President of Public Policy, is also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments in our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations. And the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors in MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 9.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. My comments today will focus on our generation portfolio and the regulatory landscape in Arizona. Jim will discuss the first quarter results and update you on our economic and financial outlook.","I'll begin with our Integrated Resource Plan filed on April 1, which outlines how we plan to meet Arizona's growing energy needs over the next 15 years. Our portfolio will continue to evolve into a cleaner, more flexible generation mix driven by renewable energy, energy efficiency and natural gas, with advanced technologies making the grid smarter and adding operational flexibility.","In our resource plan, we predict that the amount of renewable energy in our portfolio will double by 2029 driven by our continued leadership in solar energy.","The Solar Electric Power Association released its annual ranking of top solar utilities earlier this week, and APS moved up one spot to number three for growth in solar megawatts during 2013. We rank among the top five utilities for solar power in four categories.","Looked at another way, our solar investments combined with the investment in Solana Generating Station, enabled by our purchase power agreement, totaled $3 billion.","The AZ Sun Program is an important piece of that story. Construction and interconnection work remains on track at the Gila Bend site. The project with an expected in-service date of mid 2014 will bring 32 megawatts of utility-scale solar online. The next two projects totaling 20 megawatts that were approved by the ACC in December, 2013 are in the early stages of development. The 10 megawatt project in the City of Phoenix was approved by the City Council recently, an important step allowing us to move forward, and we are working with Luke Air Force Base on the land and the site plan for the 10 megawatt project at Luke.","In a recent filing with the ACC, we requested approval to develop another 20 megawatts of utility-owned solar at Redhawk Power Station to meet our renewable obligation under the 2009 settlement. If approved by the ACC, the 20 megawatts would bring the total approved in the AZ Sun program to a 190 megawatts.","The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had an excellent quarter. All three units were at full power, slightly improved from the site capacity factor of 99% in last year's first quarter. The first of this year's two planned refueling outages began in Unit 2 on April 5, with all key work streams on track.","We discussed our summer preparedness plan with the commission last month. APS is well-positioned to meet customer demand this summer, despite drought conditions from a very dry winter that is expected to result in higher fire potential beginning in May.","As we do each year, we monitor the health of our substations and the wires, which includes several methods of visual observation, and we have added a new level of contingency planning where we automatically and frequently run training scenarios of how to respond to potential issues within the Western Interconnect.","Now turning to the regulatory landscape, I'll preface my comments with a brief recap. We were the first major utility to open a dialog about how to enable the continued growth of rooftop solar and still protect customers who do not want or cannot install solar on their homes. As we wrote in December, 2012, when we proposed a stakeholder conference, to explore the subject, and I quote, \"It is APS's intent that the conference results in a collaborative solution resting on three primary pillars: one, an equitable and balanced distribution of cost and benefits; two, subsidies, if any, that are transparent; and three, a sustainable means for solar to continue in Arizona.\" By raising the net metering problem early, long before there is a financial issue for our company, APS and Arizona are in a stronger position today.","The ACC and other stakeholders, including the state's Residential Utility Consumer Office or RUCO, have recognized that net metering creates an unfair cost shift causing non-solar customers to pay higher rates to maintain the electricity grid. Commissioners and staff now understand the issue as well as any public utilities commission in the nation. Our relationships with the commission and the staff and other stakeholders remain very constructive.","On April 15, we filed the first quarterly reports on the level of rooftop applications and installations. More than 2,200 residential grid type solar photovoltaic systems were installed in the first quarter bringing the total number on our system to more than 25,000. There were 1,100 applications in the first quarter compared to 1,800 in the first quarter of last year and 2,600 in the fourth quarter.","The new rules related to rooftop solar have only been in effect for a few months and have shown significant month-to-month volatility. So I believe it's too early to draw conclusions about what the pace of installations in the first quarter of this year means. The important point is that Arizona remains ahead of schedule to meet its goals for renewable energy.","While we and the commission monitor rooftop activity, a series of three workshops are being conducted this year. One on energy efficiency and that concluded in April; the second on innovative technologies, which is in process; and the third on the value and cost of distributed generation, which will get underway next week. The workshops provide a forum to collaborate with the commission, RUCO, and other stakeholders while also learning from industry experts whose opinions we value in these venues.","One point remains clear. A robust grid is needed by all customers and rate design needs to evolve to accommodate changing technologies and preserve the integrity of the system. We have confidence that Arizona regulators understand the issue and will protect the balance of customers who do not use or have access to distributed generation technologies.","APS is an early adopter of solar energy and smart grid technology, and we are an industry leader in proactively addressing regulatory and revenue challenges associated with each. I expect a productive dialog with key stakeholders over the next several months especially on the complex topic of distributed energy and net metering.","Turning to two highlights related to our people. Earlier this year, we announced several internal organizational changes to expand the experience of key executives and transfer knowledge between critical roles. These changes continue to build our bench strength and drive efficiencies throughout the organization.","I am also proud to share that APS was selected as a finalist for the 2014 Secretary of Defense Employers Support Freedom Award, generally known as the Freedom Award. This award is the United States Department of Defense's highest honor for employers and recognizes companies that provide extraordinary support to their National Guard and Reserve employees. APS is among 30 finalists for the award and made the cut from a pool of more than 2,800 nominated organizations.","Let me conclude with a personal observation about Arizona's economy. Jim will walk you through several economic indicators which continue to move in a positive direction. More broadly though, there is a new sense of momentum among the business community here in Arizona. Forbes Magazine has ranked Arizona as the number one state for expected job growth over the next five years, beating out Texas for the top spot. Forbes also ranked Phoenix the third fastest growing city in America.","I spent the last few weeks talking about the economy with business leaders across the state and I'm struck by the optimism and enthusiasm I've encountered. That's an economic indicator that's not easily quantified, but important nonetheless. The fact remains that Arizona is an outstanding place to live and conduct business.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on Slide 4. I'll begin with a review of our first quarter results including earnings and the primary variances from last year's first quarter, followed by an update on the Arizona economy, and I'll conclude with a review of our financial outlook.","Slide 5 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings, which are the same this quarter. As usual, my comments will refer to ongoing earnings. For the first quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $16 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $24 million, or $0.22 per share, for the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the effects of weather, year-over-year earnings were actually up $0.05 per share in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of 2013.","Slide 6 outlines the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Lower operations and maintenance expenses added $0.09 per share largely driven by lower employee benefit cost including the favorable impact from pension is expected to benefit each quarter this year.","Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share primarily due to additional plant and service. Higher taxes other than income taxes reduced earnings by $0.02 per share due to higher property tax rates. The net impact of other items, including higher interest expense, decreased earnings by $0.03 per share.","A decrease in our gross margin reduced earnings by $0.09 per share, compared with the prior year's first quarter period. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these deferrals as there was no net impact on the first quarter of 2014 results.","Turing to Slide 7 and the components of the net decrease of $0.09 in our gross margin, the main components of this were as follows. The lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.02 per share, which, as designed, offset some of the impact from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy. Higher usage by APS's customers compared to the first quarter a year ago increased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation, and distributed generation, were up 0.6% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013.","The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased gross margin by $0.04 per share including the benefit of the two Arizona Sun projects that went to service at the end of 2013. Lower transmission revenue decreased earnings by $0.03 per share due to a prior period true up recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","We have included a couple of slides in the appendix that outline how the TCA works in a bit more detail.","As I referenced earlier, the effects of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.13 per share. This year's first quarter was milder or less favorable than normal, while the first quarter of 2013 was cooler or more favorable than normal. In the first quarter of this year, heating degree days were 51% below normal and 61% lower than the comparable quarter a year ago.","Beginning on Slide 8 is a look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Economic growth in Arizona continued its overall improvement in the first quarter of 2014 consistent with the four prior quarters, although the growth we're getting modest as has been the case for the last 18 months or so.","Vacant housing in Phoenix Metro has fallen by more than half since its peak in early 2010 and is at its lowest level in six years. Housing prices have responded. On the upper left-hand side of Slide 8 you can see that prices on existing home sales are 14% higher than they were a year ago and up 44% from the bottom of the market in mid-2011. Improved home values are providing more support to new home construction. Additionally, vacancy rates have fallen in all non-residential categories, as you can see in the upper right of Slide 8.","The lower left hand side of slide eight shows that permits for new single family homes increased 8% in 2013 over 2012 and more than 75% from the low point in early 2011. Despite the mild start this year in housing permit activity, we expect to see continued permit growth as the Arizona economy continues to improve. Overall, stable activity plus business investment in the region has led to 6% gain in construction jobs in just last year alone, which is supporting total non-farm job growth, as seen on the lower right hand side of Slide 8.","On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in all economic indicators, which paint a picture of continued state of recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely that each successive year in the near-term will be stronger as we go forward.","Reflecting the steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.3% compared with the first quarter last year. Looking at the next several years, we expect annual customer growth to average about 2.5% for 2014 through 2016 with higher growth rates at the end of the period than in near-term for the reasons I just discussed. This outlook is depicted on Slide 9.","Additionally, we expect our annual weather-normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to increase by about 1% on average from 2014 through 2016, primarily due to improving customer growth being partially offset by our customer programs and conservation.","The headwinds from the overgrown housing market and associated construction job losses are largely behind us and the state is poised to embark on its next phase of sustained growth. This resurgence in growth is expected over the next few years. True to form, Arizona's population rate is growing at double the national average. The exact timing and final path of the growth trajectory depends on many factors, but the roots of our future growth are well-anchored in fundamentals.","On Slide 10, I have some statistics to support the comments Don made on the growth prospect in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Recently, there have been over 8,000 new jobs announced due to near-term anticipated expansions of current facilities or consolidation of existing operations to Phoenix. These are from the likes of USAA, Luke Air Force Base, Mayo Clinic, and State Farm Insurance.","With our recent filing and focus on distributed energy, we have included some additional data on Slide 11 to help better illustrate the impact of DE. As Don mentioned, the current impact of distributed energy on our gross margin is small. As you can see in grey on the slide, distributed generation is impacting gross margins by approximately 0.5%.","Finally, I'll review our financial outlook and earnings guidance. In terms of our recent financings on May 1, APS purchased the Maricopa County 2009 Series A, D, and E Pollution Control Bonds totaling $100 million. We expect to remarket these bonds within the next 12 months. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had $10 million of commercial paper outstanding and APS had no short-term debt outstanding.","In March, we received a procedural order related to the application and approval of the Four Corners rate rider. Hearings are scheduled to begin in August with a final decision expected by year-end. The complete ALJ procedural schedule is included in the appendix to our slides. Even though the Four Corners rate rider is now expected later than we originally assumed, we continue to expect that Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2014 will be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per share. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2014 guidance is included on Slide 13, which are mostly unchanged.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Greg Jordan with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Good. Two questions as it relates to growth. So the customer growth was 1.3% in the quarter and that was good. You're at 0.6% sales growth, and I see that that was really led by residential?","Don Brandt","Yes.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","The delta between customer growth and sales growth is quite small on overall basis; it's 70 bps. You guys have told us to sort of model over time more like 150 basis point spread between customer growth and sales growth due to energy efficiency, demand response, and DG. Why was it so tight in the quarter or should we not look at it on a quarterly basis, but on an annual basis because you get more energy efficiency -- you get more energy conservation in the summer?","Jim Hatfield","Greg, I wouldn't look at the first quarter and try to draw any conclusions based on the year. Remember, first quarter, we had low sales in total -- abnormally in the weather like we had in the fourth quarter, which sometimes skews results. I would look at it over the course of the year.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. And my second question is, in talking to my housing analyst here at ISI that a slowdown in new housing purchases in the Southwest over the winter, it could cause you to have some concern about the longer-term growth trends. Can you give us some feedback on what you're hearing from developers in your service territory?","Don Brandt","Greg, we're getting pretty positive signals from the developers. They've had labor shortages and, as I've mentioned in our previous calls, they have actually built some trade schools to train crafts labor for the construction, but if you fly in and out of Phoenix, you'll see there is a fair amount of dirt moving subdivision development. And that's echoed by what the homebuilders are telling us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","So I suppose first question out of the gate, on the waiver or potential waiver to delay the rate case, where you stand on that? Do you anticipate filing that in the next couple months here?","Jeff Guldner","Hey, Julien. This is Jeff Guldner. We haven't made a determination on how we'll move forward with that at this point. So we're focused right now on moving into the workshops and having some of the dialog and the value at DG and the technology innovation workshops.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","What would be the puts and takes, if you will, in terms of making your decision to do so or not?","Jeff Guldner","You only just need to look at how some of the discussion will evolve. So, obviously, we expect that in the value DG workshop there is going to be some discussion around rate design issues.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. And I suppose just following up on that, in terms of the DG issue here, ultimately, how do you think about that playing out relative to the rate case and on being a separate track? Is that something that could be moving forward, say, late this year or early next on a separate timeline, or how are you thinking about that for the time being, just to get an update?","Jeff Guldner","Yes, I think we certainly see value in having the discussion around the rate design issues, which are broader than just APS. So that's going to involve other utilities. And you would have to implement anything like that in a rate case, so there is probably several paths forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","But to the extent to which the DG issues were broader than just you and obviously just your rate design issues, it -- would that ultimately be a separate docket just to be clear?","Don Brandt","I don't know whether it would be separate or not.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. And then lastly, in terms of the Four Corners development, can you quantify a little bit what the delay means in terms of your numbers?","Jim Hatfield","Well Four Corners is slightly less than $0.01 amounts delay, so somewhere around $0.04, $0.05 for us, but we have that incorporated in our guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Hey, Jim, to be clear, if I heard you right, as you mentioned, the delay in Four Corners, I've done the math, it's about $0.05. Are you specifically seeing whether it was the pension cost that you referred to in your opening remarks? Are there specific benefits or offsets that you're seeing that's kind of neutralizing it out there or should we think you're still in the range, but there may be some headwind for not having it done on time --coming in on time?","Jim Hatfield","Well we've factored into the range of possible outcomes both the delay and Four Corners, and we had a pretty good view that pension and OPEB would be down this year over last year. So we're still -- the range is good and we try to incorporate probability risks sort of each of these factors. So it hasn't changed my outlook on the guidance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","Okay. But to be clear, there's been no specific offsets that you could point to us to say this came in better than what you may have budgeted originally?","Jim Hatfield","No. I think it's just been steady cost control as you see in the first quarter.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","Also, on the AZ Sun program, where is the commission right now on its thinking on the final 30 megawatts? I know there were some talks that maybe that's not required any more. If you just give us an update on that and when that is supposed to be resolved.","Don Brandt","","Well, if you remember, last year the commission approved another 20 megawatts, 10 megawatts for City of Phoenix, 10 megawatts for Luke, and said when you come back for your 2014-2015 filing, we'll see how your penetration of rooftop and load and the need. We filed for 20 of that 30, and we're waiting the commission approval on it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","So this process will clarify the thinking whether that's needed or not basically?","Don Brandt","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And my last question in terms of the longer term growth outlook there, I know you added this chart in there showing the small DG component. Is it still fair to say rate-based growth should still be kind of the key driver in terms of benchmarking EPS growth? Are you still seeing that relationship as is?","Don Brandt","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed with your question.","Kit Konolige - BGC","","I just wanted to ask about the decline in O&M year-over-year. Could you guys go into a little bit what that is; pension, OPEB, et cetera?","Jim Hatfield","A lot of it is pension, OPEB and other employee benefit costs. And certainly, if I look at the business' cost controls, sometime in the quarter that expenses are incurred, but it's just a continuation of our ongoing program including the enterprise process improvement initiative, which is looking to streamline processes and document everything that we do.","Kit Konolige - BGC","And how should we think about, say, year-over-year changes in O&M going forward or is that something that we'd have to look at in the context of the next rate case?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I would say two things on that, Kit. One is our stated goal is to keep O&M basically flat year-over-year or certainly as we move out in the outer years less than or equal to the growth in kilowatt hour sales. And I think we're not going to change how we spend and run the business just because we have a rate case. So we'll continue to be focused on cost, be as efficient as possible, which ultimately lowers cost to customers, which is a good thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I want to go back to Greg's questions a little earlier, just kind of about the housing growth outlook and that sort of stuff. With inventories down at lowest point, I guess, in more than six years, and permits starting to come back, how should we think about the rate of permitting and the conversion of permitting to new home construction to help support that 2.5% customer growth rate? What is the lag between permits moving and houses getting built, and then what is the quantum of homes that we need to start getting added to the system?","Jim Hatfield","Well, typically, you see anywhere from 12 to 24-month delay in permitting to home construction. And, of course, there is anomalies in that, and it could be longer, but we see, and Moody's projects around 25,000 permits this year, which is going to relate to the customer growth of about 2%, 2.5% over the next three years. So we'll see permits begin to accelerate once -- as Don alluded to, they are getting skilled craft trained and you'll see permits pick up and growth will follow.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","So is there enough in queue when you guys look at or talk to the builders the things are getting built to support the 2.5% number this year or is it more like this year is going to be kind of at this 1% and 1.5% level and then we'll think about 2015 and 2016 being 2.5%, 3.5% type of numbers?","Jim Hatfield","Well 2.5% will be the three-year average, and it will be accelerated coming out of the -- in 2016. So you'll see growth somewhere around 2% or so this year and it will be accelerating through that to average 2.5%, so. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And then I guess one of the things we'd heard from our homebuilding analysts is there is talk of more of these homes being built with the option of solar being included with construction. When you guys talk to the developers, what rate of absorption are they seeing and hearing as far as people opting for solar to be built on the house at construction?","Don Brandt","There's a few developments, Dan, that kind of specialize in that, I guess is the word I'd use, the majority do not (inaudible) --","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","That hasn't?","Don Brandt","What the percentages of those that are building a home are electing to go solar or not.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And Don, is there talk or are there conversations about prospectively expanding the renewable mandate in Arizona where you could prospect, then, eventually expand Arizona Sun and that sort of stuff?","Don Brandt","At this time, I don't believe we've got any substantive discussions going on in that regard.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And I guess one last question from me, system performance level. As the solar stake is increasing, are you seeing any more volatility kind of in the daily dispatch profile or the requirements on your peaking ramps as far as when solar is on and off? And how is that changing as Ocotillo, the need for new physical generation?","Don Brandt","We are clearly seeing that. And that's looking forward, we expect more of it. And that's one of the driving factors behind Ocotillo. In the next few years, Ocotillo is going to be the majority of that expenditure in addition to the generating sources. It'd be adaptations on the distribution system.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","And the Ocotillo timing, when you guys model out works with kind of the timing, does the solar share takes greater impact?","Jim Hatfield","Well, Ocotillo should be finished in 2018, and the majority of the spend will be in 2017 and 2018.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","But you guys are okay from a system performance level?","Jim Hatfield","Oh, yes.","Don Brandt","Oh, yes.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Jim Hatfield","And lot of the solar is spread out across the system, so that has an impact as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Can you talk through dividend growth? You've got this 4% target over the long-term. What do you need to see to get more aggressive when it comes to dividend growth than 4%?","Jim Hatfield","Well, obviously, we're targeting average of around 4%. And we'd have to see clear path to rate-based growth greater than 6% or 7% we're seeing now to give us confidence to sort of move beyond what we're seeing right now. Our payout ratio continues to be in the low 60, so we haven't a lot of flexibility moving forward.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","And then on equity, Jim, what have you said about when the earliest you would need to issue equity is?","Jim Hatfield","Not until 2016.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","2016.","Jim Hatfield","At the earliest.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","And then finally, there has been some increased M&A activity in the Southwest and the industry in general. Can you just comment in terms of your thoughts on whether you think there's value that can be created from regional consolidation?","Don Brandt","That's pure speculation, Neil.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","","Just going back to the question about how you think about the next rate case, I understand from one of your prior answers that much of it depends on how events unfold over the remainder of this year, for example, the DG workshop. Can you give a little bit more color on what are some of the factors in the upcoming workshop, for example, or discussions around DG that might help swing you in one direction or another with regards to do we pursue a more delimited rate setting style rate case or a more full-blown rate case? I mean, some of the factors I'm thinking of could be whether the DG cost numbers end up coming out higher or lower out of the workshop, whether there is a degree of unanimity among the different regulated utilities in the state, whether the relationship and the tone among different stakeholders ends up being a little bit less acrimonious than it has been in the past. Can you just walk us through some of the factors that you're thinking of that might help you ultimately come to the right decision on the next rate case?","Jeff Guldner","Yes, Brian, this is Jeff. I think some of the ones that you just outlined are good, are right on target with that. I mean, what I think you're going to see certainly is some discussion in the value of DG workshop around what you think about solar valuation, the valuation of rooftop solar, but I think there is also going to be some discussion around how that pairs up with the value of the grid. And that's going to be a broader discussion, obviously, than just APS. So we'll have other utilities that are in there. And I think it's going to be difficult to have that kind of discussion without ultimately looking at some of the other aspects around rate design. And so, as that unfolds, I think we'll be able to see a little bit more about what that dialog looks like, what the other utilities are thinking.","We also like the opportunity here in that from a number of different industry experts from around the country. That's one of the things that the commission has done I think a nice job in lining up. Folks are going to provide commentary during those workshops. So those are just going to start next week. We'll go in and see how those progress, and obviously that will inform some of our decision making.","Brian Chin - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And then if you could remind us of the timeline of the workshop, and then roughly sort of the general timeframe under which we're more likely to see public commentary from you about how you wish to proceed in the next rate case?","Don Brandt","The workshops, the value DG workshops start on May 7. I think there is another one that's been scheduled in June. There isn't really a schedule beyond that. So it may take -- there may be some additional workshops that follow from that. We also have overlaying that separate, but probably interrelated in some ways, the innovation and technology workshops; another one of those is coming in late May. And so as we work through those probably and obviously later in the year where we see kind of how that looks then from a longer term regulatory perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Jim, just your equity comment. Is that no equity until 2016 or through 2016?","Jim Hatfield","No equity until at least 2016.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And just as far as the O&M, we're $0.09 ahead here. Your full year outlook is to be flat or up slightly. I guess the implication is that we're going to see some heavy O&M later in the year?","Jim Hatfield","Yes, a lot of that's timing, especially as it relates to generation overhauls. And just some O&M sort of delayed into later in the year. So I wouldn't say it's going to be heavy, but pension and OPEB is going to be down in every quarter, we know that.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And that's baked into your flat assumption?","Jim Hatfield","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Couple of questions. Just first, these workshops, are they going to be webcast so that we can listen in? Do you know?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","And Don, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the April 15 filing you made and kind of highlighted the fact that the adds year-to-date are less than a year ago and was certainly less than Q4, but then you also said don't read too much into that yet. Could you just maybe give a little color on that commentary, and why we shouldn't read too much into that yet? ","Don Brandt","Well if you look back two or three years, Steve, the volatility from one month of, say, February of this year versus last year versus the year before that, it's a pattern. If you just look at a few months at a time, it doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason to it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay.","Don Brandt","Draw your own conclusions, but when I look back over several years of history, one could get out on a limb and prove themselves wrong in another few months.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Second question is related to the upcoming ACC elections. Has there been kind of any people that have clarity on who is going to be running? And I'm curious if the solar issue has started coming up at all from a common election standpoint?","Don Brandt","To answer to your last one first, so far it has not and we're sort of in the not early stages, but many of the candidates are still gathering the signatures and the other information data that's required for them to be a candidate in the clean elections process and for the primaries.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. Just two spots that are up, if I recall? ","Don Brandt","That's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","","And then, lastly, I think there's this ruling by the Department of Revenue to put a property tax on solar leases. Has that been finalized and has that occurred and maybe is that having any impact on some of these additions?","Don Brandt","Well, to clarify the issue, the statute that requires generating assets that you should not link an entity is not using the generation themselves, i.e., rooftop solar under lease arrangement versus a homeowner that outright owns his generation. And it's the same law applies to our solar properties, has been on the books for years. These solar lease companies were not paying that tax. Last year about this time, the Arizona Department of Revenue issued a ruling that they were required to pay it. It's pretty clear when you look at the law.","In the legislature this last session they were, they being these solar lease entities, running or attempting to run legislation to exempt themselves from that tax; and the tax would be on them, not on the homeowner. And they weren't very successful at it. And, say, early or midstream in that process they turned on that APS was trying to raise property taxes on solar customers, and just within the last -- the legislature ended their session last week, and just recently as of yesterday, they were posting on some of their websites an attack on our governor and that her administration, I presume by that they mean the department of revenue, was applying this tax.","The facts are the tax has been on the books as a statue for years, and they weren't paying it. Now they're being required to comply. That's sort of where we are at right now, if that answers your question.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Yes. No, thanks for clarifying that. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Don Brandt","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First one was just on the quarterly DG filings. To the extent there's an acceleration or a deceleration in applications, do you expect the commission to change some of those fixed charges that they've implemented?","Jeff Guldner","Rajeev, this is Jeff. I don't know. I think that they're going to monitor them, but don't anticipate right now any action certainly in the near-term.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","And then just another question on the rate case. What's the test year that you're going to use?","Jeff Guldner","So under the current framework we have, we'd be looking at 2014 test year. And so some of the discussions that have happened earlier is whether that's the test year we'd move forward with or would we move forward potentially with a different test year. To do that, we'd have to have some change in the existing regulatory framework we have.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And then just based on the guidance you provided for the year, what's the earned ROE from a regulatory standpoint that you're forecasting?","Jim Hatfield","Well, it's going to be in excess of 9.5% and short of 10%.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And so the rate ask or the revenue ask doesn't seem like it's going to be a very big number is kind of the takeaway?","Jim Hatfield","We have $1 billion spend. So it will be what it is when we ultimately get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Most of my questions have been answered, but just sort of focusing back on Slide 11 and the customer energy efficiency. I was just wondering how much of that do you guys estimate is because of utility programs, things you guys are doing versus just sort of general trends I guess in consumer behavior?","Jim Hatfield","Well, in that regard, Paul, it's sort of hard to nail a number. We can track what CFLs we handout and things of that nature. And we do think most of the energy efficiency is in lighting for the most part. What we really don't know is what our customers doing outside of any incentives we give and, then, how much is just conservation on the part of homeowners in sort of an uncertain world. We do know that EE is going to continue to be a impact as everything in it that is manufactured today is more efficient than what it replaces including building, footprints and so on, so. But that's no data, data I can turn to to support how much is ours and how much is customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then just sort of following on Steve's question about the trends in installations, one of the things, I guess, one might think could happen is that due to a change in pricing or what have you, with the charge and what have you, that there might have been an acceleration of activity in the fourth quarter. And as time goes on that might get more normal. In other words, you might see sort of a cannibalization of sort of the first quarter stuff or being brought in, I guess, a little bit earlier into the fourth quarter.","I'm just wondering when we look at the trend throughout the quarter or as much data as you have through April or what have you, do you see -- and I know it's volatile and I completely understand what you guys are talking about, but do you see a trend in solar installations that are trending upwards as the months go on or is it really just too hard to tell?","Jeff Guldner","Paul, this is Jeff. One of the, I think, the points you made about the change in the policy that occurred at the end of December, what we saw was a significantly higher application rate in December of folks trying to get in before that change occurred. So we know that was driving the numbers to be very high in December. The challenge to try to be with only four months essentially of data to say what's the long-term trend is you've got, among other things, that change as well as things like we don't have an upfront cash incentive right now driving folks in early in the application process to get their installations in. And so we want to make sure we're looking at that trend of data to ensure we see enough of those different variables to get a handle on what the overall long-term trend is. So I think it's too early right now to really tell.","Operator","Question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Yes, if I can just ask a couple of more quick questions on Slide 11, and I might be reading more into this or trying to get more out of this chart than I should, but if I look at the distributed energy portion of those three bars, it looks like it's getting smaller. And yet I realize you said it's a little early to make any conclusions from this monthly charge. Am I reading too much into that?","Jim Hatfield","Well I think the offsetting factor there is you get increasing sales before EE and DE continuing to rise and we see DE continuing to rise, but it's a smaller percentage of the overall total.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","And so, on the box on the right, you have last year, let's say, little over 28,000 gigawatt hours of total retail sales, and what you're saying is the 60 gigawatt hours are -- is that just for one year or is that cumulative?","Jim Hatfield","Just one year.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","That's one year. Okay, that's what I thought. Okay. That was it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","This wasn't actually going to be my initial question, but just back on what Paul Patterson was asking. I would think it's more of the cash incentives that's having the difference, first of the $5 a month fixed charge, is that kind of fair, would you agree?","Jeff Guldner","In terms of the applications coming down?","Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","Yes. I mean I can't imagine $5 making a big difference?","Jeff Guldner","That's probably, I mean, I think that's our assessment is that there is a change in just the logistics of how you go through the process that's likely making it difficult to look at year-over-year comparisons, when in the year before you had upfront cash incentives that folks were trying to get.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","Right. Yes, because $5 I can't see affecting consumers' decisions. Okay. So then kind of back to what Brian Chin was talking about. So just to understand the process for the rest of the year, we're going to have these workshops where the various stakeholders will discuss their views, obviously net metering being the issue in getting that $5 charge increased to a more reasonable level. And then once the workshops are done, you really get in, and just tell me if I'm right or wrong on this, you really get into the point of not only whether you file for a rate increase or not a rate increase, which you probably won't do, but really whether the commission is going to move ahead in trying to deal with the net metering issue and raising that amount before the end of the year. Is that correct?","Jeff Guldner","I think the workshops are broader than that. So when you look at just on the value of distributed generation workshop, the $5 charge was something that was adopted in our proceeding that ended last year. This is, I think, going to be a broad discussion of just how do you look at distributed generation in general and bring in again other utilities. And so, it's a little difficult to predict at this point how that's going to unfold, but again, what we're looking forward to is having experts around the country coming in and sharing their perspectives, not just on the value, we think not just on the value of distributed generation but also on how you look at the value of the grid, and the services that we're providing. And so since those haven't even started yet, it's a little hard to tell how that's going to evolve, but obviously, that's what we're looking for to next.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","And is this scenario possible that net metering charge gets altered as a result of these workshops?","Jeff Guldner","I don't think it's as a result of these --","Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","I don't mean a direct result, wherein you go from workshop to a change in net metering charge, but where the workshops lead to a commission docket that ultimately would lead to that?","Jim Hatfield","Well, Andy, I don't think we have any expectations. We said here today that that workshop is going to alter that charge. And remember, that charge has offset the CLFTR. So it would not have an impact on EPS.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital Advisors","I know, I understand that. But I guess, the kind of the way I kind of viewed your stock performance recently, it seems that most of the underperformance has to do with solar penetration\/net metering and that can continue on. And you look at the state of California, they're probably going to come up with a net metering charge in the $20 range, $25 range. And I think if there was a more fair charge or more balanced charge between solely users and utility that may make a difference in people's perception of your long-term prospects. So, that's kind of what I'm getting at. And I guess from, I don't know, talking to some people down in Arizona who maybe are in the position to make decisions, it seems that there's at least with some a desire to get a more equitable balance between solar, and the company, or the utilities I should say. So that was kind of the line of questioning where I would see if we could get something done this year, but I understand these need to get through the workshops and all that first.","Jim Hatfield","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mountain for closing comments.","Paul Mountain","Thanks, Christine. That concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Guldner; and our Chief Administrative Officer, Jim Hatfield. Ted Geisler, CFO; Daniel Froetscher, APS' President and COO; and Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Our 2019 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through February 28.","I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Guldner","Thanks, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I review our 2019 achievements and provide operating and regulatory updates, I want to look forward to the future and share more information about our focus areas and priorities. Our strategy is anchored by four concepts that align with industry trends and shape the way we do business. Those concepts can most simply be stated as clean, affordable, reliable and customer-focused.","Let me talk briefly about each one. Clean is about decarbonizing our generation mix with our new goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050. Affordable is planning and operating our business to maintain reasonable electricity prices for the people, businesses and communities we serve. Reliable means serving our customers with dependable power safely and efficiently. And customer-focused is about developing new solutions, products and services to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers. With these in mind, we created a long-term plan and targets to track our progress along the way.","First, we recently announced our goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free electricity to customers by 2050. This goal includes a near-term target of 65% clean energy with 45% coming from renewables by 2030 and a commitment to exit coal by 2031. Importantly, our plan includes flexibility to ensure that we're able to execute in a way that maintains affordability for customers. As Jim will discuss, we expect this plan will require considerable capital investment. We believe a carbon-free future as possible while keeping customer rates over time at or below the rate of inflation with timely recovery of clean energy investments.","To support the affordability of our transition to a carbon-free resource mix, we will have a sharp focus on economic development in Arizona. Growing our customer base, allocates these costs across more customers, which helps keep rates affordable and increase the shareholder value by growing our Company. Supporting an internal culture focused on reducing costs and maintaining a financially strong company to access low cost capital are also key in delivering a 100% clean energy future affordably.","In the area of reliability, we believe putting the responsibility on the utility to maintain high-performing well-run resources is important. In pursuit of our clean energy plan, we will acquire resources that appropriately balance reliability, cost and flexibility for our customers. This includes both owning new resources and considering supplemental generation from purchase power as appropriate.","Our fourth concept reinforces that customers are at the core of what we do every day. We're committed to providing options that make it easier to do business with us. We plan to continue developing innovative programs that connect customers with advanced technologies to help manage their bill. In addition, we'll be convening an advisory panel of customers to gain a deeper understanding of the customer experience through individual perspective, so a little design basis thinking. As we work to execute in all these strategic areas, we'll focus on strengthening our relationships with stakeholders.","Going forward, we plan to continue working collaboratively with those who have vested interest in Arizona's future and our Company's role as the state's largest electricity provider. For our regulators, we are committed to maintaining an open dialog, listening and ensuring transparency. We have a lot of important work ahead of us, and we'll be sharing information about our progress as we advance through the year. And while I'm excited about our future opportunities, I also want to recognize our team and the hard work completed last year.","We finished 2019 with our best-ever reliability performance, if you exclude outages from voluntary proactive fire mitigation efforts, and Palo Verde once again achieved a capacity factor above 90%. Our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050 is new, but our efforts to move toward a cleaner energy mix are not. In 2019, we maintained our environmental, social and governance A rating from MSCI, and we were ranked in the electric utility sectors top quartile by Sustainalytics.","Notably, APS was one of 10 American companies and the only U.S. utility to make CDP's A List for both climate change and water security in 2019. And we accomplished all this while reducing the average residential bill by 7.8% or $11.68 on average since January of 2018 due primarily to savings from federal tax reform and operating cost savings that have been passed on to customers.","2019 was also a busy year for our state regulatory team. Some of the work that we began in 2019 will continue this year. Key dockets for 2020 include our rate case, retail choice, disconnection rules and modifications to the commission's energy rules. A number of workshops have already been scheduled to discuss these topics, and you can find a list of key dates in the appendix to our slides. The next milestone in our rate case proceeding is May 20, the date the commission staff and other interveners file testimony. However, I would note that commission staff has indicated that they may need an extension to watch that proceeding.","Outside of our regulated operations, our Bright Canyon subsidiary acquired minority equity stakes in two wind farms being developed by Tenaska. The 242 megawatt Clear Creek wind farm in Missouri and the 250 megawatt Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota. We expect these wind farms to be operational in Q1 and Q4 of this year, respectively. Our objective with these investments is to gain experience in the construction, ownership and operation of wind assets, and to partner with a proven developer in Tenaska.","Our overall strategy with Bright Canyon is to develop, own, operate and acquire infrastructure within the electric energy industry. Investments in renewables, electric transmission and microgrids represent some of the opportunities that Bright Canyon has been evaluating, and I want to emphasize that these are close adjacencies. We will continue to pursue attractive growth opportunities consistent with our core strength. We have ambitious goals and a talented team to achieve them. At the officer level, I recently made changes to our organizational structure that better aligns our experience and talent to our strategic focus areas and to strengthen our succession pipeline.","I'm excited about our future, all the possibilities and the team I have the privilege of working with. Before I turn it over to Jim for a financial discussion, I want to do three quick shoutouts. First, to the team at Palo Verde for their work on a short notice outage at Unit 3 in getting the necessary work done safely and the unit back online ahead of schedule. And second, to our T&D Engineering and Construction team for their outstanding work on the new substations associated with the Microsoft datacenter build out. And third, to the Arizona State Sun Devils for their win last night over 14 Oregon.","So Jim, go ahead and take it away.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Jeff, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019. Before I review the details of our 2019 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter, which can be found on Slide 3. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we earned $0.57 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our results were largely impacted by a one-time tax refund to customers related to the TEAM III refund and lower adjusted O&M expenses.","We also experienced another quarter of mild weather. For the full-year 2019, we earned $4.77 per share compared to $4.54 per share in 2018. 2019 earnings reflect our growing infrastructure to support the strong Phoenix economy and 2% customer growth. Other key items for 2019 was negative weather, which decreased gross margin by $37 million or $0.25 per share. The negative impact was more than offset by lower O&M. Year-over-year lower adjusted O&M expense increased earnings $0.52 per share, primarily driven by lower planned outage expenses and lower public outreach costs at the parent level.","As I mentioned last quarter, we are committed to enhancing our customer and shareholder value through cost management. The implementation of Lean Sigma will be the mechanism that allows us to improve the customer and employee experience while eliminating waste. As a result of our cost management efforts, we made great strides in reducing O&M in 2019, allowing us to reach the low end of our original guidance range, despite the mildest Metro Phoenix cooling season on 10 years. We expect to continue our cost savings efforts by reducing O&M approximately $20 million in 2020.","As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we are on a path to deliver 100% clean carbon-free electricity. Part of that plan includes ending our use of coal-fired generation seven years earlier than previously projected. As a result, the reduction in fuel costs as we use less fossil fuels and more renewables will be a source of cost savings to our customers in the future. Our journey to a carbon-free future will require intelligent investments in renewable resources and developing technologies.","As you can see on Slide 14, we rolled forward our capex forecast for one year. Our 2022 capex forecast reflects nearly $800 million of investment related to new clean generation resources and reflects our conservative mix of owned resources. While we don't know the exact mix of ownership versus purchase power at this point, we will need an appropriate mix to ensure long-term value and reliability for customers. That said, we believe there is potential upside to our capital investments, especially as we get past 2022.","As Jeff alluded to, customer affordability will be top of mind. We would expect customer rates to increase no more than the rate of inflation over time. In terms of financing our clean energy future, we would expect that we will issue equity sometime after 2020. While the exact amount has not yet been determined, we would expect the amount to be in the $300 million to $400 million range. The timing of the offering around the next rate case minimizes dilution and is ultimately accretive for our shareholders. Our financial health, including a solid equity layer, will continue to provide our customers the benefits of low-cost access to capital and competitive returns to our shareholders.","In 2020, we expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million that Pinnacle West. Overall liquidity remain strong. In the fourth quarter, APS issued $300 million of new 30-year unsecured debt at 3.5%. We used the proceeds to repay commercial paper and to fund a $100 million of our $250 million par value 2.2% notes which matured in mid-January. At the end of the fourth quarter, Pinnacle West had a $115 million of short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term debt outstanding.","Due to the tax benefits associated with both the TEAM Phase II and Phase III and optimized use of income tax incentives, our effective tax rate for 2019 was a negative 2.9%. We anticipate an effective tax rate in 2020 of 14%. Continued use of income tax incentives, including tax credits associated with clean generation investments, will reduce cash taxes in the year projects -- our projects are placed in service.","A quick note on pension. The funded status of our pension remains healthy at 97% as of year-end 2019. This is due to strong portfolio returns during 2019, continued contributions and the continued success of our liability-driven investment strategy, which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status. 2019 was a great year for economic development in our service territory. We saw high-profile data centers and manufacturing plants break ground in the West Valley. We successfully connected two new data centers to our power grid included in the Microsoft data center and begin prep work to add an additional six data center feeds in 2020.","In addition to growth from the commercial sector, Arizona is benefiting from residential population growth. According to a December 2019 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, Arizona ranked third in population growth behind Texas and Florida. Arizona's population grew by approximately 120,000 people between July 2018 and July 2019. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue in response to the economic trends in our service territory.","The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. In 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.9% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 9.6% and manufacturing employment increased by 5.2%. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Arizona's job growth ranked second in the nation in 2019. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. In 2020, we expect a total of 31,100 housing permits, driven by both single-family and multifamily permits.","We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated earnings for 2020 to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance can be found on Slide 6 and 7.","In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains intact at 6% to 7% and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% in 2020. The new year is off to a great start with the announcement of our bold clean energy plan, coupled with organic growth in our service territory. We are excited to embark on a path that will help create a healthy and prosperous Arizona that benefits our customers, communities and shareholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. ","Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good morning guys. Could you talk about the -- you mentioned that there would be potentially some upside after 2022 in the capital plan as a result of your carbon reduction and greenhouse gas goals trying to achieve that going forward. Is there any way -- maybe we could kind of frame that up and talk about some more of the specific opportunities you see ahead, particularly maybe in battery storage or in generation?","Jeff Guldner","Well, on average between now and to hit the interim target at 2030, we're going to need at least 300 megawatts of battery storage and 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts of other resources to meet that goal. And so, ultimately you have some competing plans out there all toward green and clean, but at different dates and want to see exactly how it plays out. But we're being very conservative in how we think about our capex budgets at this point.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And I think maybe I missed this, but did you talk about equity needs going forward? I know it's a little bit early considering the rate case is still pending and everything. But can you talk about the normalized equity need going forward and what -- how that might change depending on the outcome of the case?","Jeff Guldner","Well, so we don't expect to issue equity in 2020, Michael. We expect the next offering we have will be in the $300 million to $400 million range. It will be teed up closer to the next rate filing, but a lot of that will be what it shakes out ultimately and the capital expenditures as we move forward PPA versus owned.","Operator","Does that complete your question?","Michael Weinstein","No. Is that block equity or ATM-type equity?","Jeff Guldner","We haven't decided the how yet at this point. So we'll have to -- details will follow on that as we get closer.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Got you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. So other than the rider that you have for APS Solar Communities, which I believe is for rooftop, which we should be assuming that to move this capital through into rates that -- I think, you've already said this pretty explicitly, you will need to file another rate case post the one that's going to be closing this year too or you'll be in sort of serial filing mode to get these investments into revenues. Is that fair?","Jeff Guldner","It may depend a little bit, Greg, on kind of how the -- how this case moves forward. We've got an RES adjustment mechanism. There's some potential for that to come into play. I think what you see is, if you move with a more traditional rate basing process, then, yeah, you would be looking at rate cases that would be filed periodically to reflect the changing capital. But one of the things I think we'd like to have a conversation with the commission about is, are there either mechanisms we have today or other ways that we can look at doing that so that we're not in serial rate-making mode.","Greg Gordon","Understood. And then when I look at the 2022 rate base target or aspiration, it's -- it just looks a little bit low to me relative to the increase in capex. Maybe I'm wrong. But should I presume that the CWIP balances would be perhaps a bit larger and the AFUDC portion of your income statement would be a little bit bigger in '22?","Jim Hatfield","You know, Greg, this is Jim. I know this slide is 2020 to 2022. That 6% to 7% we think is a long-term outlook and when necessary it just reflects the debt, the period that shown. The math looking at what's shown is more like 8%, but we're looking at into the future.","Greg Gordon","No, I understand that. I'm making -- I'm asking a more basic question when I think about the earnings guidance for this year with AFUDC expected to be $35 million plus or minus, that's on Slide 6.","Jim Hatfield","Yeah.","Greg Gordon","I'm just sort of saying like, maybe I'm stating the obvious, but as your capital expenditures accelerate up that CWIP and therefore the contribution to earnings from AFUDC should grow.","Jim Hatfield","That would be correct, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Final question guys. I think there was some work -- the PUC -- sorry the ACC outside of the Tucson case and outside of the -- your pending case has been workshopping several different issues, including making a policy decision on how to deal with fair value adjustment, how to deal with post test year adjustments in rate cases. And I think there was one other item, which, frankly I'm embarrassed, I can't remember, but I think you -- hopefully, you are knowledgeable about to what I'm referencing. And could you give us an update on that where those stand on those two or three items?","Barbara Lockwood","Yes. Greg, this is Barbara Lockwood. There has been some conversation about taking a look at those outside of rate cases. Frankly, there hasn't been much activity on that recently. They've been focused on some other topics.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So there's no sort of formal process for coming up with policy statements on those would like a date certain?","Barbara Lockwood","No, there's not. Not at this time.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you very much. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. First question, could you maybe give a little bit of an update on your thoughts on the telecom petition docket and couple of the proposal that were made? And just your thoughts on the feasibility of that and what potential impact that could have on the system and on APS as well?","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. Insoo, it's Jeff. The process, there has been some draft rule proposals that were put out. And if we want to go into any more detail, let Barbara talk about it. But one of the major challenges we have here in Arizona is that we're not in an organized market. And to make the retail competition effective, I think, you've really got to be in an RTO and have that underlying framework, and you've also got to have a fair amount of infrastructure around resource adequacy.","We're in a time, if you go back to the original competition discussion back in the early 2000s, there was a lot more capacity, there was an overbuild of capacity. And so, capacity was not as tight. We're in a much tighter capacity markets, so it would be really risky to move forward without strong resource adequacy frameworks. And this is a pretty lean commission. And so how you would put in place the infrastructure that would ensure resource adequacy, how would you deal with the market structure that moves beyond scheduling -- independent scheduling administrator, which is what we had in the last go around, into an actual RTO type of Independent system operator. And then how would you actually address the arbitrage, the gaming that could happen around the trading and prices and customer-facing situation.","So it's just really difficult for me to see how you put all those in place to make this effective. But obviously, this is early in the discussion on where those rules are. And so we'll engage and share that perspective with the commission.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Thank you for the insight. And the second question, just going back to the storage and other clean energy investments. I think the 300 of storage and the 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts of other resources, what time frame was that for? And I heard a 2030 timeframe and I didn't know what the overall opportunity set you may have spoken about in this next 10-year period.","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. Insoo, I was referencing the sort of interim 45% renewables target in 2030. And over that timeframe from now to 2030, our need is about 300 megawatts a year of battery storage and 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts of renewable generation a year in that timeframe.","Insoo Kim","Got it. When I was just looking at the clean energy investments in 2021 and 2022, it seems like the dollar amounts, if you do some rough math, would imply pretty high hundreds of megawatts. I don't know if it's what you're talking about already been captured in this next couple of years or am I doing the math wrong?","Jeff Guldner","No, it's been captured. Remember, it's an average over the timeframe. But yeah, we see significant opportunity in storage and renewables.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Okay. I'll follow up. Thank you.","Jeff Guldner","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning team. Can you hear me?","Jeff Guldner","Hey Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. Howdy. Just to follow up and clarify the early equity commentary, when you talk about that $300 million to $400 million, it seems as if that you're basically saying 2021 upon rate case resolution. Just also want to clarify, does that include 2022 or these contemplate no equity in '22 as you true up your capital structure in '21, given that you've now provide a capex in '22? So sorry for all that detail, but I wanted to clarify that.","Jeff Guldner","Yeah, no...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yeah. Go forward.","Jeff Guldner","I would just say, Julien, if I imply that was going to be in 2021, that wasn't what I was trying to imply. I was just trying to imply as we look out, we see our capex, we'll need to issue equity to support the capital structure into the next rate case. I\u2019ve made no assumption on when that rate case would be filed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. And just to clarify that, that is reflective of the capex at least through '22 as it says they're not necessarily indicative of, like perhaps equity subsequently post '22 right?","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. This is just -- the next time we go to market, I expect it to be in a $300 million to $400 million range, and that will be refined based on what we ultimately do on the capex front and so on.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. Thank you. And then the second question. Coming back to the rate case dynamics, obviously it's a little bit more protracted here. How do you think about settlement and the timing of having those settlement conversations, just given how long of a process it? And then just to what -- well, I'll leave easy.","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. The -- originally, if you remember, Julien, that there was a lot of discussion. This was a case that we were directed to file by the commission. And I think that the assumption was that this would be a fully litigated rate case. Obviously, we would, I think, like to talk about settlement. I think there is a lot of benefits of settling cases, particularly in the sense that you can come up with solutions that both sides you can have a win-win kind of an outcome and often in litigated cases you're much more in a binary outcome where it's kind of one or the other.","And so I think there's value in settlement. It's probably too early. We haven't even got in it. If staffer has been our testimony, yeah, that's going to come in May likely. And so it's early yet to see if there is a dynamic that could come into play there. But just to be realistic, the commission has said that this is a case that they want to see fully litigated. So if that changes or if the opportunity presents itself, I think we'd certainly be interested in doing that, but that's not the path that we're on right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And just to clarify that, that has not changed in recent months there? At least your understanding on this case?","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. And again, Julien, this is also kind of early in the process, where it too haven't really done anything, because normally that's going to come after you see staff and intervenor testimony come in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Hey, good morning. So first question sort of on the renewable energy, sort of outlook and potential cost impacts. You guys are putting more effort in renewable energy. Costs have come way down. I'm just wondering how you -- when you look at your rate base and your capex projections and everything, obviously there's going to be lots of variables. But what are you guys thinking about what the potential rate impact might be with this outlook?","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. Paul, what we've really been focused on is trying to manage through this plan with essentially real prices remaining flat. So keep the rate pressure at or below the rate of inflation. And obviously, part of what you can look at with that is as you put more storage resources into the system, you're able to trade out some fuel expense. And so I think we're probably $1 billion or so of fuel expense right now in what we've seen.","So if you can do a little fuel for steel, you're able to translate that fuel expense into, you had rate base growth, but importantly it takes the rate pressure off customers so that you're able to make that trade out and get the capital investment, but also mitigate the rate impacts. And really important other component to this plan is the work that we've been doing, you see it reflected in. And I think some of the earnings that we're able to announce this quarter is the work around Lean Six Sigma transformation where we're trying to really look at doing work differently and eliminate waste and streamline processes and that's going to be important, because we've got to keep the O&M flat or lower. So, as you're making these capital investments, you're not just putting the rate increases through to consumers.","And so it's going to have to be a combination of that looking at how you can do some fuel for steel and save on fuel expense, and then how you can find the O&M savings. And then just a third component, which is different from the internal pieces, but is just driving growth in the state. And so when you see the large high-load factor customers come in like the data centers, they pick up a significant amount of the fixed costs and so you're able to more efficiently use the system. And so it's really tying those three things together that we think can help mitigate rate pressures on us.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, sort of on the other element that you mentioned at the beginning of the call, this rate design issue. And as you know, this -- it seems to me at least from watching all of this that the rate design issue that was implemented in the last rate cases caused or really actually probably caused a lot of the regulatory issues that we're now encountering.","And I know that you guys are trying to do customer education and what have you. But coming from -- sort of from more of a consumer perspective like technology and stuff, when you have to educate the consumer, that sometimes has seen in of itself is being kind of a drawback. And I'm wondering whether or not there is an effort of maybe thinking about and I don't really see it, I guess, in the current rate case, and it's there, I apologize. But the idea of maybe just simplifying the whole thing because I'm not -- I guess, what I'm wondering is customers may not want to be educated. I'm saying in other words, they might want simplicity.","And so I'm just wondering, I know you guys are doing a stakeholder thing and discussing it with stakeholders and what have you. But I'm wondering if there is any plan potentially of sort of making it so that you don't have what we, I guess, sort of have come up with in which you have people sort of having a really difficult time with. We've just sort of dealing -- outside of rates, just the complexity of what at least some of these customers seem to be dealing with.","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. Paul, a couple of points to that. First is, we are absolutely looking at those issues. We've got a proposal in the case for essentially a flat bill. So similar to what you see cellphone companies offer which is, here's what your monthly plan would be, it's fixed, we don't do a true up at the end, there is a nuance to that that actually says if you tie it to allowing us to put a smart thermostat in the house, you've get a lower risk rate on that. But what's really important you're -- I think you're going to see this still continue across commission's around the country.","As you move into this advanced energy economies, since we're making this transition, there is absolutely a role for customers, not just commercial and industrial, and we're working a lot with some of our commercial and industrial customers who are asking for demand side options so that they can manage around the prices that we see at the wholesale level, the duck curve issue that we've got, which is causing wholesale prices to be very low or negative in the middle of the day, and then the need to shift load off into the evening hours when you've got no solar production coming onto the grid.","And so the commercial\/industrial customers are absolutely taking advantage of that. A lot of the rate design pieces are simply to align rates that we've had for decades. We've had time of use in demand rates in our service territory for decades, so the rate concepts aren't new. The issue was that if you have a 12 to seven peak period and you've got negative prices occurring at noon, that is a crazy price signal to send customers. There's no way you can long-term operate a system with that kind of time of use period.","And so, the first change is shifting the time of use off to three to eight, which aligns us with what we actually see as the peak and get some of that shift. And then with the demand rates, we've had the largest demand rate participation in the country for again decades, because in Arizona, a lot of cases, you've got two air conditioners. When you have a demand rate, your average, your consumption, your energy costs, the cents per kilowatt hour is lower, because it's picked up on a demand charge. And even back 20 years ago, there were technologies like load controllers that could allow customers to manage their demand.","And so, yeah, we're going through education process, but what we're seeing in the rate design is real customer response to those price signals. We're seeing customers who are able to take advantage of demand response programs with smart thermostats that we simply would not be able to offer without that rate design. And really importantly, as you move forward, this just doesn't -- to me, you can't leave residential customers out of this advanced energy economy and we have to be able to take advantage of the thermal storage that's in the 1.1 million residential homes that we have in our service territory through smart water heater, smart thermostats, things like that, and none of that really works without the rate design.","So sorry for the long answer. But to try to get to your question, yeah, let's put together some options like the flat bill so that we can target or give something to folks who really don't want to do that. Recognize that there are a lot of folks who don't want to worry about it. So, now there is technology like smart thermostats that can do it without them having to actively do things, I think increasingly you'll see the technology take the consumer behavior out of the equation, and they'll just be doing things and the customer won't notice. But to get to that point, you've got to have these price signals that are there. So again, sorry for long answer, but that's how we're thinking about it.","Paul Patterson","I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Hi. The only thing I had left is the disconnect policy that you brought up last quarter. I see it's still on the bullet points on your 2020 drivers. Did that get resolved between the $20 million and $30 million?","Jim Hatfield","So that $20 million and $30 million was our projection going into 2020. Keep in mind, you're just now having people come off the sort of form of payment plan. And so a lot of this is, we'll see later this year what that impact will be. We did increase our bad debt reserve last year in June. So we are picking some of that in just our reserve, but where that shakes out remains to be seen. We will ultimately adjust that reserve once we have an annualized pattern that we feel good that that's the right amount.","Jeff Guldner","Okay. But, Charles, the rulemaking -- still the rulemaking is still under way at the commission. So they've not landed on final rules for that yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Peters with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","David Peters","Yeah. Hey, good morning guys. I would be curious just to kind of get your guys view of the legislation that's been proposed to potentially move the ACC to an appointed commission. Do you sense there is a level of support for this at the legislature and from voters? Or should we expect to kind of see a similar result that we saw in the past?","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. I think, David, the -- it didn't get out through a committee. There is a committee that it failed out of, and that was exactly the comment that was made is that the committee members that they believed it was important to allow the voters to have the right to elect the commission. And so it's working its way through the process right now. Just again, to be clear, this was not something that we proposed or that we were trying to move forward with. And just to give you a flavor on that, I think if it were, and so it's still unclear as to whether it would ultimately get out of the house, but are out of legislature to the ballot, it would then have to go to the ballot.","So then you'd have to actually have voters decide to do this. And as you know, I made the commitment that we weren't going to participate in commission elections. I think within the spirit of that commitment, we would not be participating in something like an independent expenditure to try to promote this, because I just think that would be too close to violating the spirit of what we are committed to do with the commission. So legislature will do what they're doing, but -- and I think we said we'd work with commissioners, obviously, whether appointed or elected, but if this will be a long road.","David Peters","Great. And then just quickly on the Bright Canyon business as you kind of think about it today, do you expect or is the intention to ever get to the scale of where it's kind of a material earnings driver for you guys?","Jeff Guldner","Yeah. It's a little early in that, but I think when you look at the adjacency opportunities, that's what I try to emphasize in the prepared remarks, is that we're not trying to go out far beyond what we believe is really core expertise. So we've got expertise and working with the -- with wind and solar. We're working on more expertise around battery storage. We've got -- we had phenomenal performance at our microgrid. We had an event in Yuma with the microgrid that we had installed for the Marine Corps Air Station, where they actually lost the substation. And in eight seconds that microgrid kicked in and picked up the entire load of the base from a black start, held the load until the substation was repaired and then was able to seamlessly transition the base back into service.","So for what the military is looking for in their base resiliency work, those kind of projects are good. We've got great expertise, I think, in doing those. And so a little early to see how much is really there, but I don't want to leave that expertise untapped. And so we are looking at how we can expand Bright Canyon into more opportunities like that. But it's a competitive environment, we're not going to do something that doesn't make sense, obviously, for our investors. But we do think there is some opportunity there.","David Peters","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, guys. Just a quick one. How much equity is usually issued through the employee plans every year? And how much can that absorb of the future $300 million to $400 million?","Jim Hatfield","So, we don't have an employee plan, we have a DRIP. And I think the revenue through the DRIP is $11 million, $12 million a year. It's not significant.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you for joining us today.

It will also be available by telephone through August 10.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thank you, Stefanie and thank you all for joining us today. We continue to demonstrate operational excellence through the second quarter of 2017 and we remain well-positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I will provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. Two significant milestones in the APS rate review had been completed as we near the conclusion of that process. The hearing ended on May 2 and the administrative law judge issued a recommended order on July 26. The recommended order supports the settlement agreement without material modification, including the 10% return on equity, a $94.6 million base rate increase, which is the equivalent of an overall 3.3% bill increase, deferrals for the selective catalytic reduction equipment at Four Corners, and the Ocotillo Modernization project, with a step increase in 2019 for the SCRs and moving the time of use window from noon to 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The administrative law judge also recommended that the new rates go into effect on September 1.","APS will file exceptions and clarifications to the recommended order tomorrow on August 4. The settlement agreement will bring about sustainable solar, a smarter energy infrastructure, a cleaner energy mix and more options for customers. The judge\u2019s recommendation to support the settlement agreement continues to move us in that direction. The final step in the rate review process is for the commission to vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the progress to this point, including the judge\u2019s recommendation to approve this settlement as very positive.","With the anticipated conclusion of our rate review and the related imminent grandfathering deadline for net metering, we continue to see an increase in residential solar. In June, we received over 4,500 applications for solar interconnections, which is more than double the recent monthly average. As of July, there have been more than 62,000 residential PV installations in the APS service territory, totaling 483 megawatts. As you know, APS customers also receive solar power from the large Solana Generating Station and from 10 AZ Sun utility scale solar plants.","Turning to our operations, Palo Verde generating station successfully completed a planned refueling outage for Unit 2 in less than 31 days, with no OSHA recordable injuries. The units operated at 93.1% capacity factor through the first half of the year. At our Four Corners Power Plant, the installation of new selective catalytic reduction equipment is more than 75% complete. The first unit with the new equipment will come online later this year and the second in early 2018. The 5 new fast-start flexible generating units being installed at our Ocotillo plant are more than 60% complete, and all are expected to be in service by summer 2019. The Navajo Generating Station co-owners and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo plant will remain in operation until December 2019. On June 26, the Navajo Nation Council approved a replacement lease that will allow the plant to operate through 2019 and sets guidelines for decommissioning activities that will begin after 2019. Certain additional approvals are required, which are expected to occur by late 2017. Various stakeholders, including regulators, tribal representatives, the plant\u2019s coal supplier and the United States Department of the Interior have been meeting to determine if an alternative solution can be reached that would permit continued operation of the plant beyond 2019.","On June 20, amidst a week long spell of temperatures ranging between 115 and 119 degrees, APS customers set an all-time record peak demand of 7,367 megawatts between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. This record demand eclipsed the 11-year-old record of 7,236 megawatts set back in 2006. Allow me to expand on a few more observations about energy supply on that peak day, June 20. By 8:00 p.m. that evening, the system load was still within 6% of the record peak, demonstrating how energy demand remains very strong even after the sun goes down. Production from private rooftop solar had peaked at 1:00 p.m. that afternoon and was only producing 30% of its capacity during the 6:00 p.m. hour. Our growing customer demand and the misalignment between when our demand peak occurs and when rooftop solar produces the most energy, further demonstrates the need to continue grid enhancements, while adding peaking resources.","Looking to our capital investment program. In June, the Daisy Mountain Substation came online, helping to provide strong reliability for a growing population north of the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The new system is one of over two prototype substations that incorporate self-correcting technology. As part of our continuing proactive approach to modernizing the grid, APS has implemented advanced technologies, completed multiple high-voltage transmission projects to further improve reliability and introduced new ways for customers to receive important energy usage information. This planned investment strategy helps to ensure we are able to meet our customers\u2019 increasing energy requirements.","For our future resource needs, APS issued an RFP on April 12, seeking proposals for 400 to 700 megawatts of capacity to meet peak demand requirements beginning in 2021. This RFP will be used primarily to backfill a 480-megawatt seasonal exchange agreement, which expires in 2020. The RFP required proposals to be submitted by July 14, last month. APS is currently evaluating those proposals, and we expect to have a decision by the end of 2017. In closing, we continue to be well positioned for a very solid 2017. We\u2019re focused on completing our rate review filing and positioning the company to continue to grow to meet the increasing energy needs of our customers.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don and thank you again everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2017, we earned $1.49 per share compared to $1.08 per share in the second quarter of 2016.","Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I\u2019ll highlight a few of the key drivers. Total gross margin was up $0.27 per share compared with the second quarter of 2016, supported by stronger customer usage, favorable weather and higher transmission and loss fixed cost recovery revenues. Higher net sales in the second quarter of 2017 compared with the second quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.10 per share, which we believe reflects the improving economic conditions we are seeing locally and I\u2019ll talk about more on that in a moment, which was supported by 1.8% customer growth as well as higher average usage by our residential customers. Weather-normalized retail, kilowatt-hour sales were up 2.9% in the quarterly comparison, net of the impact of customer conservation energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation.","Although we are pleased with the favorable sales growth we saw in the second quarter, year-to-date, through the end of June, sales were up 0.1% and we still expect that weather-normalized sales growth will fall within the range of about 0% to 1% for the year. Lower operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by less fossil generation plant outage activity during the current period. As you recall, we had a large plant outage at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant\u2019s routine maintenance schedule. And keep in mind that we expect extended outages at Four Corners in the second half of this year as we prepare for the installation of pollution control equipment. Also want to note that the quarterly O&M variance includes a charge related to the cancellation of capital projects at the Navajo Generating Station, which has an offsetting adjustment depreciation. On the topic of depreciation, higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to increased plant in service, partly offset by the Navajo plant item I just mentioned.","Turning now to the Arizona\u2019s economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story, I will highlight the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. As seen on the upper panel on Slide 5, the Phoenix Metropolitan area continued to show job growth above the national average. Through May, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 2.4%, compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area\u2019s commercial and residential real estate markets. Vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall and at are levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 2 million-square-foot of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in its residential real estate market.","As you can see in the lower panel on Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 5,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March through May were at their highest level seen since August of 2007. One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. That activity in the market is providing meaningful support for home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years. As I previously mentioned, reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS\u2019s retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals support future population, job growth, and economic development in Arizona prepared to be in place.","Finally, a quick update on our financing and guidance plans. We expect to issue about $650 million of additional long-term debt this year, one transaction at Pinnacle, including the refinancing of the $125 million term loan and one at APS. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We plan to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of APS\u2019s pending rate review through a separate communication. However, to assist you with estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the Appendix to today\u2019s slides. We also plan to release 2018 ongoing guidance on our third quarter call consistent with our standard practice. This concludes our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. How are you?","Don Brandt","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Good. So, several questions. First on, you indicated that your \u2013 you can file exceptions to the rule by August 4. I mean, there weren\u2019t very many material modifications to the settlement. So, should we expect that you will have material issues with the rule or would they be limited to perhaps the fact that the recommendation bifurcates the AMI opt out, because other than that, I didn\u2019t see any major changes?","Don Brandt","I think it will be mostly categorized as tweaking, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks. My second question is the weather normal sales growth as you calculated it this quarter was really quite impressive. Now, I know if I look in the appendix on Page 20 that the first \u2013 the 6 months ended weather-normal is just 0.1%, because the Q1 number looked weak, I remember asking about it at the time. Is this a number \u2013 this 2.9%, I mean, is this a number off of which you think you can build momentum or do you think it ebbs back down to a lower number, but still one that sort of drives you towards the type of customer growth targets that we have been waiting to see, which are finally showing up? I am just asking for a little bit more color and characterization of like why did it go from such a low number in Q1, such a huge number in Q2 and how...","Don Brandt","So I might ask Jim to comment on the comparison of the two quarters, Greg. But I will say \u2013 I mean we are still looking at, as we pointed out in the press release, 0% to 1% for the year. And for the first 6 months, we are up only up net-net 0.1%, but for a longer term, and by that, I mean the next 2 to 3 years, the balance of the year, some of the things Jim cited, but I mean the growth here, number one in the nation, the housing permits or the house since 2007 and if you saw the number driving around the entire metropolitan area, there is apartment buildings \u2013 huge apartment buildings going up almost everywhere you look. Different magazines and realtor.com projects Phoenix to be the number one housing market this year and next. There is a lot going on here that I think is going to continue to sustain our growth for the next few years. And Jim, I don\u2019t know if...","Jim Hatfield","Yes. I would just say, Greg, it\u2019s a great question as one quarter we come up pretty flat to negative. We do know that consumer confidence at the residential level increased in the second quarter. And I think that\u2019s consistent with the surge in housing permits in the second quarter. That said we will see some consumer elasticity as they get their bills in July from the warm June. So right now, we are continuing to be led here today by the commercial sector with the things we mentioned before, State Farm completing its build-out last year, but still continuing to increase forecast as we move forward. So, I think I would answer that by saying I think the third quarter is going to tell us a lot as well.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Move on to my last question, obviously, the quarter-over-quarter earnings comparison was incredibly punchy, $1.49 versus $1.08. But you did point to the fact that you are going to have some plant outages in the second half. Can you quantify, just \u2013 if we were to just isolate O&M, we are just going to isolate O&M in the second half sort of second half \u201817 versus second half \u201816, what that delta looks like as a function of those planned expenses?","Jim Hatfield","So we knew our O&M was going to be back end loaded this year. I think I would look to the first quarter of \u201816 when we did similar type outages at Four Corners. That\u2019s the guide in terms of the magnitude of that spend, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you very much, guys. Have a great day.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with RBC. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Good morning, everyone.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Insoo.","Insoo Kim","After the rate case decision when you guys do provide your \u201817 guidance, have you guys made a decision on whether to potentially provide longer term growth forecast, whether it be rate base or earnings growth CAGRs?","Jim Hatfield","No, we will provide \u201818 guidance. And then as our normal practice at the end of the third quarter \u2013 I am sorry, \u201817 guidance and at the end of the third quarter, we will do \u201818 guidance. But at this time, we have no plans to go out any further than what we normally do.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And my only other question was with the latest update in the suit by Commissioner Burns and on June, the ACC denied the motion to compel it. Is it pretty safe to assume that any other further consideration by the court near term shouldn\u2019t delay the upcoming rate case decision?","Jeff Guldner","Insoo, this is Jeff. The Superior Court judge just heard arguments on amending the complaint that was asked at the four commissioners and the commission. I expect him to rule on that in the next week or so. And so we have got an open meeting that\u2019s coming up in \u2013 next open meeting, the rate case could go on would be August 15 and 16. So, I think the rate case is probably going to go before anything happens in Superior Court.","Insoo Kim","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Don, a question for you. I know the rate case lays out some of the boundaries for this, but given kind of what you have seen for the last 6 or 9 months or even longer term and what you expect going forward, how are you thinking about your generation capacity and energy needs and whether post Ocotillo, there is need in the early 2020s for new gas-fired generation in your portfolio?","Don Brandt","Most likely, we would be looking at simple cycle peaking needs at that period of time.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And can you remind me \u2013 or as part of this rate case agreement, are you allowed to actually own and operate the simple cycle? The agreement, I think doesn\u2019t let you go into construction for some types of gas plants, but others it does?","Don Brandt","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks, Don. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question, Jim or Don, assuming the rate case settlement is approved and it looks like it will be, given that your ROE stays as it was but your equity ratio goes up somewhat, does that cause the earnings power of the company to increase as well?","Jim Hatfield","No. I would expect actually our equity ratio to sort of fall as we issue fixed income securities over the next couple of years.","Ali Agha","So, ultimately you think that would kind of remain where it has been?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. The equity ratio and the ROE were just placed in there as parameters for us, the rate case for the black box, so the extra equity in this case, it doesn\u2019t lead to earnings power.","Ali Agha","I see. Okay. And then separately, when you look at the deferrals and the step up increase in \u201819, again, as part of the settlement, I recall in the past, you have talked about, I think rate base growth has been 6% to 7%, dividend growth 5%, and you have talked about earnings growth somewhere in the middle of the two. One, did I get that, right? Have you...","Jim Hatfield","That\u2019s correct.","Ali Agha","Okay. But do you see that the trajectory, given the step up etcetera, won\u2019t be smooth? Should we think about some peaks and troughs as we think about that earnings trajectory because of the timing of the step up?","Jim Hatfield","Earnings always goes in peaks and troughs. And keep in mind, when we do the step increase, we still have $0.5 billion of Ocotillo that\u2019s being deferred, but not being earned on. So that would create a drag until it ultimately gets some rates hopefully in 2020.","Ali Agha","I see, okay. And then more near-term, I know you talked about the planned outages and how the O&M will move over time. But excluding that, when you look at how second quarter came out and how first half has come out, has it come out pretty much as expected on plan or how would you categorize the first half of the year?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. I think we are pleased with where we are compared to our plan this year. And beyond that, we haven\u2019t really given any guidance and we will talk about that when we get guidance out here soon.","Ali Agha","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerimiah Booream with Bank of America Merrill Lynch [sic] [UBS].","Jerimiah Booream","Hi, good afternoon.","Don Brandt","Good afternoon.","Jerimiah Booream","I just wanted to go back to the customer growth question. And specifically, could you just remind us what percentage offset you have seen from solar installations? And specifically, could you see that affecting how you are thinking about customer growth as the grandfathering period ends later this year?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. So I would say that we get probably as much impact of energy efficiency as we do rooftop, but we probably will have by the time rate goes into effect and installations that are valid we have received before that, we will probably end with 70,000 or so rooftop solar and that will be about 6% of our residential customer base will be with rooftop solar. After that, remains to be seen in terms of continued growth. We get about a 1.5% or so offset typically from the EE and DE.","Jerimiah Booream","Got it. That makes sense. And then just a quick clarification, if the Navajo operators reach an agreement to extend operations beyond 2019, would you be obligated to basically maintain your ownership or will you have the option or how are you thinking about that?","Mark Schiavoni","Well, this is Mark Schiavoni, Jerimiah. Right now, the expectation with Navajo Generating Station, the current ownership structure would not remain in place through efforts of the Navajo Nation, Department of Interior, they are looking for alternative ownership in the future of Navajo Generating Station.","Jerimiah Booream","Okay. Yes, that\u2019s fine. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Thanks. Hey, the only question I have was on Slide 9. There was a third bullet point under the rule about the battery storage. And just to make that clear, it\u2019s an incentive program for the customer to install this battery storage, correct?","Jeff Guldner","Yes, Charles, it\u2019s Jeff. It was a response to specific issue in the case that was not included in the settlement. And there were a couple of proposals out, but this is an incentive program for the customer. It\u2019s funded through the DSM adjustment mechanism.","Charles Fishman","So I know we have seen some battery storage \u2013 utility scale storage in Southern California, for instance. Was there any thought about going in that direction, because obviously the situation in your system almost lends itself to that.","Mark Schiavoni","Charles, this is Mark. We have installed a couple 2-megawatt batteries into our system and quite frankly, we are using that as part of the solution set. So with the way we look at storage or any technology, if it doesn\u2019t provide the right solution at the right cost or a system reliability so it could be a capacitor, it could be storage, it could be transformer, it doesn\u2019t matter in the technology. So we are pretty agnostic when it comes to that.","Charles Fishman","Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"17238":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call April 29, 2016 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Paul Mountain - Director, Investor Relations","Donald Brandt - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","James Hatfield - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jeffrey Guldner - Senior Vice President, Public Policy, Arizona Public Service Company","Mark Schiavoni - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Arizona Public Service Company","Analysts","Greg Gordon - Evercore","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter 2016 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy; and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, we need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 6.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald Brandt","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. 2016 has started off with a solid first quarter, very much in line with our expectations and we remain well-positioned to meet our financial commitments this year. We're focused on operational execution in APS's rate case filing plan for June 1.","We have had planned outages at both units at the Four Corner Generating fossil plant and at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. Jim will discuss the financial impact, but the Four Corners planned outages were the primary headwind in our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2015.","The Four Corners Unit 5 major outage began in late January, while Unit 4's outage started in March, with both expected online very soon. Palo Verde's planned Unit 1 refueling outage began on April 10. Palo Verde continues to perform exceptionally well. The site recently completed a peer evaluation by the World Association of Nuclear Operations or WANO as its known and by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations or INPO, and received exceptionally positive feedback from this evaluation.","On a related note, Maria Lacal, who has been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Oversight for Palo Verde. Maria, I know you're listening, so thank you for all you've done to make Palo Verde one of the safest and best performing nuclear plants in the nation.","We're making progress on our capital investment program. We're building a 40 megawatt utility scale solar facility known as Red Rock Solar, where our major customers ASU and PayPal have agreed to buy the power, and we'll also receive the renewable energy credits. We signed an agreement with a data center to construct the microgrid at their location in North Phoenix. This will be the second microgrid, APS is partnering on in our service territory.","The first was with the Department of the Navy's Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The Red Rock Solar and microgrid projects represent unique opportunities to develop innovative solutions for our customers. Additionally, as part of the APS solar partner program, we are the first utility in the nation to use advanced technology to manage solar generation through the use of advanced inverters.","The inverters APS is using recently received Underwriters Laboratories certification. This is an important milestone, since we require that all equipment on the grid be certified by UL. The advanced inverters allow us full command and control of the devices we own, which includes ramping up or curtailing power and enabling two-way power flows.","Turning to the regulatory calendar. The Arizona Corporation Commission and staff have been managing a full schedule. The UNS rate case hearings took place in March. We were engaged in the residential rate design portion of that docket. The discussion centered on the deployment of three-part rates, which include an energy component, a demand component and a customer charge. A final decision is expected this summer.","We also filed testimony in the value and cost of distributed generation docket. Hearings began on April 18 and are expected to conclude in early May. There is not a set timetable for a decision. The outcome of this docket is anticipated to outline a statewide methodology of how the cost of service for solar customers will be handled as well as how the value of solar will be determined. We do not expect to have decisions on these two dockets before our June 1 rate case filing date, but our engagement in each process has provided insight on rate design.","Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align cost with prices, including proposing three-part rates for most residential customers as well as shifting our time of use periods to later in the day. We'll also request a deferral of cost, related to two large capital projects that we'll be investing in. The selective catalytic reduction controls or SCR is as they're known at Four Corners and the fast-ramping natural gas modernization project at our Ocotillo site. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years within service dates of 2018 and 2019, respectively.","And in the case with the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect a deferred SCR cost similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition. Our overall rate filing theme centers on clear energy, sustainability, innovation and technological options for customer.","Lastly, I'll comment on a recent development. Earlier this month, a constitutional ballot initiative supported by SolarCity that was related to distributed generation and rate making was filed with the Arizona Secretary of State in an effort to put the initiative on the November 2016 ballot. In response, two bills were introduced this week in the Arizona Legislature that would have offered competing referendums for Arizona voters to consider.","Very late yesterday, the SolarCity ballot initiative and the two bills were pulled from consideration. The Arizona utility industry and SolarCity agreed to further dialogue in the future to seek a constructive outcome on net metering.","In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well-positioned for a solid year in 2016. We're focused on operational excellence and positioning APS as a sustainable leader through strategic capital investments and a forward-thinking rate filing.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see, on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2016, we were on $0.04 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2015.","The primary divers were higher gross margin offset by higher operations and maintenance expense. Several factor contributed to the gross margin in the first quarter, including favorable weather. The net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.02 per share.","Although, weather in both 2016 and 2015 first quarters were less favorable than the normal 10-year averages, heating degree days were 57% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to last year. Higher usage by APS's customers compared to the first quarter a year ago added a $0.01 to gross margin.","Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales increased 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015. The transmission adjustment mechanism in the Arizona Sun program also added to the first quarter gross margin. We still expect a loss fixed cost recovery mechanism or LFCR to be a positive driver for the year, that favorability will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year.","Now, turning to O&M. As Don mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary headwind to first quarter 2016 earnings compared to 2015, largely driven by the major plant outage at Four Corners Unit 5 that began in late January. In line with our expectation, the outage cost decreased earnings by about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. The Four Corners Unit 4 and 5 planned outages will both conclude in the second quarter, which will provide a headwind similar to the first quarter consistent with guidance.","Lastly, a brief note on depreciation and amortization expenses. Lower D&A increased earnings by $0.01 in the first quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resolving from additional plant service, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde sale leaseback.","As Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in the local economy, and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. What you see on Slide 4 is a continuation of a consistent growth trend we have been describing for you over the last couple of years. Job growth in the first quarter of 2016 in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average, as it has for nearly five years.","As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.6% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services and healthcare, showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year.","The job growth in Phoenix economy is driving robust population migrations. Of the 15 largest U.S. metro areas, Phoenix ranks third in the nation in 2015 population growth, behind only Houston and Dallas, which is influencing trends in the Metro Phoenix housing permits, as can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 4.","In 2015, Phoenix housing market record its best year since 2007, for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This growth trend continued in the first quarter of 2016, as single-family permit grew nearly 35% over last year's first quarter. We expect the housing market to continue to improve throughout this year with annual total housing permits probably in the range of 25,000 to 32,000.","In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth over the next couple of years. Additionally, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as they are situated relative to the large, but higher cost California market.","Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the first quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends, I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.19 to $4.10 per share. The adjustment mechanisms, particularly transmission and the LFCR, along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remain the key gross margin drivers.","You will a t complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 5, which are unchanged from last year. Looking ahead to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance a $250 million August maturity and anticipate issuing up $400 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, our balance sheet liquidity remained very strong.","During the first quarter, APS increased its commercial paper program from $250 million to $500 million. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $262 million of commercial paper outstanding. Finally, our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018 and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Don, a couple of questions. First, on the all the activity in the capital around the net metering, the legislation. Is it your expectation that you're going to be able to substantively settle issues around net metering in the context of your rate case or do you think that whatever happens in the UniSource case is going to be presidential, some combination of both? Is your expectation that you'll be able to effectively bury the hatchet with the solar leasing guys and figure out a scenario that makes everybody happy?","Donald Brandt","Our expectations at this point is to sit down, and we and the rest of the utility industry in Arizona, and have good faith discussions with representatives of the solar leasing industry and see where that takes us.","Greg Gordon","But do you expect that those conversations would happen soon enough to affect the outcome of the UniSource case or will the commission just make a move to change the tariffs in a way -- ","Donald Brandt","Jeff is sitting here. I'll let him chime in on the UNS case.","Jeffrey Guldner","The UNS case is moving into settlement discussion, so they're through hearing. And so I expect that's going to just continue on the path that it's on. And then our case is teed up to file on June 1, so right now there is a bunch of different paths that are moving and we'll just have to see how they intersect.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So wanted to follow-up a little bit on that solar question. I'd be curious, what exactly is the mediation that's talked about here as far as the deal with the SolarCity and the rest of the solar crowd here. What could that ultimately come out of that? What is the scope of that perhaps, is the most precise question?","Jeffrey Guldner","So the scope is sit down and look at -- certainly there have been some things that have happened elsewhere and look at what we can talk about in Arizona. And so it needs to have an Arizona focus. We're different than other parts of the country, but we certainly are open to sitting down and having good faith discussions with folks on the rooftop solar side.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So what happened in New York; is that what you're saying?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes, and also there are different things with framers, but New York is obviously at different situation. And those talks were broader and also involved some community solar aspects. And so I think the important thing is understanding Arizona has got a different setting, if you will, but still there is certainly room for discussions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to clarify, what's the timeline on that, just as it relates to sort of Craig's question here with the Tucson being presidential or your own case, et cetera?","Jeffrey Guldner","So we're working on schedule the discussions right now, but how they intersect, it's too early to say.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then moving back to the transition side, the TransCanyon JV of sorts, I'd be curious what are you guys looking at now that PG&E in the mix. I mean, how wide spread is this? Is there anything specific you can speak to in terms of FERC 1000 processes, et cetera, that you're looking out?","Jeffrey Guldner","No. The PG&E partnership, we believe at TransCanyon will give us more opportunity sets if you will. I think the scope of TransCanyon has not changed. It's still focused in the WECC region. And we'll continue to be active where we can on earth for transmission project.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to clarify here, given some of the bankruptcies in the sector, is there any opportunity to revisit certain transition line?","Jeffrey Guldner","I don't think so.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","First, Jim, wanted to clarify, I believe I heard you correctly, you were saying the outage at Four Corners impacted the first quarter by $0.13 and that you expected a similar hit in second quarter as well, $0.13, is that the way we should think about it?","James Hatfield","No. As we said on the fourth quarter call, the headwind would be $0.13 in the first quarter and it was. I think Four Corners 5 is online now, and so we're having a little bleed into the second quarter, but certainly the majority of the impact is first quarter driven.","Ali Agha","So more like a couple of pennies in the second quarter?","James Hatfield","Yes.","Ali Agha","And then, secondly, just to get a sense. A lot of moving parts around the solar issue, but do you still have that value and cost of solar process going on as well. And so is that still be the key sort of path sort of the critical path, if you will, to finally the commission reaching some conclusion on what they want to do with solar or are these other discussions taking precedence? Can you just line it up for us like what is the key critical path item here to clarify the solar situation?","Jeffrey Guldner","So the value and cost of solar docket, which is a generic docket is moving through hearings right now. And then that will go into briefings and provide the commission with information, but it's another separate track. And so the challenge right now -- and so there multiple separate tracks that are moving forward and we don't know how those are going to intersect. And so if the value and cost of solar docket results in findings and conclusions, then presumably those get factored into rate cases and other things. It's unclear where that's going right now. It's still in hearing.","Ali Agha","So when you file your rate case June 1 assuming all of this is still out there, will you basically lay out what you assume makes sense and then put that as part of the rate case filing or would you leave it blank or conceptually how should we think about that?","Donald Brandt","Now, we've got a plan. Our plan in the rate case filing continues to be around making changes to the residential rate design and moving to the three part rate structure. And that's what s you'll see proposed in our case. Now, what the commission does with that and how they overlay some of these other dockets, that's something that something will be discussed.","But that's the change here in Arizona, as a lot of the focus has moved into the rate design portion of these rate cases. And in the past, it's been much more around the revenue requirement side. So we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of desire to talk about rate design. And these other dockets are helping to feed into that discussion.","Ali Agha","Last question. Don, in the recent past and even the last couple of years, there has been clearly a trend towards consolidation in the sector. Just from an industry observer point of view, wanted to get your sense of how you're looking at that changing landscape? And given valuations as they are, does that kind of make sense as far as the ongoing consolidation trend that we're seeing in this overall utility sector?","Donald Brandt","I think the best way to respond to that is we're focused on running an exceptional utility in one of the fastest growing territories in the Untied States.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Real quick on the rate case process. I want to make sure I'm thinking about this that you're thinking that the rate case would end with the step up that probably comes mid-2017 and then another step up to reflect the SCRs like at the end of '18, beginning of '19 timeframe, am I thinking about that right? That's the first question. And then the second question is a little more nuanced. In your 2016 guidance, what do you assume for the revenue step up related to both transmission and the LFCR?","Jeffrey Guldner","Let me just talk on the rate case side and then Jim can follow-up on a second part of your question. So similar to Four Corners, we're looking at a combination of -- we're asking in this case for the commission to consider combination and mechanism that would go and replace after the case has concluded, one of them would be a step increase.","So if the case was concluded and rates went into effect in mid-2017 that would be the outcome of just the rate case result, and then a step increase later would be factored into that. And so that's similar. If you want to go look at what happened in the Four Corners decision in our last rate case, and it just reflects the fact that the timing of some of these plan additions occurred after they are too far out. And if we don't address it with some kind of a step mechanism, then you come right back in on another rate case pretty quickly.","Jim can talk about the -- ","James Hatfield","Yes. So Michael, we haven't really disclosed individually transmission LFCR, other than to say that those two together are large part of the gross margin increase. But keep in mind one thing about transmission. Last year we have the one-time decrease at transmission revenues reflecting our filing, so we don't expect to have that this year.","Michael Lapides","Just coming back to the rate case and the incremental step up piece, is the step up just for the SCRs? Is there a chance you could potentially get a step up in late '18 or early '19 for the SCRs and maybe even get Ocotillo win too? Just trying to think, you've got two really big CapEx projects underway, just trying to think about how you get rate recovery for both?","Donald Brandt","Yes, so one would be at deferral mechanisms, so deferral mechanisms around SCRs isn't a step for Ocotillo.","Michael Lapides","You wouldn't be putting in the SCR cost into rates at the same time you would try to do Ocotillo. You would defer the SCR cost until like a future case?","Donald Brandt","No, the deferral would go on to the future case.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles Fishman","Don, you mentioned that the discussions in the three-part design. I assume both you and Unisource right now have a two part design, just energy and fixed, is that correct?","Donald Brandt","No, we've actually have had demand rates for, what Jeff, for almost 200,000 customers?","James Hatfield","Yes, again, got north of 100,000 customers right now on three part residential rate design that has the demand and energy and fixed component, and so that's I think where the largest utility or line of customer base with the demand rates today in the U.S.","Charles Fishman","And really what allows you to do that is the smart meters there were installed, correct?","James Hatfield","Actually, no, we've had demand rates well before we've had smart meters. The smart meters provide some additional accessory functionality for customers. And so you can do more things with them and get more information, but we were doing demand rates before we had AMI meters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim.","Shar Pourreza","I thought prior discussions in the past, including our own conversations with the ACC seem to point that they were looking to solve the at least the generic solar proceedings by the May timeframe prior to your rate case fine. It seemed like they were pretty confident on that. But is it sort of a change or what's sort of the delay or if there wasn't delay and we were mistaken it?","Donald Brandt","So the hearings go through next week, May 5, and then we would expect the ALJ to have a recommended order out July timeframe. And then we expect the commissioners to hear an open meeting sometimes after that.","James Hatfield","So the generic docket would occur before the decision in our rate case, it's more of a challenge for the UNS given the timing of their rate case.","Shar Pourreza","And then just one last, a little bit more of an obscure question is on TransCanyon. Is there sort of, I mean with the EIM kind of being launched, is there sort of an opportunity to go sort of beyond that real-time day ahead sort of balancing to something that could lead to something more on the resource, adequacy, longer-term i.e. can there'd be more infrastructure spending around that region, especially if you get Mexico to join the EIM, which I think that's preliminary discussions.","Donald Brandt","So I think you need to separate TransCanyon from EIM. They're separate decisions. And EIM is not to solve resource adequacy capacity. It's really a more of a real-time intermittency type mechanism, so no connection between the two.","Shar Pourreza","And you don't see that sort of expanding to regional transmission planning?","Donald Brandt","Not the way the west is configured today, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Just to circle back on the negotiations with SolarCity and what have you. I'm just wondering what caused the change in heart, I mean you guys were battling and now it looks like pieces breaking out. And I just was wondering if you can give us maybe a little fence as to what changed on the ground and whether or not there is -- what you see the risk of potentially unraveling. Just was wondering, can you give us any flavor?","Jeffrey Guldner","So we started in 2012, we reached out and said, let's have a dialogue on how we address net metering and moved to a more sustainable model for the rooftop solar compensation in Arizona. And as I think you know that was met with a very aggressive political campaign that has continued to date.","And what happened earlier this month is a value proposition was launched by SolarCity that would put in the constitution very detailed provisions around net metering, interconnection rules, and things like that that prompted I think a response by the Arizona Legislature that was proposing and hearing two separate ballot propositions; one, around the resolution in net metering issues.","And the second one that would have ensured that solar rooftop companies were treated as public service corporation. That obviously escalated everything up to where we had three ballot propositions that were on a constitution. And we think it's probably more constructive to have dialog without ballot proposition hanging over everyone.","Paul Patterson","And that make sense, but it didn't sound like your position changed all that much. So I guess what I'm wondering is, is there anything to point to other than the ballot initiatives in the legislature that were going pretty quickly this week? I mean, is that what was the crux? I guess, is that the pivot point in terms of SolarCity and what have you? Is that the right way to think about it maybe?","James Hatfield","I think the ballot proposition is coming down is what's allowing the discussions to move forward.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon","I guess, as I'm thinking about the deferral mechanism that you're going ask for, for the SCRs, that would have the effect, if I'm thinking about it correctly, of sort of immunizing you guys from the earnings impact of the costs associated with running the SCRs until you could get rate recovery. But that would be a drag on the cash flow of the company, because the SCRs would actually be in place. So I guess I'm asking you, Jim, you must be pretty confident on the underlying cash flow profile of the core business to be able to offer to the customer a deferral mechanism that would smooth the rate impact in that manner. Is that a fair way of thinking about it?","James Hatfield","Greg, that's absolutely correct. I mean, we model this in our model that we've given to the agencies. As Don alluded to on the fourth quarter call, we have one of the best balance sheets in the industry. So we can really carry those from a cash perspective without recovery, until we get in the rate base.","Jeffrey Guldner","I misspoke earlier. I think I transposed them. The step is for the SCRs. The deferral is for Ocotillo. Either way, Greg, we're good with that so.","Greg Gordon","And we're still looking at 6% to 7% rate base growth with no equity needs through -- what year have you put out on the table as the sort of outside date where you're confident you don't need equity?","James Hatfield","It's really to our planning horizon.","Greg Gordon","And is that indefinite?","James Hatfield","It's not indefinite.","Greg Gordon","I'm just wondering how far out you guys generally plan for, three, five, eight, ten years?","James Hatfield","Well, we plan for five years. I mean, we have a five-year forecast.","Greg Gordon","So if rate base is growing at 6% to 7%, Don, and you can craft up rate settlement that allows you a stable return on equity construct, at a 5% dividend growth aspiration you'd actually have a declining payout ratio. So at would point do you reassess that, especially given how the fortress balance sheet that you guys have put together?","Donald Brandt","I think your analysis is correct, Greg. And we take a good hard look at it, usually in the fall of each year, as you know, and discuss it with our Board and take what we think are the appropriate long-term actions at that point in time.","Operator","Mr. Mountain, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","End of Q&A","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Christine. And thank you everybody. That concludes our call. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day."],"17240":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call November  3, 2016 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Ted Geisler - Director, Investor Relations","Don Brandt - Chairman, President and CEO","Jim Hatfield - EVP, CFO","Jeff Guldner - SVP, Public Policy, Arizona Public Service Company","Analysts","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ted Geisler, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Ted Geisler","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter 2016 earnings, recent developments and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy; and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from our expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our third quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 10.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Ted and thank you all for joining us today. This year continues to be in line with our expectation and keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year. Although, we experienced mild weather during August and September our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet our financial commitments.","Our board also approved 5% dividend increase affective with the December payment continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results I\u2019ll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Our operations team did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station performed and Unit-3 entered its planned refueling outage on October, 8.","Although this summer was mild compared to last, temperature soared to 118 degrees on June 19 and demand for electricity peaked at 7,051 megawatts. On a weather normalized basis, this was the highest peak demand for APS in nine years. Our growing customer demand further demonstrates the need to continue expanding the grid while adding peaking resources.","One data point worth noting, is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5:30 PM on June 19, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 28% of its capacity. Meanwhile utility scale solar was producing 72% of its capacity because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. A couple of hours later when our system demand was still above 7,000 megawatts essentially not changed rooftop solar production plummeted to zero. This scenario is not unique to our peak day and highlights the importance of electric grid at all hours as a day.","On average, our customers now reach their summer peak energy demand 45 minutes later in the day than they did four years ago. With customers using more energy in the evening hours, APS is on peak hours of noon to 7 PM are outdated. This is why we have recently proposed to change on peak hours to 3 to 8 PM so on peak pricing is better aligned with customer demand.","As I discussed on our last call, APS filed a rate review on June 1, since the filing we have continued to communicate with the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and interveners regarding the details of the proposal and its intent. The ACC staff and interveners will file their direct testimony on all matters except rate design on December 21 and the remaining direct testimony on January 27. Parties will have the opportunity to enter into formal settlement discussions before the hearing commences on March 22.","On a related matter a recommended opinion and order was issued by these administrative law judge on October 7 for the value and cost of distributed generation docket. The recommendation proposed progress on several key issues including the elimination of net metering to be replaced by new methodologies consistent with staff\u2019s proposal. These methodologies align the value of export energy from rooftop solar with either utilities avoided cost or a resourced comparison proxy, comprised of actual utility scale solar PPA cost.","The ALJ recommendation also concludes the rooftop solar customers, our partial requirements customers and suggest the determination for placing these customers in a separate class should be addressed in the rate review proceeding. This item is expected to be heard in the December 13 and 14 Commission Open Meeting.","On September 30th, APS filed its preliminary 2017 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP with the Corporation Commission. The plan addresses several key factors including our future resource needs as customer demand grows and power supply contracts expire. By 2022, our incremental resource requirement is forecasted to be in excess of 3,500 megawatts. This resource gap will be fulfilled through a variety of sources including the Ocotillo Modernization Project which is on track for completion in 2019.","Earlier this year, we issued an all source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity by 2020 which will also contribute toward our future resource needs. We have shortlisted proposals and will be finalizing a resource selection in the coming months. The remainder of our resource requirements will be evaluated as part of the IRP process which may include additional RFP\u2019s in the future.","On October 1, APS successfully began full participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market. This real-time wholesale power market enables APS to exchange energy with a variety of resources across eight western states reducing cost for our customers and improving the integration of renewable resources. This was a smooth transition and well managed by our operations teams.","Turning to our capital investment program, we continue making good progress on the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction technology at the Four Corners Power Plant. Our 40 megawatt utility scale solar plant Red Rock is on schedule for completion later this year and our 4 megawatts of battery storage investments are also on track for completion this year as part of the solar partner program. We completed three high voltage transmission lines this year to support our customer growth west of Phoenix which totaled $145 million of investment in the reliability of our transmission system. And finally our innovative microgrid project for The Department of Navy will begin commercial operation next month at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona.","Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next year and while the Corporation Commission addresses rate design modernization and we engage with stakeholders on our rate review. Our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing our core utility operations to prepare for the changing needs of our customers.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you Don and thank you again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016 which excluding historically mild weather were in line with our expectation. As summarised on Slide 3 of the materials for the third quarter of 2016, we earned $2.35 per share compared to $2.30 per share in the third quarter of 2015.","Slide 4 outlines variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, the largest single driver during the quarter was unfavourable weather which decreased earnings by $0.09. In aggregate, this year\u2019s third quarter was the mildest in the last 10 years where we experienced one of the hottest July\u2019s on record followed by some of the mildest August and September conditions we\u2019ve seen in the last 20 years.","Sales in the third quarter of this year compared to the third in 2015 added $0.02 to gross margin. In total, weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were essentially flat compared to last year but similar to the pattern we saw in the second quarter of this year, the sales trends by customer class were mixed and ending up yielding a positive gross margin effect. And lastly our transmission and LFCR adjuster continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed contributing $0.09 per share collectively.","Now turning to operating expenses which combined contributed $0.02 per share. Lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower other taxes each contributed a $0.01 to earnings. Lower D&A included higher expenses resulting from additional plans, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of Palo Verde sale leaseback.","In line with our expectations as we\u2019ve previously indicated operations and maintenance expense were flat in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. This also aligns with guidance with the projected increase in 2016 O&M over 2015 having been realized in the first half of the year. Interest expense, net of AFUDC was another positive driver to earnings during the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher balance offset by higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC.","As a reminder both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to the Palo Verde Unit-2 decommissioning recovered to a system benefit charge. The drivers - I discussed exclude these items as there is no net impact on third quarter results.","As Arizona\u2019s growing economy continues to be an integral part of our value proposition. I\u2019ll highlight next the trends we were seeing our local economy and in particular the Metro Phoenix area. In the latest quarter, the Metro Phoenix region continued its trend of generating solid job and population growth at rates above the national average. In fact, off the 15 largest metro areas across the country Metro Phoenix ranks at the third fastest growing area in population and the fourth fastest growing in jobs. This above average job growth holds true of virtually every major industry sector as well although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction, financial services and wholesale trade sectors.","This strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix areas commercial and residential real estate market. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the third quarter with over 1 million square feet of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in both markets helped to fall to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market which will in turn support commercial development.","The residential real estate market reflects these trends as well. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007, driven primarily by the single family market and overall the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels.","Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices which have returned to levels lasting in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who separate from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market and the economy more generally to expand in a healthy phase over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS\u2019s retail customer base grew 1.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and the economic development in Arizona appeared to be in place.","In closing, I will review our recent financing activity earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 20th, APS issued $250 million of 10-year 2.55% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily using connection with the payment of APS\u2019s August senior unsecured note maturity. On August 31st, Pinnacle West entered into a $75 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter Pinnacle West had $34 million outstanding under the facility and APS had $83 million of commercial paper outstanding. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong.","As Don discussed, in October the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.62 per share effective with our December payment. Looking to guidance, we expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. However, based on year-to-date results we expect to be in the lower half of the range. You\u2019ll find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying in our guidance included on Slide 6, which are unchanged.","Similar to prior years with rate case proceedings, we will evaluate the appropriate time to issue 2017 information and EPS guidance as the rate case progresses. In the meantime to assist with your estimates, we\u2019ve updated our rate based forecast in 2019 which was included in the appendix of today\u2019s slides.","The primary drivers have not changed and the trajectory of 6% to 7% growth off of 2015 continues. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and other drivers on our fourth quarter call as part of our 10-K update.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So quick first question, not sure if you can say too much. I think, if I saw right in the prepared remarks, you said you've shortlisted proposals, and will be finalizing a resource selection in the coming months.","Don Brandt","That\u2019s correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Can you confirm whether you guys have been shortlisted and\/or discuss any proposals that you all are pursuing as part of this RFP had process, be it for thermal and\/or any other kind of resource?","Jim Hatfield","No. At this point until we make a final selection, it\u2019s a confidential process.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, but coming months, any kind of better sense by year end or 1Q 2017?","Jim Hatfield","Yes, it will be by year end.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Okay great. Can you elaborate a little bit, and I know you started to in the commentary, but on the changes in the capital expenditures through the forecast period, I notice they've ticked up a little bit. What drove that, if you will?","Jim Hatfield","So I think, we look at 2016, 2017, 2018 up around $30 million a year most of it is distribution spend.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. So nothing too remarkable?","Jim Hatfield","No, I think what you\u2019ve seen the need to the cost to hook up commercial a little higher and it just, fine tuning our estimates as we get here unit the end of the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And just a follow-up on the last resource question. Any implications and\/or initial thought process around the proposed hike in the RPS?","Jim Hatfield","Nothing. I mean, we\u2019ll see what happens it\u2019s a proposal. Comments are due by the end of November and we\u2019ll see ultimately where that goes, on that subject though obviously an increase and would give us more upside to CapEx which is not really baked into anything at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Quick question about the economic conditions, that looks like they are steadily improving with each reporting period. I'm just wondering at what point do you think that translates into higher customer growth, higher load growth, and ultimately higher rate base, and everything else.","Jim Hatfield","So as we continue to see a further solidification of the market incremental new business we expect to the 2016 through 2018 you\u2019ll see a continual upward slope in customer growth resulting retail sales and what that means in terms of CapEx remains to be seen.","Michael Weinstein","All right. And can you comment at all on the headlines of late regarding the election, and everything else that might be happening out there?","Don Brandt","Michael there\u2019s as you pointed out, there is a lot of headlines both local, national and industry media. It is what it is, the election is not over with. You can get some pretty good reliable information at the Federal Election Commission website. The Arizona Secretary of States website and at pinnaclewest.com our political participation policy.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","For the last two consecutive quarters, we've been seeing flat weather-normalized sales growth, customer growth has been pretty consistent, anything to read into that? Are we seeing more changes in usage patterns, or too early, or can you just comment on this trend here?","Jim Hatfield","We\u2019re not really seeing anything different in usage [ph] patterns per customer obviously every residential that\u2019s added from a new units going to use less synergy then equivalent one or 10 years ago that\u2019s just the [indiscernible] world we\u2019re in we\u2019re 0.3% for the year and in line with guidance.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then if I look at the timeline on the rate case process, as you laid out, it looks like if there is to be a settlement, that January through March period would most likely be the time period before hearing but after all of the staff intervener testimony comes in?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. Rate design January 27 hearing March 22 that would be a window, where a settlement could occur.","Ali Agha","Got it. And then this target that you guys have been working on that, at a minimum, you target to earn this 9.5% ROE, should we assume that continues through this next two or three-year cycle of CapEx that you have laid out for us? Is that still a good benchmark to think about going forward?","Jim Hatfield","Well, we file for a rate case with 10.5% ROE. So assuming we get decent outcome in the rate case that supports the longer term growth Ocotillo, Four Corners, SCR\u2019s [ph] deferrals and so on, yes that would be a good benchmark to think about.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with our question.","Shahriar Pourreza","Let me just ask Mike's question slightly differently. It\u2019s been quarter after quarter, you've seen an improvement in the economic indicators, and the jobs and the housing. So the question is really when do you think that will transpire into your guidance, into your customer growth assumptions? Because right now, you're still at 50 basis points to 150 basis points of growth, but what's the lag between what you're seeing from an economic standpoint, to what you're seeing in your guidance?","Jim Hatfield","Well our guidance 2016 through 2018 from a sales growth perspective is a half of 1% sales on low end to 1.5% on the top end and I think as history has shown us in the last couple of years, slightly better improvement in customer growth and sales as we move through the timeframe. As I referenced earlier, with the low vacancy rates in apartments and low mortgage rates, you\u2019re seeing household formation 25 to 34 begin to increase across the country and that\u2019s holds true for the Metro Phoenix are as well. So it\u2019s going to be better in 2018 than it is this year. 2017 should be better than 2016. Exactly what that means, think you\u2019ll have to look to our guidance.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Don, I just wanted you to clarify something that I'm confused about. You said the staff is recommended a new customer category, or that rooftop solar customers should be in a partial requirements class? Is that correct?","Don Brandt","Yes. I\u2019ll turn to Jeff to comment on that.","Jeff Guldner","Charles, so one of the findings that\u2019s right now in the recommended or opinion or is recognized as the residential customers or the rooftop solar are partial requirement customer. So it\u2019s somewhere to what we\u2019ve seen on a commercial side where you got a customer brings their own generation and we treat those folks differently on the commercial side than a customer that\u2019s the full requirements customer and so that\u2019s a helpful finding in that recommended opinion order because it reflects the nature of that customers use.","Charles Fishman","So Jeff that would lead you then, I mean essentially what the staff is saying is consistent with your proposal of having this demand piece for the rooftop solar people, correct?","Jeff Guldner","That\u2019s the argument we\u2019ve made, is that these folks still use the demand side of the grid and so if you look at a commercial customer that\u2019s basically how we set the rates, is to recover the demand, the cost to service that reflects the fact that they bring their own generation and so again, this is going to be subject to discussion at the Open Meeting in December and we\u2019re obviously getting ready for that conversations, but it\u2019s the helpful finding that just reflects the facts of the system.","Charles Fishman","Okay, thanks a lot Jeff. Appreciated. That\u2019s it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Just as a follow-up, is it been determined that they are going to be treated with demand charts or is that still open to discussion?","Don Brandt","That\u2019s still open to discussion.","Paul Ridzon","And back to usage, sometimes we've seen extreme weather things mess with people's weather norm [ph] models, could that be going on here?","Jim Hatfield","I mean it\u2019s possible but really what we have is stronger commercial growth than we\u2019re seeing on the residential side which is sort of supporting the sales growth as we sit here today. I always say weather is an art, not a science, but it wasn\u2019t so extreme like you would see in the solar [ph] month, you sort of tend to skew your degree days.","Paul Ridzon","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed you\u2019re your question.","Greg Gordon","Sorry, I joined the call late. Have you commented on the integrated resource plan, and can you comment on it any further detail? And as a part of the shortfall, would one of the potential solutions be to acquire some of the power blocks out there? There's a lot of gas combined cycle sitting there underutilized, and I know you probably don't need base load generation. But at the values you might be able to pay to get some of those power blocks, even if they were used for intermediate or peaking, could that be a potentially good value proposition to solve that shortfall?","Don Brandt","Greg, I did cover in my remarks and we\u2019ve had a couple of questions on it, but we\u2019ve shortlisted a number of resources, we expect to resolve it by the end of the year and announce our plan going forward and beyond that we\u2019re not going to - we\u2019d prefer not to get in any detail of where we\u2019re at now in the process, it\u2019s confidential.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll see you in a few days.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Ted Geisler","Thank you, Christine. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our call."],"17412":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 20, 2015 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Paul Mountain - Director, IR ","Don Brandt - President and CEO","James Hatfield - EVP and CFO","Jeffrey Guldner - SVP, Public Policy for APS","Analysts","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2014 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public Policy; and Mark Schiavoni, APS\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today\u2019s comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our 2014 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through February 27.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today. The fourth quarter wrapped up a productive year, and set the stage for further progress in the year ahead. Earnings finished the year in the middle of the range after adjusting for below normal weather. APS\u2019s reliability and customer satisfaction remain in the top tier. Safety had another solid year and Palo Verde set a record for power production. In fact Palo Verde Unit No. 3 produced the second highest electricity output of any nuclear unit in the world in 2014 and all three Palo Verde units individually ranked among the top six producers in the United States. ","Jim will discuss the 2014 financial results but first I\u2019ll update you on the regulatory progress and discuss a few significant projects. In December the Arizona Corporation commission voted on several key issues and we appreciate their commitment to resolve these items before the bench turned over. I\u2019ll provide an update on two key issues in a moment but I\u2019d like to first thank commissioners Brenda Burns and Gary Pierce, whose terms ended in early January. We appreciate their commitment to the state over many years of public service and on driving the dialog on several complex regulatory issues. ","Commissioners Doug Little and Tom Forese were sworn in on January 5th to four year terms. Commissioner Susan Bitter Smith was selected by her fellow commissioners as the next chair succeeding Commissioner Stump who did a tremendous job leading the Commission through a challenging period. Governor Doug Ducey was also sworn in, leading a group of many new officials at the state level that are bringing a renewed focus to economic development in Arizona. We look forward to working Governor Ducey\u2019s team. ","I\u2019ll now provide an overview of the key dockets that were voted on in December at the commission. The Four Corners rate tariff was approved with rates in effect as of January 1st of this year. The $57.1 million rate change was $8 million below our request, however it was in line with the commission staffs and administrative law judges recommended order. We were pleased to have a final order in this matter. Separately the commission voted it had no objection for APS to build and own 10 megawatts of residential roof-top solar on approximately 1500 homes.","Now titled the APS Solar Partner program, installations will be given a spring. We\u2019ve had a great deal of interest from our customers and initiated the first of three requests for proposals to qualify local Arizona based installers at the end of January. We're in the process of determining the system feeders and customers to target, which will then be matched up with the selected installers who will inspect roofs and install the roof-top systems.","Putting this program in perspective, as of the end of 2014 APS has 30,000 residential roof-top installations, equating to about 200 megawatts of installed capacity. In 2014 interconnection application volume was down slightly from the record setting 2013 numbers, but actual installations in 2014 of 7,800 systems was the highest ever showing a 10% increase over 2013. ","This robust level of growth causes the unfair cost shift to continue increase. In addition the ACC initiated a generic docket in December titled in the matter of the inquiry in the solar DG business models and practices and their impacts on public service corporations and rate payers. Chairman Bitter Smith requested comments by February 13th. So the commission and staff are now reviewing the comments received last week. The next steps in timeline for this docket are expected to be discussed at an upcoming commission meeting. ","We have included 2015 calendar in our presentation to highlight the key dockets and dates ahead of us this year, including the docket I just mentioned. Let me highlight a few other items. Rate design discussions are surfacing after the initial discussion last fall. We're having discussions with several stakeholders to determine the best path forward. Late last year Salt River project proposed a broad rate restructuring and it is expected this will be voted on at their Board meeting on February 26. SRP's proposal includes several rate design principles that we have been advocating, primarily better alignment of fixed and variable cost and revenue. While each utility may have a different rate structure, it is clear from the national discussion and here in Arizona that appropriately addressing the unfair cost shift and aligning the fixed and variable discrepancy are a top priority.","The Ocotillo modernization project has moved a year closer to beginning construction, which is expected in 2016. We've been working on the necessary approvals and outreach to the surrounding community and are pleased with the reception we have received. The certificate of environmental compatibility was approved in November. The last milestone before construction will begin was raised during the commission's integrated resource planning meeting in the fall. While there was clear support for the first two units which replaced the existing steam units, questions were raised on the cost effectiveness of the additional three units.","We have maintained the importance of the five units to serve future load growth as well as improve the valley's reliability. However, to address the concerns that were raised we issued an RFP in late January for the incremental capacity equivalent to three of the five units. This process is expected to conclude in the summer.","One other item to watch is the Delaney-Colorado River transmission line decision; Trans-Canyon which is joint venture with BAG U.S. Transmission, formerly named Mid-American Transmission submitted its bid to the California ISO on November 19. In January the bidder list was disclosed, six bidders in total. The Cal-ISO is working through its qualification and selection process and we expect a decision this summer.","Lastly, I'll comment on a few recent environmental developments. On December 19, U.S. EPA issued its final regulations governing coal ash, which regulates coal combustion residuals as non-hazardous. Our initial estimate, a portion of which is included in our capital forecast is that our incremental cost to comply will be approximately $100 million, mostly at our Cholla plant.","We're also working with the corporation commission, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality known ADEQ and the Arizona Utilities to encourage the EPA to make revisions to Arizona's requirements under the clean power plan. Under the draft clean power plan, Arizona would be the second most impacted state in the nation.","While APS's diverse portfolio is a clear advantage, we are concerned about the impact on other utilities in the state, including the need for additional infrastructure and the cost to Arizonans associated with achieving the goals originally established. We support the State's efforts to enact legislation that enables ADEQ to submit a state plan to U.S. EPA. This legislation is necessary to assure EPA does not issue a federal plan for the state of Arizona.","Let me conclude by saying I'm very proud of the leadership of our people again this year, ranging from the pursuit of excellence each day across our operations and the safety of our employees and in the discussion on the complex topic rate design. I expect our team to again lead on these efforts in 2015 and that we will deliver on our commitments this year.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you Don. The topics I will cover today are outlined on Slide 3 and include a discussion of our 2014 financial results and update on the Arizona economy, a look at our financing activity and a review of earnings guidance. Slide 4 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings for the quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $5.4 million or $0.05 per share compared with ongoing earnings of $24.3 million or $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the full year 2014, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $398 million or $3.58 per share compared to net income of $406 million or $3.66 per share for 2013. Weather-normalized our earnings for 2014 would have been $3.68 in the middle of our guidance range at $3.60 to $3.75, translating earned consolidated earning of greater than 9.5%. Slide 5 outlines the full year earnings per share drivers compared to 2013. Primary favorable variances include higher gross margin supported by the various revenue adjustments and lower interest expense driven by our financing activities and the lower cost of longer term debt. ","The effect of adverse weather decreased earnings by $0.16 per share. To put the unfavorable weather effect in perspective, in terms of its impact on megawatt hours, 2014 was the second modest year in 15 years including the first quarter of 2014 which was the modest first quarter in 40 years. There was not much variance in the other drivers including operating and maintenance expenses.","Starting on Slide 6 let me walk through the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. An increasing gross margin improved earnings by $0.07 per share. I\u2019ll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Lower depreciation and amortization expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, in part due to the Palo Verde Unit 2 lease extension we announced in July, offset by additional plant in service.","Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges, resulting from refinancing long-term debt at a lower rate. Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, largely due to more fossil generation planned outages. A higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by $0.06 per share including a prior year tax benefit and the extension of bonus deprecation. The net impact of our other items decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.","Turning to Slide 7, and the components of the net increase of $0.07 in our gross margin. The main components of this were as follows: the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.01 per share, which, as designed, offset some of the impact from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy.","The Arizona Sun program benefited earnings by $0.01 per share, primarily driven by the 32 megawatt Gila Bend solar project that went into service. The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.03 per share. Although weather in both 2014 and 2013 fourth quarters was less favorable than normal, fourth quarter 2014 benefited from warmer October compared to the same month in 2013. ","Higher usage by APS's customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago increased quarterly results by $0.01 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were up 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus 2013. The favorable variance was partly due to the low usage we saw in the fourth quarter in 2013 and was in line with our expectations of where we would end the year. The net impact of other miscellaneous items added $0.01 per share. ","As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under our adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction and the impacts to our non-controlling interest for the Palo Verde lease extension are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact in 2014 results.","Slide 8 presents the look at the Arizona economy in our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona\u2019s economy continued the steady improvement in the fourth quarter of 2014. Job growth in Arizona and in Phoenix Metro area picked up modestly at the end of the year and for the quarter. Arizona added jobs at a 2.6% rate as seen on the lower right hand side of slide 8.","Business services, healthcare, tourism and consumer services are each adding jobs in excess of 4% on a year-over-year basis and most other sectors continue to grow at more modest rates. The job growth we\u2019re seeing reflects the attractiveness of Metro Phoenix and Arizona is a great place to do business with excellent access to California and other markets, but with much lower cost structure. This continued job growth is providing a stable pace of absorption in commercial, office and retail space yielding a continued decline in vacancy rate in those sectors. As these markets tighten up we expect to see disruption activity regain.","As an example Phoenix Metro area currently has 2.9 million square feet of office space currently under construction most which will be delivered this year. This is the highest amount of office construction since 2009. Although the retail sector remains quite, investor space continues to be in high demand with 4 million square feet under construction, primarily in our West Valley territory. We are also seeing continual increases in Metro Phoenix housing demand although the increase in demand is presently being met largely with multi-family development.","Total housing permits and multi-family permits both at cycle highs in 2014 providing their best year since 2007 as you can see in the panel at lower left. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and absorption of residential and commercial vacancies and believe that these trends will translate into higher overall housing activity. The future market share for apartments versus single-family homes remains a question and is largely dependent on the degree of strength in existing single-family home markets.","As you can see in the panel at the upper left, existing home prices has recovered substantially from their recession lows and continue to increase year-on-year. The recovery in prices reflects the continual absorption of vacant homes apartments in Metro Phoenix and the normalization of foreclosure sales activity. While existing home prices may not have recovered enough yet to spur new single-family home construction, the apartment markets is enjoying the lowest vacancy rate it has seen in 15 years and we believe it is only a matter of time before our new single-family market moves more decidedly in the upward direction.","On balance, we see size of sustained improvement in our economic environment and a gradually steady recovery. As in past recoveries, it is likely the each successive year in the near term would be stronger as we go forward. Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% compared with the fourth quarter last year, in line with our forecast. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly the long term fundamental supporting future population and job growth in Arizona appear to be in place.","Slide 9 outlines our financing activities. Of January 12, APS achieved $250 million of five year 2.20% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and to replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We plan to refinance a $300 million maturity in 2015 and raise that to $275 million of additional long term debt as assumed in our guidance. Overall, liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding and APS had a $147 million of commercial paper outstanding.","A quick note on pension. Our funded status remained strong at 90% as of year-end 2014 in line with year-end 2013. This was due to largely to the continued implementation of our liability driven investment strategy. The higher funded status translates to lower long term funding requirements. Also in October, the Society of Actuaries issued its final report on mortality tables. We have incorporated a modified version of a mortality assumptions in our pension calculation which we believe better reflects our employees' demographics. Additional detail is shown on the slide included in the appendix of today's presentation. Finally,","I'll review our earnings guidance and the financial outlook on Slide 10. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share. The rate adjustments in cost management remain important drivers. A complete list with factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides which are unchanged.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Eggers your line is live, perhaps you have yourself on mute.","Don Brandt","We can go to the next question, Dan can get back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha ","First question, I know you guys talked about the weather impact in 2014 on the earnings but as recently at the end of the Q3 results, or around EEI time, we were still looking at the 360 to 375 guidance range for the year. So when we look at the 358 that you reported, what were the big factors relative to your own assumptions in the fourth quarter that caused us to miss the lower end of guidance for the year?","James Hatfield","Well, we had negative weather in the fourth quarter as we talked about. We also had the extension of bonus depreciation which pushed out our ability to use production tax credits which had a negative impact of about $0.03 on the quarter as well. ","Ali Agha ","Got it, okay. And then secondly, looking at the dynamic between weather-normalized sales growth and customer growth, I know, quarterly numbers tend to gets queued, but your customer growth has been fairly steady, 1% and yet we saw the 1.9% weather-normalized sales number in the quarter. Again anything to extrapolate from that and just remind us what the expectations are for customer growth and weather-normalized growth for 2015?","Don Brandt","Well, for customer growth we\u2019re looking 1.5% to 2.5% for \u201815 with 1.4% fourth quarter of this year. Weather-normalized sales sort of flat to 1% range. I think it\u2019s important in the fourth quarter of 2013 we had, I think a negative 2% sales growth and I would not look at the quarter in and of itself. I would really look over the course of the year where we really had sort of flat sales and 1.4% customer growth. ","Ali Agha ","Got it. And my last question Jim, with regards to the current thinking in terms of the timing of the next rate case and the earliest need for equity, just remind us again where you stand today on both of those factors. ","James Hatfield","No change really, we\u2019re looking at not filling until at the earliest mid-16 at equity again no earlier than 2016 at the earliest.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon ","Just real quickly, do you have any sizable maturities coming up and kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunities on the interest lend?","Don Brandt","While we have 300 million of debt maturing earlier this year -- later this year which we'll refinance. We also have maturities in 2016 and then our big maturity is on 2019. So we\u2019ll look at all factors when we look at that in today\u2019s interest rate environment. We chose January to take advantage the short end of the curve due to demand but we still have historically low interest rates across the board and see that those refinancing got really an opportunity to incrementally provide some interest savings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","I was wondering if you can characterize how the discussions at the commission have been going with regard to rate design. I understand comments were was taken and is the process moving forward at a quick pace, regular place? Has it installed recently, and what kind of initiatives, what\u2019s the involvement of the Company in those discussions.","Jeffrey Guldner","Michael, this is Jeff Guldner. So I think those discussions are moving forward at a normal pace and so what you\u2019re seeing right now is comments from the parties here in Arizona, obviously folks are also paying attention on what\u2019s happening on the national scene and there's a lot of discussions that are happening nationally and we're engaged in both of those. So we're engaged at a state level. We're also participating in the national debate.","Michael Weinstein","Right and would you say that the things are moving along at the pace you expected?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes, I think what you'll see -- so you've got two new commissioners that have just taken their seats and so I think you'll see the discussions continue to accelerate here in the next few months.","Michael Weinstein","And do you still expect that or -- do you have any expectation that rate design and metering, those types of issues be dealt with separately outside of the rate case or whether they'll be rolled into a rate case?","Jeffrey Guldner","Well, it's a state wide issue. So remember there's going to be a discussion on this, what it means from a state perspective, how the implementation happens as part of that discussion. And so we've got a mechanism right now that is the LFCR DG adjuster. That's a component or that's one method of addressing really the cost shift issue, but structurally how do you the rate design changes. We know a lot of that's going to happen in a rate case.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, I guess maybe the crux of the question is more like when do these, when does action have to be taken by the commission on this docket? How early does it have to happen? What's the latest that could happen before so that a separate process could occur or at some point I guess it's just too late, you've to roll it in into the rate case because the file is coming in mid '16?","Jeffrey Guldner","So, there is no time clock on the discussion. So the discussion -- I can't tell you when the discussion is going to -- how it's going to specifically unfold, but from a process standpoint, some rate design changes are going to have to happen in a rate case. It's helpful to have the discussion of what that process should look like and what some of the issues are ahead of the rate case filing.","Operator","It appears we've no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Don Brandt","All right, well, thanks everyone. I mean as you look at the 10-K and then materials please give us a call if you have any questions and we'll talk with you soon.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings, recent developments and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Mark Schiavoni, APS\u2019s Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today\u2019s comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our 2015 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through February 26.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range, with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results and outlook. My comments will focus mostly on the year ahead.","Our fleet performed very well in 2015, highlighted by Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station\u2019s highest output ever equating to a capacity factor of 94.3%. One of Palo Verde\u2019s key strengths is the ability of the team to perform at an excellent level, but to also drive continuous improvement each year.","2016 marks the beginning of a new period for our fleet. In total, we are planning to invest over $3.6 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We are investing in two large projects in our fossil fleet as well as a few innovative investments, and some IT systems to prepare our operations for the long-term. The two large fossil projects are the Ocotillo modernization project and the selective catalytic reduction pollution controls, or SCRs, as they are called, at the Four Corners Generating Plant.","Four Corners Unit 5 entered a major outage in January to make several upgrades and begin laying the groundwork for the SCR installations. The innovative investments I will outline are designed to increase customer and system reliability and meet future resource needs. In November, we announced a partnership with the Department of the Navy to develop a 25 megawatt microgrid project at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. This is APS\u2019s first micro-grid project in the first military base to secure 100% backup power. We also plan to install a 40-megawatt solar facility this year on behalf of some of our larger customers. This amount has been reflected in our 2016 CapEx budget.","The Solar Partner program, which is planned for 1,500 APS-owned rooftop solar installations, is on track to be fully installed and operational by mid 2016. And just this month, we officially launched our solar innovation study, a 75-home demand rate laboratory here in the Metro Phoenix area, which will determine how customers can use various combinations of distributed energy, resources such as solar panels, battery storage, smart thermostats, and high-efficiency HVAC systems to better manage their energy environments. These customers will also be placed on our existing residential demand rate, and the study will provide valuable information on customer\u2019s ability to use technology to manage peak demand and lower their bills.","In addition to generation investments, we are upgrading several IT systems to improve our customer interface, facilitate active operation of our transmission and distribution systems, and enable participation in the California ISO Energy Imbalance Market. These investments along with our advanced meter program, which is fully deployed are enabling integration of advanced technologies while also allowing us to maintain grid stability.","2016 also represents an important year on the regulatory calendar with the APS rate case said to be filed on June 1. APS submitted the Notice of Intent to file on January 29, which gives notice to the ACC and stakeholders and outlines the primary topics we will propose in the June rate filing. APS will propose the new rates go into effect July 1, 2017 based on the test year ended December 31, 2015 with certain adjustments. To help achieve this outcome, we have held a series of stakeholder meetings to provide clarity and transparency with the stakeholders. We are also planning to submit an extensive list of standard discovery questions and responses with the June 1 filing.","Let me outline a few of the central topics from the Notice of Intent to filing. Residential rate design is an area, where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices and incentivize cost reducing technologies. And we will be proposing universal demand rates as well as shifting our time-of-use periods to later in the day. We will also propose revenue per customer decoupling mechanism that will be adjusted annually to replace the existing lost fixed cost recovery mechanism. The decoupling mechanism will be proposed on a trial basis until the next rate case to act as a rate stabilizing mechanism during the transition period to the new rate structure.","The last item I will mention is we will request the deferral of cost related to two large CapEx projects we are investing in the SCRs at Four Corners, and the fast ramping natural gas modernization project at Ocotillo. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years, within service states of 2018 and 2019, respectively. And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we will also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR costs similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.","The docket on value and cost of distributed generation has testimony due on February 25. There are also four other electric rate cases in process. UNS Electric is the first in line with hearings set to begin on March 1 in Tucson. We are an active intervener in the UNS case since it is an important forum to discuss rate design. The testimony we filed supports the concept of three-part rate design, which incorporates a fixed service charge and energy charge and the demand charge. This concept was also proposed and supported by UNS Electric and the ACC staff. Related topics including methodologies for determining the cost to serve customers with solar and the value of solar will be a central focus in the value and cost of distributed generation docket.","In closing, we delivered on our commitments in 2015, and we are well positioned for 2016 and the long-term with a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan.","I will now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don and thank you, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As you can see, on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year and ended on a strong note. Before I review the details of our 2015 results, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.37 per share, compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Slide 4 outlines the variances, which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, higher retail sales, favorable weather and the adjustment mechanism were all positive contributors. Also as we anticipated, lower operations and maintenance expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 improved earnings largely due to lower planned fossil outages.","Now turning to Slide 5, let\u2019s review some of the details of our full year results. We delivered positive results in the top line of our guidance range, earning $3.92 per share compared to $3.58 per share in 2014 and earned a consolidated ROE of 9.77%, which was in line with our goal of achieving more than 9.5%. Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, including favorable year-over-year weather. The adjustment mechanisms were also earnings accretive in 2015 including the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, transmission and our Arizona Sun program. The Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1, 2015, was the largest driver in gross margin. However, keep in mind that the Four Corners rate change was largely offset in D&A. Higher usage by APS customers in 2015 versus 2014 contributed to earnings. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer behavior and distributed generation were up 0.70%, year-over-year.","2015 was our strongest year for retail sales growth since 2008, including three out of four quarters, in which combined customer and usage growth outweighed the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation. Operations and maintenance expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due in part to our ongoing cost management efforts. The largest reductions include a decrease in employee benefit costs and the lower costs related to fossil plant outages. Lower interest expense net of AFUDC was another benefit to earnings to 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease included reduced charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at a lower rate and higher construction and work in progress balances benefiting AFUDC.","Higher depreciation and amortization expense was a primary headwind to 2015 earnings as compared to 2014. As we reported all year, higher D&A decreased earnings due in part to the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and the cost associated with the Four Corners acquisition in 2013. Additional plant in service also reduced year-over-year earnings. Because Arizona\u2019s economy has been an integral part of our business story, let me highlight to you the trends we are seeing in our local economy, in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.","By and large what you see on Slide 6 is the continuation of the consistent growth trends we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the fourth quarter in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average as it has for the past 18 quarters. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial, business sectors, consumer services sectors, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. Notably, the construction sector has been adding jobs in the last two quarters at a rate of about 7%. Growth in consumer spending remains robust and the housing market continues to strengthen. Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen in the lower panel.","In 2015, the housing market recorded its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector, by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits respectively. This level of single-family permit activity represents an increase over the prior year of almost 50%. As you can see on the slide, we expect the housing market to improve in 2016 with total housing permits within the range of 25,000 to 32,000.","In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years. As I mentioned before, Arizona and the Metro Phoenix remained attractive places to live and do business especially as it is situated relative to the high cost California market. 2015 was better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction and we expect to see 2016 to be better than 2015. Reflecting a steady improvement in economic conditions, APS\u2019s retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the fourth quarter last year and 1.2% year-over-year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Now, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. Last quarter, we issued Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016, which we continue to expect to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. The adjustment mechanism, particularly transmission and the LFCR, along with modest sales growth and normal weather remained the key gross margin drivers.","O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spend remains flat. As you may recall, last year, we have reported that we had moved a planned Four Corners unit outage from 2015 to 2016. 2016 includes major planned outages of both Four Corners and Cholla. The planned 82-day major overhaul at Four Corners Unit 5 started in January, which creates a Q1 2016 earnings headwind of about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind this was factored into our guidance.","Overall, our focus remains on our cost management efforts as we look through 2016 and beyond, but the outages are our priority for us this year. One other comment on O&M, the funding status of our pension plan remains strong at 88% as of year end 2015, but the continued implementation of our liability driven investment strategy has helped us keep cost down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension plan. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance in the appendix to our slides which are unchanged.","As Don mentioned, our balance sheet remained strong. I will outline our financing plan and how the impact of bonus depreciation has factored in. We have already assumed a 2-year extension of bonus depreciation and that was incorporated to our rate base disclosure in the last earnings call. Our updated estimates can be found in the appendix, which show an incremental reduction in rate base of approximately $200 million in 2018 as a result of the bonus depreciation. However, the extension also resulted in approximately $550 million of total cash benefit through 2019, which provides financing flexibility over that time horizon.","In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS\u2019 spend to average around $1.2 billion annually from 2016 to 2018, which will be primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. With this capital spending level taking into account the bonus depreciation, we continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2018. Turning to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance a $250 million maturity in August and anticipate issuing of $0.25 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, liquidity remains very strong. At the end of 2015, neither Pinnacle West nor APS had any short-term debt outstanding.","In summary, given the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the extension of bonus depreciation, we no longer forecast the need for additional equity. The net effect of bonus depreciation and the removal of equity leads us relatively neutral from an earnings perspective. We will continue to review our capital forecast to identify additional investment opportunities as we move forward.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers","Hi, good morning guys.","Don Brandt","Good morning Dan.","Dan Eggers","Just on the revenue per customer decoupling mechanism you talked about in your opening remarks, you said there were going to be some adjuster mechanisms as you go ahead, try and rebalance to keep you guys on hold, can you just explain to me how that\u2019s going to work and kind of how you propose for that to work going forward?","Don Brandt","Jeff is sitting right here. Dan, I will let him try on that one.","Jeff Guldner","Sure, Dan, so there was an extensive discussion in Arizona a few years ago around decoupling mechanisms in general. In our last rate case, we had proposed that LFCR mechanism as a \u2013 essentially from the settlement process. But the way our revenue per customer mechanism would work is it takes into account all of the different adjustments, so whether sales as well as just other changes to essentially changes to the normal revenue requirement process, but what it does is it looks that it to accommodate customer growth, right. So as customers grow and we are making additional investments into the system, we need to be able to pickup the additional costs that come from that growth. Did that make sense?","Dan Eggers","Yes, that makes sense. Okay. Don, you also said, you guys were going to change the kind of peak period from a demand charge perspective toward a pricing perspective, what hours are you looking to move that to\u2026?","Don Brandt","Have we arrived at those yet, Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Still working through obviously the stakeholder process, but pushing it more towards the first later in the day, because that\u2019s where you see the need to essentially focus on the peak?","Dan Eggers","Okay. So kind of the evening, early evening hours I guess\u2026?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. Early evening, we have got current rates, primary time use rate is 12 to 7 peak period. And so, we\u2019d both shorten that up and then move it out later in the day. And that\u2019s partly responding to the dot curve what you see in the wholesale market up here from the over generation that happens in the middle of the day.","Don Brandt","As our summer peak this last year was at 5 o'clock to 6 o'clock maybe afternoon, early evening and that\u2019s been typically the time of hitting our peak.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. And I guess, you know, how do you guys see this working, I guess, with all the parties involved? Obviously, the Nevada process has gotten challenged and maybe a little bit sloppy in retrospect. Do you see common ground where this works to get to a fair conclusion all the way around or this is probably going to be another contentious process?","Don Brandt","Well, I think there will be some additional element in this that is typical, but the last few cases have been very well organized and executed by all 22, 23 parties, and that\u2019s certainly I think the direction we, the staff will go and the vast majority of the parties would intend to proceed.","Dan Eggers","Should we be watching the UniSource case as indicative of what you guys will try and accomplish as well?","Don Brandt","UniSource is going to be an important discussion. That\u2019s the first case in the state that\u2019s really focused on the changes to residential rate design. That\u2019s why we have got four witnesses in that case. So obviously, that\u2019s probably a case to watch.","Dan Eggers","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Don Brandt","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Shar Pourreza","Good morning, everyone.","Don Brandt","Hey, Shar.","Shar Pourreza","So, just on the shifting of the demand rates later in the day, is there any potential impact if we get a successful launch with the EIM, can that sort of that peak demand period smooth out a little bit?","Jeff Guldner","No, Shar, this is Jeff. EIM helps balance really intra-hour. It\u2019s not affecting the underlying wholesale market. So, what you see in that shift and it\u2019s not the shift of demand rates, but that shift of the time-of-use period, the peak period out to later in the day is reflecting that ramp that comes later in the day from the duck curve.","Shar Pourreza","Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just thinking about sort of have you \u2013 is there \u2013 are we anywhere in the process as far as looking at gas storage opportunities right now around APS?","Don Brandt","No, nothing in the process.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. Okay. And then lastly, the toll does sort of expire I think next year. Any updates there as far as looking at new build or acquiring in-state generation or another toll?","Jeff Guldner","Well, we will be going out next month, I believe, with all resource RFP for \u2013 with the beginning date later. This decade is really designed with not only the heat rate options, which are not flexible than have been or will expire. And then we have a toll in \u201816 and a toll in \u201819. So this process and we will get being all resource, I expect to see various resources in there and we will evaluate -- and evaluate where we are and what we need and we will move from there.","Shar Pourreza","Okay, got it. But new build is still an option?","Jeff Guldner","Yes. I think we have great optionality here. I mean, we can extend the tolls shorter term, long-term. We could new build if it was the right thing to do. But right now, we will just see what comes into the RFP.","Shar Pourreza","Excellent. Thanks, Jeff and Don.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. In regard to the shifting of the time-of-use rates to later in the day, how much value do you really see shifting or being shifted as a result of that change?","Jeff Guldner","This is Jeff. So, what you are trying to do, we have a fuel adjuster, right, which is going to pick up essentially the cost of the fuel burn, but what you are trying to do and shift that out later is to align the customer response with when we see the need for essentially conservation on the system. And so what it\u2019s...","Michael Weinstein","I guess, what I am asking is how much value is being lost right now by having the time of these rates peaking too early in the day?","Jeff Guldner","It\u2019s a customer issue. So, if you have the time of use rates fixed, you don\u2019t have essentially, for example, on the solar side, you are not providing credit at noon at a peak rate when the wholesale market is negative.","Michael Weinstein","Oh, I see. So, this is \u2013 yes, I guess what I am trying to find out is how much money is the utility losing by providing peak pricing at times of the non-peak usage?","Jeff Guldner","Yes, Michael, there is no money loss for APS. It\u2019s really a shifting and sending the right pricing signals to \u2013 what was done whey they were put in before to what we are seeing in today\u2019s marketplace. It\u2019s an alignment issue.","Michael Weinstein","Do you have any sense of how much of the shift, how much in dollar terms that shift is?","Don Brandt","It\u2019s a rate design issue. So, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s part of the rate design process. We are trying to align the retail rates with the wholesale market.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Also, yes I was just going to shift to another question, but we can talk more about that offline.","Don Brandt","The issue is, its rate design, so it\u2019s revenue neutral, so\u2026","Michael Weinstein","I understand it\u2019s revenue neutral. I am just trying to get at what\u2019s the impact on solar, on the third-party solar in the state and how \u2013 what\u2019s the impact on them in terms of cost shifting and what kind of rate shift will they see as a result and how it\u2019s going to impact adoption rates? On a separate topic, Doug Little was recently in New York City and he was talking about reducing regulatory lag as a high priority. And this goes along the lines of you applying for a decoupling mechanism. I am just wondering are there other forms of rate lag, structural rate lag that you could seek to eliminate under the new commission make up?","Don Brandt","We have made a fair number of changes really over the last probably 2 or 3 rate cases that have picked that up. A lot of it comes in the time to process the case and trying to get that processing time down to a year or so and things we have done with that are for example pre-filing the discovery. So we don\u2019t wait, file the case, wait for 3, 4 months and then begin the discovery process. And so a lot of that\u2019s been worked out, obviously adjuster mechanisms and how you can work on adjustment mechanisms can help smooth out even further. And so that\u2019s probably going to be some of the discussion you will see and that\u2019s part of what we have been talking about with stakeholders.","Michael Weinstein","Right. Are there any important differences between your rate design and the UNS case, the UNS rate design that we should be looking for as we watch that case?","Don Brandt","I think the general issue that\u2019s coming up in UNS is how it\u2019s going to apply broadly across the customer base. And so the commission staff that proposed that the three-part rate design be applied to all residential customers and that\u2019s one of the key issues to look at, I think.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Jim, first, wanted to clarify your comment, when you said with bonus depreciation extension equity needs have been taken out of the equation. Does that mean through this 2018 period or when at the earliest do you now see any need for equity?","Jim Hatfield","I don\u2019t see any equity needs, Ali, through the planning horizon.","Ali Agha","That runs through 2018?","Jim Hatfield","Yes, but through the end of this decade, frankly.","Ali Agha","End of this decade, okay. And then secondly given that fact, if I look at your updated rate base numbers, if I take \u201815 as the starting point, the \u201815 through \u201818 CAGR is about 6%. So, should we assume EPS should pretty much follow that since there is no equity dilution to factor in or should we think about the EPS CAGR there?","Jim Hatfield","I think as we have said in the past, EPS CAGR is somewhere between rate base growth and dividend growth as we think about those as your two boundaries.","Ali Agha","And dividend growth, you have talked about, 4% annually, if I recall correctly?","Jim Hatfield","5% was the last dividend increase.","Ali Agha","Okay, okay. And then a question to you, Don, wanted to get your view, we have seen a pickup in consolidation in the utility space, we have seen very large premiums being paid out there. Just wondering, what\u2019s your perspective is and do you see a role for Pinnacle West in that consolidation process we are seeing out there?","Don Brandt","Well, you are right, there is a lot going on out there, but we don\u2019t really comment on M&A. I will say we are focused on our excellent operations and continuing that. And we believe, growing earnings and providing \u2013 will provide shareholder value without combining operations with another entity.","Ali Agha","Would you agree with the assessment that valuations that are being paid appear excessive or do you think those are reasonable out there?","Don Brandt","I think each one of them is unique to the specific transaction.","Ali Agha","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Jim, I just want to confirm, ROE for 2015, you said 9.77 and I am assuming that\u2019s weather normalized?","Jim Hatfield","No. That\u2019s based on the 3.92. And that\u2019s at the Pinnacle level.","Charles Fishman","Okay. So it\u2019s a book.","Jim Hatfield","Yes.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And do you have it for \u2013 well, I am looking at my model and I have 9.6 last year, what \u2013 am I comparing apples-to-apples?","Jim Hatfield","I think that\u2019s pretty close, yes.","Charles Fishman","Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Andy Levi","Actually all my questions have been answered, but it\u2019s nice to hear a call where there are no \u2013 make your number and your forecast is good and that there is no like pension plugs or anything like that, so that\u2019s it, all of my question have been answered. Thank you.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Andy.","Don Brandt","Thanks Andy. We like it that way too.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Mountain. You may begin.","Paul J. Mountain","Thank you, Latonya. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2013 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Senior Vice President of Customers & Regulation, is also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our second quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements cautionary language, as well as the Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days and will also be available by telephone through August 9.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald E. Brandt","Thank you, Paul, and thank you for joining us today. This is a very special conference call for us. It's Becky Hickman sitting at my side here, and this is her last call that she'll sit at my side in her long career here at Pinnacle and APS. And I've enjoyed working with Becky for 10.5 years. She's been here a lot longer than that, and she'll be retiring in just a few weeks. And Becky, I know I speak on behalf of the dozens of people on this call. The APS team and myself personally thank you very much for all your contributions to our company, our shareholders and the State of Arizona. You've been a good partner, and I'm proud to call you a friend.","Rebecca L. Hickman","Thanks, Don.","Donald E. Brandt","Back to the business at hand. During the second quarter, we made progress towards our financial targets by executing on our strategy. Another solid quarter operationally and financially gave us the confidence to raise our 2013 guidance. At the same time, we focused on several regulatory policy issues in Arizona, which I'll cover first. I'll also provide an operational update and Jim will discuss the results of the quarter and update you on our earnings guidance and financial outlook.","Now turning to Arizona regulation for a few moments. In its open meeting on May 9, the Arizona Corporation Commission voted to reexamine the facilitation of a deregulated electric market in Arizona. The commission opened a docket and set a procedural schedule to solicit comments from interested parties on the pros and cons of retail market deregulation. Responses were submitted July 15, with reply comments due August 16. In the comments APS submitted on July 15, we encouraged the commission not to trade Arizona's long record of affordable rates, reliable service and customer satisfaction for the risk and uncertainties associated with deregulation. The commission stated it plans to convene an open meeting after it's had an opportunity to review the written comments. And the meeting has not been scheduled, but we expect it to take place in September or October of this year. On July 12 of this year, we filed APS's proposed solution with the commission on a policy revision for net metering. The proposal was developed after we held 6 technical conferences this spring with various stakeholders. The primary issue with net metering is fairness among customers who have rooftop solar and those customers who do not. APS's net metering proposal is built around 2 options, either of which would ensure that APS residential customers who install rooftop solar pay a fair price for their use of the electricity grid, but also receive upfront cash incentives and appropriate compensation for their solar energy production. There is no set procedural schedule on this docket, but we expect extensive dialogue with resolution later this year or early next year.","Now turning to our Four Corners power plant. In light of the docket being opened on deregulation, we determined in June that it would not be prudent for APS to complete its acquisition of Southern California Edison's interest in Four Corners until the commission's intentions with regard to deregulation become clear. In the meantime, we intend to maintain all necessary regulatory and other approvals to ensure the necessary steps to complete the acquisition remain on track. Additionally, our team also worked with the United States EPA to seek a necessary extension from the July 1 to the December 31 of this year for the required notification of APS's decision on the best available retrofit technology or as it's called, BART, for Four Corners.","Now turning to the rest of our operations. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another solid operational quarter, with a capacity factor of 90%. As I discussed on the first quarter call, the spring refueling outage at Unit 1 was completed in less than 30 days, the shortest in Palo Verde's history. Palo Verde continues its very strong performance and a recent evaluation by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations has validated that it is one of the best-run nuclear facilities in the nation. INPO indicated that overall performance at Palo Verde, which is, as you know, the nation's top energy-producing facility, is excellent. I'm extremely proud of the Palo Verde team and commend our Chief Nuclear Officer, Randy Edington, and the entire workforce at Palo Verde, for the high standard that is consistently maintained throughout the plant every single day. They have instilled a culture of continuous improvement, with a focus on safety and excellence in all aspects of their operation, which is our goal throughout the APS organization. This is also demonstrated by the recent announcement by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, that Palo Verde is one of the safest workplaces in Arizona, naming it a Voluntary Protection Program STAR Site.","APS also continues to be a leader in utility-scale solar. The completion of Yuma Foothills Phase 2 and the Hyder II project later this year will grow our AZ Sun platform to 118 megawatts in commercial operation by the end of this year. In addition, work will begin this fall on the 32-megawatt Gila Bend plant, which is expected to come online in mid-2014. As part of APS's Renewable Energy Standard implementation plan filing that we made on July 12 of this year, APS is seeking approval to conduct RFPs, sign contracts and begin construction on the final 50 megawatts of its 200-megawatt AZ Sun Program. We also expect the 250-megawatt Solana project to reach commercial operation in the third quarter, with APS purchasing 100% of that power, which is a key step to meeting our Renewable Energy Standard target. Solana is a concentrating solar trough facility, the largest of its kind, located 70 miles southwest of Phoenix. The concentrating solar design, along with the plant's thermal storage capabilities, will allow solar-powered energy to be produced for up to 6 hours after sundown.","On the customer service side of our business, APS has once again been recognized in the J.D. Power and Associates residential customer survey published last month as being in the top decile among large investor-owned utilities in overall customer satisfaction.","To conclude, I remain positive on our future and assure you that the entire management team remains focused on delivering on our commitments.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James R. Hatfield","Thank you, Don. Today, I will discuss the following topics: First, I will review our second quarter results, including the earnings and the primary variances from last year's corresponding quarter; second, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy; third, I will review our current credit ratings and financing activities; and finally, I will review our 2013 earnings guidance and financial outlook.","Slide 6 summarizes our ongoing and GAAP earnings for the quarter and year-to-date. On a GAAP basis for this year's second quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $131 million or $1.18 per share, compared with net income of $122 million or $1.11 per share for the prior year's second quarter.","Our ongoing earnings increased $0.06 per share. For the 2013 second quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $131 million or $1.18 per share, versus ongoing net income of $123 million or $1.12 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago. Slide 21 in the Appendix reconciles our second quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share, which excludes results related to our discontinued operations. My remaining comments will focus on ongoing results.","Slide 7 displays the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. An increase in our gross margin added $0.12 per share compared with the prior year's second quarter period. I will cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","Higher operations and maintenance expenses reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, consisting largely of higher employee benefits cost related to the effects of the amortization in this year's second quarter of certain pension and other post-retirement benefit cost, compared with the regulatory deferral of such cost as part of the 2012 settlement. The O&M variance excludes costs related to the Renewable Energy Standard or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms.","The net effect of other miscellaneous items, primarily higher depreciation, decreased earnings by $0.02 per share.","Turning to Slide 8, in the components of the net increase of $0.12 in our gross margin, the main components of this increase were as follows: APS's regulatory settlement, which became effective July 1, 2012, improved gross margin by $0.18 per share, almost all of which were comprised of a nonfuel base rate increase. When the 2012 settlement became effective, the company also began recording revenues from the new Lost Fixed Cost Recovery mechanism or LFCR and stopped recording line extension fees as revenue.","Higher transmission revenue increased earnings by $0.06 per share. Increased fuel and purchased power cost, net of lower off-system sales and lower mark-to-market valuations, reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. This variance is a result of the Power Supply Adjustor modification, effective mid-2012, with the implementation of the regulatory settlement that changed the PSA to a 100% pass-through, as compared to the 90-10 sharing mechanism that was previously in effect. The effects of weather, the combination of year-over-year variations in heating and cooling degree days and relative humidity reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. Although weather in the second quarter of both this year and last year were more favorable than normal, this year's quarter was milder.","As a reminder, we use a 10-year rolling average to define normal weather versus the industry norm of 30 years and 80 degrees Fahrenheit as a cooling degree day threshold for residential sales. Our model show these parameters provide a better indication of normal weather.","Turning to Slides 9 and 10, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued its overall improvement in the second quarter of 2013, although the growth remains modest as has been the case for last year or so.","As shown on Slide 9, the rate of overall job growth has been positive for the last 2 years and appears to be stabilizing around the 2% level. Nearly all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some work. The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting a gradual increase in incomes and consumer spending and has pushed Arizona's unemployment rate down generally in parallel with national trends. While these trends are positive, we believe we still have to, at a minimum, up to a year to go before we see local markets returning to more normal conditions.","Also on Slide 9, you can see our estimate of the amount of vacant homes and apartments that presently exist in our Metro Phoenix service territory. In the second quarter of 2013, the number of vacancies has continued to fall, such that we are currently below the level of 2007, where existing home resale pricing is more supportive of new home construction.","On Slide 10, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices, as reflected in the Case-Shiller repeat sales index. Throughout 2012, we saw steady increases in existing home prices and these positive trends have continued in 2013. The resurgence in home prices has sparked more demand for new housing. However, we are hearing that homebuilders continue to face hurdles in acquiring and developing land at reasonable prices, attracting skilled labor and controlling building materials costs, particularly at the entry-level of the market. The ability of homebuilders to successfully navigate through these challenges will have a sizable influence on the pace of the Phoenix and Arizona construction recovery over the next several quarters.","Slide 10 also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market. As you can see on the slide, vacancy rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels but remain quite high, while those for industrial space have fallen more dramatically. Again, we view this as a positive trend, but believe the extent of vacant space in the office and retail markets means the recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.","On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in all economic indicators, which paint a picture of continuing steady recovery. But it will still be about 3 quarters or so before the Arizona economy has returned to normal levels of economic activity and growth. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% year-to-date as compared with a year ago.","Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona's growth are still here, and that our customer growth rate will return to more typical levels. Looking at the next several years, we continue to expect annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2013 through 2015, with higher growth rates at the end of the period than in the near term for the reasons I've just discussed.","Additionally, we also continue to expect our annual weather-normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to increase by less than 1% on average for 2013 through 2015, primarily due to customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed energy generation initiatives offsetting the continued recovery in the economy and customer growth.","Slide 11 displays our current investment grade credit ratings. In May, Fitch upgraded APS's and Pinnacle West's corporate credit ratings from BBB to BBB+ and upgraded APS's senior unsecured rating from BBB+ to A-. We are pleased that the rating agencies continue to recognize our improving financial performance.","Our recent financing activities included 2 tax-exempt transactions. On May 1, APS purchased all $32 million of Maricopa County 2009 Series C pollution control bonds, and these bonds were remarketed on May 28.","On July 12, APS purchased all $33 million of Coconino County 1994 Series A pollution control bonds, and we will expect to remarket these bonds within the next 12 months.","Liquidity is still very strong, and we currently have no short-term debt. Looking ahead, we still expect to issue debt to fund the acquisition of SoCal Edison's interest in the Four Corners plant later this year, if the transaction is consummated.","Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 12, we expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2013 will now be in the range of $3.55 to $3.70 per share. This increase in guidance is driven primarily by favorable weather in the first 6 months of the year, translating into about $0.14 per share of positive impact to earnings. We assume normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. An updated list of key factors and assumptions underlying our revised 2013 outlook is included in the appendix to our slides.","Slide 13 illustrates our longer term financial outlook. We continue to expect to grow our dividend by approximately 4% annually. Of course, future dividends are subject to declaration at the Board of Directors' discretion. In addition, the company's goal continues to be an annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of at least 9.5% through 2015.","The earnings and dividend growth continue to be supported by an approximately 6% annual growth in rate base through 2015. Additionally, approximately 80% of our capital expenditures are funded through depreciation cash flow or tracker mechanisms.","In closing, we are confident in our expectations to achieve our financial objectives through 2015, that is, during our base rate stay-out period. Our confidence is supported by the gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement, coupled with our demonstrated operational execution and cost management focus.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, can I go to the Appendix and a -- Page 15 in the Appendix and just have you talk us through some of the changes to your factors for '13? Obviously, electric gross margin is up given the weather and the other factors that you laid out in your formal presentation.","James R. Hatfield","Right.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But can you focus on, for me, you've got a significant increase in your OpEx budget for the year and a pretty meaningful decrease in your interest expense expectation. Is the OpEx up because you're making investments that you think will allow you to control O&M in the future? That's something we've talked about, so just want to make sure I understand that. And then, where's the interest expense delta coming from?","James R. Hatfield","Sure. Sure. So I think if you look at OpEx, you have a couple of factors going on. So if I look at the quarter, year-over-year, O&M was essentially flat other than the amortization of the pension and OPEB, which theoretically we got paid for in the rate settlement. And our approach to these ranges really is, we put sort of parameters around each of these and then we run a probability distribution. And I think -- so I look at O&M, where we are in cost. There's probably more downside than upside with flat O&M for the year. And then, we are making some strategic investments, especially in the IT area, to accelerate the benefit in the later years based on where we are today in our financial performance. If I look at interest expense, a couple of things there as well. You got the delay of Four Corners, but you also have the fact that we've refinanced at lower rates, and we have less debt outstanding. And as I said, we're, no short-term debt as we sit here today, so we're in a great liquidity position. So that would be the things that would drive those changes in ranges. I'd also point out, Greg, on the gross margin besides weather. If you remember, we had first quarter usage that was positive, and that also impacts our gross margin.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And I know, look, I know we can't necessarily capitalize the weather into what we expect your earnings power to be, but to the extent you continue to have good weather quarters, that obviously does impact earnings power in the long run, right, because it increases retained earnings. And so down the line, the necessity for equity might either be decreased or obviated altogether. Is that a fair observation or not?","James R. Hatfield","No, that is in fact -- well, we can't count on weather year-to-year. Any positive weather is less equity we have to raise down the road. So that's obviously a positive long-term story as well.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Last question. Don, you earned a 9.9% ROE on consolidated earns last year. It looks like you're in good shape this year in part because of the weather. But if we adjust for weather and then we look at the underlying trends and where you think you could bring in your cost profile, is there any reason for us to expect that there'd be a significant degradation in earned ROE from the 9.9% you earned in '12 as we look through the forecast period?","Donald E. Brandt","No, Greg. I'm very confident, as Jim alluded to, in talking about the changes in O&M. We're making some investments that we're confident are going to pay dividends in cost savings in the years ahead and other aspects of our cost-containment program are going to provide benefits down the road. So I'm very comfortable where we're at in our future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Becky, congrats on the retirement.","Rebecca L. Hickman","Thanks, Kevin.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You've been a great mentor over the years, and I appreciate all your help. Thank you very much. And so I guess for the question on deregulation, Don, can you provide a little perspective on what happened last time Arizona did this exercise? And can you give, I guess, some comments on just your general confidence that this will be resolved in September, October timeframe?","Donald E. Brandt","Sure, Kevin. Let me first start with your last part of the question. I am very confident that the Corporation Commission is going to act in the best interest of all our customers and to do that action on a timely basis. Where I sit now, I think we could count the number of customers that are proponents of dereg, so-called deregulation, on one hand, and I'm looking at a list of 153 organizations, elected officials, chambers, numerous other business leaders, leaders of the Arizona Senate, the Arizona House of Representatives, numerous mayors, city managers and other local elected officials across the state that have come out strongly against it. I don't think the proponents of deregulation necessarily counted on the negative reaction it's received. As you know, reliability of an electric system is very important, and it's also a fundamental of all advanced economies. But in Arizona, the hottest state in America, reliable electric service is literally a life or death necessity. Regarding what happened last time around, and that was the latter half of the '90s and the first couple of years of 2000. First, I'll direct your attention to when the utilities in the state made the filings the middle of this month. APS's filing had a cover letter from me on it; as did Paul Bonavia did the same at UNS; and Mark Bonsall, who's the Chief Executive Officer of Salt River Project, he also addressed Salt River's project filing with a cover letter, and I don't know how accessible Mark's letter is. If you can't find it on their website or the commission's website, we'd be happy to provide it. Mark is the 1 of the 3 of us that was actually around here for that period of time. But let me respond to your question is, the commission at that time, before the debacle in California, was pursuing deregulation had put the rules in place. The utilities incurred many millions of dollars of cost in systems and other projects to get ready for a deregulated environment. And then you had the California energy crisis which brought that movement towards deregulation to a screeching halt. And similarly at that time, essentially the Arizona courts concluded that most of the rules and other processes that had been put in place were unconstitutional and\/or illegal for a variety of different reasons. So that obstacle to deregulation still exists. But it was a very expensive endeavor for the utilities, for our customers, and there was no visible benefits that came of that exercise. And I think once the commission has a chance to review all the comments and reply comments, so that will be later in August, they'll have a good sense that there's not too many opportunities here for Arizona customers and significant risk and cost that are almost a virtual certainty. So I hope that was a long-winded answer to your question.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, it was very helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Echo Kevin's comments, so congratulations, Becky, and thank you for all your help through the years.","Rebecca L. Hickman","You bet. Thanks.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And given what your comments around new construction, are we to the point where you're looking at or actually putting in new substations and thinking about new developments? Or is that still a ways out?","James R. Hatfield","We're always continuing to improve the system for reliability. In terms of growth, we do have developers talking to us now about their next phase of development. Less real construction going on, but it's probably at 12 to 18 months out when we see sort of construction begin to pick up to support the residential housing build.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So right now, you're still sopping up excess inventory, but that's probably a ways out?","James R. Hatfield","Pretty much. It's infill at this point.","Donald E. Brandt","Paul, I'll add to that. Besides the activity our customer service folks are hearing from homebuilders and developers, on the commercial side of our business, there seems to be some early signs of an uptick. Just yesterday, they broke ground in the Tempe area, our service territory right at the shores of Tempe Town Lake, on a massive project for a regional headquarters for State Farm Insurance that's going to provide jobs for 10,000 to 12,000 people there. And a good part of that is State Farm consolidating some of their operations in the west. So it will have ancillary growth opportunities just coming off that single large project.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So kind of falling back on Kevin's question a little bit. Again, once again, thank you very much, Becky. But I wanted to follow up on retail here and go back to perhaps a little bit of the change of late has been the introduction of net metering and solar DG is kind of taking off to a certain extent. How is that kind of changing the color of deregulation or the conversation, if you will? I'd be curious, are we talking about something a little bit different? What are the different outcomes potentially as it relates to so-called restructuring, if you will? And what I'm really getting at is some of the questions posed by the ACC appear to be getting at exactly that nuance between solar DG and restructuring, if you will?","Donald E. Brandt","I've got Jeff Guldner here, and I'll let him jump in on that.","Jeffrey B. Guldner","Julien, part of the challenge, I think the net metering discussion makes the deregulation conversation more difficult or more complex, and it's primarily because the net metering is mostly impacting the fixed cost recovery, and so much of that is on the wire side that would not be subject to the restructuring debate. And so it simply adds another layer of complexity as we have the discussion that you'd have to sort through if you were to move forward with any kind of a deregulated market.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then perhaps a little bit more detailed question, if you will. With regards to Four Corners, again, kind of thinking through the various options here. As you're thinking through kind of that 12\/31 year end EPA deadline, amongst, I suppose, several other considerations, what are some of the key milestones that need to be hit or could trigger differences in the transaction as you think about it?","James R. Hatfield","Well, obviously, clarity on what happens in Arizona is going to be a key one for us as well. That's probably the primary driver at this point in where we are with Four Corners.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Or maybe stated differently, do you need to get resolution by a certain point in time?","Donald E. Brandt","Well, I don't know if there's necessarily a date and time, but for, frankly, for every day goes by, there's a risk to the Four Corners transaction. But as I go back to my earlier comments to Kevin's questions, I'm fairly confident that this commission's going to act in the best interest of our customers in a timely basis, and we're going to exercise our best efforts to keep the Four Corners transaction viable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I was just wondering if maybe you could just give us a quick update on any longer term transmission project opportunities?","James R. Hatfield","Well, we have in our -- in APS, the biggest transaction going on now is our Hassayampa into North Gila Line 2. It's about a $250 million, roughly, transmission project which we expect to be in service by April of 2015. And outside of that, we just continue to look at opportunities away from APS, and the Delaney-Colorado River project we've submitted to the Cal-ISO, and we're still waiting for resolution on that.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Any timing on resolution or any estimated investment for it?","James R. Hatfield","No. We thought we'd have resolution on September, but resolution now is a little more murkier in terms of when we'll get some sort of a yes or no on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","First, on Four Corners, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. I know that as every month passes, the value of that transaction comes down. But I wanted to be clear from Pinnacle West's perspective, is there a particular time period by which you need to complete this? Apart from the EPA deadline, is there any other regulatory deadline we need to be aware of? And just from an economic perspective, because I know in the past, I had a call, getting from you guys that if it didn't get done by the end of the year, it didn't make sense to do it. But I just want to be clear what the current thinking on this one is.","Donald E. Brandt","Well, I think other than the clarity that we've talking about before, not sure there's anything else that needs to happen other than we just need clarity on what the market structure is going to be.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if that discussion spills over into next year, I mean, there's nothing to stop you from waiting for this process on the clarity front to play out before closing it? And this could happen next year, say, first or second quarter. That's not an issue for you?","Donald E. Brandt","Well, Ali, we've got our -- the EPA has extended the BART settlement through the end of the year. So beyond the end of the year, it introduces a whole new risk profile to the situation. Again, we go back to the point, I think this is going to get resolved long before year end.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just had a call, the way that the rate case settlement was made, I think the carve out for Four Corners also expires at the end of the year? Is that right?","James R. Hatfield","That's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question, Jim, I apologize if I missed this, but what was the load growth weather-normalized in the second quarter? I don't know if you gave that and I may have missed it.","James R. Hatfield","It was less than 1% retail sales increase.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So there was a slowdown from the Q1 trend?","James R. Hatfield","No, not really. I think the difference between the 2 quarters relates to, again, customer mix and usage patterns. We saw an increase in residential sales, but a reduction in commercial sales. And so there was a de minimis impact on gross margin growth in the second quarter.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I see. Last question, as you're thinking, I know it's going to be a couple of years out, on the timing of the next rate case once the stay-out period is over. Is that more a Q3, Q4 '14 event in your mind? Or can you just give us big picture of when it is that you would be in a position to make a determination on the timing there?","James R. Hatfield","We can't file until May 31, 2015. I would say that the timing would be sometime in early '15, whether we want to file May 31 or we want to wait.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of easy questions from me. The first is, so guidance went up $0.10 on the quarter, but weather positively impacted EPS by $0.14 versus normal. What's the delta there? Is that simply Four Corners or is it the O&M trends that you've seen so far this year?","James R. Hatfield","It's just based on looking at where we are and what we have ahead of us in the second half of the year. As you know, the third quarter is our big quarter in terms of earnings. Just putting a probability distribution around that, when you do that, it comes up to $0.10. So I wouldn't necessarily say that because weather is $0.14 and the range is $0.10 that there's a negative looming in the second half.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just on O&M, how should we think about the right O&M growth rate post 2013? So off of this base, in light of some of the cost savings initiatives that you guys are employing.","James R. Hatfield","I would think you would look at the O&M growth to be equal to or less than the rate of growth of kWh sales.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And then last question, Jim, in light of increasing interest rates, what are your thoughts about using a forward equity mechanism to lock in current prices?","James R. Hatfield","Neil, my response to that would be, we're very well versed on the forward, but as I sit here today, and I have no short-term debt and a very healthy equity mix, I'm not really thinking about equity at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah Akers with Wells Fargo.","Sarah Akers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one question on the general support for coal in Arizona. We've seen measures in some of your neighboring states to move away from coal. Are you seeing anything similar in Arizona or how would you characterize the support in the state?","James R. Hatfield","I would say there is -- we're not like the other states moving away from coal. In fact, we have one commissioner who stressed that she'd like to see coal as part of the generation mix. So I think at this point, you have Navajo, which is really a big part of the water system in Arizona. And a high desire, obviously to the impacts of water rates for that to stay open as well. So I would say, the state is -- likes our mix of nuclear and coal and gas and that generation diversity is a positive.","Donald E. Brandt","Sarah, Don here. I'll add too, if you'll go to azcentral.com, the website for the Arizona Republic. This morning, U.S. Congressman Paul Gosar on the Arizona delegation wrote an op-ed in support of coal generation.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just had one quick one left. Just to make sure I understand this. The ACC review of regulation versus deregulation, that has had no impact on AZ Sun or your demand management program, correct?","Donald E. Brandt","That's correct.","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Operator","Our last question comes from Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","I guess first, I'd like to say, and I kind of expressed this to Becky in New York, but Becky, I've known you for a very, very long time and not everybody can achieve being the best at what they do, but you clearly have. And also proud to call you a friend, as Don has. So congratulations on achieving what you've achieved. Question-wise, Jim, just on Four Corners. How quickly -- so let's just say, tomorrow, the commission put this to rest, or you were comfortable kind of where things were going, how quickly can you close on Four Corners?","James R. Hatfield","Fairly quickly, actually.","Andrew Levi","Fairly quickly being a week, 2 weeks?","James R. Hatfield","It's going to take time to ink documents. Probably within 30 days certainly. I mean, I think everything is ready to go.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So it's kind of a 30-day process.","James R. Hatfield","30 or less. I mean, you always, in these transactions, just need to check everything. So fairly quickly.","Andrew Levi","Great. And then just the interest savings, how much was from Four Corners? I don't have that in my notes so I'm just -- need that for my model.","James R. Hatfield","$3 million to $4 million.","Andrew Levi","Was allocated for this year?","James R. Hatfield","Yes.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Mountain for closing comments.","Paul J. Mountain","All right. That concludes our call. Thank you for joining today. Let us know if you have any questions. Thanks, Latonya.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"17190":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  2, 2012 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Rebecca Hickman - Director, Investor Relations","Donald Brandt - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","James Hatfield - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jeff Guldner - Senior Vice President, Customers and Regulation, Arizona Public Service Company","Analysts","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2012 third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my please to introduce your host, Becky Hickman, Director of Investor Relations.","Rebecca Hickman","I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulations is also here with us.","Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per-share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.","It is my responsibility to advice you that this call and our slides contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our third quarter 2012 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements cautionary language as well as the MDNA section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 9.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Don.","Donald Brandt","Thanks, Becky, and thank you all for joining us today. This year we've made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business.","This progress includes demonstrating sustained improvement in the regulatory environment in Arizona, making selective capital investments, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery. Jim and I will provide more information on each of these areas throughout our remarks today.","APS's retail rate settlement, which was approved earlier this year became effective on July 1. Details of the agreement as well as the key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides.","The settlement demonstrates significant collaboration and cooperation among APS peers on a Corporation Commission and other stakeholders as well as a proven commitment to expedite the retail rate case process. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.","Among other things, first, it provides a financial support APS needs to meet our customers' energy needs and to help achieve Arizona's energy goals. Second, the settlement provides measure of regulatory certainty for both customers and shareholders through at least mid-2016. Third, it provides rate gradualism through the use of a number of rate adjustment mechanisms. This process will void the need for base rate increases every several years, while allowing reasonable recovery that APS has prudently incurred expenditures in the interim. And fourth, it allows APS the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity.","That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during this out-period. Aspects related to the settlement include, first, APS's rate adjustment mechanisms, which will continue to function throughout the stay-out period. Among others, these mechanism include preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjuster, which passes annual changes in the formula rate through their APS retail customers.","The renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions, and other renewable resourced program costs, the new loss fixed cost recovery mechanism, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed cost related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation. And an enhanced environment improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying cost on government-mandated environmental capital projects.","Second, a rate rider carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition, and this provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013, after the acquisition is consummated. I will review the status of the Four Corners plan momentarily.","Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases. These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases as well as full pass-through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster. And finally, without a time-intensive rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and disciplined cost management.","In a related manner, on August 1, APS implemented an ACC approved increase in the retail transmission cost adjuster. The rate change reflected APS's increased investment in transmission lines and will increase annual formula-based revenues by $18 million. Beginning next year, the settlement allows future transmission cost adjuster changes to go into effect June 1 of each year without requiring the expressed Commission action. This change will synchronize wholesale and retail transmission cost recovery.","Turning into next week selections, three of the five ACC Commission seats are on the ballot. Incumbent Commissioners, Sandra Kennedy, Paul Newman and Bob Stump are running for reelection. In addition, three challengers are also running for the seats. Republican, Susan Bitter Smith and Bob Burns; and Democrat, Marcia Busching.","Regardless of the party affiliation, the three candidates who receive the highest number of votes will win the election and begin four-year terms in January. Whatever the results of the elections, we will continue working with the Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to continue our collaborative focus on the states energy future.","Our capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS's electricity customers, while meeting goals for Arizona's sustainable energy future and environmental compliance. Today I'll update you on two major components of our capital expenditures program, the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition.","Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program are important, measured steps toward advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future. Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale, photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.","This program is progressing on target. To date, we have commitments in place for a total of 118 megawatts with a projected capital investment of $504 million. A summary of the program is included in the appendix to our slides.","To date, we have placed three plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 50 megawatts. Construction and other development activities are currently underway at three sites for another 68 megawatts. Of this amount, we plan to place 19 megawatts at the Chino Valley site in Northern Arizona into service later this year. We expect the reminder will go into operation in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.","We are continuing with our plan to acquire Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico. A summary of the plant is included in the appendix to our slides. The plant has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially. The acquisition requires approvals by Arizona, California and federal regulators as we as other government agencies, most of which have already been obtained.","Noteworthy conditions still must be met prior to closing the transaction, including approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and negotiation of a new coal supply contract. We expect to hear from them first by the end of this month, and coal contract negotiations are continuing. We intend to close the acquisition following satisfactory completion of these conditions.","Excellence in day-to-day operations remains our top priority and our third quarter results reflect this focus. Throughout the summer, our generating fleet turned in solid performance, and our employees provided high-quality service, all of them meeting and demands of our peak season.","During the third quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear plant operated as a 98% capacity factor. Currently, Unit 2 is in a planned refueling outage, which we've expected to be completed early this month, reflecting a schedule of approximately 30 days. Our fossil plants also operated well. When appropriate, we took advantage of low near-term natural gas prices by reducing output by our coal plants and increasing gas plant production.","In September, we were again recognized for our sustainable business practices as Pinnacle West was name to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Our company has been included in the index for eight consecutive years. Every year since the index was established and is one on only nine North American electric utilities included in the current index listing.","Over the past several years, we have achieved a number of needed improvements to strengthen the company's balance sheet and other aspects of our financial profile, while focusing on continuous improvement in operations to regulatory framework and cost management. Continuous improvement is essential to maintaining operational excellence and they are achieving our current and future financial goals.","Last month we achieved another milestone, when our Board of Directors improved the cash component of return for our shareholders by increasing the common dividend by about 4% effective with this year's December payment. The board's decision to increase our dividend demonstrates the confidence we have in the fundamental strength of our business, the Arizona communities we serve and our future growth prospects. We are focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth and strong cash returns to shareholders.","To close my remarks, I am very pleased with where our company is today and very optimistic about our future. With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue to achieve top-tier performance through our day-to-day focus on excellence in execution and continuous improvement, areas in which our talented leadership team and workforce performed exceptionally well.","Now, Jim will review our third quarter results, the outlook for the Arizona economy and our guidance for 2012 earnings.","James Hatfield","Thank you, Don. As Don said, we continue making progress, strengthening our financial profile. Today I'll discuss the following topics: first, I'll review our third quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year's corresponding quarter; second, I'll provide an update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy; and finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook during the retail base rate stay-out period.","Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year's third quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $245 million or $2.21 per share compared with net income of $255 million or $2.32 per share for last year's third quarter.","Our ongoing earnings were comparable to last year's third quarter. For this year's quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $245 million or $2.21 per share versus ongoing earnings of $246 million or $2.24 per share for the same quarter a year ago.","Slide 7 reconciliations our third quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amounts for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued energy services and real estate businesses. The most significant item excluded is a $10 million gain on the sale of our energy services business in last year's third quarter.","My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results. Slide 8 displays variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.16 per share compared with the prior-year third quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprised as positive net variance. And I'll cover those items in more detail on the next slide.","Second, lower infrastructure-related cost improved earnings by $0.04 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. These cost reductions were primarily offset by higher property taxes related to tax rate increases.","Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.10 per share. The expense increase primarily consisted of: an increase in employee benefit cost; the effects of beginning amortization in this year's third quarter of pension and other post retirement benefit cost compared with deferral of such cost in 2011, pursuant to APS's retail regulatory settlements; and higher fossil generation cost resulting from more plant maintenance being completed in the third quarter of this year than in the same quarter a year ago. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.","Fourth, the absence of certain items that reduced the company's effective tax rate in the third quarter of last year, reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. For example, the federal research and experimentation credit expired at the end of 2011. And it's not yet been extended by Congress, although we expect them to do so.","Additionally, last year's third quarter reflected tax benefits of a non-cash charitable contribution. The net impact of other miscellaneous items decreased earnings by $0.04 per share. Our third quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun plants that were placed in service late last year and early this year. The net variance is reflected in various line items throughout the income statement.","Turning to Slide 9 and the components of the net increase in our gross margin, total gross margin increased $0.16 per share compared with last year's third quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows: the APS's retail regulatory settlement, which became effective July 1, improved gross margin by $0.21 per share, all of which was comprised of a non-fuel base rate increase. The company also stopped recording, line extension fees received as revenues, when the 2012 settlement became effective.","Retail transmission revenue increases improved earnings by $0.09 per share. The transmission cost adjuster increase that became effective August 1, improved earnings by $0.02 per share.","Additionally, in last year's third quarter, we booked a catch-up adjustment to our formula rates that reduce 2011 third quarter results by $0.04 per share. By comparison, the absence of that adjustment in this year's third quarter, improved the quarter-to-quarter comparison.","Finally, the procedures for processing future retail rate adjustments have been streamlined by the 2012 retail rate settlement, thereby allowing APS to accrue the estimated effects of a change in next year's formula transmission revenues. The balance of that variance is primarily comprised of these accruals. The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.05 per share.","The effects of cooler weather reduced earnings by $0.17 per share. This year's third quarter was milder than normal, while the 2011 quarter was abnormally hot. This year residential cooling degree days were 15% lower than last year's third quarter, and 5% below normal.","Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales decreased our earnings by $0.02 per share. This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 1.2% over year ago levels.","Turning to Slide 10 and 11, and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy, economic growth in Arizona continued to improve in the third quarter. Although, the growth remains modest as has been the case for last several quarters.","As shown on Slide 10, growth in non-farm jobs continued to show improvement. The rate of overall job growth is increasing certainly, and has been consistently positive for the last two years. Virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth, and the rate of growth is two-thirds faster than the rate seen in the nation as a whole.","The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending, and has pushed the unemployment rate down generally in parallel with national trends. While these trends are positive, we believe that we still have a few more quarters to go before we see local markets returning to a more normal condition.","On Slide 10, you can see our estimate of the amount of vacant homes and apartments that presently exist in our service territory in Metro Phoenix. Vacancies have retreated by 35% from their peak in May 2009 and early 2010, which has sparked some renewed interest in the single-family housing market.","Permit activity has increased in each of last five consecutive quarters and finished the third quarter of this year 20% higher than that of third quarter of last year. We believe we are on a pace to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level where existing home resell pricing will be more supportive of the new home construction.","On Slide 11, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in the case shower repeat sales index. In recent months, we have seen an up tick in existing home prices as a number of foreclosure sales have declined and the level of housing demand has improved.","Even with the slight rebound on pricing, affordability of single-family housing remains quite high by historical standards. And we believe that condition has been particularly helpful in attracting property investors to increase shareholdings in their existing stock of housing.","The decline in vacancies and foreclosures and increases in prices are evidence of the continuing, albeit slow progress of the housing market back to more normal levels. This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market. As you can see on the slide, vacancy rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels, but remain quite high. Well, those for industrial space have fallen more dramatically.","Again, we view this as a positive trend, but believe that the extent of vacant space in the office and retail markets means a recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.","On balance we see favorable, albeit modest economic indicators which paint a picture of continuing steady recovery, accompanied by sizable but diminishing hindrance. Reflecting this modest, steady improvement in economic condition, APS's customer base grew 1.2% in this year's third quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, which represents a stronger growth we've seen in three years.","Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona's growth are still here and that our growth rate in customers will return to more typical levels.","Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 through 2015 with growth rates higher at the end of that period than in the near term for the reasons I've just discussed. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2015, primarily due to customer conservation, energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.","Finally, I want to discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook. As shown on Slide 12, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50 per share. Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing earnings per share.","The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on in the appendix to our slides. We plan to discuss guidance for our 2013 ongoing earnings at our Analyst Day on November 9.","As Don discussed, last month, our Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.08 per share or about 4% to $2.18 per share effective with the December payment.","Slide 13 depicts our longer term financial outlook to the base rate stay-out period. The company expects to achieve an annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of at least 9.5% through 2015, compared with APS's allowed return on equity of 10% under the settlement agreement.","This level represents another step change in earned returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement as well as our operational excellence and cost management initiatives. This goal reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined on Slide 16 and 17.","In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion annually through 2015. However, approximately 45% of this amount will be recovered through the rate mechanisms that Don outlined and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow. This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.","Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt to fund the acquisition of SoCal Edison's interest in Four Corners at closing of that plant. With respect to any potential equity issuances, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest.","Under the current schedule, the timing and amount of issuance would facilitate calibration of APS's capital structure for the next general rate case which is assumed to be in mid-2015 with the 2014 test year and provide support for the company's credit metrics.","In closing, we are confident we will achieve our financial objectives during the stay-out period. A confidence supported by the gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated operational execution and cost management abilities. Additionally, our outlook conservatively assumes a slow economic recovery and accelerated return to economic growth should provide upside to our outlook.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we would be pleased to take questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Don, can I ask you to maybe articulate a little bit what the mindset is of the board around the dividends, the $0.02 increase was much appreciated by your shareholders, but I've heard from, maybe a few of them that they had hoped for at least a modestly higher increase. So what was the mindset of the board around that decision? And then second question on that front is the board going to be addressing the dividend annually in December or would you plan on sort of moving that date prospectively and ask them to think about the dividend increases on a different timetable?","Donald Brandt","I'll answer the last one first, probably we've continue to address it as the October board meeting. There is no reason that couldn't change but that's traditionally been the time, if there was a reason. But I don't think we've changed it just to change it. So that's about as best answer. I think I'd focus on October for future years following some other changes.","Relative to how the management team and the board focused on the dividend, one is focus on what would we do to create the most long term value for shareholders. And in that regard, our philosophy was a change in the dividend that would appear to be the least risky, meaning, I believe and our board, the more secure that dividend of peers going forward, the more shareholder value will create with the absence of uncertainty around it. That certainly doesn't mean we're locked into this kind of an increase in the future. But I'm also not telegraphing there is any change.","But as you know we've heard the stock over the last couple of years about our cost control initiatives and the projects that Jim Hatfield, Mark Schiavoni, our team helped for us over the stay-out period, and the fact that we have 200 to 300 employees retiring each year and we're going to try to take as much advantage of those potential cost savings as possible.","And our forecast of sales is essentially flat. And it's still very early stages. There is some activity in the housing market. And as you know, we've got more than 25,000 empty homes in our service territory. And when the market starts to return to normal, whatever normal might it look like in future years, that would be potential upside to earnings, and obviously both the management team and board would take those potential positive developments in the consideration in future years.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","On that front, Don, in talking to my housing analysts here, we've seen what you're seeing in Phoenix and if you could collaborate it or not? That would be helpful, as that there's been a slowdown in new home sales, because there is simply a lack of supply. And so do you think that that's true, have you seen the front end of permitting activity that might cause sort of a year down the line. A lot of the new homes to come on the market, and do you also think that that might lead to a quicker absorption of the 25,000 existing homes, because there's such lack of supply of new homes.","Donald Brandt","Yes. It's a broad question. I'll probably give you a broad answer too. I know from our folks who deal with developers, there is still continuing activity. One thing we have heard is there is a labor shortage right now, relative to what the severe downturn or basically the housing industry, all that's shutdown, the carpenters, masons, roofers, et cetera. But that's not the kind of thing, and people in the housing business I've talked to that takes a year to develop, that's where you recruit folks from other parts of the country and you might be talking a matter of months to solve some of the labor issues.","But with that said, I guess we've got the 25,000 plus, I think it's 27,000 of empty homes that are ready, willing and able to be occupied at a very short notice. And the local print paper, you find online at azcentral.com, there has been a number of almost every other day another story about changing in house prices and while there is some volatility, the trend seems to be on the uptick.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Jim, I think last time when I was out there we were talking about O&M trends. And I got the sense that you're looking to keep O&M flat in 2013 and 2014, as you think about the expense pie, where are those costs reductions coming from?","James Hatfield","Well, I think we've been flat since '08, so I think any sort of non-essential expense has been eliminated. I think Don alluded to this in his text, which is we're going to have significant retirements over the next few years, to consider that two-thirds of our people related costs that as we continue to improve our business processes in labor technology, our ability not to replace each individual that leaves will be where we'll have to drop them.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","And then on AZ Sun, that's been a big success here and do you think that appetite to upsize the AZ Sun program?","James Hatfield","At this point, I don't think so for a couple of reasons. This thing runs through '15, so we'll have to see. But from a capacity perspective we're in pretty good shape capacity-wise. We'll be doubled at 2015 renewable energy standard, so probably not near term and appetite to do anything more with utility scale.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Kevin Cole from Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","I guess, more on Greg's question on the dividend, is it your view, I guess, should I review that the 4% increase is a one-time up year-over-year or should I consider it to be stable through the stay-out or is it a stable longer term than that.","Donald Brandt","Well, it's something we'll look at each year. But I think our aspirations are to continue to grow the dividend. We feel very confident and we'll talking more about the future earnings in connection with EEI in the next week or so. And I think that would give you more insight into it.","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Then I guess, this 4% dividend growth imply a similar annual EPS growth rate through the stay-out or is that's a point that's coming at your Analyst Day?","Donald Brandt","Yes, Kevin, we'll address that at the next Friday.","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","And then last question on leverage to an economic recovery, I guess under the current rates and the LFCR, what is your EPS leverage for every 1% move and in a lower order customer count?","Donald Brandt","1% move is about $10 million in net income, so probably $0.09 or so.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Jim, you had mentioned, one federal tax credit that expired and might it ticking up again, would that apply retroactively?","James Hatfield","Well, if it came back in or was extended in 2012 before the end of the year, it would be applied retroactively to the year. They could also extended in '13 and make a retroactive. We'll have to wait and see what happens with that. Our tax people feel like it's something that will be extended at some point.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And can you give more color on where the $0.09 from retail transmission came from that, it seems awful big?","James Hatfield","Well, I think there were a couple of things in there, Paul. First you had to switch gear at annual increase, which was $0.02. We also had about $0.04 to a catch-up adjustment last year which went against us. So we didn't have that this year, and that's another $0.04. And then, we begin booking in the third quarter, now, that we have a set schedule of June 1 every year through the 2012 settlement that we're sort of accruing next year's increase as we earn it throughout the year. It's a same concept we're doing with LFCR which will apply for our filing on application next year, but we're actually earning it this year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","In the appendix and the slides, et cetera, you guys talked about '12 through '15 a 6% annual growth in rate base. Does that bake in all the expenditures that will be spent at that time or is there a scenario that growth could be stronger than that?","James Hatfield","That's our current plan, Ali. At this point absent something unforeseen like a quick recovery and growth next year sometime. I don't see that we would have a rate base growth that's greater than 6%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And, Jim, to your point earlier apart from some equity issuance that will come into play maybe sometimes in '14, is that the biggest disconnect we should think about between the 6% rate base growth and what an EPS growth commensurate with that should look like, it's really some dilution at some point from equity, is that a fair way to think about it?","James Hatfield","I think we have a couple of things, Ali, to think about. And again, we'll cover this more specifically Friday. But you don't have perfect regulation, so you're not going to get a dollar for dollar in that regard. And then, yes, at some point we'll have some dilution as we calibrate the capital structure assuming we are on a next rate case.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And last question, coming back to the dividend for a second. So given where you are right now, at least from a payout ratio perspective, are you guys now comfortable that you are where you need to be relative to your benchmark peer group or do you have any thoughts on the payout ratio?","James Hatfield","I think we are comfortable where we are, Ali.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Don, you brought up the fact that the election could change the composition of the Commission. Is there anything that because of a stay-out there is really nothing that the new commissioners would have to hit the ground running on, I mean there is no immediate decisions that would face. I mean it's just really all you have to do is get them up to speed between now and when you file in 2014?","Donald Brandt","Well, we have the ongoing riders in that, we'll continue communications. But to answer your question, Charles, directly, there aren't any big issues out there. But its continuing monthly, if not a weekly dialogue with the commissioners and their policy advisor's to keeping abreast to what's going on in the company, and just from a relationship standpoint.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","And then, can I ask a question on Slide 26, the RES cost, demand side management cost?","Donald Brandt","Yes.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Quarter-over-quarter there is step down in the RES, but that was due to the transfer of those cost to rate base with the settlement earlier this year, is that correct?","Donald Brandt","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","So just a sort of a follow-up on, I guess Ali's question. If I just look at your slides, and I know you'll probably be going to tell me, I'm front running your Analyst Day by asking you this. If I look at Slide 17, you say rate base is going to grow on average 6% annually. You're saying that you'll earn at least to 9.5% ROE over the forecast period. Jim, you've said, there's very little regulatory lag associated with your capital expenditures. So absent equity dilution, why wouldn't it be fair to presume that earning should grow in line with rate base growth?","James Hatfield","Well, Greg, I think you'll need to come back Analyst Day to get that answer. How did that sound?","Operator","Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just on the election is there any potential that there could be a change in policies like renewals or whatever that could impact to you. I know there's been sort of a back and forth between the Commission and the state legislature and what have you. I'm just wondering, if there is anything we should be thinking about in terms of what could happen there with respect to renewables or whether or not that could impact you guys?","Donald Brandt","Well, most of the issues were a year ago in the media between a legislature and Commission, if fairly well died down. And both parties in the year of the existing commissioners have been supportive over our past on renewable. So I certainly can't and won't predict the outcome of any election much less the Corporation Commission. But I don't foresee the need or the likelihood of any significant change.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then, with respect to just a housekeeping I guess, I'm a little bit confused. When I read maybe I'm reading something incorrectly, but when I look at the press release on Page 2, it says that there was a decrease in retail sales, excluding the effects of weather variations, which reduced results by $0.02 a share?","Donald Brandt","That's correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then, when I look at the statistical slides, and again, maybe I'm just misreading it. It looks like retail sales gigawatt hour weather normalized was actually up, on Page 4 and 5 in the statistical supplement? It does look like it's a lot. We're not talking about this, just sort of wondering about if I am reading it correctly, if there was something missing?","I saw that, I just meant the total retail sales seem to, weather normally seem to go up, and if I was reading this it seemed like the effects of what you guys actually have seen it go down?","James Hatfield","Yes, we did. I'll have to look into that.","Rebecca Hickman","I'll get back to you Paul.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back over to Ms. Hickman.","Rebecca Hickman","We thank you all for being with us. We know that you have a number of calls today. And if there is anything else that you need, please contact me or one of us. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"17232":["Pinnacle West Capital Corp.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul Mountain","","Thank you, Christine. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2014 earnings, recent developments, and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield; Jeff Guldner, our APS\u2019s Senior Vice President of Public Policy, and Mark Schiavoni APS\u2019s Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments in our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations. And the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our second quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors in MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 7th.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Paul and thank you all for joining us today. As Paul mentioned along with Jim and Jeff Guldner we have Mark Schiavoni with us here today. Mark was promoted to Chief Operating Officer last month. Mark overseas our non-nuclear operations while also helping us set the company\u2019s strategy. He co-chairs our sustainable cost management initiative with Jim and is one of our most local champions on safety issues.","Last quarter, I shared my view that Arizona's regulatory climate is stronger today, because APS and the Arizona Corporation Commission were among the first to address the fairness issues associated with distributed generation. And did so along before these rate design challenges became a significant financial issue for our customers.","I'll update you on the regulatory progress as well as a few operational highlights. And then Jim will discuss the second quarter results and update you on our economic and financial outlook. The Arizona Corporation Commission has conducted two workshops in the value and cost of distributed generation series.","The most recent on June 20th. On that date, APS along with Tucson Electric, the residential utility consumer office or RUCO and two Arizona solarcrete associations, Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance and the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association filed a joint letter in the docket outlining three broad principals rate design to which all diverse signatories agree.","These three principals are that rates need to be customer focused, forward thinking and affordable and fair. The workshops was constructive, in the end all parties agree that the voting time to address rate design was necessary. Following the work shop at the ACCs July 22nd staff meeting, the ACC voted four to one for a limited reopening of the 2013 net mitering decision to consider removing the requirement for APS to file a rate case in 2015 to allow for the possibility of developing rate design options in generic proceedings.","The commissioners agreed that Chairman, Stump would file a letter in the docket explaining the need for a rate design generic proceeding and providing notice that the commission would vote on whether to eliminate the requirement for APS to file a rate case in June 2015 at an August open meeting.","Commissioner, Brenda Burns was the sole of the center only because she thought it best to open the matter and vote on the proposed change to the requirement at one time. The exact process is currently undetermined but we expect rate design discussions to continue into 2015. Rate design changes agreed upon would likely not take effect until the conclusion of APS\u2019s next rate case.","We applaud the commission for beginning to take action to deal with rate design, showing that Arizona is a leader in dealing with these complex issues while providing clarity to stakeholders on the next steps. We look forward to building on the principles outlined in the joint letter and having a constructive dialog with all parties. The ACC is taking a forward-looking approach in other areas as well. The innovative technology\u2019s workshop series also continues through the summer. The topics covered inform the rate design discussions and educate all stakeholders on new ways to address customer interest. APS is actively participating in these workshops.","Planning what\u2019s next for Arizona\u2019s energy future is our top priority. We know our customers want more options for receiving energy to power their lives including rooftop solar. The total number of residential grid type solar photovoltaic systems on our system is now about 26,800. There were about 2,000 applications in the second quarter, in line with last year, although we continue to see increasing number of applicants each month this year.","Earlier this week, APS presented the ACC with an additional option to complete the final 20 megawatts of AZ Sun program. In April, we proposed to continue our successful program of building community scale solar with a new plant at our Redhawk facility.","On July, we presented the Commission with the second option that would be an APS owned residential rooftop solar program in partnership with local Arizona solar installers. 20 megawatts is equivalent of about 3,000 home installations. This proposal would provide a new avenue for customers who may not want to or be able to purchase or lease solar panels from third-parties, so that they too can benefit from rooftop solar installations.","We've asked the ACC to review the proposal within two months in order to maintain compliance by the end of 2015. AZ Sun added 32 megawatts to our operations when the Gila Bend site came on line in June, as expected. The 10 megawatt sites in the City of Phoenix and at Luke Air Force Base are making progress and are expected to come on line in 2015.","Closely related to our planning for the future of the grid is our monetization plan for Ocotillo Generating Station, which will be an important component in managing intermittent generation, which includes renewable and distributed generation. This certificate of environmental comparability application will be filed with the ACC this week and hearings are expected this fall.","Turning to the rest of our operations. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another great quarter. Unit 2s plant refueling outage in April was completed in a record time for the site 28 days and 22 hours. The site capacity factor was in line with the second quarter of last year as each quarter included one plant outage. In May, the nuclear industry held a grand opening on Phoenix\u2019s West side for the first of two nuclear response centers and the second facility open this month in Memphis, Tennessee.","These reserve facilities are part of the industry\u2019s response to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi incident in Japan and provides standardized equipment that can be shipped to any nuclear site in the United States in 24 hours or less. Arizona was selected as one of the sites because of the low probably of natural disasters here. On June 2nd the EPA released the clean power plant which proposes state to specific goals to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions measured from a 2012 baseline. As proposed states would be required to submit their plants to EPA by June 2016 although states may be eligible for one or two year extensions.","For sources on Native American tribal lands including four corners in the Navajo plant. EPA is expected to finalize a plan by June 2015. We're working with regulators and other utilities to determine what the EPA plan means for his owner. We have already made significant progress in reducing greenhouse gas submissions including permanently showing down through three units at four corners.","EPA also issued its final cooling water intake structures rule in May under section 316 B of the Clean Water Act. We have not determined the exact cost to comply however we don\u2019t expect the cost to be material.","Those of you who have followed Pinnacle West in recent years know the emphasis this management team has placed on running our core electricity business well by sticking our netting we've achieved strong operational and financial results.","Looking forward we see an opportunity to leverage our operational expertise and pursue growth through carefully selected opportunities that are closely to our core business. And an example that kind of close to core opportunity that we intend to explore the California ISO Board of Governors recently voted to move forward with the Delaney to Colorado river transmission line.","The hot 500 kilovolt line would be approximately 130 miles long 90% of which would be located in Arizona. To enable our exploration for this opportunity we formed a new subsidiary of Pinnacle West called Bright Canian Energy Corporation.","Bright Canian in turn has formed a 50-50 joint venture to pursue transmission projects in the Western United States with the Berkshire Hathawa subsidiary mid American transmission. This joint venture plan is to participate in the bidding for the DCR line. The competitive solicitation process is expected to begin in August and culminate in 2015. It is expected that the DCR line will take three years to permit and two years to construct. So at this point, we expect the line would be in service by 2020. Given the competitive process and this timeframe, we do not currently reflect any CapEx in our forecast for this line.","Jim will discuss the latest economic data in his remarks, but let me provide some context. We have spent significant time with homebuilders in our area in recent weeks to calibrate our outlook. And understand what they see and expect to see in the Phoenix housing market. All they agree that the very near-term trends are difficult to predict from quarter-to-quarter, they also agree that Phoenix is a great place to live and roll our business and the fundamentals for growth remain solidly intact looking ahead into 2015 and 2016.","Let me conclude my remarks by thanking the crews and volunteers who help limit the damage caused by the nearly 22,000 acre slide rock fire in late May of this year. Slide rock is in the canyon directly adjacent to Sedona, Arizona very popular destination North of Phoenix and recognizable by its fantastic red rock formations. The train in this area is extremely difficult to navigate and required our crews to fly in polls and other equipment necessary to restore service to area customers.","Because of the difficulty in reaching this location much of this work was done the all fashion way by hiking in on foot and using hand tools to dig holes to replace pools damaged by the fire. Just as important our crews performed this challenging work safely and without any recordable injuries. This is also one example of what helped APS to be recognized as industry leading in customer satisfaction. To that point APS maintained top docile performance among large investor owned utilities and overall customer satisfaction ranking 5th in that category as measured by the JD Power and Associates Residential Customer Survey that was released earlier this month.","I will now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","","Thank you, Don and welcome everybody to the second quarter call. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide four. I will begin with a review of our second quarter results including earnings and the primary variances from last year\u2019s second quarter. I will follow with an update on the Arizona economy and I will conclude with a review of our financial outlook.","Slide five summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings, which are the same this quarter. As usual, my comments will refer to ongoing earnings. For the second quarter of 2014, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $132 million or $1.19 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $131 million, or $1.18 per share, for the first quarter of 2013.","Slide six outlines the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Lower operations and maintenance expenses added $0.03 per share largely driven by lower employee benefit cost including the favorable impact from lower pension and post retirement expense that is expected to positively impact each quarter this year.","Lower interest expense net of AFUDC added $0.02 per share. Lower income tax expense added $0.02 per share, primarily driven by tax credits related to our renewable facilities and a slightly lower statutory state tax rate. The net impact of other items increased earnings by $0.02 per share. A decrease in our gross margin reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, compared with the prior year's second quarter period.","I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.01 per share primarily due to additional plant and service. Higher taxes other than income taxes also reduced earnings by $0.01 per share.","As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these deferrals as there was no net impact on second quarter 2014 results.","Turing to slide seven and the components of our net decrease of $0.06 in our gross margin, the main components of this were as follows. The lost fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.02 per share, which as designed offset some of the impact from energy efficiency programs and distributed energy. The Arizona Sun was a primary driver of the other $0.01 per share. The effects of weather variation decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's second quarter was more favorable than normal, although milder than the second quarter of 2013.","Cooling degree days were 10% about normal, but 9% lower than the comparable quarter a year ago. On this topic, APS had a peak load for the year of 7,020 megawatts on July 23rd during a weeklong heat wave and also surpassed last [peak] week. Lower usage by APS customers compared with the second quarter a year ago decreased quarterly results by $0.04 per share.","Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency programs, customer conservation and distributed generation were down 2% in the second quarter of 2014 versus 2013. Lower transmission revenue decreased earnings by $0.02 per share due to the annual update in May related to the formula rate filing and the updated estimate for the current year. We continue to expect transmission revenue to be relatively flat on a full year basis compared to 2013.","Beginning on slide eight, as I look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Economic growth in Arizona [Yervoy] continued its overall improvement in the second quarter 2014 consistent with the prior four quarters, although growth remains modest. Vacant housing in Metro Phoenix has fallen by more than half since its peak in early 2010 and it\u2019s at a slowest level in almost six years. Housing prices have responded. On the upper left hand side, you can see that prices on the existing home sales are 10% higher than they were a year ago and up 45% from the bottom of the market in mid 2011. As for commercial buildings, vacant space continues to be observed and the office and retail sectors yielding steadily declining vacancy rates.","As shown on the upper right, vacancy rates for industrial space reflected some sizeable new developments which just recently come on line. Both trends are indicative of the steady job growth the Metro Phoenix area and Arizona have been experiencing for the last three years. Arizona has added jobs year-over-year at around a very steady 2% since the end of 2011 as seen on the lower right hand side.","Business services, tourism, healthcare, wholesale trade, manufacturing and financial services have all been sources of growth in recent quarters. And highlight the sources for continued occupancy gains in the available commercial floor stock.","The lower left hand side shows that permits for new single family homes increased 8% in 2013 over 2012 and more than 75% from the low point in 2011. While single family had permit activity this year has been softer than we initially expected, multifamily permit activity has been robust and it's contributing to an overall increase in hosing investments.","As apartment rates and existing home prices continue to rise, we expect activity levels in both sectors to continue to expand. As Don mentioned, we are engaged with Oklahoma builders in recent weeks to validate our view of fundamental growth prospects for Phoenix and Arizona.","Slide nine displays selected public statements by four different home building executives, giving support to the idea that Phoenix remains very desirable city in which to work and raise a family. The sentiments expressed here are very much in line with our own.","In our conversations with the home builders, they have not wavered from these opinions. They do acknowledge that the market today is less robust than they and frankly than we expected but they're collectively quite confident that impediments faced in the housing market today are largely related to the hangover from the extreme business cycle we just went through.","In particular, the spread between new home and existing home prices while much narrower than several years ago remains too high and buy our confidence is rising only slowly. These factors along with other market dynamics have led to build subdued builder confidence at the moment.","And although this situation may slow the momentum for sing family home construction in near-term, it has created an opportunity for multi-family market to expand and at best rate and secure as I mentioned earlier.","On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in our economic environment and gradually steady recovery. As in past recovery, it is likely that each successive year in the near-term will be stronger as we go forward. Key in this pattern is a steady absorption of vacant housing which provides additional price support to existing homes and by extension the new home market.","Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% compared with the second quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response of the economic growth trends I just discussed.","It is easy to draw conclusions on long-term growth each quarter. However, we are planning and running our business for the long-term. Nothing we see changes our view as the long-term fundamental supporting each of population job growth in Arizona appear to be firmly in place.","Finally, I will review our recent financing and the financial outlook, referring to slide 10 in terms of our recent financing. On June 18th APS as issued 250 million a new 10 year, 3.35% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used along with other funds to refinance the 300 million, 5.8% maturity on June 30th.","We expect to need other 350 million of additional long-term debt later this year. During the second quarter, APS's temporarily purchased five series of Pollution Control revenue bonds totaling 166 million on their mandatory tender dates, and we expect to remarket our refinance the bonds within the next 12 months.","APS also remarketed two other series of Pollution Control Bonds totaling 49 million during the quarter. Overall, liquidity remains very strong, at the end of the second quarter we had total available liquidity of over $1 billion with a total of 177 million of commercial paper outstanding principally at APS. On May 9th we refinanced the Pinnacle West 200 million and the APS 500 million revolving credit facilities that would have mature in November 16th. These new facilities mature in 2019.","As we head into the important third quarter we continue to expect that Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2014 will be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per share. A completeness of factor in assumptions underlying our 2014 guidance is included on slide 11.","I will conclude with a brief on the Four Corners rate rider proceedings, Testimony recently concluded and hearings will begin next week the consensus for most interveners is that the transaction is a good investment for APS and its customers the focus of testimony and the hearing center on the determination of fair value rate of return.","APS believes that its interpretation is the most consistent with prior orders as served in our testimony. And this concludes our prepared remarks operator we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","Good morning, guys.","Don Brandt","","Good morning Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","On the housing outlook, you said it was maybe a little bit slower right now than you had anticipated, but more optimism out of the home builders. Can you just maybe convert how we should think about that optimism really being real versus home builders being optimistic, because by nature they tend to be.","Don Brandt","Sure. I had this, some of Jim's team do a little research and I personally called a few the CEO as I know got a perspective and I've got of several pages of note. So, I'm can't read them all, but let me hit couple of high points, so, it's virtually all were bullish on the Phoenix area, as you say those price there, their job to be bullish, but some of the observations. One they still see the labor markets being constrained.","And that's a negative, but it's sort of a temporary to 6 month to 15 month phenomena, most of them cited 12 consecutive quarters of job increases and lower unemployment rates, personal income growth, a high jobs to permit, in building permit ratio and favorable long-term outlook with respectable population and job growth.","Statistic that surprised me, but actually when we dug into it, it was validated by what we are seeing with their contacts to our folks that they reach out those 12 to 18 months, before they actually break ground to get the electric set up.","But over the last 12 months, the number of builder communities in the area and they range in different size, but in absolute number, they have increased from 300 to 400. So, we have seen a 33% increase in the number of communities.","Also, one specifically, I heard this reaction from several is they are not going to give these homes away, they see these ball ways of demand coming. And the one pointed to me that his to be that his average sale price increased 35% in the last 12 months, such as some of the commentary we saw. Also is the there is tremendous increase in multi-family construction and builder see that as where potential buyers are staging themselves now and they still talk about the amount of traffic at their display homes up substantially but the sales are not tracking the demand there and they attribute much of that to consumer confidence and concerns over job security. So hope that helps Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Yes, thank you for that. And I guess if I look at slide 17, we should the PV applications to residential levels and those numbers are relatively consistent year-on-year a lot of additional upside.","Can you just talk about where are you seeing those permits play so you\u2019ve seen changes in demographics are you seeing more of a bias between existing homes and new homes or any kind of trends we can draw from that data?","Jim Hatfield","No, real changes in the demographics that we\u2019ve seen \u201814 compared to \u201813.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. So, it looks the same. And then I guess the last question just because maybe I didn\u2019t pay my attention to it 111D as it relates to four corners and kind of the different treatment for the tribal lands. What are the considerations the EPA is taking up relative to kind of a full national perspective and how do you see that prospectively effecting this investment?","Mark Schiavoni","Hey this is Mark Schiavoni. Quite frankly we don\u2019t see any difference as the way they\u2019re going to treat it. But we quite frankly don\u2019t know much more of what they\u2019re going to do with tribal lands we\u2019ll know this fall and that\u2019s when we expect to get the feedback for what will take place on tribal lands.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","","Thanks. Jim I want to believe that your longer term growth expectations are ultimately going to come to fruition and that there are just sort of trailing behind because of the slow start to recovery. But your year-to-date sales are tracking 200 basis point behind customer growth not the 150 that you articulated you see it's been a long term average.","Am I just focusing in on two small of a data set and should we be waiting for a longer term trend look through the third quarter or the fourth quarter before we see how things play out?","Jim Hatfield","","Yes. That's said in my remarks Greg. I think it's easy to look at a quarter and extrapolate something. Last year if I look at three to six, trends we were up. And so there is a lot of volatility on these numbers today and I would third quarter is always big for us and the fourth quarter in terms of momentum into '15. So I am playing I am not worried about our long-term growth trend as I said we believe in the fundamentals in Arizona and Phoenix.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And if you look at the what is driving the delta between customer growth and sales growth, so still the impact of DG is still probably the smallest piece of that?","Jeff Guldner","","Yes. We are seeing a little usage per customer and that really relates to the consumer confidence in EE, DGs continue to be about 0.5% to 1% with really the EE and consumer confidence which is driven by job security or other things going underly being a bigger part of that.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","How's July been in terms of underlying demand trends?","Jeff Guldner","It\u2019s being good. Whether it's going to come in pretty much close to normal and we've seen usage demand pretty much according to expectations.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. Don, you made a pretty innovative filing with the commission to ask to participate in rooftop solar market in a pretty significant way. It would be 10% of the installs, if you were approved on a prospective basis. And that would be in rate base. What makes you think that the thought process of the ACC's evolved to a point where they think that the utility should be one of the service providers for rooftop solar, because historically, that has not been the case?","Don Brandt","Well, it hasn't. we did the couple of years ago of pilot project that the commissions proved up in flags that community power project. And we have learned a lot from that experience. And in this case, when we're doing rooftop solar first there is no cost ship from let's say lower creditworthy the customers, the higher creditworthy customers as there is under the current, I will call it the lease structure that some solar companies are using, because credit score is not an issue, it's basically structurally sound roof and customers is good to go. There is no upfront investment. We handle the maintenance. We will use reputable Arizona based installer. So it's jobs in Arizona and the customers are guaranteed $30 a month bill credit for 20 years from a company that\u2019s been around for 127 years and has AA credit rating and most of the others can\u2019t claim that.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay, One final question. Jim, as you look at the financial model for the company and you look at the aspiration to earn at least 9.5% on ROE on the capital investment. With the capital investment growing, if we\u2019re looking at least a short period where sales growth is stagnant, do you have a revenue model through the rate adjusters that you currently receive and your ability to control cost? Still allows you to hit your earnings targets in\u2026","Jim Hatfield","","Yes Greg, I think it\u2019s important remember while we are in a base rate stay out, we have mechanism Four Corners in \u201815, we have AZ Sun, we have the TCA, LFCR. So, the top line is not stagnant from that perspective.","Don Brandt","","Greg, this is Don. We are very confident we\u2019ll make our numbers.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thank you, guys. Have a good afternoon.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","","Good morning.","Don Brandt","","Hey Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","","So first just picking up on Greg\u2019s last question if you don't mind. On the solar rooftop program if you will, how do you ensure that you'll be competitive or how do you just think about competitiveness versus the broader marketplace, if you can elaborate a little bit.","Don Brandt","","Well because our program will apply to the broad market whereas the current programs are effectively discriminating against low income customers. To quality for credit score to qualify for lease arrangement or to purchase the solars come up alright and purchase it, basically skews that market to the higher end customers, where there is no credit score requirement, just a structurally sound roof. So, it's across the whole system and there is no subsidization from one credit category of customer to another.","Jeff Guldner","Julien, this is Jeff Guldner. Just one thing to keep in mind to, this isn\u2019t another option. So it doesn't displace the current folks that are out there, this is simply saying that we extend the program that's modeled like our Arizona Sun program or on utility ownership to a broader set of customers than probably could get it today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. So, could you extend a little bit about where and how big this program could get? I mean, I know it's a little early, but obviously this is the growth subject.","Paul Mountain","So, it's Paul right now. This is a compliance program; we've got a compliance requirement in our Arizona Sun settlement commitment for 20 megawatts of generation. If you convert that 20 megawatts, it's either 20 megawatt utility scale project or it's 3,000 smaller solar rooftops.","So, that's how we are thinking about this program.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. All right. Excellent. And then moving on, you talked here about creating a new transco, 50\/50, but it was also in the context of a broader Western exploration from what I could tell, right?","Don Brandt","That's correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","In that vein, what other opportunities are you exploring outside of what you specifically called out?","Don Brandt","Well, we're looking with our partner on several opportunities in the West, none are as far as long as DCR which is front center right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. And then could you just elaborate a little bit more on the weather norm sales growth trends? How much of what we saw in the quarter is energy efficiency versus as you said consumer confidence what have you?","Jim Hatfield","Well, energy efficiency, the consumer confidence roughly $0.06 per share offset by customer growth of $0.04 and then slightly lower usage about $0.03, so all together about $0.06.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Okay, all right. Well thank you very much.","Jim Hatfield","Thanks Julien.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Thank you. Good morning.","Paul Mountain","Good morning.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Jim can you remind us in your forecast for weather normalized sales, what the assumptions are? If I recall for \u201814 you\u2019d assumed about 0.5% and going forward about 1% a year is that right?","Jim Hatfield","0.5% this year looking through \u201816 on average 1%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. And then how sensitive are your plans for the next rate case filing around where these sales numbers do come out? And if we don\u2019t hit those targets and let\u2019s say we\u2019re flat to even down, how much capacity you have in terms of staying away from the rate case filing?","Jim Hatfield","Well we\u2019re confident even stressing sales under the model that we will hit above 9.5% in this out.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. But just to give us some cushion around that would that be even a negative sales scenario or flattish sales scenario?","Jim Hatfield","If you look the last -- I really think since \u201808 we\u2019ve had negative sales every year including since the stay-out went to effect and we have a waiver from our commitment.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. And then separately on the filing for the solar roof top option, does that sort of signal to us that you guys sort of the feedback you were getting from the commission would suggest that they will perhaps not supportive of the scale not a model. And so just this kind of gets down another option to look at or do you think you will scale 20 megawatt Redhawk is still a viable option in front of the commission.","Jeff Guldner","This is Jeff this is simplified as an option so what the commission will do they are considering the application that we've made or considered both the 20 megawatt utility scale 1 and that's distributed alternative as an option.","Don Brandt","","And Ali, I'll add it wasn't an issue feedback from the commission it was listing to our customers. And there is a significant segment of our customers manufacture the majority that we're locked out of the solar route market because either lack of credit standing or a lack of upward cash to investment.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","Okay. And last question as you look at your sales comparisons going forward, you want to run into some easier comparisons you had negative numbers you brought in the third and fourth quarter last year weather normalize can you just remind us what were factors there that perhaps still get repeated this year as we look at the second half numbers for our sales growth?","Don Brandt","","Ali, there are several trends go into that for example last year we had a very cold first quarter so customers got high bills. We had a very warm second quarter so they got a high builds. And that leads to lower levels of usage and we think a lot of the last '13 was really the impact a very strong first half of the year as a relates to sales and the impact of weather.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. I'm just trying to think a little bit longer term about kind of where rate base is going. You obviously give your CapEx forecast in the appendices but also, things that could provide upside to that level. Could you just kind of summarize and it may be kind of a short list, what are things that could provide incremental upside to rate base or even capital spending levels that aren't necessarily in your current CapEx forecast through about 2018 or so?","Don Brandt","Well, the upside would be certainly outside of rate based transformation, which currently as in. Our forecast $0.80 not in our forecast at this point, because it's just a proposal. I think reflecting customer growth in the base infrastructure and PND. So that sort of the two things I can play with some visibility.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Is Ocotillo currently in the forecast? I know it's not due online until '17, '18 time frame.","Don Brandt","The bill was started in '16 and '17 for the most part saying with the SCR is four quarter is really '16, '17 CapEx period.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed with your question.","Kit Konolige - BGC","","Good morning.","","Don Brandt","Hey Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Just had a question about the political situation I believe there is a primary on, I think it\u2019s August 26. Can you give us a sense of how that team of Parker and Mason is doing in the Republican primary?","Don Brandt","","Well the voting doesn\u2019t start until I guess the end of this week the early voting and you are right the election the primary is August 26th.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Do you guys have any, I don\u2019t know if there is any polling on an ACC race or do you guys have any sense of who's ahead? Maybe you can also give us a little background on how much of an issue DG has become in that race or solar in particular?","Don Brandt","","There is good poling of the both, and Kit I would suggest to each of the candidates their websites are kind of give you the inclination of their issues.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, Don.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","","Does the DCR transmission line project, has FERC set the allowed ROE on that or is that also part of the competitive bid process?","Jim Hatfield","","It\u2019s part of the competitive bid process like Don said in his remarks for selective we won\u2019t know until early \u201815 and it\u2019s 20-20 in services state so we have a lot ahead of us before we even count on DCR at this point.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","","Got it. That\u2019s the only question I had, thank you.","Jim Hatfield","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Your O&M is tracking very well year-over-year which we look for the back half of the year to show?","Don Brandt","Well, we do know that from an overall perspective we have more fall outages than we have in prior year. So that's probably going to put a little stress on O&M. But overall I would say that, the things Mark and I and the rest of the leadership team are doing around the sustainable cost is providing dividends now, and as we are implementing enterprise price process improvement, we think we'll keep that going for at least a couple of years. At some point we're going to get into wage inflation and that's just the way it's going to be. But right now we're still working at fairly flat O&M.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Do you have any favor on the 790 to 810 range?","Jim Hatfield","We will look at that as we get into the third quarter and we plan our outages and we see how the summer goes, remember we have storms and we stretch an equipment in the third quarter's key in terms of what will be, so we'll update that in the third quarter.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","And what's the status of the discussion around the tax position of leased solar?","Jim Hatfield","Well, the position now, by the Department of Revenue, is they are subject to property tax. They will begin, they have been sending out assessments to be paid in 2015. Nothing's changed on ruling at this point from the Department of Revenue.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Hey, Don. Hey Jim. How are you?","Jim Hatfield","Hey how are you?","Don Brandt","Hey, Jim, how are you?","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Good. I want to just touch based on the solar topic a little bit. Is there anything unique in your proposal that\u2019s different than say what the competitors are doing right now? I know one of the big hang ups is the lean that gets attached by the competitors; are you going to do something where you\u2019re observing that cost or somebody tries to sell their house -- there is no $30,000 lean or so attached to the home?","Don Brandt","You\u2019re correct. There is no lean on the home; basically we\u2019re renting for 20 years the roof space. And the customers are eligible to cancel it any point in time. So when they sell the home, if the new home owner doesn\u2019t want to solar on his roof top, his or her roof top for whatever reason, we will remove it and put the roof back in the shape it was before the equipment was up there.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","So, that sounds like the unique proposition that could actually improve the penetration rates pretty high and maybe\u2026","Don Brandt","Very customer friendly.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","And then they get a credit worth counterparty and somebody who is not going to, who will actually answer the phone calls right?","Don Brandt","Exactly.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Okay. I got it.","Don Brandt","Stand behind it.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Second thing is I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about the housing market and some of the disconnects there. But can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on and call it wager income growth in Arizona, I mean is that flat or is that kind of rising?","Jim Hatfield","No, in terms of wages we see, wages grow 3.1% year-over-year so we\u2019re having strong wage growth. Personal incomes are up almost 3%. So, it\u2019s really a lot around a couple things that Don mentioned, I mean certainly credit is tighter today you need to bigger down payment. And just confidence in the economy is still not where it was I don't think and I think all these things are impacting.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Okay. I forgot to ask the second part of my question on the solar thing, so I apologize for jumping around but with the solar proposal that you are doing, is that going to go into rate base or that going to go outside of the utility?","Jim Hatfield","","If it's approved by the commission it would be a rate based item.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Okay. And what would be your initial investment out of all this?","Jim Hatfield","","We think it's 60 million to 65 million roughly to a lot of that would depend on the size of the installations and number and so on so forth.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group","Great, sounds good. That's all I need guys. Thank you. ","Jim Hatfield","","Thanks.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to just the confidence in hitting some of your targets and numbers coming forward. Can you talk more about the specific leverage you have in O&M CapEx equity that will help you get the numbers. And then second relating to that to the extent that you can't hit your numbers for whatever reason, couldn\u2019t you just go ahead and file a rate case? And obviously this is all assuming that the commission approves your request.","Jim Hatfield","","Well, so levers we have we don't plan on achieving equity till 2016 at the earliest. You saw the numbers flat O&M with benefits down. That continues to be lever, I would say overall cost control is a focus of this company and we\u2019re more managing cost well. And we have the mechanism that I talked about.","So we've said we do want to file in \u201815, so we'll see how that goes we have large CapEx going in \u201816, \u201817 and \u201818. So moving the right case back certainly lines up better with our CapEx spend. So we're highly confident, we're going to hit our numbers during this period.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then are you envisioning or does your request for the commission to have some sort of stay out period or would they just potentially remove the requirement to file a rate case and you can come in at any time?","Don Brandt","Remember, under the settlement, we could not file until May 31, 2015. The net meter in May order that sort of coming on that date, if they remove that, it's open in after May 31st we could follow last half of '15, '16, '17. There is no requirement at that point.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley","Great. That was it. Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Hey, one more time here. I just wanted to get some clarity, if you wouldn't mind, about when you would expect to see new solar tariffs in place coming out of both these workshops and revisiting the broader subject of solar tariffs? And then secondly, just to be very clear about it, when would you expect to file another rate case, given your commitment to continue earnings your ROE irrespective?","Don Brandt","So on the first side, if you not ask or do we expect any change in the $5 tariff at this point. And remember that tariff those to offset the LFCR. So there is no income impact ATS. Second of all, we wouldn't follow-up to at least 2016 at the earliest and that would be dependent upon earnings and allowed ROEs around the country and some of the other things.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And just to be clear, in theory, when would that $5 tariff at least be revisited, just procedurally speaking.","Don Brandt","","That would be, if you do a rate design change or a change like that that would happen in the next rate case.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. In some sense you would be revisiting that here in the near term, subsequently implementing whatever changes came out of that at the conclusion of a rate case in 2016?","Don Brandt","","Yes conceptually that the commission right now is talking about going some generic rate design discussions that would benefit from having our rate case come after those discussion have occurred which is part of the desire to move that out to 2016. Once you get through those discussions then you could begin to implement those in that subsequent rate case.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And there would be no requirement, even in 2016, for you to file, right? That's just your, that would be subject to your decision.","Don Brandt","","The proposal right now is they are talking about is to lift the requirement that we file in 2015 it was in the net mitering decision if you look that back you would go back to the underlying settlement which had a no earlier than requirement.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Right, great. Thank you.","Operator","","We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Paul Mountain","","That concludes our call.

Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulation, is also here with us.","Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you.

It will also be available by telephone through March 1.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Don.","Donald E. Brandt","Thanks, Becky, and thank you, all, for joining us today. In 2012, we made progress in a number of key areas as we focused on our core electric utility business. This progress included demonstrating sustained improvement in Arizona's regulatory environment, making strategic capital investments, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery in Arizona. Jim and I will provide more information on these areas through our remarks today.","Looking first to Arizona regulation. Early last month, the composition of the Arizona Corporation Commission changed as the commissioners elected in November, Bob Stump, Susan Bitter Smith and Bob Burns, were sworn in, and Bob Stump was elected Chairman of the commission. With 2 new members and commissioners Stump, Brenda Burns and Gary Pierce continuing in office, the commission is now comprised of 5 Republicans. In January, the commissioners unanimously approved APS's 2013 Renewable Energy Standard implementation plan. The plan contains steps for continued compliance with the commission's Renewable Energy Standard and other APS commitments while balancing the need to moderate customers' bills and to support renewable energy. Given our history over the past several years, it is indeed a pleasant change for me not to be discussing a pending retail rate case. APS's retail regulatory settlement that became effective July 1, 2012, was progressive and contained broad-ranging benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Among other things, it provides the financial support APS needs to meet our customers' energy needs while helping to achieve Arizona's energy goals. It also provides a measure of regulatory certainty for both customers and shareholders through at least mid-2016. Third, it allows retail rates to change gradually over time through a number of rate adjustment mechanisms. Moderating rates this way will avoid the need for large base rate increases every several years while allowing reasonable recovery for APS's prudently incurred expenditures. And finally, it allows APS the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on invested common equity during the 4-year settlement period. With that settlement in place, we are continuing to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and various stakeholders on a collaborative approach to the state's energy future.","Our capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS's electric customers while addressing Arizona's energy goals and environmental compliance. Today, I'll update you on 2 components of our capital expenditure program, the AZ Sun Program and the planned Four Corners acquisition. Our renewable energy initiatives, including the AZ Sun Program, taken together, are an important part of a comprehensive resource plan designed to advance our state's energy future. Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own utility-scale photovoltaic solar plants in Arizona. To date, we have commitments in place for a total of 118 megawatts, with a projected capital investment of $502 million. So far, we have placed 4 plants in commercial operation with a total capacity of 69 megawatts. The latest addition was 19 megawatts at the Chino Valley site in Northern Arizona that went into service on November 26 of last year. Construction and other development activities are currently under way for another 49 megawatts at 2 sites in Southwestern Arizona called Yuma Hills and Hyder. We expect those facilities will go into operation later this year.","We are continuing with our plan to acquire Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico. The plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially, and has already been approved by Arizona, California and federal regulators, as well as other government agencies. In mid-December, the Navajo Nation and BHP Billiton, the parent company of the operator of the coal mine serving that plant, announced that they had entered into a memoranda of understanding under which BHP plans to sell the coal mine operation to the Navajo Nation. The Nation would retain BHP as the mine manager and operator until July 2016. It's currently expected that the Navajo Nation Tribal Council will consider approval of their transaction in the second quarter.","APS has been negotiating a new coal supply contract for Four Corners. Key terms of the new contract are being finalized by APS, the other Four Corners co-owners and the Navajo Nation. We expect that this agreement would be executed upon completion of negotiations and following the transfer of ownership of the stock of BHP's mine operation subsidiary to a new Navajo Nation commercial entity. We are targeting mid this year to close APS's Four Corners acquisition from Southern California Edison, following satisfactory completion of a new coal supply contract and finalization of other typical closing conditions.","Turning now to our operational excellence. Excellence in day-to-day execution remains a top priority. Our performance in 2012 reflected this focus. I'll highlight just a few examples. First, Pinnacle West stock outperformed our industry. We're pleased that our total return to shareholders, comprised of stock price appreciation, plus dividends, was 10.3% for the year, which compares very favorably with U.S. electric utility average of just 0.1%. Second, our industrial safety record is one of our top accomplishments. I am proud to report that in 2012, we had the lowest number of recordable injuries in our company's history, bettering our record performance in 2011. However, every member of our team and I will continue to drive safety performance toward our goal of 0 injuries. Third, our baseload nuclear and coal fleet continues to turn in solid performance. For the full year 2012, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a site average capacity factor above 92%. Palo Verde had its best production year ever, topping its site record from 2011 and generating almost 32 million megawatt hours. Additionally, in 2012, Palo Verde was the top U.S. power producer of any kind for the 21st consecutive year. Furthermore, Palo Verde is the only U.S.-generating facility of any kind to ever exceed 30 million megawatt hours in a single year, and it did so last year for the eighth time. Our fossil plants also have operated well. When appropriate, we took advantage of low near-term natural gas prices by reducing output by our coal plants and increasing gas plant production. And fourth, top tier reliability and other customer-focused efforts allowed APS to again achieve top decile customer satisfaction as evidenced by the company being ranked third highest nationally among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities by J.D. Power and Associates. In addition, APS's system reliability continued to be in the best quartile of our industry on almost every reliability metric.","To close my remarks, I'm very pleased with where our company is today and very optimistic about our future. With the retail settlement behind us, we expect we will continue to achieve top-tier performance through our day-to-day focus on excellence and execution, cost management, strategic forward thinking and continuous improvements, areas in which our talented leadership team and workforce perform very well.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for the financial and economic overview. Jim?","James R. Hatfield","Thank you, Don. Today, I will discuss the following topics: first, I will review our fourth quarter results, including the earnings and the primary variances from last year's corresponding quarter; second, I will discuss our 2012 full year results; third, I'll provide an update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy; and fourth, I will review the recent upgrades of our credit ratings and our financing plans; and finally, I'll discuss our earnings guidance and our financial outlook for the next few years.","Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for 2012's fourth quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $23 million or $0.20 per share compared with a net income of $13 million or $0.11 per share for the prior year's fourth quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.13 per share. For the 2012 fourth quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $27 million or $0.24 per share versus ongoing earnings of $12 million or $0.11 per share, both for the same quarter a year ago.","Slide 7 reconciles our fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our previously discontinued operations.","My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results. Slide 8 displays the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.22 per share compared with the prior year's fourth quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprised this positive net variance, and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide. Second, lower infrastructure-related costs improved earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with a 20-year license extension granted for Palo Verde in 2011 by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These cost reductions were partly offset by higher property tax related to tax rate increases. Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. The expense increase primarily consisted of the effects of amortization in this year's fourth quarter of pension and other postretirement benefit costs compared with the deferral of such costs in 2011 pursuant to APS's retail regulatory settlements. An increase in other employee benefit costs and higher information technology costs primarily related to software, these increases were partially offset by lower fossil generation costs because of less planned maintenance being completed in the 2012 quarter than the same quarter a year ago. This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs. Fourth, the net impact of other miscellaneous items decreased earnings by $0.07 per share.","Turning to Slide 9 and the components of the net increase in our gross margin. Total gross margin increased $0.22 per share compared with last year's fourth quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows: APS's retail regulatory settlement, which became effective July 1, improved gross margin by $0.13 per share, almost all of which was comprised of a nonfuel base rate increase. The company also stopped recording line extension fees received as revenues when the 2012 settlement became effective. The retail transmission revenue increase that became effective last summer improved earnings by $0.06 per share. Higher weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation, increased our earnings by $0.06 per share. The variance was primarily driven by modest customer growth of 1.4% in the quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.03 per share. Increased fuel and purchase power costs, net of lower off-system sales and higher mark-to-market valuations, reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. This variance is a result of the Power Supply Adjustor modification effective mid-2012 with the implementation of the regulatory settlement that changed the PSA to 100% pass-through as compared to the 90-10 sharing mechanism that was previously in effect. The effects of milder weather reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. The 2012 fourth quarter was near normal, while the prior year's fourth quarter was favorably cooler than normal.","Putting all this in context, let's look at our full year comparison on Slide 10. On a GAAP basis for the year 2012 as a whole, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $382 million or $3.45 per share compared with net income of $339 million or $3.09 per share for 2011. Our ongoing earnings for 2012 were $3.50 per share compared to $2.99 per share for 2011. Our 2012 ongoing earnings were at the top of our guidance range of $3.35 to $3.50 per share. The performance was due largely to stronger-than-expected gross margin growth in the fourth quarter and continued cost management efforts.","Turning to Slides 11 and 12 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the fourth quarter, although the growth remains modest as has been the case for the last several quarters. As shown on Slide 11, growth in nonfarm jobs continues to show improvement. The rate of overall job growth is increasing steadily and has been consistently positive for the last 2 years. Nearly all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. In 2012, Arizona job growth was 1.5x higher than the national rate. The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth in incomes and consumer spending, and this pushed the unemployment rate down generally in parallel with national trends.","While these trends were positive, we believe that we still have a few more quarters to go before we see local markets returning to more normal conditions. On Slide 11, you can see our estimate of the amount of vacant homes and apartments that presently exist in our service territory in Metro Phoenix. The reduction in vacancies in 2012 was the greatest since vacancies peaked in late 2009 and early 2010. The absorption has sparked some renewed interest in single-family housing market. Permit activity has increased in each of the last 6 consecutive quarters and finished the fourth quarter 72% higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year permits were 56% higher than 2011 levels. We believe we are on pace to further reduce those vacancies by the end of this year to a level where existing home resale pricing will be more supportive of new home construction.","On Slide 12, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in the Case-Shiller repeat sales index. Throughout 2012, we saw an uptick in existing home prices, as the number of foreclosure sales has declined and the level of housing demand improved. Even with the rebound in pricing, affordability of single-family housing remains high by historical standards and combined with an improving economy is a key support for the current housing demand. The decline of vacancies and foreclosures and the increases in prices is evidence of the continuing progression of the housing market back to more normal conditions.","This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market. As you can see on the slide, vacancy rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels but remain quite high, while those for industrial space have fallen more dramatically. Again, we view this as a positive trend but believe that the extent of vacant space in the office and retail markets means that the recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes. On balance, we see signs of improvement in all economic indicators, which paint a more -- a picture of continuing steady recovery. But it will still be 12 to 18 months before the Arizona economy has returned to normal levels of economic activity and growth.","Reflecting this modest steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.4% in 2012's fourth quarter compared with the same quarter a year earlier and represents the strongest growth we've seen in 4 years. Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona's growth are still there and that our growth rate in customers will return to more typical levels. Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2013 through 2015, with growth rates higher at the end of the period than in the near term for the reasons I've just discussed. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather-normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2013 through 2015, primarily due to customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.","Slide 13 displays our investment grade credit ratings. In November, Standard & Poor's raised its corporate credit and other ratings on Pinnacle West and APS to BBB+ from BBB. As you recall, after approval of the retail rate settlement in May, both Moody's and Fitch raised Pinnacle West and APS's credit ratings, including APS's long-term credit ratings, to the BBB+ level. We are pleased that the rating agencies recognized the constructive regulatory outcome and our improving financial performance.","Regarding our planned financing activity, we do not have any long-term debt maturing in 2013. We do plan to issue debt to fund the acquisition that Don discussed of Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners plant later this year if the transaction is consummated. Following successful completion of the retail rate settlement, we currently project we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest. The timing and amount of any equity issuance would facilitate rebalancing APS's capital structure and provide support for the company's credit metrics.","Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 14, we continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2013 to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.60 per share. The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed in the appendix to our slides.","Slide 15 depicts our longer-term financial outlook. Last October, our Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.08 per share or about 4% to $2.18 per share effective with the December 2012 payment. In addition, we currently plan to grow the dividend by approximately 4% annually. Of course, future dividends are subject to declaration at the Board of Directors' discretion.","Pinnacle West's consolidated earned return on average common equity was 9.9% in the year 2012 compared with 8.8% in 2011. The company's goal is to achieve an annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of at least 9.5% through 2015. This level represents another step change in earned returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from the combination of our rate settlement with our operational excellence and cost management initiatives. This goal reflects the financial support initiatives in the key factors and assumptions in the appendix.","While I am discussing longer-term factors, I'd like to touch upon a few earnings and cash flow hot topics in the industry. Our costs for pension and other postretirement medical benefits included in O&M were up $12 million pretax in 2012 compared with 2011, including the effects of the deferrals prior to July 1, 2012, and amortization since then pursuant to APS's retail regulatory settlements. We expect the related O&M costs to remain relatively steady, if not decline somewhat over the next few years. Our expectations also reflect a discount rate of 4.01% from -- for 2012 versus a 2011 discount rate of 4.42%.","Since bonus depreciation was extended for 2013 by the new tax act at the beginning of this year, many of you have asked about the impact of the extension. We estimate that as a result of the combination of provisions of the 2012 and 2010 tax acts, total cash tax benefits from bonus depreciation could be up to $400 million to $500 million. We anticipate these tax benefits will be fully realized by APS by the end of 2013, with the majority of the benefit having been realized by year-end 2012.","In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.1 billion annually for 2013 through 2015 as shown in the Form 10-K. However, approximately 40% of this amount will be recovered through rate adjustment mechanisms, and approximately 35% will be covered through a depreciation cash flow. That leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag. With this capital spending level, we continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% in 2013 through 2015.","In closing, we are confident in our expectations to achieve our financial objectives through 2015, that is during the base rate stay-out period. Our confidence is supported by the gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement, coupled with our demonstrated operational execution and cost management abilities. Additionally, our outlook conservatively assumes a modest economic recovery. An accelerated return to economic growth should provide upside to our outlook.","And this concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would be pleased to take questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Cole with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] I guess a broad question about 2013 guidance. I just have a tough time keeping my numbers down towards the mid-point, given that I really only see upward movement given the rate case, the TCA, the LFCR true-up, Four Corners and the assumption of normal weather. Is there any unknown risk that maybe I'm just not seeing that could possibly get you towards the bottom end of your guidance range?","James R. Hatfield","No. I think we've laid out our story pretty effectively. Just a couple points, Kevin. One, we performed very well in 2012 and was able to get to top end of our guidance. We set our guidance range last November, and we got a lot to execute throughout the year. And it's a little early to be changing guidance when we have all summer ahead of us, which is really where we make our money.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess weather aside, I should -- if I just assume normal weather, I should be towards the top end?","James R. Hatfield","I always plan to be in the middle of the range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I'm taking a look at the appendices here, and there are some moving pieces in the guidance relative to the Analyst Day. Gross margin was down, but it looks like O&M operating expenses offset those, as well as interest. Can you talk about some of the assumptions that drove the changes to the appendix?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, it's really just the delay in the Four Corners transaction. Assuming a mid-year close, in the 6-month or short rate cycle, as opposed to getting the rate increase July 1, '13, it will be more like January 1, '14. So it really reflects nothing but Four Corners. Nothing else has really changed.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I wanted to confirm. On bonus depreciation, the number, Jim, you cited was $400 million to $500 million?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, it's -- impact this year of about somewhere between $50 million and $100 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The slide where you talked about dividend growth of about 4% expected over the next 3 years or so, Jim, should we assume that, that basically moves in line with EPS growth? Or how should we be thinking about that relative to EPS growth?","James R. Hatfield","Well, what we've been talking about is rate base growth of 6% should lead to net income growth somewhere lower than 6%. And if you will, the dividend growth is sort of the floor, so to speak, on what we think is possible over the next few years.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Because, I mean, if EPS growth is any greater than that, then you're implying that your payout ratio would be coming down.","James R. Hatfield","Slightly. Very slightly.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And more near term, coming back to '13, the Four Corners delay, the rate increase going into effect, let's say, beginning of '14, if my math is right, it's about $0.07 if you will delay in earnings in '13. And I'm wondering, is that a direct offset to that? Or is that within the band of the range that you've laid out? How should I think about that?","James R. Hatfield","That's within the band of the range that we laid out.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But my math makes sense to you?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, it makes sense.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is, essentially, the load growth assumption that you've made out there, relatively flat going forward, can you remind us the earnings sensitivity to, let's say, a 1% change in load growth?","James R. Hatfield","1% change in customer growth is about $0.10 per share, as a rule of thumb.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's customer growth. Should I equate that to sales growth as well, weather-normalized?","James R. Hatfield","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Akers with Wells Fargo.","Sarah Akers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With the new makeup of the commission, do you think there's any chance that the commission may reconsider the aggressive energy efficiency standards that are currently in place?","Jeffrey B. Guldner","Sarah, this is Jeff Guldner. They are certainly asking questions about the standard. And so one of the discussions we've had at open meetings has been around how you do the performance or how you manage cost effectiveness. And so as they look at that, that has the potential to impact it. There's also some things they are looking at with respect to how large customers, like a mine, is impacted by energy efficiency. So there may be some changes from that, but there's certainly discussion going on.","Sarah Akers - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then are there any other potential regulatory issues or regulatory initiatives on your part that we should keep an eye on over the next 9, 12 months or so?","James R. Hatfield","No, I think probably the biggest thing is -- Sarah, is we have some technical workshops now on the impact of net metering, and that will be ongoing through the first half of the year. Other than that, they're like any commission who's looking at the impact to consumers of everything that's going on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jim, could you just repeat something you said around the $1.1 billion of annual CapEx?","James R. Hatfield","Sure.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You said 40% had rider recovery and 35% had what?","James R. Hatfield","It's covered by cash from depreciation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ellinghaus with Williams Capital.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group, L.P., Research Division","Can you give us any detail on what the loss from discontinued operations was in the fourth quarter? That's kind of a more substantial number than normal.","James R. Hatfield","Yes. It's specific to SunCor, and it really is part of the final wind-down through bankruptcy of SunCor.","Christopher R. Ellinghaus - The Williams Capital Group, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And as far as the rating changes have transpired over the last couple of years, are you satisfied where you're at now? And I'm really thinking in terms of future equity needs. Do you have greater aspirations for credit ratings? Or can you just give a little color...","James R. Hatfield","No. We obviously always have aspirations for higher credit ratings, but we're very happy the BBB level. It's probably at or slightly above average for the industry as a whole. And with the BBB+, we have more room, so to speak, than we had when we were BBB or BBB-. So certainly would not issue equity with the stated goal of trying to raise the credit rating.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You achieved 9.9% consolidated ROE in 2012. Can I assume that it is likely that will fall to the 9.5% range for '13? And is that -- can I equate that to about the mid-point of your guidance?","Donald E. Brandt","No -- Charles, Don Brandt here. No, I don't think you can equate that or assume that it will fall to 9.5%. As we've communicated in the past, we believe during this period of we're out of the regulatory environment or at least base rate cases, we're looking at greater than a 9.5% return.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then declining as you get farther along in the stay-out or...","James R. Hatfield","Well...","Donald E. Brandt","No, it's -- it will be more than 9.5% each of those years.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then the -- on the financial outlook, the bullet points you list, I think the second last one with the -- for 2013, the decrease in interest expense, that is all due to the delay in Four Corners?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, primarily.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","The AZ Sun, I'm sorry if I missed this, how many megawatts did you put in 2012? And what's now the forecast for 2013 through 2015?","James R. Hatfield","Well, we have 118 megawatts under development, 69 of which were in service at the end of the year. And we're in development currently of another 49 megawatts, as Don mentioned. And then beyond '13, we'll continue to work on the renewable energy plan, which needs to be approved by the commission.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the -- the retail customer sales growth, it looks like it's 1.5%, and before, it was 1%. But the longer-term growth, you're still sort of projecting 2%.","James R. Hatfield","That's right. And we expect that you'll get acceleration throughout the '13 to '15 period with higher growth at the end to get to an average.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That's right. You guys mentioned that last time. Just on the offset, the 2.5% growth offset that you guys are projecting, with renewables, how much is the distributor renewable element of that? I'm sorry. How much of -- I know it's energy conservation and efficiency. But what's the renewable sort of distributed impact on that?","James R. Hatfield","It's about 1%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And does anything, I mean -- I know that it's early and the previous question on what the ACC is looking into. But is there -- do you have any -- do you guys feel more or less confident about -- or let me put it this way, do you think that there's more upside potential in terms of sales growth, given the tone of conversation and discussion that you're seeing at the ACC versus perhaps last quarter?","James R. Hatfield","No, not where we sit today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management.","Kevin Fallon","I just had a question on the Four Corners milestones to the transaction actually closing. What are the steps that need to occur between now and when it actually closes?","Donald E. Brandt","Primarily, the transaction between BHP and the Navajo Nation transferring the coal mine -- the coal mine operations.","Kevin Fallon","And they have to reach an agreement first and then there needs to be a vote by the Navajo Nation. Is that correct?","Donald E. Brandt","Essentially. And then the Navajo Nation Council has to approve it.","Kevin Fallon","And after that occurs, does the transaction just consummate at that point? Or is there an incremental step that needs to be done?","James R. Hatfield","We'll need to sign a coal contract with the Nation now that they have the mine, and then it will be normal closing preparation and then closing.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And once the transaction is actually completed, what's the process that it moves into rate? And, in particular, is it purely a single issue of moving into the rates? Or is there any kind of a reopener or look at earned returns or anything like that?","James R. Hatfield","Well, our settlement kept the docket open for the treatment of Four Corners upon acquisition, and that calls for the deferral during a period of time where we file and get rates into effect. I wouldn't call it a single issue rate case, but there's already been an adjudication of the Four Corners purchase prior to that. So, I mean, it'll be focused on just bringing Four Corners in.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. So as long as your equity ratio and earned returns are in line with expectations, there's no reason to see those being revisited?","James R. Hatfield","I would not think so.","Kevin Fallon","Okay. And just the last thing. Any update on the potential for transmission investments?","James R. Hatfield","Still working on it.","Operator","Ms. Hickman, we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Rebecca L. Hickman","Thank you, Christine. And thank you again for joining us today.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. A Question-and-Answer Session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Geisler, Director of Investor Relations for Pinnacle West. Thank you, Mr. Geisler, you may now begin.","Ted Geisler","Thank you, Manny. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter and 2017 earnings, recent developments and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy; is also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from our expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning.

It will also be available by telephone through May 9.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks Ted and thank you all for joining us today. 2017 has started off in line with our expectations and we remain well positioned for a very solid year. Before Jim discussed the details of our first quarter results I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments.","I know EPS as a rate review is top of mine from many of you and we continue making good progress with this preceding. On March 1, we announced a settlement which has broad base support. In total 29 interveners signed a settlement agreement including the Arizona corporation commission staff, the residential and utility consumer officer Ruco, members of the local and national solar industry and low income advocates.","The settlement provisions contain a number of benefits to our customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. Details of the settlements were outlined in the appendix of our slides today and I'll review some of the highlights with you now.","Slide 8 shows the settlements proposed base rate changes, which include a non-fuel, non-depreciation base rate increase of $87.2 million per year excluding the transfer of adjusted balances. Additionally, APS will decrease rates by $53.6 million attributable to reduce fuel and purchase power cost and increase rates by $61 million due to changes in depreciation schedules. The result is a total base rate increase of $94.6 million or an overall 3.3% bill increased. Other elements that underpin the settlement including maintaining our allowed return on equity at 10%, our capital structure and base fuel rate are also listed on the slide.","The settlement contains a number of important financial provisions which reduce regulatory lag and better aligned rates with the cost to service. In particular the settlement provides for a cost deferral order for the Ocotillo Modernization project and a cost deferral order plus rate adjustment for the selective catalytic reduction equipment to Four Corners. Also the current property tax deferral continues in the power supply adjuster is expanded to include additional production cost. APS proposed changes to the rate options offered to customers ensuring the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. This one is an important focus of our filing.","The settlement includes meaningful changes to modernize rates including shifting the on peak period from 12 noon to 7 pm, to 3 pm to 8 pm in the afternoon and early evening, which is more aligned with actual peak usage by customers. Importantly new distributor generation customers will be required to select a rate option that has time of used rates including the great access to our demand component. APS was the among the first utilities in the nation during it is time of use rates for residential customers back in 1984 today more than half of our customers chose the time of used rate for their service. This settlement will create another first by establishing time of use rates as a standard for all new customers after May 1, 2018, except for our smallest customers.","The settlement also contains a self-build Moratorium through January 1, 2022, with certain exceptions. For example the Moratorium excludes investments in new combustion turbines that will placed in service after January 1, 2022. Finally, the settlement includes a three year stay out for the next general rate case application under, this provision APS may file its next general rate case on or after June 1, 2019.","Lastly, the APCs formal hearing on the APS rate review began and its currently underway. Looking ahead we anticipate the administrative war judge to issue a recommended order followed by a commissioner vote at an upcoming open meeting. We view the proposed settlement agreement as a further sign of Arizona's constructed regulatory environment. We appreciate the opportunity to continue working with ACC and various stake holders to find solutions that balanced interest of customers, shareholders and the communities we serve.","Turning to our operations, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another successful quarter operating above their 100% capacity factor, a planned refilling outage for Palo Verde unit 2 began on April 8. Additionally, at the Four Corners Power Plant our employees are making solid progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction equipment and construction activity is ramping up at our Ocotillo Modernization project. This year we are investing more in our distribution systems than ever before. Our focus on modernizing the distribution grid is not a temporary phase, but instead a shift in how reprioritize investments with a greater emphasis on our transmission and distribution business.","Over the next few years we expect to invest $1.8 billion in our grid infrastructure enabling a more secure and resilient grid which has greater access to the Western Energy market.","On April 10th we filed our 2017 integrated resource plan which includes a 15 year forecast of customer electricity demands and the resources needed to serve our customers reliably in the future. An important point of our forecast is to growing requirement with flexible peeking generation over the planning horizon. By 2025, we expect an additional 1.3 gigawatts of quick start combustion turbine capacity will be needed in order to meet our growing summer peak, as well as supplement the intermittency created by solar resource.","Moreover we are witnessing lower average daily prices on the wholesale market which show price spikes and increased volatility during peak periods. This new pricing pattern is a result of access energy supply during the middle of the day, throughout much of the year largely created by an oversupply of solar energy in California.","In order to take advantage of the solar supply and payoff the energy savings to our customers we value investments in flexible resources that can quickly shut down to allow the import of market power and then quickly ramp back up when demand and prices spike again later in the day. We expect these market conditions to exist for the foreseeable future and we are positioning our generation investment to be more aligned with these market conditions.","Ultimately, this will result in a lower cost to service to our customer, improve reliability for the region and new investment opportunities for our company. This also means that our views is on the value of base load and intermediate generation for our customers are evolving and we will focus our future investments for new generation towards flexible peeking technology like combustion turbines and eventually energy storage which is better optimized for emerging market conditions.","Finally, I would like to update you on a change in our executive team. When I became CEO in early 2009, the top of my priority list was to recruit one of the finest legal minds in the electricity industry, Dave Falck to join the company as our general counsel. Fortunately for us Dave accepted the offer and has provided Pinnacle West and me with consistently thoughtful counsel ever since. These are trusted advisors so it is with mixed feelings that I shared Dave's decision to begin the transition into retirement.","Dave will become Pinnacle West executive vice president of law through his retirement in the spring at 2018 and will continue to advise the Board of Directors and me on governance matters and industries issues. Dave's transition period allows us to continue our commitments for succession planning and talent development at all levels of our company and I am pleased to announce that Jeff Guldner has been promoted to Executive Vice President and will assume the role of General Counsel for Pinnacle West and APS in addition to his current responsibilities of leading our public policy organization. Jeff is a skilled lawyer and a thoughtful and respected leader with the deep understanding of our industry.","In closing we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2017. We are focused on completing our rate review filing and maintaining operational excellence while positioning Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader for its strategic capital investments.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us on our call. This morning, we\u2019ve reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. As shown on Slide 3 in the materials, for the first quarter of 2017 we earned $0.21 per share compared to $0.4 per share in the first quarter of 2016.","Slide 3, also outlines the variances that has drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. An increase in gross margin added $0.6 per share compared with the prior-year first quarter period, supported by higher LFCR revenues and favorable weather. [Indiscernible] sales in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, where the positive effects of customer growth were more than offset by energy savings driven by customer behavior, energy efficiency programs and distributed renewable generation. And one less day of sales [indiscernible] 2016.","Although sales were down in the first quarter, it should be noted that normalized usage per customer in our first and fourth quarters tend to have more variability than usage in the second and third quarters and results in these periods are less indicative of full year results. As an example of this month-to-month variability, we've seen positive weather-normalized sales growth in April, although I will remind you that we're only one month of data.","Overall operations and maintenance expense contributed $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower planned outage costs. As you recall, we had large planned outages at the Four Corners Power Plant in both the first and second quarters of 2016 as part of the plant's routine maintenance schedules.","As we've previously indicated, we expect additional planned outages at Four Corners this year as we prepare for the FCR installations, the timing of which will be largely focused in the second half of 2017. Higher D&A decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in the first quarter due to increased expenses resulting from additional planned service. And lastly, you will notice a $0.05 benefit to first quarter earnings, driven by a lower effective tax rate in the current year period, primarily due to the adoption of the new stock compensation guidance in 2016. The new guidance requires income tax benefits and deficiencies, resulting from share-based payments to be recognized in the period as they occur.","Now turning to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment story. I'll highlight the trends that we are seeing in our local economy, and in particular, the Phoenix Metro area. In 2017, the Metro Phoenix region continues to have job growth above the national average. Through February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.6% compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. This above-average job growth is driven largely by the financial services sector. This solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets.","As seen on the upward panel of Slide 4, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall in the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, over 2 million square feet of new office in the retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development.","Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you could see on the lower panel of Slide 4, housing construction is expected to continue the upward close recession trend. In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 7,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in March were at the highest levels since August of 2007. Several factors are driving this increase.","Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. Also, as I mentioned on previous calls, vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth or mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households separates from for-closures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years.","Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's has retail customer base grew 1.4% in the first quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamental supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Finally, I'll comment on our liquidity and financing. On March 21, APS issued an additional $250 million of its outstanding 4.35% senior unsecured notes that mature in November 2045. The proceeds were used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. We expect to issue up to $600 million of additional long-term debt this year, one transaction at Pinnacle, including financing of the $125 million term loan and one at APS. Overall, our balance sheet liquidity remains very strong. At the end of the first quarter, Pinnacle and APS had approximately $91 million and $117 million of short term debt outstanding respectively.","And just a quick thought on guidance. We do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2017 until after final approval in APS's rate review. However, to assist you with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2017 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix in today's slides. Additionally, if the proposed settlement and depending rate review differed by the Arizona Corporation Commission, we would be comfortable with our ability to continue to fund APS's capital expenditure program with no new equity through our planning horizon.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Gordon of Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Looking at your sales statistics for the quarter, did the leap day have an impact on the sort of bottom line demand numbers?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. I would say of the 3.3 lower sales, about one third of that was related to leap year.","Greg Gordon","Okay, great. And then, Commissioner Burns at the ACC had recently made a filing with the ALJ in your case, either asking or recommending that several of his peers be refused from voting in that case. Could you tell us what has occurred subsequent to that, if anything?","Jeff Guldner","Greg, this is Jeff. Nothing has occurred and the commission, the hearing is continuing right now, and we expect the hearing will probably wrap up today.","Greg Gordon","Great. So, the ALJ like say that they're going to find this as to whether or not they would rule on that? Or has there been any guidance coming from the ALJ on whether or not that [indiscernible] is going to be considered?","Jeff Guldner","No. She had commented early in the proceeding that any issues with Commissioner Burns were going to be addressed by the commission.","Greg Gordon","By the commission, okay. And I guess, I apologize for not doing my homework, but on April 17, you guys filed your Integrated Resource Plan. If we look in there, that will give us some sense of the quantum of capital spending that you expect to deal with the sort of these issues that Don laid out, so clearly on the call on a qualitative fashion? And does it look like it actually would necessitate a sustained spend, capital spend and the $1 billion to $1.3 billion range that you're currently spending through post '19?","Jim Hatfield","Yes, Greg, this is Jim. The ERP is at beginning of 2021, I think specifically talked about PPAs, it's really for the summer period, May through September. I think that the flexible generation that we've talked about is, really, has been carved out of the self-build Moratorium, and that would be further off into the horizon.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. Last question for me. The commissioner [indiscernible], your former chair, had proposed consideration of an increase in the renewable portfolio standard. Is it your expectation that the commission will take up that consideration of that proposal at any point this year?","Don Brandt","I think that's on our expectation. Obviously, any increased renewable spends outside of the $15 million a year in '18, '19 from any return to is not currently on our forecast. So that will be incremental capital.","Operator","And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin Smith from UBS. Please go ahead. ","Julien Dumoulin Smith","So let's pick up where Greg left off. Let's talk about storages real quickly, if we can. I'd like to understand, in the context, the ERP, the timing of any associated capital ramp-up of the storage program? Looks like you have roughly 400 megawatts in there in the regulatory process and framework that you would otherwise contemplate to put those storage opportunities in theory in rate base.","Don Brandt","We're drilling [ph] this chapter, ERP is just been filed. So obviously, we're working through -- we'll be working through that and there will be I'm sure more discussion on that as we move forward. We've got some storage that we're doing right now that is with the Solar Partners program. I'd say the focus we got right now is storage that's related to power quality, local reliability issues. And we're making sure that we have a good understanding of that. And so that's kind of what [Multiple Speakers] that's what in right now when the discussion started.","Jim Hatfield","I think our view on storage at the moment, Julien, it's more of reliability-driven. And I think we'll be seeing more capital allies for storage, but we're taking a very measured approach and making sure we're on the right side of that cost curve on storage. But clearly, it's going to have a part in our future from a capital perspective. And I would say, that's not currently in our forecast.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Right. And just to understand this, is there any if you were to move forward with it, what kind of regulatory recovery framework would you think about? Or would this be more conventional CapEx? The only reason I mentioned is just, in kind of thinking about when this program would roll out and how that would roll into the timing of any subsequent rate case?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I think if we owned it, would have to be recovered in the regulatory process. So there's not currently a framework for adjuster mechanism. We also have a PSA expanded, where we can put commission approved battery, asset cost through the PSA and net recovered that way.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Got it. So let's pretend that you could use a PSA to the extent which you built something?","Jim Hatfield","Potentially.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Got it. Excellent. And actually, just in tandem with that, rooftop, obviously, there's a good amount of discussion on the RFP on that front, can you elaborate a little bit? Is there -- how meaningful of an opportunity for you all is that to the extent of which you're looking at prospects?","Don Brandt","Well, we agreed to spend a $50 million a year. So we're covering through they know. As currently contemplated, it's not a big capital line, but it is incremental and can recover concurrently, which is from a capital perspective.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","And that is indeed embedded in your latest update, right? ","Jim Hatfield","Right.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Lastly, on Navajo, can you expand upon the potential scenarios contemplated? I suppose to the extent in which the plant is indeed left open through some kind of federal program or what have you, is there a [indiscernible] in which you would actually receive funds to continue operating the plant? Or is this unlikely something in which if it continues operation, there would be some different owner? I know there's a lot of different iterations out there, if you can kind of high-level summarize it, I would appreciate it.","Jeff Guldner","Actually, this is Jeff. Right now, the Chris is focused on getting the initial two-year lease extension which would allow the operation of the plant to continue through 2019. Then the department of interior has workshop going that's looking at a variety of different scenarios that could include potential new owners for the plant, but that's there's been two meetings and there's another meeting coming up at later this month, so that's pretty early right now.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","So it's not off the table that you guys would continue to operate that plant clearly?","Don Brandt","We don't operate [Multiple Speakers] --.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Or have an ownership? Sorry.","Don Brandt","I don't know that I would say it's off the table. We're only 14% owner in that plant. So we don't want to speak for [indiscernible] owner-operator.","Operator","The next question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","First question, Jim, what the effective tax rate should we be assuming for the year and going forward with these tax rate changes you were mentioning?","Jim Hatfield","I think it will be consistent with prior years. That tax benefit in the first quarter, we typically took over the course of the year in our effective tax rate with the change in accounting guidance, with both right now at the time this years are issued. It required us to do in the first quarter, which just stands out because the first quarter is such a small quarter.","Ali Agha","Okay. So about 34% or so?","Jim Hatfield","Yes.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then, coming back to the electric sales. This is the third consecutive quarter we've seen a decline here on a weather-normalized basis. Any particular explanation for that? Or what's may be happening here?","Jim Hatfield","Well, again, in the fourth and first quarter, with small sales, any sort of weather variation or anomalies pop up from year to year. We look for the second and third quarter, and so far, the second quarter is starting off with weather adjusted positive sales. So I would sort of hold on cost on sales until we get through the second quarter, where we have more meaningful amount of sales.","Ali Agha","Okay.","Jim Hatfield","I'm worried about as we tick it [ph] today for the year.","Ali Agha","I see. And then as part of the settlement, one thing obviously that also will get updated is the higher equity ratio later for you guys. So assuming the sentiment obviously is approved, does that change your thinking of the underlying earnings power of the company, now that you're operating with a higher equity ratio? Does that change the growth outlook from your perspective?","Jim Hatfield","No. Not at all. I think the equity ratio are more normalized as we find our CapEx program with long term debt.","Ali Agha","Okay. So all else being equal, you don't think the higher ratio should lead to higher earnings growth as well?","Jim Hatfield","No. It was good in the context with the settlement obviously, but not driving meaningful growth.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","A couple of regulatory questions. So in the IRP, it talks about your filing a 2017 RFP for summer season peaking needs, 2021 and beyond. How does -- how do the requirements in the rate case settlement fit into whether APS could either be building CTs in the 2022, 2024 time frame? Or whether you could potentially be buying other people's CTs and putting them in rate base if that's the outcome of an independent review process in RFP?","Don Brandt","Michael, there's a self-build moratorium that's in the case, that you'd have to step through the process if you're going to propose a bill. So typically, that's going to be more in the view of a back step, but one of the changes to that moratorium would be an acquisition, would be different. So that's changed a little bit from the last moratorium.","Michael Lapides","Meaning, you're allowed to do, in the rate case settlement and acquisition, going through the normal process with the PSC and RFP, but it doesn't preclude acquisitions?","Don Brandt","Yes. The moratorium that's proposed in the settlement doesn't preclude the acquisitions, but it would affect the self-build.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Can I just think through, and this may be a Jim question, trying to think through O&M and some of the lumpiness in O&M. So first quarter '16 had the big outages. First quarter '17, you still had some outages, but not nearly the size that you had in first quarter '16. But fourth quarter or late third, early fourth quarter '17 will once again have pretty sizable outages. Is that the kind of the right way to think about it? And will those outages look more like what you had this quarter or what you had in the first quarter of '16?","Don Brandt","More like the first quarter of '16.","Michael Lapides","So pretty big?","Don Brandt","Yes. It's going to be the major outage for our Units 4 and 5, practically for the SCR installations.","Michael Lapides","Okay. Are the 2016 and '17 outages -- should we think of this as normal run-off course type of stuff that happens kind of every year? Or is this more stuff that's kind of more one-off-ish? And when we think out to 2018 and beyond, we shouldn't be thinking that O&M stays at this pretty elevated level?","Don Brandt","No. Our fossil planted outage O&M is pretty lumpy. '16 and '17 are elevated because of the impact for the SCRs. So I think you would see, as you get out to '18, '19, more normalized fast O&M.","Michael Lapides","Okay. And is there a year where we can go back in time and look at O&M and say, that was more of a normal year?","Jim Hatfield","I'd say, probably '15 would be more normal.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Fishman of MorningStar. Please go ahead. ","Charles Fishman","The 3-year stay-out, remind me, that was similar to your last settlement, except it went longer, right, just by your choice?","Jim Hatfield","Correct.","Don Brandt","Last one we could have filed June 15, we elected not to file until '16.","Charles Fishman","But originally, was it 3 years?","Jim Hatfield","Yes.","Charles Fishman","And then, the stay-out, didn't it have provisions into this one that allowed you to go back in under certain unusual circumstances? Does this have something like that?","Jim Hatfield","There's always in kind of every settlement I've seen in Arizona, that Charles, there has been force majeure type of provisions. I don't recall a case in which they've actually been used.","Charles Fishman","Okay, that sounds what I was thinking.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Most of my questions have been answered. But I want to sort of touch base on something I heard on the economics of the area. It astonished me that, if I got it right or let me know if I got it wrong, but the financial services was the big driver on the commercial side, is that correct?","Jim Hatfield","Correct.","Paul Patterson","And part of my ignorance, but why -- I don't think it's financial services being in Arizona that much, what -- is there anything in particular? Or?","Jim Hatfield","We defined that broadly, but State Farm relocated the Western operations to Tempe. And built five buildings on Tempe County lake and they're beginning now to populate all of these buildings with the people, and so that's a big driver of that growth.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then, you also just mentioned that like, basically, things look like they were pretty much around 2008. Now obviously things have changed in the economy and what have you. But do you guys -- what do you feel -- obviously, 2008, in some ways, is not so positive in terms of what followed afterwards. Do you have any sense in terms of the real estate market or anything about how things are on the ground there? In other words, I mean, are you seeing the same kind of real estate activity that you actually saw in 2008? Or could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?","Don Brandt","Paul, Don Brandt here. Just a couple of facts right here, Metropolitan Phoenix housing permits are at the highest levels they've been since 2007. Maricopa County's the fastest-growing county in the United States in 2016, eclipsing, I believe a county that where Austin, Texas is located. And we've seen not just in the financial services, but beyond State Farm a lot of back-office operations are here, call centers. But also, in biosciences, there's a really booming industry, that brings a lot of jobs and relatively highly paid jobs.","Operator","The next question is from Gregg Orrill of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Is it possible to give a sensitivity, an EPS sensitivity to 1% weather-normalized sales growth?","Jim Hatfield","It's about $0.08 after tax.","Gregg Orrill","Okay. And with regard to the LFCR, under the new settlement, is it more -- does it result in more recovery than under the prior rate plan?","Jim Hatfield","No, it will be recovered differently. It's going to be demand-based versus volumetric. But the robustness on the LFCR did not change.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","My apologies, a follow-up The LFCR running $0.03 to $0.04 a quarter, that stays post rate case implementation roughly? I know it's hard to forecast, but just trying to think about if the rate case changes that at all?","Jim Hatfield","No.","Michael Lapides","Okay. Second, when we think about the rate case settlement, I've kind of go through it and it's not the easiest document to get your arms around. The increase in the D&A rate, the $61 million, that doesn't drop to the bottom line because your D&A is going to go up. And the moving around of the $53.6 million in the fuel and purchased power, will that also not drop to the EBITDA or EBIT line because your fuel and purchased power costs should change, right?","Jim Hatfield","Correct.","Michael Lapides","Okay, the base rate increase of 87.2, are there any costs that are not on your income statement today that will be on your income statement when the rates go into effect? Or is this simply trying to catch up some of the regulatory lag with the investments you've made and the increased costs you've seen?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I wouldn\u2019t contemplate recovery any costs that will be new as that defer the SCR's for recovery in '19 and Ocotillo until the next rate case. Another now it's just be really reflecting the capital investment into the system that was -- from the last settlement forward.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And so what ending period last year was that using, what's the ending rate base of that?","Jim Hatfield","'15 rate base was -- we don\u2019t have that number. ","Don Brandt","We'll get that to you. We have that number.","Michael Lapides","Okay, I just didn't know that it was a known and measurable number from like, say, 3 months ago or 6 months ago, or is that truly an ending 2015 or early 2015 rate base number?","Jim Hatfield","It was 2015 with 12 months of post [indiscernible] plan. So we really were approximately '16 our agency rate base at year-end was $6.8 billion for purposely of Arizona and if we're to add probably another $300 million of rate base over the course of '16.","Michael Lapides","Okay. And the only reason why I kind of asked about this is, an 87, this is a pretty decent revenue increase and on your share count, if you just kind of tax effect that, that would seem like a pretty decent outcome. I'm just trying to make sure I'm not missing anything, where there are costs that are increasing significantly relative to what you're incurring today and that's all kind of embedded in that base rate case?","James Hatfield","Yes. I don\u2019t you're missing anything.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.","James Hatfield","Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference."],"17188":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  3, 2012  1:30 PM ET","Executives","Becky Hickman - Director, IR","Jim Hatfield - CFO","Don Brandt Chairman & CEO","Analysts","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Jim Krapfel - Morningstar","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2011 first quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Becky Hickman, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Hickman, you may begin.","Becky Hickman","Thank you, Claudia. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter 2012 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Vice President of Rates and Regulation is also here with us.","Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Also, all of our references to per share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.","It is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our first quarter 2012 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the MD&A section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 10.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on slide four. First I will review the consolidated first-quarter results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second I'll provide a brief update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy and last I will close with brief comments on our liquidity and financing activities.","Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On GAAP basis for this year's first quarter we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $8 million or $0.08 per share compared to a net loss of $15 million or $0.14 per share for the prior year's first quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.08 per share. For the 2012 first quarter we had consolidated ongoing loss of $7 million or $0.07 per share versus an ongoing loss of $16 million or $0.15 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.","Slide six contains a reconciliation of our first quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share. The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate and energy services businesses. My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on our ongoing results.","Moving to slide seven, you see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our gross margins added one penny per share compared against the prior year's first-quarter earnings. Several plusses and minuses comprises positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.","Second lower operations and maintenance expense improved earnings by $0.07 per share. The expense decrease largely reflects lower fossil plant maintenance cost as a result of less work being completed early in the year compared to 2011 as well as the net decrease in other items.","This on end variance excludes expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard or RAS, energy efficiency, similar regulatory programs as well as the 2011 first quarter settlement of transmission rights, away costs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts. Third, lower infrastructure related costs increased earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the NRC for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.","Those cost reductions were partially offset by higher property tax related to tax rates. Fourth, the net impact of all other items decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Finally our first-quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.02 per share because of the Arizona (inaudible) plants that were placed in service last year and earlier this year.","This net variance is reflected in various items on the income statement. Total gross margin was up one penny per share compared to the 2011 first quarter. The main components of that increase were as follows. The Retail Transmission Cost Adjustor rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.03 per share. Line extension fees recorded as revenue pursuant to 2009 retail regulatory settlement improved our results by $0.02 per share.","The net effect of other miscellaneous items increased our gross margin by $0.03 per share. Lower usage by APS retail customers compared against last year's first quarter decreased our quarterly results by $0.04 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 0.9% in the quarterly comparison after accounting for the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs.","Customer growth of 0.8% over a year ago levels helped offset the decline in kilowatt hour sales. The effects of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. This year's first quarter was warmer than normal with residential heating degree days lower than normal by 17%.","Turning to slide nine and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the first quarter although modestly. As shown on slide nine growth in non-farm jobs and consumer spending are both slightly ahead of the prior year's levels.","In particular the rate of overall job growth has set up well for almost a year and virtually all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. Other indicators like income growth and the unemployment rate also shows steady improvement although the patterns remain uneven.","Additionally APS' customer base grew 0.8% in the first quarter which is the strongest growth we have seen in three years. All-in-all these trends indicate that the Arizona economy is headed in the right direction even though we have significant headwinds to contend with. ","Unemployment remains too high and vacancy rates in housing and commercial real estate only marginally lower in their peaks of 2010. One bright spot has begun to emerge in the demand for industrial space in the Metro Phoenix region with vacancy rates down some 20% from their peak but other sectors are seeing only slow absorption of excess space. We believe that this situation will continue to restrain new construction and higher levels of growth for at least two to three years.","Over the long term though, we remain confident in Arizona\u2019s fundamentals. We expect customer growth in [inaudible] to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.","Looking at the next several years, we currently expect annual customer growth to average about 1.6% for 2012 to 2014. Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2012 through 2014 primarily due to APS\u2019 energy efficiency programs offsetting a modest recovery in the economy.","Finally I want to comment on our liquidity and financing plans. At the end of the first quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding. APS had $217 million of short-term borrowings and both have ample liquidity. Our higher credit ratings have provided APS and the parent company improved access to short-term funding as well as lower cost funding through the debt capital markets.","As we previously indicated, we do not intend to issue earnings guidance for 2012 until after the final decision has been rendered in APS\u2019 pending retail rate case. However to assist with your estimates, a list of key drivers that may affect 2012 ongoing earnings is included in the appendix to today's slide.","Additionally if the constructed element in the pending retail rate case is approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. We would be comfortable with our ability to fund APS\u2019 capital expenditure program with no new equity needed until 2013 at the earliest.","And with that I will turn the call over to Don. Don?","Don Brandt","Thanks Jim. And thank you all for joining us today. I will update you on developments in the following areas. Arizona regulation and APS\u2019 pending retail rates supplement, our investments in generations including renewable resources and our overall operating performance. I will start with APS\u2019 pending rate settlement. On January 6, we filed a proposed settlement of APS\u2019 pending retail rate case which was signed by 22 of the 24 active parties to the proceedings. Very late yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission\u2019s Chief Administrative Law Judge issued her recommendation that the settlement be improved without material modifications.","Collectively, the settlement terms would produce a net $0 change to existing change to existing base rates 2012, an important benefit for APS customers. In addition to the base rate change is a settlement contained a number of key financial provisions which we discussed during last quarter\u2019s conference call.","Details of the settlement as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined on slides 13 to 17 in the appendix to your slide space. The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Notably the requested regulatory treatment would build upon the constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provide financial support for APS will help us achieve Arizona\u2019s energy goals over the next four years. The settlement also includes a four year stay out for the next general retail rate case. Under this provision, APS\u2019 may file its next general rate case on or after May 31, 2015 for based rate to become effective not earlier than July 1, 2016.","We believe several factors will support us financially during the stay out period. These factors include first APS\u2019 rate adjustment mechanisms such as the power supply adjustor and the transmission cost adjustor. Second, provision to allow APS to seek rate adjustments related the Four Corners acquisition if it is can\u2019t submitted and I\u2019ll review the Four Corners progress momentarily.","Third, certain features of settlements such as the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism and the property tax deferrals. And finally our continuing focus on cost management and operational excellence.","Looking at key procedural dates, the parties to the case have until May 11 to file any exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommended order. Thereafter, the Commissioner will consider a settlement at an open meeting which has not been yet schedule.","APS and other settling parties have requested that the settlement become effective to July 1 of this year and that\u2019s supported by the judges recommended.","We view the settlement agreement as a further sign or progress in Arizona regulatory environment. With its broad based support, the settlement demonstrates significant collaborations and cooperation among APS, the ACC staff and the variety of other parties.","We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with Arizona Corporation Commission and the various stakeholders to enhance the state\u2019s regulatory framework and to find solutions of balance of the interested customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.","Turning to the Four Corners plan, we continue making progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison\u2019s interest in the Four Corners plant in Northwestern New Mexico. The multi-part plant addresses environmental regulations while maintaining a well balanced resource portfolio. It has substantial merits economically, environmentally and socially. A summary of the plan is included on slide 18.","The acquisition requires approval by Arizona, California and federal regulators and other government agencies. Noteworthy progress has been made in this regard. On April 18, the Arizona Corporation Commission authorized APS to proceed with the acquisition and to defer certain transaction related cost until the acquired generation is played in to retail rates with a condition that the transaction may not close prior to December 1st of this year.","The commission established a closing date parameter to reduce the cost impacts of the transaction on customers. Separately, as I have already mentioned, APS suspending retail rate settlement contains a proposal that would permit APS to seek to reflect the Four Corners transaction in retail rates on or after July 1 of 2013, if it is [inaudible] submitted.","In addition, the California Public Utilities Commission approved the transaction for Southern California Edison on March 29. Other conditions that must be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of the new coal supply contract, approval by the Federal Energy regulatory Commission, expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and other typical closing conditions.","We remain optimistic about our pending remaining approvals and completing the related required activities to allow the completion of our Four Corners plant in a timely manner.","Turning to renewable resources and our AZ Sun development activities; we were on track with plans to increase the amount of renewable energy APS provides for our retail customers. Under the AZ Sun program, APS plans develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale portable take solar plants in Arizona.","The projects that we placed in service in 2011 through 2015 and the Arizona Corporation Commission has approved the program with a constructive rate recovery mechanism. To-date, we have announced AZ Sun projects that have a total production capacity of 104 megawatts at an estimated capital investment of $451 million. A summary of the program is included on slide 19.","In late 2011 and earlier this year, we placed three new AZ Sun plants into commercial operation adding a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity to APS\u2019 generation mix.","Construction and other development activities are currently underway at two sites for another 54 megawatts and we anticipate these facilities will be placed in service in late 2012 and in 2013. Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the capacity needed to complete the AZ Sun program.","Our renewable energy initiatives particularly AZ Sun are important measured steps toward advancing Arizona\u2019s sustainable energy future. These projects also support our economy. New solar and wind plants to serve APS customers have created more than 2400 design, engineering and construction jobs for our state. We are pleased that APS\u2019 accomplishments installing and promoting solar power have been recognized by a number of independent third parties.","For example in April, APS was named one of the top 10 Solar Electric Utilities in the United States by the Solar Electric Power Association.","Looking at our operating performance, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform well. During the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at a 94% capacity factor. This capacity factor reflects the fact that Unit 3\u2019s refueling outage began during the quarter on March 17th and that 32 day outage was successfully completed on April 17th making it the second charters to refueling outage in the Palo Verde site\u2019s history.","The chartered duration demonstrates Palo Verde\u2019s commitment to reducing its average refueling outage time, while maintaining its commitment to safely and efficiently generate electricity for the long term. The site\u2019s next refueling outage will be Unit 2 this fall.","Our coal-fired plants also continued their run of solid performance.","Turning to the quality of our customer service, in February of this year JD Power & Associates released the results of its most recent Business Customer Survey. I am pleased that APS continues its record of performance excellence in overall customer satisfaction.","In the most recent results APS ranked fourth nationally among 47 large investor owned electric utilities. More specific to our region, we were rated second among 10 investor owned utilities in the West. In addition, for the third consecutive year APS was awarded the environmental protection agencies highest honor for continuing leadership and protecting the environment through energy efficiency programs.","The EPA\u2019s ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award recognized two APS program for promoting energy efficiency and reducing Greenhouse gas emissions.","In summary, company aims to achieve top tier performance and our employee team constantly try to meet that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, I assure you we remain focused on our core utility business, operational excellence and achieving a constructive regulatory outcome. All for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and the communities we serve.","Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and we would be pleased to take questions at this time.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Citigroup. Please state your question.","Shar Pourreza - Citigroup","Just a quick question, Jim I know you mention that you would look to issue 2012 APS guidance following a final order in the GFC and then Don did a great a job presenting some growth drivers outside of base rates during his prepared remarks.","Given that you could be in a multi-year duration under the settlement, could you also issue some kind of EPS growth trajectory during the stay-out period when you begin to issue guidance again? Thank.","Jim Hatfield","A great question Shar and the answer to that is, yes. And if you remember our last settlement, we issued guidance over a couple of year period and we would look to do some sort of EPS growth looking over the settlement period again to give investor\u2019s comfort of our ability to manage through that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Cole with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","Yeah, I was just checking whether for AGA it will mid 90 so we can, is it still too early to have any really cooling driven weather at all or how does that\u2026.","Don Brandt","A couple of weekends ago we had a record 106 degrees we believe on Saturday and Sunday. It\u2019s gotten hot here before in May. I think you might have a pleasant visit for AGA.","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","And so I guess with the Four Corners approval a couple of weeks ago, does this impulsively approve the $300 million of environmental CapEx then also treatment of Units 1, 2, 3?","Jim Hatfield","","From a CapEx perspective, I would say no. From units 1, 2 and 3, the answer would be yes.","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","And what is the process for getting the $300 million of environmental CapEx approved?","Jim Hatfield","Well, assuming we close, we will put our CapEx plan pain upon when that\u2019s needed to be in service 2016. The 2018 will be in design and engineering work for the plant which is consistent with what was filed in our IRP back on March 30th?","","Kevin Cole - Credit Suisse","And then with the $700 million of equity, I think you guys kind of agreed to in the last settlement, I guess from my chair it doesn\u2019t look like you need that much and from an expensive form of financing. With this new settlement are you able to rebase that number or does it kind of nullify the previous number?","Jim Hatfield","It does not nullify it, Kevin but obviously if we don't believe we need that amount of equity by 2014 we will certainly make our case to the settlement parties in 2009 and I would not expect that they would want to issue the most expensive form of cost of money if it's not needed and keep in mind too since that last settlement in 2009 we have been upgraded as well which helps the situation.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of the (inaudible) with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Unidentified Analyst","So with an earnings uplift likely upcoming pending the implementation of new rates, how do you think about dividend growth, you have been kind of in a flat dividend trajectory for the last couple of years. How do you think about that going forward?","Jim Hatfield","Well obviously assuming the settlement is approved and the ability really to have a sort of runway now to the next filing I would expect a dialog with the board on the appropriate dividend level for Pinnacle West going forward?","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, but you haven't talked about historically a targeted dividend payout level, have you?","Jim Hatfield","No and I don\u2019t think we would specifically say a payout level. I think we would consistent with earnings growth of X, look at a dividend growth rate of X minus or something to that regard as opposed saying an explicit payout ratio.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks Jim and any notable changes from this morning's announcement in terms of the settlement terms with ALJ recommendation?","Jim Hatfield","No","Unidentified Analyst","And then the last question I had, has there been any update in terms of what happened with the Southwest utilities outage last year, there's been some headlines that's been coming across our screens here?","Don Brandt","The report out at this point that's all we know is the report\u2019s out.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","So one of the things that jumped out from the release was while you are seeing some signs of pick up in economic growth you also had significant impact of energy efficient, from energy efficiency and demand side management in the quarter?","Don Brandt","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","So, can you refresh our memories on how the recovery writer prospectively will work to sort of incentivize you to continue to sue those and\/or compensate you for continuing to pursue those types of savings?","Don Brandt","Sure the mechanism of loss fixed costs recovery mechanism envisions that we will file the first recovery in March of 2013 and it recovers that distribution fixed costs associated with lost cells through those mechanisms.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","So assuming approval of this as filed prospectively, there will be an offsetting revenue to the extent that you see incremental energy efficiency driven load reductions?","Jim Hatfield","","That's correct. I would not characterize it as a one that will offset but you do get a partial revenue pick up from what's lost through the programs.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And you currently do not get anything like that, correct.","Jim Hatfield","Correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. Second question with regard to financing plans, you said 2013 at the earliest for equity but when I just think about regulated utility model the fact, that filing a rate case till 2014 for at the earliest 2014, for rates in \u201915 and that you have an historic test period what are the factors that are going to go into the timing of the equity issuance, it would seemed to me that it would be reviewed sort of try time it more concurrently with when you would need to update your capital structure for the next rate review which is some time away.","Don Brandt","Yeah, Greg I think you are exactly right there that it would be certainly no sooner than we needed and the driving force would be rebalancing our capital structure going into that test year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Jim, I wanted to just be clear, the Four Corners acquisition assuming that it does close as planned. The earnings that you are to book for that increment, will that be timed with when it goes into retail rate base? In other words July 1 onwards of \u201913 is when we should see earnings?","Jim Hatfield","That's correct Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. And the four year or so stay-out period, I know the segment obviously has not been approved yet but assuming it is, should we also assume as you will be planning through that time period that you are fairly confident that ROEs will be maintained. We won't see any erosion. Is that a fair way to be thinking about that period when you have the stay-out?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I think to say, you wouldn't see any erosion over that timeframe is probably a bit strong. I think depending upon factors, including our ability to have CapEx at the right level and control expenses I think over the timeframe you would see ROEs in the mid 9s.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And lastly I just clarifying you\u2019ve made a couple of comments on the need for equity in the future but how much of that is also been driven by liquidity and credit rating concerns. As you said you've been obviously upgraded and so on, but you know in terms of what would be causing you to issue equity in 13 if you were to do it? What are the main issues in your mind, obviously the rate case would not be one of them?","Jim Hatfield","That\u2019s correct and back to Don's earlier comments. We\u2019re not going to issue equity any sooner than we needed, but I think the factors that go into that are obviously liquidity which we have ample liquidity. So I am not necessarily worried about that, but we do have to watch our credit ratios as well which will be part of the equation. And that\u2019s going to be driven obviously by fund some operation CapEx going forward.","I mean I think there is a balance there between try to maintain ratings and not pile on too much debt but it's going to be the latest long as possible.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please state your question.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Just to follow on the equity needs question. Could you maybe be more specific on the target ratios that we should monitor that you know maybe to equity or push equity out and preserve your credit rating?","Jim Hatfield","Sure, from a regulatory ROE, our regulatory equity layer, our last case was 539 which was our actual capital structure, long before that was 538. So it's in that range and at sort of a consolidated level it's 50-50. What we also have to monitor is imputed debt and the other factors that S&P puts into the rating.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","And in terms of when Four Corners gets added into rates, I guess July of \u201813, will there be some regulatory lag in terms of when the purchase is completed, no earlier than December of \u201812 and we could see some incremental D&A and operating expenses without the rate offset, is that accurate?","Jim Hatfield","","Well, we get to defer the cost associated with four and five. We get a debt return. So the real lag from an earnings perspective is just the offset of the equity return. It\u2019s more of a cash flow issue than it\u2019s going to be a book issue during that timeframe.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","And then lastly, just could you remind us how the property tracker works, is there any sort of cap and inherent risk of under recovering those taxes?","Jim Hatfield","Well, so the deferral started 25% in 2012 and ramps up to 75%. So yeah, there is a risk there obviously of property taxes. The assessment rates continue to go up. Property tax assessment rates typically are about 18 month lag to values. So it\u2019s really depend upon what happens in and around in property values in Arizona between now and the next decade.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel with Morningstar. Please state your question.","Jim Krapfel - Morningstar","","Hi, recent net migration from Mexico has recently turned negative for the US; (inaudible) is going to have impact on the growth opportunities?","Don Brandt","It won\u2019t have an impact on us at this point. Keep in mind, our migration into Arizona really follows job opportunities and that\u2019s not going to happen until we see the absorption of housing and construction pickup again.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please repeat your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just on a touch basis you guys on sales growth, you guys are projecting flat sales growth growing forward and that\u2019s because of customer growth being offset by energy efficiency; correct?","Don Brandt","That\u2019s correct Paul","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And what would it be without energy -- what is the energy efficiency impact and is this completely APS\u2019 efforts or is it just stuff that we are seeing as well in other parts or others efforts that might be going on underway?","Don Brandt","Well, that\u2019s pretty hard to track exactly Paul, but I would say, I know we have energy efficiency standard and a distributor generation standard. We can track pretty much what we\u2019re doing; customers are also doing things as well. But primarily, I would say yes, it\u2019s the ACC compliance program that\u2019s involved.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And what is that versus what the -- what would the growth rate be with out your efforts I guess?","Don Brandt","Well over this time frame probably slightly less than 2%","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Little over 2% growth, correct?","Don Brandt","","Correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","For the quarter, you had a decrease in sales growth of 0.9% was that adjusted?","Jim Hatfield","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And does that include leap year?","Jim Hatfield","Yeah, it would.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","So it would even be lower; I mean is there anything in particular with this quarter that would still be causing that or is that something that\u2026?","Jim Hatfield","The leap year is one day out of three months and the first quarter is not a big sales month for us, so not a big impact from that.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to management for closing remarks.","Becky Hickman","Thank you again for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul J. Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings, recent developments and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, who is APS Senior Vice President of Public Policy is also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our 2013 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through February 28.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald E. Brandt","Thanks, Paul, and thank you, all, for joining us on the call today. My comments today will discuss our operations and the strategic investments we are making to reliably serve our customers. I'll conclude with a few areas to watch in 2014, and then Jim will discuss 2013 results and update you on our economics and financial outlooks.","Turning to our operations in 2013. We delivered on our commitments and remained focused on operational excellence across the business, as demonstrated by our top-tier performance in safety and reliability. I'm proud to say that for the sixth consecutive year, we recorded the lowest number of recordable injuries in our company's history, moving closer to our goal of 0 recordable injuries. The fossil and energy delivery teams, in particular, were instrumental in achieving this record performance. Similarly, providing a reliable electric service to our customers, despite the hottest summer on record, is our focus every single day and was demonstrated by top quartile performance, again, this year.","The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another outstanding year with a capacity factor of 91%. This represents the fourth consecutive year in which production exceeded 31 million megawatt hours, and the ninth year in which Palo Verde was the only U.S. generating facility to produce more than 30 million megawatt hours.","Unit 3 completed its planned outage in late November, after finalizing repairs we found early in the outage related to a very small water leak from an instrumentation tube that connects to the bottom of the reactor vessel.","Turning to capital investments. We expanded our generation portfolio by completing the Four Corners transaction, which I'll discuss in a moment, and also added over 400 megawatts of solar energy. Key additions to the solar portfolio include the 250-megawatt Solana plant, which went into service in October of last year, as well as another 32 megawatts of AZ Sun, that went into service in December, at Hyder II in Foothills Phase 2.","Over the next several years, we expect the solar generation portfolio to continue to grow, with 32 megawatts of AZ Sun going into service in mid-2014, and 20 megawatts of AZ Sun expected in 2015. These additions, including the 20 megawatts recently approved by our commission, bring our owned utility scale solar commitment to 170 megawatts, or about $695 million.","Let me to discuss the Four Corners in a bit more detail, as that transaction represents an important milestone.","First, I'd like to thank Dave Hansen, our Vice President of Fossil Generation, and the team that they've worked with that was involved for the commitment and patience in seeing this transaction through to its completion, despite a challenging set of circumstances. The transaction provides ongoing long-term benefit to the region, ranging from reduced emissions, additional low-cost generation for our customers and continued support of the Navajo Nation.","On December 30, APS notified the EPA that the Four Corners participants selected the BART alternative, which required APS to permanently retire the Four Corners Units 1, 2 and 3 by January 1, 2014, and install and operate selective catalytic reduction control technology on Units 4 and 5 by July 31, 2018. The environmental spend will be mostly in the period 2016 and 2017. Units 1, 2 and 3 were retired on December 30. Decommissioning work began immediately and is expected to last about 3 years with the help of employees already dedicated to those units. Also, on December 30, APS filed an application with the Arizona Corporation Commission to recover costs associated with purchase of Southern California Edison's interest in Four Corners. We expect a procedural order from the administrative law judge soon that will lay out the timeline, with the decision from the commission expected later this year. As part of the application process, we have been conducting technical conferences in February to discuss the specifics of the filing with many of the interested stakeholders.","Another plant that plays an important role in our fleet and in maintaining the values reliability is Ocotillo, a 330-megawatt, 4-unit gas plant in Tempe, Arizona. We announced the Ocotillo modernization project earlier this month, which will involve retiring 2 110-megawatt steam units constructed in 1960, adding 5 102-megawatt combustion turbines to the site and maintaining the 2 existing 55-megawatt combustion turbines. In total, this will increase the capacity of the Ocotillo site to 620 megawatts, adding 290 megawatts to what is there today. The project, targeted for completion by the summer of 2018, will represent an investment of between $600 million and $700 million to ensure the continued reliability of service in our Phoenix service area and allow our generation fleet to respond to increasing intermittent generation in the desert southwest. Construction will likely start in 2016.","In addition to these generation investments, we're making significant investments in the grid, much of which is to support renewable generation and key transmission infrastructure.","On January 31, APS filed the annual 10-year plan for major transmission facilities. Two projects of note include the Hassayampa to North Gila 2 project that is well underway and is still expected to be online in the second quarter of 2015, as well as a series of projects linking the Palo Verde power hub to a substation in Northeast Phoenix. These projects have been in our capital forecast. The projects I highlighted are the key driver of our rate base growth. We have updated our estimates as we now expect rate base growth of 6% to 7% through the year 2018.","Looking ahead to 2014. We have included the slide to outline some of the key regulatory and political milestones for the year. On the regulatory calendar, in addition to our annual filings related to the adjusters and compliance, we will be filing quarterly reports on distributed generation or roof-top solar installations. We will also participate in a series of commission-led workshops on distributed generation and other technological developments as they occur throughout the year.","Let me conclude with a comment on the November net metering decision. The commission made a significant first step in recognizing the cost shift embedded in the net metering construct. The industry, generally, acknowledges this decision as the first significant advancement in the nation of the cost shift issues associated with distributed generation installations. The $0.70 per kilowatt charge took effect on January 1. Also included in the order, in an effort to protect our customers, was a requirement that each residential customer owning or leasing a roof-top solar system sign a disclaimer as part of the interconnection process to heighten consumer awareness of the risk embedded in the agreement, as it relates to potential future rate changes. That net metering order also stated that APS shall file its next rate case in June 2015, for the provisions of the 2012 settlement to more fully analyze the cost shift issue. We will work with the stakeholders and the commission through the workshops and other discussions before we determine how best to proceed.","As always, we will continue to advocate for the best interests of our customers and for a sustainable solar policy for Arizona. As you can see, we can anticipate another full year ahead, but our priorities are clear and the management team and I remain committed to that strategy.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James R. Hatfield","Thank you, Don. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on Slide 4. I'll begin with the review of our 2013 full year results, followed by a discussion of our fourth quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year's quarter. I'll then provide an update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Next, we'll review our balance sheet strength, including recent upgrades of our credit ratings and our financing activities. I'll conclude with the review of 2014 earnings guidance.","Slide 5 summarizes our ongoing and GAAP earnings for the quarter and full year. On a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2013, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $24 million, or $0.22 per share, compared with net income of $23 million, or $0.20 per share, for the prior year's fourth quarter. On an ongoing basis, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $24 million, or $0.22 per share, for the 2013 fourth quarter versus ongoing earnings of $27 million, or $0.24 per share, for the same quarter a year ago. For the full year 2013, on a GAAP basis, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $406 million, or $3.60 per share, compared to net income of $382 million, or $3.45 per share, for 2012. Our ongoing earnings for 2013 were also $3.66 per share, compared to $3.50 per share for 2012, and in the top half of our guidance range of $3.55 to $3.70. Pinnacle West earned a consolidated ROE of 9.9% in 2013, above our 9.5% goal. Our remaining comments will focus on the fourth quarter ongoing and results.","Slide 6 outlines the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Lower operations and maintenance expenses added $0.05 per share, largely driven by a lower employee benefit cost. Lower interest expense improved earnings by $0.01 per share, due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates. The net impact of other items increased earnings by $0.06 per share, primarily tax-related items of $0.04 per share. Higher net operating expenses decreased earnings by $0.03 per share, mainly reflecting an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional plant in service. A decrease in our gross margin reduced earnings by $0.11 per share compared with the prior year fourth quarter period. I will cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","As a reminder, both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms. Also, the deferrals associated with the Four Corners transaction are treated in a similar manner, as the O&M and D&A drivers I discussed exclude deferrals as they had no impact on 2013 results.","Turning to Slide 7 and the components of the net decrease of $0.11 in our gross margin. The main component of this were as follows: the loss fixed cost recovery mechanism improved earnings by $0.02 per share, which as designed, largely offset lower customer usage; lower usage by APS as customers compared with the fourth quarter a year ago decreased our quarterly results by $0.03 per share; weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 2012. While our customer programs and conversation are the largest source of the reduction in sales, this variance also reflects a convergence back to more normal usage trend compared to last year's fourth quarter. This was in line with our expectations.","On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 0.5%. Lower transmission revenues decreased earnings by $0.04 per share, due to the timing of the FERC formula rate true-up. The effects of weather decreased earnings by $0.05 per share.","During the fourth quarter, we record cooling degree days in October and heating degree days in November and December. A negative quarter-over-quarter variance was driven almost entirely by unfavorable weather versus normal in October of 2013. In fact, in terms of the number of cooling degree days, last October recorded the fewest cooling degree days in the last 15 years. The net effect of other miscellaneous items decreased gross margin by $0.01 per share.","Slides 8, 9 and 10 look at the Arizona economy and our fundamental growth outlook. Economic growth in Arizona continued its overall improvement in the fourth quarter of 2013, consistent with the prior 3 quarters, although growth remains modest, as has been the case for a year or so. Vacant housing in Metro Phoenix has fallen by more than half since its peak in early 2010, and is at the lowest levels in 6 years. Housing prices have responded. On the upper left-hand side of Slide 8, you can see that prices on existing home sales are 18% -- are 17% higher than they were a year ago and up 45% from the bottom of the market in mid-2011. Rising prices are providing more support to new home construction. Additionally, vacant rates have fallen in all nonresidential categories, as you can see in the upper right of Slide 8. On the lower left-hand side of Slide 8 shows that permits for new housing increased 12% in 2013 over 2012, and more than 150% from the low point in early 2011. This activity, plus business investment in the region, has led to an 8% gain in construction jobs in just the last year alone, which is supporting total nonfarm drive growth, as seen in the lower right-hand side of Slide 8.","Consumers are also driving the recovery. For 2013, Arizona consumer spending reached record highs. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in all economic indicators, which paint a picture of continuing steady recovery. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' customer base grew 1.3% compared with the year ago. Looking at the next several years, we expect annual customer growth to average about 2.5% for 2014 to 2016, with higher growth rates at the end of the period and in the near term for the reasons I've just discussed. This outlook is depicted on Slide 9.","Additionally, we expect our annual weather-normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to increase by about 1% on average from 2014 through 2016, primarily due to improving customer growth being partially offset by our customer programs and conservation.","The headwinds from the overbuilt housing market and associated construction job losses are largely behind us. And the state is poised to embark on the next phase to sustain growth. Between 1970 and 2001, Arizona's economy joined the U.S. economy on economic recession 5x. And each time, Arizona's recovery rebounded from recession at a rate 2 to 3x greater than the national average. We expect that this pattern will repeat itself in this business cycle once the national economy returns to more stable and healthy growth rates. One of the key regions for this expectation is the attractiveness of Phoenix as a place to live and do business in. Phoenix is the largest city in the Western U.S.A. -- Western United States outside of California and is almost 20% less expensive than living in California, which is the world's ninth largest economy.","As an example, the median single-family home in Phoenix is priced 54% lower than the median single-family home in San Diego, and almost 60% lower than in Los Angeles. These cost advantages are key to Phoenix-area businesses retaining a competitive edge in the California market, as well as globally. This resurgence in growth is expected over the next few years. True to form, Arizona's population rate is growing at double the national average. The exact timing of this growth trajectory depends on many factors, but the roots of our future growth are well anchored in fundamentals.","Besides history, Slide 10 provides some anecdotal evidence of the economic outlook for Arizona. Forbes project Arizona as the #1 state for job growth and ranked Phoenix third on their 2014 list of America's Fastest-Growing Cities. Forbes is not alone. Moody's.com has an outlook for Arizona growth over the next 5 years that is more robust in our own internal forecast.","Slide 11 outlines our investment-grade credit ratings and financing activities, as we continue to strengthen the balance sheet. In December, Standard & Poor's announced its upgrade to APS' senior unsecured rating to A- from BBB+, a ratings level the company hasn't enjoyed since the mid-'80s, as well as similar upgrades to Pinnacle West in APS' corporate credit rating. Additionally, in January, Moody's upgraded APS' senior unsecured and corporate credit ratings to 83, and Pinnacle West corporate credit rating to Baa1. These upgrades will allow our company to borrow at lower interest rates, reducing the financing costs from new infrastructure investment and system improvement projects, while lowering costs to customers. In connection with these ratings' actions, the ratings agencies decide that the company is improving financial condition and focus on core utility operations, as well as an improvement in the Arizona regulatory environment.","In terms of our financing. On January 10, APS issued $250 million of 30-year 4.7% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to fund the purchase price and certain costs associated with the acquisition of SoCal Edison's 48% ownership interest in each of Units 4 and 5 for Four Corners, and the replenished cash used to reacquire 2 series of tax exempt bonds in July and October of 2013. We also plan to refinance a $300 million maturity this year and raise up to an additional $250 million of new money debt, as we assumed in our guidance.","Overall, liquidity is very strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, the parent company had no short-term debt outstanding. APS had $153 million of commercial paper outstanding temporarily used to fund the Four Corners transaction. We estimate we will not need to raise additional common equity until 2016. The timing of our next general rate case will not necessarily drive the timing of our equity issuance.","On Slide 12 are some of the details of our pension and other postretirement benefits. This will be a favorable driver in 2014 results as compared to 2013. The 2 fundamental factors leading to lower expenses are a higher discount rate and improved funding status. Our pension fund status is now 90% funded, up from 77% at year-end 2012, driven by higher interest rates, substantial equity returns and larger-than-assumed recent contributions. As you know, the impact of higher interest rates benefits a funded status and is supported by our liability driven investment strategy. The higher funded status translates to lowering our long-term funding requirements. Please note that much of this expense reduction was captured in our original 2014 earnings guidance we issued on October 31.","Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2014 will be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75 per share. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2014 guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which are mostly unchanged.","One update I would like to mention is the status of the Delaney-Colorado River transmission project that you have heard us talk about. The project reached a milestone on February 3, when the project was recommended for approval by the California Independent System Operator to the California Independent System Operator Board of Governors. The Board of Governors is expected to deliberate on this project after a March 20 meeting. Keep in mind, even if approved, there will be a competitive solicitation process. So we will not know if we are successful until the fourth quarter of the year. The capital expenditures for this project are not included in our projected CapEx at this time. We will continue to keep you updated in this regard.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Julien in here. So just quickly, could you just chat about the timing of issue, of equity issuance and the context on the rate case and putting that in? I'm sorry if it wasn't exactly clear on the call.","James R. Hatfield","Well, I apologize if it wasn't clear on the call. The point we're making -- I guess, the only difference, we talked about 2016 not until that year for equity. We're not necessarily looking at needing equity associated directly with the rate case. So even if it's pulled forward, for example, 2016 is still our year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And that would just subsequently be pulled into, in this further rate case? There would be no way to put that into the '15 case, right? There's no true-up or anything?","James R. Hatfield","Well, they have historically done no measurable change when we issued equity for the capital structure. But our equity layer at APS for regulatory purposes right now is very strong, so.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, could you -- just quickly going back to that last transition project you were talking about, how much is that in terms of CapEx? And how would that change? And perhaps if you could talk broadly speaking about FERC 1,000 in the context of your participation with CAISO projects?","James R. Hatfield","Well, as you know, we submitted this project as an economic project back in 2011. 2012, it was recommended by the Cal-ISO. It was -- did pull between that time and the Board of Governors approving the plan for 2012. It's, again, been recommended by the -- to the Board of Governors. It's about 3 -- it's a 115-mile transmission line, really, from the Palo Verde hub into the Colorado River substation across Colorado River, and it's about $325 million. We would do this in a partnership, so our share would be half of that. And if approved, if the fourth -- if we win this competitive solicitation in the fourth quarter, this project wouldn't go into service until 2020. So we're still down the road, but as we've talked about before, I mean, these are things we'd be interested away from APS. And Jeff, can you talk about 1000?","Jeff Guldner","Sure. Julien, Jeff Guldner. This project's in Arizona so it's within the California planning process, and that process is evolving with Order 1000, but it's one of the things that we looked at as the strengths that we have within that region and understanding the transmission in the region. So it's folding that in with some of the Order 1000 developments. Certainly we'd be looking within the footprint, but at projects that make sense for our skills.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. Excellent. And then just lastly, could you just talk quickly, I mean, obviously, the -- you have the $0.70-kilowatt fixed charge now in place. What's the timing, at least, as you see the world in terms of getting step-ups in that rate?","Jeff Guldner","Julien, Jeff again. So we do quarterly reporting now in terms of what we're seeing with installations, and that's something that all of the parties have indicated that they want to watch. They want to see how the $0.70 charge affects the installation pace. And so as those numbers start to come in, you'll have a number of parties who are looking at them, and then they may take action based on where we see that trajectory going, but nothing is specific yet. We're very early in that process. We don't know exactly now what that trend's going to look like.","James R. Hatfield","And Julien, this is Jim here. I'll just remind you that even if they decide to step it up, it's no revenue impact to us. It just goes offset to that -- to the LFCR.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cole with Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Jeff, while you're on the phone, can you talk a little bit more about the options available to you to avoid co-mingling of net metering with the potential 2015 rate case? Just a path and timing for visibility into resolution?","Jeff Guldner","Sure, Kevin. So we've got a couple of things going right now. There's -- first, there's a distributed generation workshop. And so they're going to be looking at the cost and benefits distributed generation. Obviously, that is occurring outside the rate case contacts. We'll also be looking at making a rate plan filing later in the year. And so in the rate plan filing, we'll have some discussions. Obviously, something that we want to look at is how we make sure we have as constructive a discussion as we can in a generic sense, because it's not just an APS issue, this is a statewide issue. And so have that discussion, and then as we move into the rate case, that's when you would implement some of the more rate-specific solutions.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm sorry, so are you saying that the net metering will be a part of the rate -- are you guys doing the 2015 rate case? Sorry if I misunderstood what you said.","James R. Hatfield","I just think it's too early, Kevin, to know what our filing's going to look like right now. I think the visibility on this will be later in the year, when we file our rate plan, which was a requirement of the last settlement.","Jeff Guldner","But you've got proceedings that are be -- going to be going on this year prior to any rate case.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When will those proceedings end?","Jeff Guldner","There isn't a docket -- there's a docket established, but there's not yet a timeline that's established for having those proceedings. So they're going to just continue under the schedule that's developed. What we've proposed, so far, is a list of potential parties and experts and witnesses that can talk through those proceedings.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, the earliest we'll find out about if net metering can be separate from the rate case is the end of this year, and the latest is, if you file a rate case, middle of next year? That's the timing?","James R. Hatfield","Yes.","Jeff Guldner","Yes, that's probably correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Jim, can you elaborate a little more about the visibility that you have on the sales growth and also, the customer growth trends that you're assuming for '14 through '16? If you look at the second half of last year, retail sales were down in both third and fourth quarter. Customer growth has been running at about 1.3%. So the pickup in customer growth, but more importantly, retail sales, can you just remind us again on how that math works and how you're confident given the second half of last year?","James R. Hatfield","Well, as -- first of all, the fourth quarter was off 1.9% on sales. I'd point out that to comment on return to more normal, we were up 1% on usage per customer in the fourth quarter of 2012. So again, you have sort of the one year up, one year down effect. And like I said in my comments, I mean, fundamentally, Arizona has demonstrated ability to grow 2 to 3x faster than the U.S. And also, as I said in my comments, it's not clear when that will be, '14, '15, but we're confident in the long-term growth in the State of Arizona because the fundamentals have not changed.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. I get it. And then, at the back -- in the appendix, you laid out a 5-year rate base growth trajectory, 6.6% average, I think, you -- 6% to 7%, as you talked about on the call as well. What's sort of the visibility or confidence level in that 5-year growth for rate base? And what will that equate to from an earnings per share growth for the company?","James R. Hatfield","The visibility we have in -- through 2018 is -- I would say, I'm pretty confident. I mean, Ocotillo still needs approval and we have to get permitting and all of those things, but we've announced that project. It's critical for reliability in the valley for both us and SRP. And then the other big driver, as we get into '17, '18 is going to be the SCRs at Four Corners 4 and 5, which the owners are committed to do. So we're -- things move around every year as circumstances change, but I think we're pretty confident that, that is the trajectory of rate base growth. In terms of earnings, I think it really depends on a couple of factors. What happens to sales, timing of rate case will be important. So as we've said, when we have 6% rate-base growth, you're going to see earnings per share growth, somewhere between rate base growth and the 4% dividend growth.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. Got it. And lastly, more near term. If I recall correctly, you've assumed that new rates for Four Corners will go into effect July 1 onwards. Is the current schedule keeping you on track? And is that what's embedded in the '14 guidance?","James R. Hatfield","'14 guidance has Four Corners July 1. I think we don't have a procedural schedule yet, so don't know when we'll get that. But I think once we get the ALJ schedule, we'll have -- when those go into effect in the interim, we're deferring the cost with 1, 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 acquisition until the time they go into effect. So cash impact, but no book impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Given the LFCR, what's the sensitivity to every 1% change in weather-normal demand in 2014?","James R. Hatfield","Well, 1% in weather demand?","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The weather-normal demand.","James R. Hatfield","Oh, weather-normal demand. Well, every -- generally speaking, every 1% customer growth is about $30 million of gross margin, about $10 million of net income.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So as demand tracks below expectations, more like the second half of '13 type of run rate, do you think you have the O&M flexibility to still make the midpoint of guidance?","James R. Hatfield","We're confident in our guidance.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then last question on transmission adjustment clauses in 2014. Approximately, what's the rate increase related to transmission...","James R. Hatfield","We haven't filed that yet, Neil. Part of our adjustment in the fourth quarter of '13 was a true-up to what we expect to file, but we have not worked through the Form 1 yet. We expect to file that probably around April 1 would be a good time line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on Slide 12, your pension expenses. It looked as though there were some adjustments to the discount rate and the plan assets, and so it looks as though your pension expense will be a little bit lower in '14 and '15 than what it was in '13. Given that the guidance for '14 didn't really change, can you just give a little bit more color as to what some of the offsets to that might be? Or has the retention of the guidance been just a little bit more of conservatism on your part or is it a little bit of mix of both? Just a little bit of extra color there.","James R. Hatfield","Well, I think, a little bit of both. We -- when we came out with guidance on August 31, we had a fairly good view of interest rates. So we knew we'd have some reduction -- or some increase in the discount rate. We factored that in. We have a liability-funded pension strategy, which, the more we're funded, the more we go -- move toward fixed income. And so we do -- the long-term return on plan assets will drop as we get more funded. So we made a educated guess at the end of October, and where we are now, that we have the assumptions nailed down is not materially different than what we had in October. And of course, it'd be, I think, for us, kind of silly to change our guidance based on truing up the pension from -- to, really, one month of the year. So that's some conservatism in that regard.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with MorningStar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Ocotillo would not be covered by a tracker. I mean, that would have to wait for the rate case following 2016?","James R. Hatfield","Well, it could or could not. I mean, we haven't made any decisions on our rate strategy there. We won't really begin spending any material money until 2016. So -- and I think what we try to do from a rate strategy also depends on the timing of the rate case.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. But that's planned? I mean, that's not considered an environmental thing or, I mean, it wouldn't be covered by any trackers, correct?","James R. Hatfield","No.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's what I thought. And then just on the FERC true-up that caused the $0.04 in the recently ended quarter. I always thought those FERC true-ups were like clockwork. What happened?","James R. Hatfield","Well, so we basically, when we're going to file next year, we've began to actually charge to revenue a portion of what we think we're going to do next year, because it's for this year, period. And that came out of our settlement when we had the actual date of June 1 in Arizona, as well as FERC. And various things impact that. What goes into service, what expense levels are, what our wheeling revenue is. And so as we go through the year, we just get a better view as to where we're going to end up the year, and -- I mean, we're talking $0.02 increase last in '12 and $0.02 down this year. So I'd say it is pretty close, actually.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So nobody really challenged the true-up. It was just a procedural thing?","James R. Hatfield","It's an internal thing.","Jeff Guldner","This is Jeff. It's the way the formula works. And so everything that's happening in the true-up is normal formula adjustments, and they just become clearer as you work through the formula year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just walk through the timeline and approval process for the Ocotillo project? And then I have a follow-up.","James R. Hatfield","I can only tell you that we're -- we have to get permitting -- we have to get approval from the city of Tempe.","Jeff Guldner","Yes, this is Jeff. There's about a year-long certificate of environmental compliance or compatibility process that takes place. And so that would go before the Arizona Commission. Ultimately, they are the ones who approves the certificate of environmental compatibility. And then once that's approved, you've got your other normal air permitting and the other things that would go forward. But that initial regulatory approval is about a 12-month process.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then a clarification of a question earlier or an answer earlier. The 1% sales growth that you noted from '14 to '16, does that include any benefit from the LFCR? And if it doesn't, what would the benefit of the LFCR be on top of the 1%, if that make sense?","James R. Hatfield","Yes. So obviously, as customer growth increases from where we are today, at 2.5%, we're going to begin to see a sales growth increase as well. On top of that 1% would be some benefit of the LFCR or whatever else happens out of net metering in the rate case. That would be consistent with what we're doing today from an LFCR perspective. It's like $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter basically.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And on a percentage basis, where does that come out to? Like 0.5% or so?","James R. Hatfield","I think this year's filing was like 0.7% or something like that. It started at 0.2%. It's capped at 1% rate increase. So that would be your top end.","Jeff Guldner","Yes, we're about 0.75% rate on this year's.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So going forward, from a modeling standpoint, weather-normalized sales growth should be something like 1.5%, 1.7% or so?","Jeff Guldner","Well, you need to separate sales from revenue, because we think sales gross can be about 1%, and then you have some of your adjusters that you would include on top of that like TTA, RES, LFCR, EIS, when we get later into the period.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","On the $0.70 per net metering, obviously, it has not been in place very long, but I'm sure you guys are watching it closely. Do you have any early returns or even anecdotal kinds of feedback on whether it's having any impact one way or the other?","Donald E. Brandt","Kit, this is Don. No, we're just a month or so into it. To draw any conclusions from the statistics would be pure speculation.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And if I understood your correctly, basically, your strategy towards any further proposed alteration in, let's say, the level of that charge, would, you want to gather evidence and go through these workshops and it may or may not be something that is part of the next rate case?","Donald E. Brandt","I think you're correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Chairman Stump was in New York last month and made a couple comments about some of the regulatory policies that the ACC is going to be examining, and then he also brought up the topic of ballot initiatives. And at that time, he had mentioned the possibility of a retail competition ballot initiative going into Arizona. I know, judging currently, it's not on the ballot, but can you just give an update with that and some of the dynamic pricing and some of the other things that they were talking about?","Jeff Guldner","Jim, this is Jeff. The -- we don't know of any ballot initiative right now. There's legislation that's out there right now, and I think there is one bill that was introduced that had a competition, kind of broadly defined competition, language in it. But that hasn't -- I don't believe that's moved right now, and so, obviously, we'd be watching that, but [indiscernible] there yet.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I have just one nit question, if you don't mind. Sorry to do this on a call. The CapEx from the slide deck doesn't match your cash flow CapEx in the 10-K. It's off by about $152 million. Am I missing something there?","James R. Hatfield","I'll have to look -- we'll have to look into that. We also have -- we also accrued CapEx at -- in December, but I -- we'll have to look into that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Jim, just a follow-up. Wanted to be clear I was understanding you right on your thoughts on equity needs and so on. So what would be the trigger for the equity offering? I guess, you're looking at that in 2016. Is it to true-up the balance sheet for the rate case, even though you may have filed earlier? Or is it more to look at your CapEx forecast next 3 years and look at funding needs? What would be that sort of triggering element for you in terms of when you end up raising equity?","James R. Hatfield","What would -- what we'll be looking at is our credit metrics to protect our A- credit rating.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's looking at your funding needs, et cetera. But to be clear, given your equity layered at APS right now, you're fairly comfortable that you will be at your threshold through the rate case process?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, I'm very comfortable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisers.","Andrew Levi","I just wanted to shake out a little bit more just to make sure I understood it. So just back on the sales, can you just explain a little bit in more detail, I guess, from what you were saying that the third quarter and particularly, the fourth quarter of 2012, was unusually high, and that is what's making the fourth quarter of 2013 look uglier than it really is, and really, is not something that we should focus on going forward. So can you maybe just talk about that?","James R. Hatfield","Yes. Well, usually...","Andrew Levi","Because the reason I say that is I kind of look at how your stock's trading, and I think that may be affecting it today.","James R. Hatfield","Well, if you look at fourth quarter of 2012, usage per customer was up 1% from what we'd consider normal customer usage and customer growth. And it was lower in the fourth quarter of 2013 by 1.9%, with 1% of that being the offset of last year. I will point out this, and you have a quarter where -- and the first quarter was like this as well. Any anomaly in weather can really skew sort of usage just based on weather patterns. So we're not worried about it. We see it a lot in the first and fourth quarters, just because of the very low usage. We're still confident in our projections going forward.","Andrew Levi","So I guess what's the fourth quarter, just in general, is that your lowest earnings quarter?","James R. Hatfield","First quarter would be.","Andrew Levi","First quarter, and then second -- then it comes fourth quarter, then you really make your money in the second and third quarter. So I guess that what you're saying is, just to paraphrase, is because of weather and because of low usage, it's very hard to kind of use that number as some type of trend?","James R. Hatfield","I would say that despite my team's best assertations, weather is an art not a science, when it comes to exactly what's weather-driven and what's not weather-driven.","Andrew Levi","And the other thing is, I kind of wanted, I guess, give you an opportunity for a better way to put it, is you kind of look at how the stock's done, particularly since the last 5 or 6 months, and you went from trading at a pretty nice premium to the group, and then kind of after EEI and the things that kind of happened with rooftop solar and the -- kind of the ruling there, which obviously didn't really affect your earnings, your trading gives you the third cheapest stock in the group on the regulated side. So how do you kind of turn that around? And why, if you had to kind of just talk about a few things, why it shouldn't be justified? And maybe address kind of the regulatory atmosphere in Arizona, which is probably not as bad as what's being portrayed in the stock.","Donald E. Brandt","Andy, first, I'll say the regulatory atmosphere, I think, is very positive. There was a lot of relatively ugly media coverage generated by certain parties, in particularly the second -- excuse me, third and fourth quarter last year. That's probably got some impact, a fair amount of notoriety. I think a number of other states around the country are going to take up the cause, and we'll see where it goes. But coming back to, I think, the intrinsic value that Pinnacle West has to offer is, first, as a lot of the charts and numbers Jim went over, is the intrinsic growth that's inherent in our service territory, the level of rate base growth we've got. We are very successful, I think one of the best operators in the nation, and that all adds up to the creation of shareholder value over a longer period of time. One little nit on, to add to Jim's comments about the fourth quarter, we did have an October -- month of October, where heating-degree days were all but nonexistent. So I won't get into the statistics of it, but the weather-normalizing model is a statistical model. And when you get a few standard deviations off of a normal weather pattern in one of the weakest -- traditionally weakest quarters of the year, I wouldn't use the fourth quarter of '13 to predict any kind of a future trend.","Andrew Levi","All right. And then the last question I have is just, can you just remind us of dividend policy going forward?","James R. Hatfield","Current intention of the board is to grow the dividend approximately 4% a year, and they'll look at that every October and make a determination. But certainly, with rate-base growth and the adjusters and our ability to earn, we'd expect that to continue, something to board annual action.","Operator","Due to time constraints, our final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just very quickly on the 1% sales growth. Does that anticipate any change in the impact from solar installations?","James R. Hatfield","No, it's really at a projection of continued rooftop solar.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So in other words, the changes that we've seen so far, which is, you guys have indicated, is too early to really sort of measure what the impact will be from the recent regulatory decision. As far as your -- the numbers that you have at the 1%, you guys are not baking in any significant change as a result of that regulatory decision?","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Paul J.

And welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2019 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast, to review our first quarter earnings, recent developments, and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS\u2019s President; and Daniel Froetscher, APS\u2019s Executive Vice President of Operations are also here with us. ","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our Earnings Release and related information. ","Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. ","Today\u2019s comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. ","Our first quarter 2019, Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. ","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 8.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thank you, Stefanie. And thank you all for joining us today. 2019 has started off in-line with our expectations and we remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I\u2019ll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. ","On April 9, Chief Administrative Law Judge, Jane Rodda, issued a recommended opinion and order, or rule as we call it in the customer complaint docket. The rule states that the customer complaint should be dismissed. ","The rule also recommends that in the next rate review APS, Commission staff and other stakeholders collaborate on better ways to communicate the bill impacts to residential customers. The rule suggests that any further issues concerning the reasonableness of APS\u2019s rates or the adequacy of its customer education and outreach program be considered in the current rate review docket. ","The current rate review docket was opened by the Commission in January, to review APS\u2019s 2018 books and records and to determine whether APS has earned more than its allowed return. As we\u2019ve mentioned on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, our 2018 ACC jurisdictional return on equity was 9.5%, which is less than the authorized 10% ROE. ","Commission staff is in the process of reviewing our 2018 financial information, and I\u2019ll provide the Commissioners with a report at the conclusion of their review. While the Commission staff had originally been targeting a May 3, deadline for their report, the staff indicated during the open meeting on April 23 and 24 that they may need some additional time. ","Lastly, the Commission approved our second refund to customers from Federal Tax Reform. Starting April 1, we began passing an additional $86 million back to customers. Together with the first $119 million in savings, approved in 2018 customers will receive more than a $200 million rate decrease. ","The third and final tax refund request was filed with the Commission on April 10 and is currently awaiting approval. If approved, TEAM Phase III will return an additional $34 million to customers annually for the first three years. ","The tax reform reductions combined with additional savings from lower fuel cost are expected to lower bills, $14 per month or $168 a year for the average residential customer, compared to one year ago. ","Turning to our operations. Palo Verde generating station had another successful quarter operating above a 100% capacity factor. A planned refueling and maintenance outage for Palo Verde Unit 1, began on April 6. Additionally, the Ocotillo modernization project is on budget and schedule to have all five units in service by this summer. ","On August 1, we planned to file our preliminary Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a 15 year forecast of electricity, demand and the resources needed to serve our customers, reliably in the future. We\u2019re currently engaging with a wide variety of stakeholders to gather input and ideas prior to our preliminary filing. The final IRP will be filed with the Commission in April of 2020. ","An important part of our forecast will be increasing the integration of clean energy resources and technology in an economically responsible manner. Clean energy resources not only reduce our carbon intensity, they also reduce O&M and fuel cost for customers. ","Similar to the bill savings from tax reform, these reductions will allow us to continue investing in technology and grid enhancements, necessary to support additional clean energy while maintaining customer bills at an affordable level. ","As you know, in February we announced the addition of nearly one gigawatt of new clean energy projects. Consistent with this plan, in April we issued a request for proposal for 59 megawatts of storage that will be added to our existing Chino Valley and Red Rock Solar Plants. Both projects are expected to be in service in 2021. ","We also issued a request for proposal for a new 100 megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of battery storage to be in service in 2021. Lastly, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the equipment failures that occurred on April 19 at our McMicken Substation Battery Storage Facility. ","During the response to this incident, firefighters from Surprise and Peoria, Arizona were injured. Our hearts go out to the injured firefighters. We greatly appreciate their hard work and bravery in responding to this event. ","An investigation with APS, First Responder Representatives, and third-party engineering and safety experts is under way. A thorough investigation will help us determine the cause of the failure. ","We have no reason to believe there are any safety issues with similar energy storage facilities. However, we will use the findings from the investigation to ensure all our facilities are safe moving forward. ","In addition, we will continue with our plans to add clean energy projects to our system, including pairing storage with solar resources. Energy storage is a breakthrough technology helping to solve challenges and create new opportunities for additional clean energy resources. ","In closing, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. We\u2019re focused on operational excellence while solidifying Pinnacle West as a sustainable leader through strategic clean energy investments. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield ","Thank you, Don. And thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. As shown on slide three, of the materials; for the first quarter of 2019 we earned $0.16 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2018. ","Higher adjusted gross margin and lower adjusted operating and maintenance expenses were the key positive drivers during the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.14 per share compared to the prior year, first quarter period. ","Favorable weather was a positive $0.14 gross margin impact during the quarter driven by the second coldest February in the last 40 years. Higher adjusted gross margin was also supported by a shift in the seasonality of revenue. ","The positive drivers were partially offset by lower transmission revenue, and lower other gross margins. As Don mentioned, TEAM Phase II was approved by the Commission and was implemented beginning on April 1. The impact of the TEAM Phase II is expected to be earnings neutral as both the timing of the refund and the offsetting income tax benefit will be recognized based on our seasonal sales pattern. ","Sales, net of energy efficiency, and distributed generation were up 1% in the quarter compared to the prior year first quarter period. As we mentioned last year, we expect to see the headwinds from energy efficiency and distributed generation decline, which will likely narrow the difference between customer growth and retail sales growth going forward. ","Continuing with the drivers, lower adjusted operations and maintenance expenses increased earnings to $0.09 per share primarily due to lower planned outage costs. Partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers were higher depreciation and amortization expenses due to plant additions and lower pension and other post retirement non-service credits, due to lower market returns. ","As we look ahead to the remainder of 2019, we remain focused on achieving long-term benefits for customers and investors. We have a track record of cost management discipline and we are taking the next steps in becoming a lean principal organization. We are committed to identifying new ways of working and strengthening our lean and digital capabilities in order to create cost reduction opportunities to keep customer rates affordable over the long term. ","Turning now to the Arizona economy, Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been among the national average. Through February of 2019 employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3.1% over 2018 compared to 1.8% for the entire US. Job growth remained strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors based on the strength in the regional economy. ","Construction employment increased by 10.3% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.3%. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development. ","In particular, we have had several recent announcements of companies moving to the west side of the Metro Phoenix area. Red Bull announced they will build 700,000 square feet facility in Glendale and milk distributor Fairlife plans to build a 300,000 square foot distribution facility in Goodyear. ","After announcements from strain data centers and vantage data centers regarding plans to build in the West Valley, Microsoft recently confirmed their plans to build world class data center facilities on two new sites in Goodyear. Phoenix was also ranked the second most active market in data-center leasing in 2018 according to CBRE\u2019s latest US data center trends report. ","The Metro Phoenix residential real-estate market has also continued its upward post-recession trend. In 2019 we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,800 compared to 2018 driven by single family permits. ","We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Phoenix Metro Housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. ","Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS\u2019s retail customer base grew 1.9% in the first quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. ","Importantly, long-term fundamental supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. ","According to the U.S. Census Data, Maricopa County ranked number 1 in the US for population growth for the third straight year and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country\u2019s fastest growing large metropolitan areas.","Switching to our financing activities. On February 26, APS entered into a $200 million unsecured term loan facility that matures on August 26, 2020. On February 28, APS issued $300 million a 30 year, 4.25% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds were used to repay the $500 million of 8.75% senior notes at maturity. We continue to expect to issue up to $450 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. Overall, liquidity remained strong. ","Turning to guidance, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. A complete list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on slide six and seven of the materials. ","This concludes our prepared remarks and I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Hey gentlemen, good afternoon.","Jim Hatfield","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon","So, I see you know all of the underlying short, medium and long-term guidance drivers are the same as Q4; but I did notice that you've extended the planned outage schedule for Cholla on Page 10 of the presentation. Can you explain what's going on there and why that's not having an impact on your O&M or moving you around in the guidance range in any material way I would hope?","Daniel Froetscher","Yes Greg, its Daniel Froetscher. Thanks for the question. When we opened up the generator in Cholla at the outset of our planned outage, we discovered some rubbing and erosion elements that affected rotor vibrations and in essence had to remove that rotor, ship it offsite, get it recalibrated and balanced, and it's due to be back on site later this week. The outage was originally scheduled for 46 days. It will go to approximately 79 days. And the reality is at this time of year based on its anticipated running profile anyway, there will not be an increase to overall fossil O&M.","Greg Gordon","Great, thanks. The second question, I know that we fought the war to end all wars on rooftop solar several years ago in terms of getting a balanced decision on net metering. But I saw news yesterday that Tesla, the artist formerly known as SolarCity, significantly cut -- is significantly cutting the cost of its rooftop solar installations. I know it's only been a day, but do you have any sense of whether or not that might allow them to \u2013 for increase or slow the deceleration of their penetration under the current rate structure in Arizona?","Jim Hatfield","Sunrun has probably been the leader in our service territory over the last 18 months or so and so it's hard to say what that will do that at this point in time.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you, guys. I'm sure \u2013 I won't take up any more time. I'll go to the back of the queue if I have more. Have a great day.","Jim Hatfield","Thanks Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Insoo Kim, your line is live.","Insoo Kim","Apologies, I was on mute. Just going back to the Cholla plant, I know you guys are potentially looking into the conversion of one of the units to biomass. Any detail you could provide on timing or scale of such a conversion, and my second related question is why are you only considering the conversion of one of the units as opposed to the remaining couple?","Daniel Froetscher","Yes, thanks for the question. Again, it's Daniel Froetscher. We have just taken an exploratory look at converting potentially Cholla 1 to biomass. We've engaged the services of a third-party engineering and design firm, invested in that exploratory look over the last 60 days to 75 days, and in relatively short order should be coming forth with a summary of that analysis and a discussion at the Arizona Corporation Commission then about whether that appears to be the right approach to take for customers and our company. So I ask you to be patient a little bit longer. ","In terms of only the one unit versus Unit 1 and 3, frankly there is an existing biomass plant within which APS is the off-taker in Northern Arizona. There is some level of uncertainty about long-term contracts with harvesting the biomass and slash from the Northern Arizona forest to support multiple, multiple biomass plants and so we're taking a conservative approach. Additionally, there are some gas pipeline issues that would prevent Cholla from being converted into anything larger than a Unit 1 conversion of about 60 megawatts to 70 megawatts.","Insoo Kim","Got it, thanks Dan. And then maybe switching to guidance a little bit, in your 2019 guidance do you incorporate the Four Corners SCR investment recovery and return to go into effect sometime in this year, potentially mid-2019?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. So, our guidance considered an earlier 2019 implementation date. We'll continue to look at guidance throughout the year. But I don't believe that material -- that guidance will change as we continue to throw \u2013 you know offset to most of the costs of the SCR. So we should be good within our original guidance.","Insoo Kim","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Jim Hatfield","Hi, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","I see that in the CapEx forecast there's a little bit more clean generation of CapEx planned for 2020, I think some of the buckets have changed a little bit. Maybe you could just talk about what that's from and what's happening since the last \u2013 since the fourth quarter report?","Jim Hatfield","Nothing has really changed. We just trued up the cash flows over those years as we got a better understanding of how all the cash flows would work.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, and after \u2013 I guess once we get the staff report through, eventually it's \u2013 assuming it's \u2013 I guess it might be delayed, but I guess officially right now it's still May 3rd. Is that correct?","Jeffrey Guldner","No Michael, this is Jeff. So there was discussion at the last open meeting. I think Don mentioned that there was discussion at the last open meeting where staff indicated that they were not likely to make that May 3rd date and so we expect \u2013 I don't have great visibility on when it's coming out, but I would expect it will probably come out later in May.","Michael Weinstein","And could you kind of explain what actions \u2013 what are the possible choices that the commission has after that, like what happens at the ACC level once that report comes out?","Jeffrey Guldner","Well, they'll issue the report. So one of the questions is what open meeting will it be synced to. There's an open meeting in May 21 and 22 given the time for exceptions and such, it's challenging to see it making that open meeting. Then there's an open meeting June 11and 12. When they issue the recommended opinion and order, all the parties have an opportunity to file exceptions to that. Part of the discussion that had been in that process was what are the remedies and I think that would be my opinion, more future focus so things to address in the next rate case, but you got to see what the staff report says.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning. How are you?","Jim Hatfield","Hey, good Julien. How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good, excellent, thanks for the time. Perhaps just to come back to where Michael just left it off if you can. Can you talk a little bit more about the timeline here as you see it more for the Four Corners step up? And then also if I can go back to Insoo's question. How do you think about offsetting factors here for guidance depending on the timeline for Four Corners to get done, especially if it's pushed out from June into July or whenever, and I'm thinking here about O&M cost cuts or anything else that again as you think about like affirming the 2019 outlook specifically here. I know a number of different questions there, so I'll let you take it at each point.","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes Julien, its Jeff. Let me start with the sequencing. So you've got the customer complaint case, recommended opinion and order came out on that; they recommended dismissing the complaint. That was discussed, but not voted on at the last open meeting and so then you've got the rate review and so we'd expect a rule to come out next month or so. ","The timing of that, I don't know whether the customer complaint is going to go on the May open meeting or whether that will get pushed to potentially coincide with the rate review at a subsequent open meeting and again, all that will then drive what happens with the SCR decision and will they all be on an open meeting or will there be some sequencing between there. I just don't have visibility to that, but from a timing standpoint that's what I look at.","Jim Hatfield","And then on your last question Julien, I mean I look through the guidance, through the course of the year, managed within the bandwidth of all the factors of guidance. So again, I don't expect a delay will cause us to rethink guidance at least at this point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And sorry, just to clarify that. When you say at least at this point, that's contemplating a delay potentially into this July timeframe or actually how do you even think about the timeframe? Is there a relationship between this rule and just getting this Four Corners step up done at this point? I know a lot's going on.","Jim Hatfield","I think we look at the range of timing of the SCR rule. I'm still very comfortable with our guidance.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, fair enough, understood.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Jim Hatfield","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Clarifying a few of the points made already. First on the staff audit on the returns calculation, are there certain adjustments that they make that may be different to the way you calculate that, because if I heard you right, you guys have already done the math and you didn't see yourself overearning, but is there a different math that staff likely goes through than the way you've done it?","Jeffrey Guldner","Ali, its Jeff. I don't know. They'll come out with the staff report and when we do rate cases, you do pro forma adjustments and things. But we'll have to see in the staff report.","Ali Agha","I see. And then in coming back just again to get a perspective on this, this Four Corners step up and you said one of those deferred costs obviously currently that are out there as well. So on a net basis, can you just give us a sense of what the impact is of this Four Corners step up net of deferred costs?","Jim Hatfield","While all the costs are deferred, so your deferral balance gets bigger as you go through the year.","Ali Agha","Right. So when you do get the step up in other words, what's kind of embedded in guidance in terms of the net EPS impact? How should we think about that?","Jim Hatfield","I would think about it as the deferral covers your costs and so until we get those into effect, you are just deferring all the cost and not a significant financial impact.","Ali Agha","I get that. But I'm saying assuming this all plays out, I mean is this a net $0.10 pickup or $0.05 pickup? I mean just to get a sense of magnitude the way you're thinking about it.","Jim Hatfield","It's in guidance.","Ali Agha","Okay, okay, and then my final question. Can you just remind us again on your current thinking on when to file the next rate case and when at the earliest you think you may need to issue external equity at this point?","Jim Hatfield","So, right now our plans are June 1, 2020 and as we've said in the past you know we'll consider to issue an equity sometime this year, but it won't be a \u2013 it will be a modest amount so...","Ali Agha","So sometime this year, but a modest amount?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. We're considering sometime this year, but whatever we issue will be a modest amount. It's really to top off the capital structure.","Ali Agha","I got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman","Hi, thanks. Hey Don, just a question on the battery fire and just I think in some of the articles I read that there\u2019s been some of these maybe overseas. So, I'm just kind of curious what is \u2013 of some of the ones that have occurred elsewhere, what have generally been the reason for it and just do you have any sense of what can be done differently to make sure these don't happen in the future?","Don Brandt","Yes, thanks Steve. I don't think we have a lot of data on the fires overseas. I think that there are a variety of different causes and it's just far too preliminary to even speculate on what happened. We're not quite sure if it was fire, explosion or both. It\u2019s very early. I think it was just last Monday that the experts got into the field so to speak, where it was secured and saved to begin the inspection. We think it's going to be at least a couple weeks to do the postmortem on it.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And so I mean I assume \u2013 I mean obviously this is a big new sector in having something like this happens kind of not \u2013 it's kind of important. I mean are you seeing like a lot of people take a look at this from well beyond kind of you\u2019re just the company involved, the supplier?","Don Brandt","Yes. I think the industry is taking a look at it and obviously we're getting a lot of questions of what happened, but the technology is not extremely complex; identifying what the issues in this specific instance was and to make sure that doesn't recur. I don't think it's anything systemic relative to the design or the industry as a whole. We still have full confidence in going forward on our clean energy projects, including pairing batteries with solar resources. So we don't have doubts there. I mean some glitch happened and we're going to run it to ground and make sure it's not any place else on our system and I think the industry will be looking to make sure it's not any place else.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Don Brandt","Alright.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Hey, good morning.","Jim Hatfield","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson","Just to go back on the Champion complaint case. When I was listening to one of the \u2013 I guess it was last week, the hearing, it seems that there was some discussion to that. It was like 56% of customers were not on the economically optimal rate plan and I think it was Commissioner Olson seemed to suggest the idea of placing customer service default on the economics \u2013 on a plan that would be economically optimal for them since the education seems to be sort of a challenged here. And I was just wondering, do we have a sense as to what the potential revenue impact of that might be or just your general thoughts about that approach?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes Paul, this is Jeff. So the complexity with that, I think this was talked about at the hearing, was that the settling parties in that underlying rate case agreed on a framework where the customer would move on to the most like rate. And so there was a lot of customer outreach to try to encourage customers to move on to the best rate, but because of the \u2013 this is we're ahead of the rest of the country I think in residential rate design and so a lot of the things that we're working through here are going to be important in how you do this in other places and so that was one of them. ","But the parties initially to the settlement said we think we should move customers to the most like, most similar rate structure, not necessarily the one that is best for them. And so what I think you'll see in this and the rate review case is a fair amount of attention on that; how do you focus on the customer education piece of this and then how you factor into revenue, you'd have to look at that in subsequent cases.","Paul Patterson","Okay. But I guess what it sounded to me like when I listened to it was that just in general because of the complexity of this and because of the sort of the response that we've seen and the fact that we've got this complaint case, etc., it seemed to me that they were looking sort of perhaps beyond the idea of educating customers to simply going for a default rate that would be economically optimal. Do you follow what I'm saying? And I'm just wondering if that did happen, do we have a sense what that would mean from a revenue impact? Do you follow what I'm saying, if they were to take it?","Jeffrey Guldner"," ","Yes. No, I don't and again my guess is that would be in a subsequent case."," ","Paul Patterson"," ","You don't think it would be as part of this complaint case?"," ","Jeffrey Guldner"," ","I don't know, but I hope so."," ","Paul Patterson"," ","Okay, that's it. The rest of my questions were asked and answered. Thanks so much guys."," ","Jeffrey Guldner"," ","Thanks."," ","Operator"," ","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your questions."," ","Charles Fishman"," ","Thank you. Don, in your opening remarks, I believe you said as part of the next round of IRP process that you would forecast demand to 2035 and then if memory serves me, the last time you went through this, you were talking a 30% increase by 2030 in customer demand. I would think with what's going on over the last five years with respect to the Phoenix economy, with respect to the rate design that is now more balanced between utility scale renewables, as well as rooftop; is it fair to assume that that number is going to \u2013 is not going to be lower and it could even go a little higher as far as a 15-year growth rate?"," ","DonBrandt","That's a good observation Charles. I hate to front run our work on the IRP, even the preliminary IRP, but the economy here in Arizona is really humming on all cylinders. You don't have to do a study, you can just drive around all the frames and the excavation and buildings going on both commercial, industrial, residential. So it wouldn't surprise me to see longer-term growth rates higher than they were last time around."," ","Charles Fishman"," ","Okay great, thank you.

I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter 2017 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Executive Vice President of Public Policy and General Counsel and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our third quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 10.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald Brandt","Thanks, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. This year continued to be in line with our expectations and keeps on pace with our full-year guidance. Although we experienced milder weather compared to normal during September. Our positive customer growth, ample investment opportunities and disciplined cost management continued to support our ability to meet financial commitments. Just last month, our Board also approved a 6.1% dividend increase, demonstrating the confidence our Board and our management team have in our ability to maintain sustainable growth.","Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent regulatory and operational developments. Our rate review concluded on August 15 with Arizona Corporation Commission voting to approve our settlement agreement without material modifications, including a 10% return on equity; and a $94.6 million base rate increase, which results in an overall 3.3% customer bill increase.","New rates went into effect on August 19. The successful rate review outcome continues to demonstrate Arizona's constructive regulatory environment. On September 1, we filed our proposed 2018 Demand Site Management or DSM, plan with the Corporation Commission. The 2018 DSM plan shifts focus to better align with our changing resource needs. The plan moves away from incentives, where savings no longer aligned with the system needs.","It also introduces new programs to shift customer usage to the middle of the day, when solar resources are abundant and energy is less expensive. For example, the 2018 DSM plan includes a pilot proposal to electrify school buses and provide charging infrastructure. We believe electrifying vehicle fleets is a win-win solution, utilizing excess power generated by solar during the middle of the day, while effectively reducing carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner.","To further address excess mid-day power, the 2018 DSM plan also includes an innovative reversed demand response pilot, allowing customers to take advantage of negative pricing events. Further recognizing the growing market for electric vehicles, the 2018, DSM plan includes a managed EV charging pilot program for electric fleets, workplaces and multi-family housing locations. And charging stations would be utility-controlled and available to provide demand response and load-shifting capabilities.","The shift in energy efficiency towards a strategic focus on managing peak demand allows customers to save money by encouraging usage during periods where energy is less expensive. From an operational perspective, this shift helps address our over-generation challenges in the middle of the day. In addition, it plays a key role in providing environmental benefits by allowing us to more fully utilize zero or low-carbon resources.","Turning to our operations. Our employees once again did an excellent job, maintaining the generation fleet and electric grid this summer. The Palo Verde generating station performed well, with all three units operating at a combined capacity factor of 99.4%, unit 1 at Palo Verde ended its plan refueling outage on October 7. In September, Four Corners began a 95-day plant outage on unit 5.","During the outage, we will tie in with selective catalytic reduction equipment referred to as SCRs. A second 95-day plant outage will occur in early 2018 to repeat the process for Four Corners unit 4. The SCR will be installed at Four Corners will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 80%. APS customers have benefited from savings of $30 million in the Company's first year in the Western regional energy imbalance market.","Our EIM participation has allowed us to garner efficiencies by decreasing production costs, lowering the cost of integrating renewable resources and taking advantage of negatively priced power from other states. The summer of 2017, also, we wrote APS energy records, an all-time peak usage record and new technology defined the season.","On the technology front, we experienced our first summer with a newly-implemented advanced distribution management system, or ADMS. And ADMS provides grid operators increased visibility of our system and the ability to remotely control a greater portions of the distribution grid across the state. And this ability played an important role in APS' response to monsoon storms over the course of the summer. And with our operating system and other grid-enhancing technology, APS is positioned to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers.","Our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing core utility operations. We are progressing on the installation of five new fast start, flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant. Also, in middle of rebuilding about 20 miles of poles and wires and rulers on Arizona. We'll be installing a battery storage system to meet the area's growing demand for electricity. Construction on our new 8-megawatt hour battery storage project will begin in early November and is expected to be operational early next year.","We also installed two battery storage units in the West Valley in December, 2016, as part of the solar partner program, and we are exploring additional storage opportunities. These innovative projects are indicative of the type of grid we envisioned for customers: smart, multifunctional and a platform for additional customer-cited technology.","Looking forward, our long-term strategic plan positions us well to capitalize on new investment opportunities. Our fundamentals and our expectation for growth remain unchanged. And the recent dividend increase reinforces the boards' and management's confidence and our ability to execute and deliver value to our shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you, Don. And thank you again everyone for joining us on a call. Today I'll discuss the details of our third quarter financial results provide an update on Arizona economy and review our financial outlook, including introducing 2018 guidance.","This morning, we've reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2017, which will in line with expectation. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2017, we earned $2.46 per share, compared to $2.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016.","Slide 4, outlines the vacancies that drove - the variances that drove the changes in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the key drivers. Gross margin was up $0.22 per share in the third quarter of this year, compared to last year reported by several factors. The rate increase approved by the commission in ADS' rate case proceeding, which became effective August 19, improved gross margin in $0.13 per share.","Higher sales in the third quarter of 2017, compared to the third quarter of 2016 increased earnings by $0.02 per share, driven by customer growth, partly offset by the effects of energy efficiency and the disputed generation, the net effect of weather variations $0.02 per share.","Cooling degree-days were higher in the third quarter of this year, compared to last year, although whether in both 2016 and 2017 third quarters with less favorable the material averages.","Higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in employee benefit costs. We also have had higher plant outage cost related to the beginning stages of the SCR installation at Four Corners unit 5.","Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2017, compared to the third quarter of 2016, impacting earnings by $0.07 per share. The increase was primarily driven related to time additions and the $61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in the rate case.","Looking next to Arizona's economy, which continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis, I'll cover some of the trends we are seeing on the local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Metro Phoenix areas continue to show job growth of about the national average.","Through August, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2% compared 1.5% for the entire U.S. The above average job growth is broad based and driven largely by tourism, health care, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 4.3% also reflects a strength of the job market.","Job growth continued to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen on the upper of Slide 5, vacancy rates in commercial markets continue to fall or at the levels last seen in 2008 or earlier. Additionally, about 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter.","We expect the continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support continued commercial development. Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession, trend.","In 2017, housing permits are expected to increase by about 2,000 compared to 2016, driven by single-family permits. In fact, permits for new single-family homes in the third quarter with a highest level seen since 2006.","One factor driving this increase is that Maricopa County was the fastest-growing county in the U.S. in 2016. That activity in the market is providing meaningful support for home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in 2008.","We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years.","Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.9% in the third quarter. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 11, APS issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds will be used to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures.","Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West and APS had approximately $100 million and $32 million of short-term debt outstanding, respectively. As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased indicative annual dividend by $0.16 per share, or approximately 6% to $2.78 per share effective with the December payments.","Turning to guidance. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2017 will be in the range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. Key drivers to the remainder of the year include the impact from our rate case, and higher O&Ms as we complete the plant outage at Four Corners. The extended planned outage at Four Corners is why earnings in the fourth quarter of this year are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2016.","We are also introducing 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which includes an increase in our weather-normalized sales forecast to 0.5% to 1.5%. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanisms and sales growth will be important gross margin drivers, we expect will be partially offset higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expenses relating to more plant service, including higher G&A and property tax.","We've also increased our 2018 capital expenditures forecast by approximately $40 million, mainly from reliability-related projects. We have higher cost of planned outages cost in 2018 including the 95 day SCR installation of Four Corners Unit 4. We also have planned outages that our gas plant including Redhawk, maintenance that our gas plants is based on one hours and starts.","Our participation in the energy and balance market increasing levels of solar generation and low gas prices combined with the result and more starts in many of our plants. We'll continue to plant to operate our business for long-term success, but we continuously strive to manage costs in sustainable manner. In 2018, there are larger than normal number of planned outages will provides necessary maintenance to continue operating or diversified fleet with a high level of reliability our customers expect.","We also believe that thoughtful and well-executed preventive maintenance can limit more costly emerged work in the future. We will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlining our 2017 and 2018 guidance in the appendix to today's slides. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 67% through 2019, and this growth expect annualized consolidated return on average common equity at more than 9.5% over the same time raising.","With the combination of modest customer growth supported by robust economic development activities, extensive capital investment opportunities and renewable resources, technology and grid modernization together with a constructive and forward thinking regulatory commission. We believe we are well-positioned to continue our track record of success.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Donald Brandt","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. You mentioned pointed out in 2018, you will have higher than normal outages and so the O&M expense yes, it's lumpy and it's higher. As you look forward you may be the next couple of years. Can you remind us again when we should see that kind of lumpiness in the O&M expense, I am assuming 2019, 2020 perhaps return to normalized level so how should we think about that?","Donald Brandt","Well, I would say that, since we haven't gone beyond 2018, is our fossils - overall spend has always been lumpy. And you can see on Slide 14 and the appendix so to the historical pattern. This was an unusual year with the SCRs and scope of the work done to make that happen, along with gas plants as I said based on starting hours. So I'll just say it's a lumpy, but this year it's unusually high.","Ali Agha","As would be next year as well.","Donald Brandt","Yes.","Ali Agha","And then, the second question, in the slide deck, you laid out at least an aspiration of the plan for the dividend growth to continue at 6% beyond the current level. Should we use that as a good proxy of how you're thinking about EPS growth longer term as well?","James Hatfield","Well, I would just state it this way since we don't give earnings growth is, our rate base growth is 6% to 7%, the board and the management team is very comfortable of what we'd see through the next rate cycle. So you can imply anything you want on that.","Ali Agha","Okay. Last question, year-to-date, weather-normalized sales growth has been essentially flat, I think like 0.1%. Is that in line with what you're thinking for this year? And any read-through on how you're expecting longer term? I know you're expecting it to go higher, but how would you rate sort of the year-to-date trends?","James Hatfield","I would say that, year-to-date, of 0.1%. We saw a somewhat of the slowdown usages that came probably in October. Probably some impact in there, higher than the rate case. We had a weak fourth quarter of 2016, so I think sales are right in line with what we've forecasted throughout the year.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","James Hatfield","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon","I mean, I will frankly ask the key questions that I was focused on. But I'm looking through the slides here. I don't see any update on what rooftop solar penetration or rooftop solar sales have done since the rate case was resolved and the rate design has changed. Can you give us a sense of how the market has changed from what\u2026","James Hatfield","Yes. So the exact number will be in our EEI slide deck, which will be filed later today and we're just finalizing the number, but you did see a fall off on what we expected with the pull forward in 2018 to the grandfathering, but that number will be in slide that we'll follow later today.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Great. Thank you. And I know, Don, you talked about ample investment opportunities just around the economic growth and the monetization of your infrastructure. Your current 2017 to 2019 CapEx plan is reasonably significantly backward-dated. It goes from $1.3 billion to $1 billion per year. At what juncture should we expect or what milestones should we look for you to identify customer-friendly sort of customer necessary investments that might bring those numbers up?","Donald Brandt","Good question, Greg. We continue to look for those opportunities. And I think it's going to be largely driven by the kind of growth we're seeing, some of the things that Jim touched on, but an addition to that, Maricopa County, where Phoenix is at, the number one population growth center in the United States. We saw employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2% compared to 1.5% for the nation and realtor.com projects Phoenix to be the number one housing market in 2017.","We've had the larger customer side, like Intel, which isn't the customer, but they announced a new fab facility in the Metro area, which the housing component has add in the service sector will bleed over into our service territory. And you used to get the card drive around and the card looks blinded block without multi-family project going up in the Downtown Phoenix is really taken off. So it's pretty bullish on our customer expectation over the next two to five years and I think that will drive a lot of our CapEx spending.","James Hatfield","And Greg we will have a updated - we'll file all updated CapEx including 2020 in our 10-K in February, so that will give you all so outlook in the future.","Greg Gordon","That's was I thought. Thanks guys. Have a great day.","Donald Brandt","You too.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning.","Donald Brandt","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes, thank you sir. Appreciate it. I wanted to follow-up a couple of questions real quickly, a little bit to the last one that Greg last one that Greg asked. You talked about future investments, given the acceleration here. Can you talk about the smart grid and reinvesting the grid from that perspective beyond kind of the near-term beyond 2019? Clearly it seems like that that's a trend in the industry and you all probably see that to a larger extent, perhaps, and others given the customer growth?","Donald Brandt","We have smart meters in across our system. So they are fully deployed. Don mentioned ADMS, which is really the grid, technology that allows us to get visibility into the grid and control. And I would say, our annual spend today on things like integrated greater more are probably $40 million to $50 million and that's really evolving at this point, so ample opportunity to continue to support the two way grid.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent and then separately, obviously, more of a few related question, but how do you think about the timeline to retirement in some of the units here. I mean could we see some of the accelerations out there. Just given average units costs structure et cetera, I mean could that be a mitigate to some of the future O&M growth or the current O&M growth your facing here.","Donald Brandt","So Navajo is closing in 2019. The way it stands today. We did an RFP last year for beyond 2020. We have one in store right now as well. So I think unless are talking about the successful sort of safety type, I would not put anything in near-term.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Fair enough, excellent. And then out of the RFP, any commentary in terms of your ability to own something. I mean obviously we saw last year's results turn out to be contracted gas. How are you thinking about that for yourselves under any number of potential outcomes including build, own, transfer, acquire, own the rate base is - any number scenario?","Donald Brandt","So the RFP's in process now. We're nearing the final stages at this point. We did not final stages at this point. We did not include in of build, own, transfer or sales build at this point. This is really for power blocks for day. It is what we're really looking for.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much and see you soon.","Donald Brandt","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good afternoon. Just two follow-up on Julien's question, so would we see perhaps or replacement from Navajo being sought next year's RFP, is that the kind of timing that we would be thinking about","Donald Brandt","Last year's RFP was for 2020 and beyond, so we'll get through this RFP and see what our needs are at this point.","Michael Weinstein","Right, and at some point, do you anticipate try to take advantage of some of the exceptions to this self-build moratoriums such renewable ownership and that kind of thing and maybe that would show up in the CapEx forecasts at some point?","James Hatfield","Yes, we don't really need anything at the moment. But we'll evaluate ongoing whether we need something that or not so.","Michael Weinstein","Is there any - I mean I know it hasn't put out the new presentation here for you, but what do you think are the expansion possibilities for battery storage at this point beyond the current programs that something that could take off and accelerate?","James Hatfield","Well, I think we'll continue to play more battery storage as we move forward. I think we're taking a measured pace to make sure we're not in front of the cost curve. As Don said, we're putting in a couple of batteries in the rural area to in lieu of upgrading the circuit. And I think there will continue to be opportunities where we can sort of capital near-term few battery storage. But we're just getting started at battery storage at this point.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. If I just at look at your guidance for 2017 and your guidance for 2018 and take midpoint to midpoint. It implies about I mean back on the envelope, 3% EPS growth. Your rate base growth guidance is about 2x of that or double of that. I'm just curious, can you help me understand do you think 3% is kind of a normal EPS growth or there abnormal things that are happening in 2018 that make the EPS growth rate below average?","James Hatfield","Obviously, we don't think 3% is normal or the board would normal rate the dividend of 6%. 2018, as it sits today as a test year. There's a lot of capital if that recovered in there you have the training of the - you have a deferral, but you are not earning on it. So now I think it's just on unusual year if you look back historically we've grown from 10% to 1.5% EPS and I wish desktop was leaner it makes it a lot easier but unfortunately it's not leaner. We're always have cycles through the rate cycle.","Michael Lapides","And I want to make sure I understand when I think about the rate case cycle. Will you be filing just add Four Corners in Ocotillo in the rates as follow-up bolt-on kind of mini-cases. Or you still planning to have a full blown GRC filing in 2019 with 2018 is the test year and 2020 is the implementation timeframe?","James Hatfield","So the way it sits today, remember we have the step increase in the Four Corners which will be 1\/1\/2019. We currently have 2018 as a test year which would be - Ocotillo will be done in May of 2019 and then it will be the rest of the capital and with 2018 test year as it sits today.","Michael Lapides","But the case will be if you are using 2018 as a test year, it's not just the capital, it's the capital, it's the O&M, it's kind of all in.","James Hatfield","It's not one issue for the rate case; it would be four rate case.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And when would that case get kind of I'm trying to think about the timing of it, when would that get implemented probably sometime in 2020?","James Hatfield","So we cannot file the before moving on to 2019, so if you think about the last cycle we filed June 1, rate will to effect July 1, 2020 and that's as it's currently contemplated.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Just one quick one. Dividend growth guidance was 5% recently is after the August rate case discussion, now at 6%. Can you provide a little color, what was the board - what drove the board to increase the 1% payout ratio or how do they look at it?","Donald Brandt","They look at normal payout ratio per se, although, we look at payout ratio and credit metrics and everything. They use to look at our long-term future and see that we have a good plan in place with growth. We started the dividend increase as we drove that 4%, we raise it to 5% in 2015, so as far they are manually looking at our sustainable dividend growth.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Pretty good. Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Shar Pourreza","Hey, guys. My questions are answered. Thanks.","Donald Brandt","Thanks, Shar.","James Hatfield","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Yes, I just wanted to be clear then this goes back to the first question that was asked, and then as it ties into 3% year-over-year growth, the midpoint of guidance. That's also clearly a function of the fact that you're - the timing of the maintenance the sort of $0.11 higher year-over-year, right and going back to\u2026?","James Hatfield","Well, that moving one piece of it Greg.","Greg Gordon","Yes, I mean I understand the other pieces that you articulated but that alone, if you look at Slide 14, you're looking at, over the last one, two, three - six years, you're at an all-time high on planned outage spending. So is it the right way to think about it without trying to tie you into a specific guidance format that you're not comfortable with, looking at sort of a long-term average and thinking about that as what a run rate should be in any given year?","James Hatfield","I haven't calculated it, but certainly your $0.11 in 2018 over 2017 is part of that up and down that happens on a year-to-year basis.","Greg Gordon","Right, but even 2017 was - 2016 and 2017 were higher than the prior three years by the significant margin? I guess, what I'm trying to do is maybe at EEI you can decide to give people what you're thinking on average estimated cost would be through the cycle. So we could get a better sense of what it will look like out through time?","James Hatfield","I'll say overall O&M and obviously this goes up and down, cents per kWh, O&M expense as a - cent per kWh whether normalized retail sales have been flat since 2010 at $0.275 of kWh. So we'll work hard that to keep O&M certainly over the timeframe based on kWh growth.","Greg Gordon","Great, thanks guys. See you soon.","James Hatfield","Okay, yep.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Donald Brandt","Thank you for being on the call. We'll see you next week in Orlando.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day."],"17407":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call February 23, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Stefanie Layton - Director, IR","Donald Brandt - Chairman and CEO","James Hatfield - CFO","Jeffrey Guldner - EVP, Public Policy, APS","Mark Schiavoni - COO, APS","Analysts","Greg Gordon - Evercore","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Layton. You may begin.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you, Doug. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Executive Vice President of Public Policy; and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our 2017 Form 10-K was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which will identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through March 2.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald Brandt","Thanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today.","2017 was a strong year for our company financially, operationally and in the areas of safety and public policy. After increasing the dividend in October for the 6th straight year, we completed 2017 with earnings exceeding expectations. Jim will discuss the financial results. My comments will focus on our 2017 highlights in the year ahead","Our fleet continued to perform well in 2017. Palo Verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon-free electricity production, generating 32.3 million megawatt hours of energy. It's also notable that the team of Palo Verde completed each of the scheduled 2017 spring and fall refuelings and maintenance outages in 30 days. This is the first time in the plant's history when both outages were completed in 30 days.","Our generation fleet continues to evolve by integrating additional clean energy and by focusing on meeting our peak demand. The 2017 request for proposal for heating capacity resources concluded with a power purchase agreement for 65 megawatts of solar with 50 megawatts of battery storage. This will be one of the largest battery storage systems in the country.","Although APS is recognized as a national leader in solar energy with more than a gigawatt of solar power on our system, this next step toward battery storage will ensure the sun helps power Arizona homes into the early evening when our customer demand for electricity peaks. The facility is expected to begin serving customers in 2021.","Our investments are focused both on additional clean energy resources and the technology necessary to support these resources. Our 2017 operations benefited from a robust technology investments that were further strengthen our electric system, increase efficiency of our operations, and improved our customers experience.","Among the most significant improvements were the implementation of a new advanced distribution management system or ADMS and customer information system. ADMS has increased our ability to control the grid remotely, while the customer information system has increased our ability to respond to customers. Our continued investment in system improvements has resulted in other tangible customer benefits.","In 2017 we achieved top quartile distribution reliability metrics and have the best summer reliability in five years despite the hot and demanding weather. APS also remains top decile for safety performance as compared to our pure electric utilities.","The transmission and distribution organization had its safest year ever. The safety of our men and women is a top priority. It's indicative not only of our commitment to our people but it also reflects our commitment to operational excellence. We'll continue to strive for zero, a truly injury free workplace.","Turning to the regulatory front, the positive and collaborative outcome of our rate review was a milestone accomplishment in 2017. The Arizona Corporation Commission's decision clearly demonstrates Arizona's interest in capitalizing on the changing dynamics of the electric utility industry and meeting the evolving needs of our customers. We will continue this progress in 2018 as our customers' transition to the new rates.","Although the rate review is complete, there are a number of public policy items to be decided in 2018. The step increase request for the SCR environmental control project at Four Corners will be filed in April and the Commission is expected to vote on the 2018 demand site management plan and yesterday the Commission approved $119 million of bill reduction for customers based on federal corporate tax reductions.","The savings from the tax reductions will be passed directly to customers through the tax expense adjustor mechanism. A new adjustor mechanism that was included in our 2017 rate review. We intend to file a subsequent application with the Commission later this year to pass through additional savings from the federal tax reform to our customers. In addition discussions continue on ways to economically integrate more clean energy sources state-wide without jeopardizing reliability or magnifying the over generation challenges in the middle of the day.","For 2018 our strategic priorities center around consumer engagement, flexible resources, employees and innovation. Specifically, we plan to deliver consumer driven programs and services develop new initiatives that leverage our core capabilities, adopt sustainable programs that support our people and integrate new technologies to enhance performance reliability and the overall experience of our customers. These priorities align with our mission of safely and efficiently delivering energy to meet the changing needs of our customers.","In summary, we achieved another year of outstanding performance as we focus on delivering on our commitments to the customers who depend on us. The communities we serve, our dedicated employees and the shareholders who trust us with their investment. For 2018 we have clear priorities and alignment amongst the senior leadership to execute collectively on these priorities.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you Don. And thank you again everyone for joining us today.","This morning we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. As you can see on slide three of the material we had a solid year. Before I review the details of our 2017 results, let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017 we earned $0.19 per share compared to $0.47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016.","Slide four outlines the variances which drove the decrease in our quarterly earnings. Looking at adjusted gross margin the rate increase higher sales related revenue and transmission revenue were all positive contributions. As we anticipated higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense in the fourth of 2017 compared to the 2016 decreased earnings largely due to the higher plant outage cost related to the SCR installation at Four Corners unit 5.","Now turning your attention to slide five I\u2019ll review some highlights of our full year results. We delivered strong results in 2017 that exceeded our guidance range of $4.15 to $4.30 earnings $4.35 per share compared to $3.95 per share in 2016. Actual results were higher than projected due in part to effective cost management and higher revenues. Gross margin was a key driver in 2017 with the key core components. There were rate increase that went into effect on August 19, 2017 contributed $0.30.","Note however, that there were related increases in operating expenses that partially offset the benefit of gross margin. Higher sales related revenue added $0.13 to gross margin in 2017 driven by customer growth and higher average effected prices. Transmission and LFCR revenues also continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin and combined contributed $0.31 per share.","Looking next at operating expenses, operations and maintenance expense was up slightly in 2017 compared to 2016 decreased earnings by $0.03 per share. Primarily due to higher employee benefit and information technology cost partially offset by lower Palo Verde operating costs and lower fossil generating cost. Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the largest to offset to 2017 earnings compared to 2016.","The increase was primarily related to plant additions and includes 61 million annual increase in D&A rates approved in 2017 rate review order other taxes were higher in 2017 resulted in 2016 reflect the higher property values the impacts related to the amortization of the property that fall as part of 2017 rate review order.","Other taxes were higher in 2017 relative to 2016 reflecting high property value and impacts related to the amortization of the properties tax deferral as part of 2017 rate review order. Lastly higher interest expense, net of AFUDC reduced earnings in 2017 compared to 2016. This included interest charges due to higher balances partially offset by higher construction work in progress balance is contributed to AFUDC. As we know Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis. I\u2019ll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy.","The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average as seen in the upper panel on slide six. Through December employment in Metro Phoenix increased 4% to 31.3% for the entire U.S. This above average job growth is broad-based and driven largely by tourism, healthcare, manufacturing, finance and construction. The Metro Phoenix unemployment rate of 3.7% also reflects the strength of the job market. Arizona\u2019s political and community leaders continue to support economic development.","Recently, Nikola Motor Company announced it would move its headquarters and build a new $1 million manufacturing plant West of Phoenix. This move is expected to bring 2000 jobs to the Metro area with construction set to begin this year. This was one example of the ongoing business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market. Metro Phoenix also had growth in the residential and real estate market.","You can see in the lower panel of slide six, housing construction is affected to continue the upward post-recession trend. Permits for new single-family homes in 2017 were the highest level since 2007. The activity in the market is providing meaningful support to home prices which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth and low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand at this pace over the next couple of years.","Reflecting the steady improvement in the economic conditions the APS\u2019s retail customer base grew 1.8% in 2017 which is also the highest growth rate since 2007. We expected that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and the economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Switching topics to our financing activities on November 30 Pinnacle West issued 300 million of three year 2.25% senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds were used to repay Pinnacle West $125 million term loan and for general corporate purposes. In 2018, we expect to issue up to 600 million of long-term debt at APS.","Overall liquidity remain strong at the end of the fourth quarter Pinnacle West has 95 million in short-term debt outstanding and APS had no short-term borrowings outstanding. A quick note on pension the funded status of our pension remains healthier at 95% as of year-end 2017. This is largely due to the continued success of our liability driven investment strategy.","Turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook as shown on slide 7 we expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will now be in the range of $4.35 per share to $4.55 per share up $0.10, from $4.25 to $4.45 per share. This increase in guidance is supported by our continuation of our cost management and favorable cost trends coupled with a solid gross margin forecast.","Our earnings outlook also incorporates the financial impacts from tax reform including the tax expense adjustor mechanism which was approved to last year\u2019s rate review and the lower effective tax rate. This rate increase our adjustor mechanism that sales growth remain important gross margin drivers which we expect will be partially offset by higher fossil plant outage cost and higher other operating expense related to more plant and service including higher D&A and property taxes.","As a reminder, we have higher fossil plant outage cost in the first half of 2018 including a 95-day SCR installation of Four Corners Unit 4 and planned outages at our gas plants such as Redhawk.","And updated list of the key factors and assumptions underlying our revised 2018 outlook is included in the appendix to our slides. Also included in today's material you will see that we have extended our capital expenditures and rate base forecast to 2020. We increased our capital expenditures forecast for 2019 to 1.15 billion and we anticipate APS\u2019s spend to be around 1.2 billion in 2020. With this capital spending level we expect our rate base to continue to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% although individual year's may vary.","Before closing I\u2019ll take a few minutes to walk through the impacts of tax reform. Though the various effects are mix on balance we view the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is favorable most notably the preservation of interest and property tax deductions for the regulated utility. The reform package will also relieve some rate pressure. The corporate tax rate reduction to 21% we gained in 2018 results in $1.1 billion of excess deferred tax and a regulatory liability of $1.5 million after the required run rate growth up for APS.","Under the new tax provision, the majority of these excess deferred taxes are subject to IRS normalization provisions. During 2018 we will be working with our federal and state regulators to determine the period over which to return these excess deferred tax to customers.","We don\u2019t expect a material earnings impact from the cash reform package especially given PNWs minimal parent level debt. From a rate base perspective, our preliminary estimates show incremental rate base, increased approximately 150 million per year in 2018 and 2019 as a result of both the lower tax rate and the legislative changes related to tax depreciation.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","So looking at the drivers for the financial outlook for 2018, it appears that the only meaningful change in the near-term is that AFUDC is higher by and that explains that - all things equal the move up in the range is that correct. And if so can you just give us a brief explanation as to why?","Donald Brandt","Yes, so that\u2019s one driver and it's really driven by the fact that we expect more of construction work progress in 2018 over 2017. But I think what\u2019s also being masked is an electric gross margin where the big downward estimate was due to tax reform. But also we show higher retail revenue in there as well. We finished the year at 1.9% customer growth 1.8 for the year so we\u2019re seeing continued improvement in that economy and although we did not change the O&M range we expect to have lower O&M in 2018.","Greg Gordon","So you\u2019re within the ranges for electric gross margin in O&M even though didn\u2019t change them - all things equal so you\u2019re sort of better inside those ranges then you were before?","Donald Brandt","That\u2019s right. We see continuation of the effective cost controls.","Greg Gordon","And that gross margin improvement that's due to the changes in the rate design that are allowing you to - you have historically given us sort of a spread between what you would expect the gross revenue or gross customer growth and sort of net revenue growth - its obviously I think that great design you\u2019ve seen some improvement in that?","Donald Brandt","I think it\u2019s due to higher sales we expect 1.5% to 1% to 1.5% in 2018 and we are seeing higher realized prices in the last half of 2017.","Greg Gordon","And then there has been some debate amongst investors on how to think about structurally you know how your earnings power grows through time especially when it gets sort of 2020. You\u2019ve now given us rate base numbers which help. But to be clear when you give your guidance, we should assume that you\u2019re still targeting a return on parent equity of 9.5% or better and that be consistent through 2020 and that we should be sort of obsessing about the equity layer in the utility business so the rate base number, the notional equity value but models here your capital structure and model to whether or not we believe that given these drivers you can earn 9.5% or better on parent equity is that right?","Donald Brandt","That\u2019s correct. Nothing changed in our investment thesis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So couple of quick questions. First on the CapEx update obviously constructive here. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the precise maybe pieces are? I know grid modernization has been something that got some amount of attention. How fully baked are those numbers that you presenting here relative to the potential in the medium term here as well as any potential incremental solar opportunities that may have emerged out of the RFP - whether in the future whether you acquire them or otherwise just want to be clear about that?","Donald Brandt","So the big drivers really on the distribution side and that\u2019s really driven by a modernization of the grid reliability and then really growth. We have 21 new substations planned over the next three year so that\u2019s a sign of preparing for future growth as well. So those are the big drivers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But it's relatively fully reflected in the numbers as it stands.","Donald Brandt","Yes, we continue to talk with customer like the City of Phoenix with a micro-grid at the airport thanks for that nature but none of that\u2019s been here because we did not have specific projects. So incrementally maybe a little upside but I think it reflects our best thinking as of now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just turning back to the earned ROEs, looking beyond 2018 here obviously we\u2019re doing well thus far. Can you comment a little bit on 2019 onwards earned ROE expectations? Should we expect further pressure as you kind of wean away from the latest rate case or how you think about that given the latest efforts to cost management that you articulated.","James Hatfield","I\u2019ll take the last question Don answered the question which we continue to take - earned somewhere between 9.5 and 9.9 based on revenue cost control. We have a Four Corners step increase in 2019. So nothing changed in that regard.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right but even specifically 2018 or 2019 you think your ability to consistently earn the ROE at the same level is a fair statement at this point?","James Hatfield","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","First coming back to - you said one of the big drivers for both 2018 guidance going up and fourth quarter coming in stronger than even the original expectations. On the revenue side things came about better cost us well but I just wanted to reconcile that with - you reported negative 1.8% whether normalized retail sales numbers for the fourth quarter even though customer growth as you pointed was strong. So how do we reconcile strong customer growth but negative retail sales, but higher than expected actual revenues. Can you just link those?","Donald Brandt","It\u2019s just the realized price space on when customer use their electricity.","Ali Agha","But the usage shouldn\u2019t that be caught in the weather normalized retail sales growth number?","Donald Brandt","No, sales of a number of units sold the revenue is really the impact of prices realized per unit.","Ali Agha","So time of usage in other words?","Donald Brandt","Yes.","Ali Agha","And then secondly on the tax reform front, as you think about your financing plans over this 2018 through 2020 cycle call it, any changes at all that tax reform has triggered that would change any of your medium longer term financing plans?","Donald Brandt","Not at this time. We're in an A minus we have a very pristine balance sheet, strong FFO to debt and so we\u2019re not looking or planning on equity at this time.","Ali Agha","And the period we are looking at is this 2018 through 2020 sort of period?","Donald Brandt","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","I only had one question, Slide 11 third bullet point down on the left for guidance on rate reduction for transmission customers expect in 2018, would that be prospective or would you have to - can they go backwards on that at all?","Donald Brandt","They would not be retrospective, they would be '18 forward.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to management for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you for joining us today. That concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you sir, you may begin.","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and Webcast to review our third quarter 2015 earnings, recent developments, and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt, and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer, are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will using are available on our Investor Relations Web site, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our third quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our Web site for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 6th.","I'll now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thank you, Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Pinnacle West delivered a solid quarter with several financial and operational highlights keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year and setting us up well for next year. The Board also approved the 5% dividend increase last week effective with the December dividend payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. Jim will discuss the financial results and guidance.","Our operations team did an excellent job maintaining the fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station performed well. Unit 2 entered its planned refilling outage on October 10th this outage marks an important milestone. It represents the completion of flex equipment installation at all three units. Flex addresses one of the main safety challenges at Fukushima the loss of cooling capability and electrical power resulting from a severe event. Flex short for diverse and flexible mitigation strategies is an industry wide initiative with site specific applicability, it relies on portable equipment to protect against even the most unlikely scenarios. The transmission distribution and customer service teams also performed well.","Similar to last year we had a series of monsoon storms over the last few months 50,000 customers were without power during the worse storm. The vast majority were back on within 24 hours. Due to the storm damage our crones replaced 485 pools nearly twice a number from the 2014 storm season. August was particularly hot this year. We hit our 2015 load peak on Saturday August 15th after temperatures hit over 114 degrees for three consecutive days. This is the first time in modern era with air-conditioning that our peak has been on a Saturday. One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5 pm that day rooftop solar on our system was producing only 38% of its capacity, supplying 75 megawatts of the 7,031 megawatt load, since rooftop solar peaks around noon. However in stark contrast utility scale solar was producing 80% of its capacity supplying 140 megawatts of the load, because most utilities scaled panels are on trackers that move with the sun.","Just a couple of hours later when our system load was still high rooftop solar production was at zero and the only solar production was coming from Solana our concentrated solar facility with thermal storage capabilities. This scenario was not unique to our peak lower day and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. Along with a robust and modern grid modernizing the rate structure is a necessary priority for which we have been advocating.","Let me provide some perspective on how our recent regulatory fillings have evolved. Our priority remains clear we want to continue the dialogue on rate design with the objective of thoughtfully evaluating these policy issues ahead of the rate case application we plan to file in June of next year. The grid access towards filling we made on April 2nd was designed to take another step in this rate transition by increasing the fixed charge to $3 per KW or about $21 per month per solar customer. In August the Arizona Corporation Commission ordered to move forward with an evidentiary hearing on the issue the exact scope and timing of that process was to be determined they has another meeting. Subsequent to that decision we saw an unprecedented display of political theatre and character attacks by the rooftop solar lobby aimed at paralyzing the commission. Given the backdrop we offered an alternative to the commission in September to forgo of the request to increase the grid access charge and exchange for a more narrow hearing on the cost to serve customers with and without solar.","In connection with this alternative we filed a summary of a recently concluded cost to service study on October 8th. This study used a methodology that has been tried, tested and validated in utility proceeding across the country using actual verifiable data. It concluded that each month APS incurs $67 to serve solar customers that those customers do not pay. This analysis credit solar customers for the measurable cost that APS avoids when a customer installs rooftop solar primarily reduce fuel costs. The commission discussed how to proceed at the open meeting last week. In the end they wanted to move forward with a single generic docket that will investigate a both the cost to service issue raised by APS and the value of solar.","The procedural calendar would be determined soon by the commission staff. Although there has been a lot of noise around this issue we believe moving forward is critical and we will continue to work with the commission and key stakeholders in this proceeding. In addition to the regulatory proceedings we are also learning about the customer and grid impacts through our solar partner rooftop solar program. Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers\u2019 energy needs. We've had a lot of interest in the process of signing up customers and installing rooftop systems.","Let me know provide an update on a few other items related to our generation portfolio. Our utility scale program AZ Sun has two 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix metro area come on line in September bringing the total program total to 170 megawatts. We will access a need for more utility scale solar through our resource planning process. We also retired Cholla unit 2 one of our core units as of October 1st in line with our announcement a year ago as part of a broader environmental plan for the Cholla site. Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering on our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next couple of years while the state addresses rate design modernization and we prepare for our rate case filling. We will remain steadfast to find solutions that benefit all of our customers.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don and welcome everybody. We had a solid third quarter as we benefitted from our continued cost management efforts and improvement in our customer sales. Today I'll discuss the details of our third quarter financial results provide an update on the Arizona economy and review our financial outlook including introducing 2016 guidance.","Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the third quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $357 million, or $2.30 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $244 million, or $2.20 per share for the third quarter of 2014.","Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight two primary drivers. Higher gross margin increased earnings by $0.28 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide. Going the other way higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.12 per share. Similar to the first half of this year the variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and cost associated with the acquisition. D&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant service.","Turning to Slide 5, I will cover a few of the key components of the net increase of $0.28 in gross margin. Higher usage by APS customers compared to the third quarter a year ago contributed $0.08 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation and distributed generation increased 2.1% in the third quarter of 2015 versus 2014. Collectively the adjustment mechanism is continuing to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.17 per share primarily the Four Corners adjuster that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners\u2019 expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier.","The effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.04 per share. This year's third quarter was warmer or more favorable than normal, while the third quarter of 2014 was milder, or less favorable compared to normal conditions. As Don mentioned, August was particularly hot this year or for the first time since we added in Arkansas -- we hit our peak on a weekend. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanism.","Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy, and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow, much like it has in the past several quarters. Job growth in the third quarter in the Phoenix Metro area remained above the national average, as they have for the past 17 quarters. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 6, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial activity, business services and consumer service sectors, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. Growth in consumer spending remains robust and expectations are improving for the housing market.","Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits could be seen in the lower panel on Slide 6. The housing market is on track to record its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself. Total permits are up more than 12% this year and notably single family permit activity is up over 40%. Permit activity in the third quarter was the highest we\u2019ve seen since the middle of 2007 and homeowners continue to report strong traffic in their sales offices. In summary, Metro Phoenix economy did grow fairly and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years as it will act on the overbilled real estate market receipts into the past.","As I have mentioned before, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 2015 is turning out to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending, and new construction. And we expect 2016 to be better than 2015. Reflecting the steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the lower half of the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share, based on the negative effects of weather through September. Year-to-date unfavorable weather through September has impacted earnings by approximately $0.08 per share versus normal conditions.","We adjusted our 2015 customer growth down slightly to 1% to 2% from 1.5% to 2.5%, although our sales outlook hasn\u2019t changed. We are introducing 2016 ongoing guidance of $3.90 to $4.10 per share which assumes the normal weather. The adjustment mechanics particularly transmission and LFCR along with modest sales growth are the key growth margin drivers.","O&M is above trend in 2016 however, non-outage O&M spending remains flat in 2016 compared to 2015 with planned possible outages representing the increase year-over-year. This includes major planned outages at Four Corners and Cholla which occur roughly over six years. Separately the new lease terms related to the Palo Verde waste plant at Unit 2 that take effect January 1, 2015 offset plan and service impact and key depreciation and amortization relatively flat year-over-year. A complete list of the factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in our slides.","Our rate based growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018. We've included our updated rate based slide in the appendix. These estimates include bonus depreciation which we\u2019re assuming will be extended for 2015 and 2016. And we continue to forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017 at the early. Lastly as Don discussed the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend last week by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.50 per share effective with the December payment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Eggers","If we get to see an end of the 2016 guidance a little bit. I guess first question is you go back from the 1.5% to 2.5% customer growth number, given that reduction in inventory and revenue mix. Is there enough things now are coming online for next year that you can actually hit that numbers you guys look out and see what\u2019s getting built?","Jim Hatfield","We do Dan. We see as we talk about home permits were up 78% in the August from the same month a year-ago. We\u2019re seeing sales up 32% in [indiscernible] so we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in that housing market.","Don Brandt","And this is Don, I refer you if you do a search on azcentral.com Web site for the Arizona Republic and just a story that appeared on the 21st of October I just take a selective quote out of that but over the past two years approximately 11,000 building permits for single-family new homes have been issued annually and he said the expectation is that the number will reach 16,000 by year's end. ","Dan Eggers","And then on the O&M cost side for next year. The cost should be flat excluding the maintenance I guess what you said if we thought about what \u201917 looks like how much of that extra maintenance gives us a way to just try and normalize that?","Don Brandt","Well don't think \u201917 will be as big as \u201916 and when we look for rate case purposes we use a average of five years or so, so that all get blended out in the rate case.","Dan Eggers","The rate case will reflect that moving that with the \u201917 numbers?","Don Brandt","Yes I mean we\u2019ll get all of it because this is a sort of peak but we\u2019ll get an average over several years as typically how they do it.","Dan Eggers","And then on the rate base forecast it includes another non depreciation act in the 18 rate case numbers now have a $400 million, what you guys do with the bonus depreciation cash and the activation company and the equity?","Don Brandt","Easy to fund CapEx, we\u2019ll still be net negative cash from our fixed income securities to fund the CapEx but it does reduce our need.","Jim Hatfield","It will reduce our need for debt financing.","Don Brandt","Yes and we take bonus depreciations will be 70% of that reduction in CapEx the rest is really moving Ocotillo out to \u201919 from \u201918.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","My math shows that -- I think my math shows that on the updated rate case forecast that 390 to 410 basically should more or less reflect the 9.5% to 10% ROE band on parent equity in 2016?","Don Brandt","That\u2019s correct, right.","Greg Gordon","So yes that\u2019s consistent with the way you thought about in the past?","Don Brandt","Correct.","Greg Gordon","So to the extend we lined up with the low-end or to high-end of that range thinking about the drivers on Page 10. Obviously this year we\u2019re more towards the lower half because weather was mild. Is it fair to assume that the midpoint of your gross margin guidance range just assumes just a normal weather?","Don Brandt","Yes it includes normal weather as well as we've those adjuster mechanisms two things you -- the other thing you'll see from the gross margin perspective we've the negative transmission adjuster in 2015 which will have a positive next year. So we get the cumulative effect of that as well.","Greg Gordon","I guess I'll step back and then ask higher level more open ended question. What are the key two or three factors that would cause you to end up at 410 versus that would cause you to end up at 390 i.e. high end of the range versus low end as you think about managing risk in \u201916?","Don Brandt","I'll take the higher end of the guidance to reflect a little higher sales growth and we\u2019re currently planning. That would be the big driver.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And you file a rate case when and how and when is the -- what's the statutory time limit for a decision?","Don Brandt","We will file June 1 of 2016 typically there was a 30 days efficiency and there is the last case we did in 10.5 we expect probably it will last goal longer with the rate design in there it's the statutory four month timeline but and Christmas around as you get days of the hearings and so on.","Greg Gordon","So the goal would be to have rates in place for the summer of \u201917 but that could slip?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. And the perfect word we will have it at July 1 what the issue in the case on rate design changes and so on that would be an optimistic scenario I think.","Greg Gordon","But isn\u2019t that the reason why you are trying to get a lot of that discussion down now and the context of these proceedings that Don just discussed.","Jim Hatfield","Exactly Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Don so do you want that the commission decided to have these hearings on the generic basis and I know you guys have pushed for them to be more specific and focused on the cost of service side and is there a concern that while they go through the generic process and then when the rate case comes you've got to go through this once again but with more specific numbers so at the end of the day how much realistically do you think this moves the ball forward given the generic measure of this discussion?","Jim Hatfield","I think it's a new advanced the ball will be dealing with the not just generic number but our numbers specifically as will be other participants and Jeff Guldner sitting here next to me I think can explain on that far a little bit.","Jeff Guldner","Sure. And I remember this they said their value has sold the dockets which was up there with obviously would be a new port on a generic the cost of service study that we did is specific with us and so one of the things you would get in the generic proceeding is still some discussion of how do you apply cost allocation factors how do you sort it out cost to service issue and result those and move forward in the rate case with the given the commissioners policy options that are available to cost from the value side and the more of that we can work through ahead of the rate case the more productive that's going to be when you get into the rate case process.","Ali Agha","And then secondly as strong was good to see the growth in weather normalized sales pick up this quarter at 2.1%. With customer growth at that 1.3% level was there anything specific to this quarter would the weather normalization not have worked perfectly the sense that your sales growth is actually greater than customer growth this quarter and normally as you said does that 50 to 100 basis point differential but you see so anything to explain why sales growth was strong than customer growth this quarter?","Jeff Guldner","I think the biggest thing Ali is sort of a weak comparison last year in the third quarter overall we have 1% sales growth year-to-date which would reflect the kind of customer growth we\u2019re seeing currently. I think a lot of that two part of our we look at the we have top solar and EDE and a lot of this been confident it's new and I think you are seeing a little more cost that consumer and those in the Phoenix marketplace.","Ali Agha","I see, okay. And then on a sort of the LTM basis based on the way you guys calculate ROE and I know that's all book value when you talk about your targets. Can you tell us what is that ROE that you want over the LTM basis?","Jeff Guldner","I haven\u2019t calculated that I'll have to look at that.","Ali Agha","Okay. But to be clear on the \u201916 outlook the range reflects at the lower end 9.5% again based on the book value calculation?","Jeff Guldner","Yes.","Ali Agha","And the high-end would be 10. Is that right?","Jeff Guldner","Yes.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Jeff Guldner","Next question? Operator, next question? Christine? We have lost connection from the host just one moment please.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry for the delay. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi guys. Can you hear me okay? Hello? Oh! Boy.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by your conference will resume momentarily.","Michael Weinstein","Oh! Boy.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, again please stand by your conference will resume momentarily. Once again please stand by your conference will resume momentarily. Gentlemen, you are reconnected. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay? Hello? I am not hearing anybody, operator.","Operator","Gentlemen you are connected.","Michael Weinstein","Yes, can you guys hear me okay?","Don Brandt","Yes.","Michael Weinstein","Oh! There we go. All right. ","Don Brandt","Okay.","Michael Weinstein","So my question has to do with the guidance for 2015. Just looking at you\u2019ve reduced the retail customer growth a little bit by 0.5% but the sales volume is remaining the same. So that would sort of indicate that there has been an improvement in terms of energy efficiency effects, I guess less of an energy efficiency effect that you see in 2015. However, when you go forward to 2016 guidance, you have an increase in the customer growth rate but still the same sales rate, so that indicates the opposite. Just wondering what\u2019s going on with energy efficiencies and asset management side?","Don Brandt","I Michael would caution you to look at any quarter and try to extract anything out of quarters, a quarter. I think we are pleasantly surprised by the sales growth year-to-date. I don\u2019t think we necessarily expect laying that into \u201916 guidance.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And also just in terms of the rate cases filing. Is it true you guys are going to have to file or you are going to have to make purchases of new generating assets before you file the case. Is that right?","Don Brandt","We have no plans to purchase generation assets other than what we are billing at occupancy or which is a self built.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, so there is no potential for anything else, fairly probably you can see now?","Don Brandt","No we have some PPAs and other things rolling off and we will go out next year for sort of all resources RFP for sometime later this -- probably later this decade, then we will see what where get at that point but we\u2019re ways off from new generation at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Chin","So with the revised rate base numbers including bonus depreciation, can you quantify out the impact of the bonus depreciation or give us some sense of how big that is relative to the prior forecast?","Don Brandt","Yes, bonus depreciation we expect to be over the two years about $250 million. We just think about that as ratably over those two years.","Brian Chin","Okay, excellent. And then with regards to the revised bonus depreciation numbers, can you give us an update on any potential needs for equity, I would assume that it reduces that since you are able to take the bonus depreciation and use that for further deployment of capital. But just revise us on what the equity financing needs are if any as we go to the next year?","Don Brandt","Yes, well, certainly the cash and bonus depreciation would minimize the need, if we need anything, we won't do anything until after we get that outcome and next rate case.","Brian Chin","Okay, great. And then lastly, just what risk do you think there could be under the more narrowly tailored generic proceeding. Is it possible that any delays or extension of that proceeding could bleed into the timing of when you file the rate case? Is there a risk of the two issues kind of melting together? I guess it\u2019s a little bit of a springboard question on earlier question I think that Ali asked?","Jeff Guldner","Brian it\u2019s Jeff I don\u2019t think it would affect the timing of the filing of the rate case. One of the issues that came up in the discussion a little while ago was we've requested that the information push to get that aside us in the April timeframe was ahead in the case. But the procedural conference is still coming out, if that leaves over that wouldn't affect the filing, once you file the case you've got a fairly lengthy litigation process.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Pleas proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","If I could go back to the rate base growth once again 2018, the 400 million decline in generation and distribution that was bonus depreciation and the delay of Ocotillo the $200 million decline in transmission is that all bonus depreciation or there a project is been delayed or canceled that I have forgotten about?","Don Brandt","No we\u2019re constantly on ongoing basis moving capital from year-to-year so there is nothing substantial in terms of delay in big projects or anything like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","Very quickly, you said you had 2.1% sales growth and that is after the impact of efficiency correct?","Don Brandt","Yes, and distributors and origin.","Paul Ridzon","What was the gross number?","Don Brandt","Little over three.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Sorry to beat a little bit of a dead horse just want to make sure I understand though. Can you walk us through from your prior disclosures to today's flight deck, the change in total expected rate basis for the forecast period and just two or three biggest drivers for that? There has been a lot 1C 2Cs and I want make sure I understand what\u2019s going on here?","Don Brandt","Well about 70% of the change roughly is the impact of bonus depreciation, and significant amount of the other is just moving Ocotillo from our end service date of \u201918 to 2019.","Michael Lapides","And the total change is $400 million or greater number?","Don Brandt","About $4 million.","Michael Lapides","Second when we think about 2017 O&M should we assume that it kind of gets back down in that year to something closer what you've guided to for 2015 or does it kind of stay at that elevated level that you're going to see next year but that you recovering you're expecting to get more recovery of that in rates?","Don Brandt","We've really not talked about any aspect of 2017 guidance Michael.","Michael Lapides","Is the 2016 increase in O&M viewed more as one time or viewed as recurring?","Don Brandt","Well I think it is -- I would call it one time, and we do generation outage every year where it is based with significant overall at both quarters at 28 in the same year I could say that that number is elevated based on what we wouldn\u2019t call it one time in any view.","Michael Lapides","And the case are going to filed in mid-\u201916 will that use a full year \u201915 test year and what large if any known and measurables would be in there?","Don Brandt","We\u2019ll try to let's see what we had on the past which is the 2015 test year and any planned service 15-18 months then post patch your plan and there will be some things that are still under construction that won\u2019t be done like the SCRs or Ocotillo allows them to recover some other mechanism.","Michael Lapides","Meaning you're expecting to potentially get Ocotillo recovered in this even though Ocotillo is now not due online until 2019?","Don Brandt","No, we would not get Ocotillo in this rate case.","Michael Lapides","So this rate case is more about just managing lag and getting the FBRs in?","Don Brandt","I think this rate case is also a lot about the rate design issue which is how we align our 70% of fixed cost with only 10% of fixed revenue and try to get more alignment between cost and revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from our Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","There was a court case in the Arizona Court of Appeal which overturned from the Arizona Corporate Commissions it was the case that didn't involve you but in theory I guess there is some that are arguing that the solar access being out of the rate case could be -- would it comply with the court of appeal ruling if you follow me. I am sure you guys are familiar with the case but whether -- is this a new point that you have withdrawn your request or is there any risk if this I know the ACC is probably going to appeal it but if this decision were upheld is there any risk to you guys would respect to what would be the impact to you guys if it was upheld let me just ask it that way?","Jeff Guldner","So Paul this is Jeff Guldner. If you are referring that water company case involving infrastructure adjustor the commission have appealed that and if so court of appeals case they start review with the Arizona supreme court and with the case that what's there was how the commission makes fair value findings which is somewhat unique that Arizona regulation how it makes their value findings in the context of adjustor mechanisms and things like that so we get them in rate cases we do typically fair value findings and provisions and almost everything that we do and so what I think folks are looking for right now is clarify some of the things that were in the court has appeals decision but it's I don\u2019t think that the supreme court is not yet excited whether to grant review and if they do I'm sure they will see mostly intelligence of state participating in that litigation.","Paul Patterson","Okay, right. But I guess what I'm wondering is if they grant review and I mean this ultimately is upheld where there would be any impact on what you guys have collected in riders or what have you with this access do you mean what would be -- let me just ask you this way with reviewing impact on you guys when you look at the Arizona court of appeal\u2019s decision what do you think the impact would be if we were up held?","Jeff Guldner","The part of the review on how you that to make fair value findings and those proceedings and I think most folks would expect the release to be prospective and so would be in highly to move forward with a different proceeding in terms of making fair value findings to which support whatever the court ultimately came out lift. We've had filed adjustors and one of the things that was mention that decision is a fuel adjustor which tracks expenses up and down fuel adjustors have been common in Arizona for decades and that opinion recognize with types of adjustors fine and as you get into different styles or different models for adjustor gets little more complicated and you guys figure out how you put the fair value piece it up. [Multiple Speakers]","Paul Patterson","So you guys have been fine with fuel adjustment that wanted to be something that would be impacted but would there be any other potential riders as something that we should think about as being potentially impacted or is it would you feel basically that you guys have the one that impacts that much. Is that what I'm getting at?","Jeff Guldner","Yes. We also look at all the riders and we look at how the fair value provisions and how we handle fair value in each of those cases and that litigated or implemented the rate cases and then if we have to make adjustments for the next rate case then we would.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Don Brandt","Thank you, Christine. Thanks for joining us today. We apologize for the connection issues we had on the call. And we look forward to seeing most of you at EVI here in a couple of weeks. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  (Operator Instructions).  ","It is now my please to introduce your host, Ms. Rebecca Hickman, Director of Investor Relations.  Thank you, Ms. Hickman, you may begin.  ","Becky Hickman","","Thank you, LaTonya.  I\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2012 earnings, recent developments operating performance.  ","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt and our CFO Jim Hatfield.  Jeff Guldner, who is our APS Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulations is also here with us.  ","Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you.  First, the slides to which we refer are available on our Investor Relations website along with our earnings release and related information.  Please note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.  Also, all of our references to per-share amounts will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.  ","It is my responsibility to advice you that this call and our slides contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements.  Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.  Our second quarter 2012 Form 10-Q was filed this morning.  Please refer to that document\u2019s forward-looking statements cautionary language as well as the MDNA section, which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.  A replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.  It is also available by telephone through August 9th.  ","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don.  ","Don Brandt","","Thank you, Becky, and thank you all for joining us today.  Since our last conference call we\u2019ve made progress in a number of key areas as we focus on our core electric utility business.  This progress includes demonstrating improvement in the regulatory environment in Arizona, maintaining operational excellence, strengthening our financial profile and positioning ourselves to benefit from economic recovery.  Jim and I will provide more information on each of these areas through our remarks today.  ","The regulatory environment in Arizona took another step forward when APS\u2019s retail rate settlement was approved on May 15th by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  The decision came 11 \u00bd months after the case was filed, the quickest resolution of a major Arizona utility rate case in recent memory.  Supported by 22 of the 24 active parties to the case, the settlement shows significant collaboration and cooperation among APS, the Arizona Corporation Commission and other parties as well as a comprehensive commitment to an expedited process.  ","The settlement contains a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders.  Details of the agreement, as well as key underlying assumptions are outlined in the appendix to our slides today.  ","The settlement prevents base rates from increasing for four years, but it is not a rate freeze.  Under the agreement, APS may file it\u2019s next general rate case on or after May 31st of 2015 for new base rates to become effective on or after July 1st of 2016.  That said, we believe a number of factors will allow us to achieve competitive financial performance during the stay-out period.  ","Aspects related to that settlement include first APS\u2019s rate adjustment mechanisms.  All of APS\u2019s rate adjustment mechanisms will continue to function throughout the stay-out period.  These mechanism include, among others, first the preferred formula rates and the related retail transmission costs adjusted, which beginning in 2013 can pass annual changes in the preferred formula rate to APS retail customers without explicit ACC approval because of the settlement.  ","Next, the renewable energy surcharge, which allows for recovery of AZ Sun plant additions and then the loss fixed cost recovery mechanisms, which was adopted in the settlement to mitigate the loss of certain fixed costs related to energy efficiency programs and distributed generation. ","And finally, an enhanced environmental improvement surcharge, which will allow APS to collect up to $5 million annually for certain carrying costs on government-mandated environmental capital projects.  Second, a carve out for the proposed Four Corners acquisition.  This provision will allow APS to seek rate adjustments as early as mid-2013 if the acquisition is consummated as we currently plan.  I will review our progress in the Four Corners plan momentarily.  ","Third, provisions to mitigate certain cost increases.  These features include deferrals of portions of higher property taxes attributable to tax rate increases and 100% pass through of fuel costs through the power supply adjuster.  ","And finally, without a time-sensitive base rate case litigation process in the next few years, we can focus fully on operational excellence, efficiency and discipline cost management.  ","This settlement builds upon a constructive framework established in the 2009 settlement and provides financial support for APS that will help us achieve Arizona\u2019s energy goals over the next four years.  ","In a related manner, on July 18th, the Arizona Commission approved the 2012 retail transmission cost adjuster increase.  The rate change, which became effective August 1st will increase annual revenues $18 million.  As I mentioned earlier, beginning next year, any future changes can automatically go into effect June 1st of each year without separate Arizona Commission action.  ","We appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with the Arizona Corporate Commission and various stakeholders to further influence the state\u2019s regulatory framework and define solutions that balance the interest of customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.  ","Our selective capital investments position us well to reliably serve the needs of APS\u2019s electricity customers while meeting goals for Arizona\u2019s sustainable energy future and environmental compliance.  ","I\u2019ll update you on two major components of our capital expenditures program; the AZ Sun program and the planned Four Corners acquisition.  Our renewable energy initiatives, particularly the AZ Sun program are important measured steps towards advancing Arizona\u2019s sustainable energy future.  Through AZ Sun, APS plans to develop and own up to 200 megawatts of utility scale photoable take solar plants in Arizona within service dates from 2011 through 2015.  ","A summary of the program is included in the appendix to today\u2019s slides.  This program is progressing on target.  To date, we have placed in commercial operation three plants with a total of 50 megawatts of solar capacity.  Construction and other development activities are currently underway at two sites for another 54 megawatts.  We plan to place 19 megawatts into service late this year and the remainder into operation in 2013.  ","Additional planning and procurement activities are in various stages for the balance of the AZ Sun program.  ","We are continuing to make progress on our plan to acquire Southern California Edison\u2019s interest in the Four Corners coal-fired plant in Northwestern New Mexico.  A summary of that plan is included in the appendix to today\u2019s slides.  The plan has substantial merits, economically, environmentally and socially.  The acquisition requires approvals from Arizona, California and Federal regulators and other government agencies, most of which have been obtained.  Noteworthy conditions that remain to be met prior to closing the transaction include negotiation of a new coal supply contract reasonably acceptable to APS and approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  We continue to target closing of the acquisition late this year.  ","In addition to strategic capital investments, excellence in day-to-day execution remains a top priority.  In the second quarter, our operating results reflected that priority.  Palo Verde operated at a 93% capacity factor, reflecting a portion of the planned refueling outage at Unit 3, which was completed on April 17th in 32 days.  The facility\u2019s second shortest refueling outage to date.  ","On the customer service side of our business, JD Power and Associates released the results of this year\u2019s residential customer survey last month.  I am pleased that APS was ranked third best among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities, continuing the recognition of our excellence and overall customer satisfaction.  ","More specific to our region, we were ranked second among the ten investor-owned utilities in the West.  ","Looking to the future, in late June I announced APS\u2019s organizational changes and promotions to strengthen our leadership team and further enhance our operations.  First, APS President, Don Robinson will continue as a Senior Advisor and join me in the newly-created Office of Procurement while handing off his day-to-day operational responsibilities.  ","Second, Mark Schiavoni has been named Executive Vice President of Operations.  In his new role, Mark has responsibility of r operations except for nuclear generation and customer service.  Mark joined APS in 2009 ,bringing strong experience running Exelon\u2019s Fossil Fleet and also at nuclear operations at two other utilities.  ","Third, Jeff Guldner was named Senior Vice President of Customers and Regulation.  This move combines our customer service organization and APS\u2019s interactions with Arizona and federal utility regulators under Jeff\u2019s guidance.  To date, Jeff has successfully headed our rate regulation efforts including leading the team that negotiated the 2009 and 2012 retail rate settlements.  ","Fourth, the Information Technology organization now reports to Jim Hatfield who will focus that important group on increased efficiency and effectiveness that will benefit our entire company.  In addition, we have hired a new Senior Executive in IT who brings impressive experience in this regard from a major financial services company.  ","Finally, there were several senior manager promotions that will realign some of our operational areas under proven leaders.  I believe these changes to the senior management team support our company-wide focus on best practices and continuous improvement.  ","Over the past several years we have often spoke about cost management.  Following the theme of continuous improvement, we will continue to look for ways to improve our cost while maintaining safety and operational excellence.  ","We have cross-functional management initiatives underway, co-headed by Jiim Hatfield and Mark Schiavoni.  Jim will discuss those initiatives momentarily.  ","To close my remarks, I\u2019m very please where our company is today and very optimistic about our future.  With the retail rate settlement behind us, we will continue achieving top-tier performance through focus on excellence and execution and continuous improvement, something our talented leadership team and workforce do exceptionally well.  ","Now, Jim will review our second quarter results, credit rating upgrades and financing plans, the outlook for this Arizona economy, our cost management initiatives and our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financial outlook through the stay-out period.  Jim? ","Jim Hatfield","","Thank you, Don.  As Don said, we continue making progress strengthening our financial profile.  Today I will discuss the following topics.  First, I will discuss our second quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year\u2019s corresponding quarter.  Second, I will review recent upgrades of our credit ratings and our financing plans.  Third, I\u2019ll provide an update on the status outlook for the Arizona economy.  Fourth, I will describe our cost management initiatives to which Don referred.  And finally, I will discuss our guidance for 2012 earnings and our financials during the stay-out.  ","Slide 6 summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter.  On a GAAP basis for this year\u2019s second quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of 122 million, or $1.11 per share compared with net income of 87 million or $0.79 per share for last year\u2019s second quarter.  Our ongoing earnings increased $0.34 per share.  For this year\u2019s second quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of 123 million or $1.12 per share versus ongoing earnings of 86 million or $0.78 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.  ","Slide 7 contains a reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP earnings per share to our ongoing earnings per share.  The amount for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate and our energy services businesses.  My remaining comments on the quarter will focus on ongoing results.  ","Slide 8, this displays the variances that grow the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share.  First, an increase in our gross margin added $0.35 per share compared with the prior year\u2019s second quarter earnings.  Several pluses and minuses comprise of positive net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.  ","Second, lower infrastructure-related costs improved earnings by $0.06 per share, reflecting both lower interest charges and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the 20-year license extension granted last year by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.  These costs reductions were partially offset by higher property taxes related to tax-rate increased.  ","Third, higher operations and maintenance expense reduced earnings by $0.05 per share.  The expense increase was largely due to stock compensation costs resulting from improvements in the company\u2019s stock price.  This O&M variance excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard, or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulator programs all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under the adjustment mechanisms.  ","Fourth, the net impact of miscellaneous other items decreased earnings by $0.02 per share.  Our second quarter 2012 earnings benefited $0.03 per share because of the Arizona Sun program and plans that were placed in service late last year and early this year.  This net variance is reflected in various line items on the income statement.  ","Turning to Slide 9, and the components of the net increase in our gross margins, total gross margin increased $0.35 per share compared with last year\u2019s second quarter.  The main components of that increase were as follows:  The effect of weather variations improved earnings by $0.23 per share.  This year\u2019s second quarter was hotter than normal while the 2011 second quarter was abnormally mild.  This year, residents of cooling degree days were 14% higher than normal and 51% over the comparable quarter a year ago.  The retail transmission cost adjusted rate increase that became effective July 1st of 2011 improved earnings by $0.05 per share.  Lower fuel and purchased power costs and higher mark-to-market valuations of APS\u2019s fuel hedges net of related PCA deferrals improved earnings by $0.04.  ","The net effect of miscellaneous items improved our gross margin by $0.04 per share.  Lower weather normalized retail kilowatt hours sales decreased our earnings by $0.01 per share.  This variance reflects the effects of customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives, which were essentially offset by customer growth of 0.9% over year-ago levels.  ","Slide 10 displays our investment-grade credit ratings.  In May after approval of the retail rate settlement, both Moody\u2019s and Fitch rate Pinnacle West and APS long-term credit ratings up one notch including an upgrade of APS\u2019s senior unsecured debt to Baa1 and BBB+ respectively.  We are pleased the rating industry recognizes constructive conservatory outcome and are improving financial performance.  ","Regarding our planned financing activity, we expect to issue debt upon the acquisition of SoCal Edison\u2019s interest in Four Corners later this year if the transaction is consummated.  With respect to potential equity issuances, [inaudible] successful completion of the retail rate settlement, we currently project that we will not need to raise additional common equity capital until 2014 at the earliest.  The timing of any amount \u2013 the timing and amount of any issuance would facilitate balancing of APS\u2019s capital structure and provide support for the company\u2019s credit metrics.  ","Turing to Slide 11 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy.  Economic growth in Arizona continues to improve in the second quarter although the growth remains modest as has been the case for the last several quarters.  ","As shown on Slide 11, growth in non-farm jobs continue to show modest gains.  In particular, the rate of overall job growth was \u2013 has held up well for over a year and virtually all the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth.  The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting gradual growth and incomes and consumer spending and has pushed the unemployment rate down parallel with national trends.  However, as I have discussed on previous calls, significant headwinds remain to be overcome before we can expect the Arizona economy to begin growing robustly.  While consumer spending is above last year\u2019s levels, the rate of growth has declined I recent months, unemployment remains persistently high and the amount of unoccupied housing continues to restrain the new home construction market. ","On Slide 11, you can see our estimates of the amount of excess housing that presently exists in our service territory and metro Phoenix.  The good news is that the Phoenix economy has absorbed about 10,000 vacant homes and apartments since the peak of [inaudible] in 2009.  We believe we are on a page to further reduce those vacancies by the end of next year to a level of our existing home resale price will be more supportive of new home construction.  ","On Slide 12, you can see the recent trends in Metro Phoenix home prices as reflected in [inaudible] repeat sales index.  In recent months we have seen a slight rebound in pricing as the number of foreclosure sales have declined.  While we view this as a positive trend, we also recognize that the single-family retail pricing has just recently returned to levels that we saw in early 2010, just past the peak of the recession.  More importantly, these price levels are consist with the market for homes at the end of 2001 or 11 years ago.  ","This slide also shows that similar conditions are present in the commercial real estate market.  As you can see on the slide, vacant rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels but remain quite high.  Again, we view this as a positive trend but believe that to the extent of vacant space in these markets means that the recovery for new office and retail construction will likely lag that for new homes.  ","Reflecting this modest steady improvement in economic conditions, APS\u2019s customer base grew 0.9% in this year\u2019s second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago and represents the strongest growth we\u2019ve seen in three years.  ","Over the long term, we believe the fundamentals that have been important to Arizona\u2019s growth are still here and that our growth rate and customers will return to more typical levels.  Looking at the next several years, we see current \u2013 we currently expect the annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2012 to 2015 with growth rates higher at the end of the period than in the near term for reasons I just discussed.  ","Additionally, we expect our average annual weather normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat in 2012 to 2015 primarily due to customer conservation and energy efficiency and distributed renewable generation initiatives offsetting the modest recovery in the economy.  ","Turing to Slide 13 and our cost management initiatives.  We are building on the cost management foundation with solid achievements in recent years.  As this slide shows, we have been able to hold O&M essentially flat since 2008.  In preparation for the recently settled rate case, we reduced capital and operational spending by more than 30 million per year through several efforts such as our enterprise-wide supply chain initiative.  However, we are cognizant that we cannot let cost escalate unchecked as customer growth and sales improve.  Our goal is to keep O&M growth in line with retail sales growth.  However, we will not sacrifice safety or operational excellence in order to do so.  ","To achieve continuous improvement, we\u2019re challenging employees throughout the company to find ways to be more efficient and effective in their jobs.  Additionally, we have a number of corporate initiatives.  A company-wide cross-functional initiative underway to benchmark and evaluate various activities.  Recently we have identified and eliminated some duplication of efforts. For example, we have combined financial business analyst groups in my organization by consolidating previously these centralized functions, we were able to create significant synergies.  Further, progress is being made on cross-functional processes which will also create significant synergies.  ","Workforce attrition will provide opportunity to capitalize on efficiencies without the need for large layoffs.  We estimate that more than 220 will leave the company in each of the next 10 years due in large part to retirements as the baby boomers transition to the next phase of their lives.  Through process improvements, we believe that we will be able to avoid replacing a significant number of those employees.  To minimize a loss of key knowledge as our workforce changes, we are implementing programs to enhance knowledge transfer and ensure consistency and documentation of processes.  ","Finally, I will discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook.  As shown on Slide 14, we currently expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2012 will be in the range of 3.35 to 3.50 per share.  Using the middle of the range, this reflects an improvement of approximately 15% over 2011 ongoing in earnings per share.  ","The key factors and assumptions that underpin our guidance are listed on Slide 16 in the appendix to today\u2019s slide.  ","Looking ahead through the base rate stay-out period, the company\u2019s goal is to achieve an annual consolidated rate of return, average common equity of at least 9.5% on average  through 2015 as shown on Slide 14.  This represents another step change in returns, demonstrating the benefit to shareholders from our rate settlement.  This expectation reflects the financial support provided by the retail rate settlement and other factors and assumptions outlined in Slide 17 and 18.  ","In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate spend to average around $1.1 billion through 2015.  However, approximately 45% will be addressed by the rate mechanisms Don alluded to and approximately 35% will be covered by depreciation cash flow.  This leaves minimal annual spend exposed to regulatory lag.  ","In closing, we are confident in achieving our financial objectives through the stay-out period.  The gross margin mechanisms contained in the retail rate settlement coupled with our demonstrated cost management ability give us this confidence.  ","Additionally, but not assumed in our outlook, an accelerated return to our economic growth provide outside out outlook.  ","This concludes our prepared remarks.  Operator, we would be pleased to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you.  (Operator instructions).  Our first question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group, please proceed with your question.  ","Bill Episelli - ISI Group","","Hi, good morning, it\u2019s actually Bill Episelli.","Don Brandt","","Hey, Bill.","Bill Episelli - ISI Group","","Hey, just a question on the, you know, the outlook going out to \u201915, I know you guys have given the guidance here of rate base growth, from about 6% and off of an 11 base, and you know, you\u2019re targeting the average ROE of 9.5% - I mean, thinking not earning is how they relate to those metrics, and I know that you\u2019re good about talking about, you know, issuing equity in \u201914, so, there will it be some impact from that, but I was just wondering if you could give additional thoughts on how the key pieces of earnings as it relates to base rate growth, and then the \u2013 you know, other pieces that you \u2013 you mentioned there at the end about the acceleration in the economy, all the things that could drive the 9.5% higher off of the targeted base.","Jim Hatfield","","Well, you know, again, and that 6% rate base [inaudible] \u2013 you do have equity in \u201914, you do have a little bit of regulatory lag, all though a lot of that has been mitigated, and we\u2019re assuming, you know, cost control.  If all those things come true, and the economy recovers, about a 1% customer increase equals 10 million in after tax earnings on average.  Since we\u2019re assuming no sales growth over the 2015, we don\u2019t think there is a lot of downside in the growth number, and so that sort of gives you a [inaudible] of [inaudible] what may happen if we do see some acceleration.  ","Bill Episelli - ISI Group","Okay, great, and then on the sales growth outlook, you know, could you maybe desegregate the 2.5% in terms of how it\u2019s getting offset through just to regeneration in energy efficiency?","Jim Hatfield","","No, but since they break down we do \u2013 we assume compliance on energy efficiency which goes up every year, and then \u2013 and then we have the renewable energy standard by \u201915 and we do know that from a deployment perspective, we\u2019re slightly ahead of target \u2013 we can track those pretty good.  And so, we feel that we have those two, and we do have just some customer conservation in there due to continued lack of direction of the long term economy.  ","Bill Episelli - ISI Group","Okay, and then just lastly \u2013 so, if we think about growth, if it were to say they hit 3% or 3.5% at some point over the life of the deal, is that \u2013 so, that\u2019s netting out the 2.5% that you\u2019re targeting, so that\u2019s how you get your sort of 1% of additional growth, is that how we think about it?","Jim Hatfield","","No, my one percent of additional growth is just the same as additional 1% - customers came out of the system, normally you see to have gained about 10 million after tax earning. ","Bill Episelli - ISI Group","Oh, okay.  Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman and Sachs, please proceed with your question.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hi, thank you \u2013 so, now that we\u2019re through the rate case here, as you said Jim, cost control is so key, so, do you believe that you can keep going them flat throughout the stay out period assuming that retail sales are flat, or is that more of an aspirational target?","Jim Hatfield","","It\u2019s both aspirational, but I have highly great confidence in our ability to do that.  We \u2013 you know, the good news for me from a cost perspective, is \u2013 you know, what we\u2019re trying to accomplish from the cost side is not just coming from the CFO \u2013 I have a good partner and [inaudible] loaning from the off side, and together we are pretty aligned, and pretty much seeing the same path going forward.  So, I\u2019m pretty confident now.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got it, [inaudible], and also with a rate base \u2013 your rate base behind us, dividend growth comes into focus, you had that dividend around $2.10 for a long time, how are you think about the potential for dividend growth now?","Jim Hatfield","","You know, Neil, now that I think we have a runway out through \u201915, I would expect, you know, the board will look at the dividend policy later this year.   ","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, and guidance\u2026","Jim Hatfield","","Let me add to that, traditionally, our board\u2019s a little bit the dividend level \u2013 the annualize dividend level at their October meeting, and I think this year would be consistent with that, the board will take a look at it, and we\u2019ve accomplished a lot in the last few years in rebuilding our balance sheet, and getting our earnings up to a competitive level, and I think those are all positive aspects going into the fall, and the dividend decision.  ","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay, and then when do you intend to issue 2013 guidance?","Jim Hatfield","","Right now we\u2019re attentatively planning to do it on our analyst day, November 9th.","Neil Mehta \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Perfect, thank you, thank you very much.","Jim Hatfield","","You\u2019re welcome, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup, please proceed with your question.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","","Good morning everyone.","Jim Hatfield","","Good morning, Shar.","har Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","","Can you just remind us with the current regional haze rules that\u2019s coming about if your cap x outlook includes a state plan, or a federal implemented plan?","Jim Hatfield","","Currently, in terms of us, the regional haze rule advise to all [inaudible] four corners, Navaho, and [inaudible] three and four.  The state proposed [inaudible] would be to install low nox burners in over fired air.  All thought the EPA recently rejected that, and calling for more stringent, expensive FCRs, and what [inaudible] determined schedule for November of this year.  The EPA proposed to burn it for [inaudible] be the insulation on FCRs on units four and five, it\u2019s been in the transaction close and we don\u2019t have a bared ruling from the EPA on Navaho at this time.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Is there a status on how much your cap x can increase assuming that the federal implemented plan gets inacted?","Jim Hatfield","","Excuse me?","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Is there a status on how much you cap x could increase assuming a federal implemented plan gets inacted?","Jim Hatfield","","Yes, really it effects [inaudible] at this point, and we don\u2019t have \u2013 we have the state plan in there, I think, it\u2019s about 182 million if we had to implement the rest of the EPA.","Don Brandt","","Yes, FCRs on units two and three at [inaudible] would cost us about 182 million in additional CapEx.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, perfect, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust, please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Thank you, good morning.  ","Jim Hatfield","","Hey, Ali.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","","To be clear, to be guidance that you have for 2012 range, the 9.5% [inaudible], should we assume that associate with the midpoint of that guidance, or do you think about [inaudible] for 2012?","Jim Hatfield","","I think that the 9.5 really relates to \u201913 through \u201915, if you think about how we have that rate increase in the second half of the year, and we have the mechanisms from the nine settlement in the first half of the year, but \u2013 so, I would suspect slightly to exceed the 9.5 in 2012 with a sort of a hybrid year.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","I see, okay.  And secondly, also, to be clear, if I had [inaudible] the cap x that you have planned to have right now, if I use [inaudible] does that translate into a 5% annual rate based growth?  Is it 5 or 6?","Jim Hatfield","","Well, [inaudible] is from 2011.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Right, so, it would be\u2026","Jim Hatfield","","I have \u2013 I even calculated from \u201912.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay, I thought in one of your slides that I may have seen 5%, and I may be wrong there.","Jim Hatfield","","It would decelerate because you have four corners in 2012, which is a large piece of that component in \u201912.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Right, right.  Okay, and thirdly on the equity issue that said that you don\u2019t see before 2014, should we think of it really, you know, timing issue you needed for your next rate case, or should we think of end of \u201914, or maybe not there, and from a size perspective for the last couple of [inaudible] actions, be a good proxy of the size that we should be thinking about?","Jim Hatfield","","No proxy for size at this point, and you know, it wouldn\u2019t be until \u201914 at the earliest and we would have to get to \u201914 to make a decision as to what we are going to do at that point.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Understood, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","You mentioned the ongoing coal contract at Four Corners as the acquisition will be contingent on that. Could you just update us on the timeline there and what are the major items of discussion?","Don Brandt","","We expect to get the transaction closed by the end of the year, say around the first of December, and we\u2019re in active negotiations on the coal supply contract. Like with most contracts it involves price.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, and then just to clarify on the 9.5% target ROE. Is that utility earned ROE, or is that the consolidated ROE, which would include the $0.05 of parent track.","Don Brandt"," ","Consolidated.","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Hi, Good Morning guys.  Congratulations on the very constructive rate outcome and change in (inaudible)","Don Brandt","Thank you.","Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse","","I guess I have a little bit more, just kind of I guess on the (inaudible) drivers.  So I guess the base approach that I should use is that, given that you expect 6% annual rate based growth, and a flat 9.5% earned ROE, that your base EPS growth should be 6%, and then that will likely be a little bit bigger in 2012, \u201813\u2019 and \u201914 due to the rate increase in the four quarters, and that it could be, it could start to taper off towards the backend a little bit due to the equity delusion in 2014 sometime?","Jim Hatfield","","Brian, with 6% rate based growth, it would be hard for me to see a path of 6% range growth, whether normalized. Because you do have the delusion at some point assumed throughout to stay out, and you do, and we\u2019ll continue to have some regulatory lag.  So, I would say it\u2019s going to be south of that.","Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, should it follow the path of it being EPS growth being a little bit stronger in \u201912, \u201913 and \u201914? And then kind of I guess taper off towards the backend due to that equity delusion?","Jim Hatfield","If you assume equity delusion in the backend, yes that would be the case due to the delusion.","Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then Jim, does your 2014 equity comment preclude you from doing like a forward sale or something like that on the back of the project (inaudible) later this year?","Jim Hatfield","We would not be precluded from doing anything at this point, so.","","Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay. Lastly I guess, can you put some collar around your dividend policy going forward during the four year rate sale?","Don Brandt","Well, Kevin I think where we\u2019re at now is pretty close to the conclusion of rebuilding (1) the company\u2019s balance sheet. Significantly adding some consistency, to the Arizona Regulatory Environment, both consistency and creditability with the expeditious resolution of the last settlement and the settlement before that, that laid really the ground work going forward.  You just talked to Jim about earnings growth, and earning at a minimum 9.5% ROE going forward, and that kind of lays the groundwork.  (2)  The next step is we have had the dividend frozen for a number of years at the current level.  That\u2019s something again that the board is going to address at our October board meeting in all likelihood. And I think you\u2019ll see a dividend path forward coming out this fall.","Kevin Cole \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Again, congrats.","Don Brandt","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jim (von Reesman) \u2013 UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Jim (von Reesman) \u2013 UBS ","","Good Morning Arizona.","Don Brandt"," ","Hey, Jim how are you?","Jim (von Reesman) \u2013 UBS ","Good, yourself","","Don Brandt","","Great.","Jim (von Reesman) \u2013 UBS ","Hey, a couple of questions. You know this transportation highway bill, whatever you want to call it, that Congress passed. Does that have any cash flow impact for you guys?","","Don Brandt","","Well it could. Our minimum funding requirements would drop under the highway bill, as we understand the perimeters right now. The result of dropping our funding, Jim going forward, is it drives our expense up.  And so at this point with the liquidity we have, and a plan in place, we\u2019re still planning on funding at pre-highway bill levels, which is somewhere in the $150 -$160 area \u201913 through \u201915.","Jim (von Reesman) \u2013 UBS ","Okay, just kind of keeping along this whole cash flow things for a second. Can you talk a little bit about, or broadly speaking \u201913 to\u201915, what your coverage metrics, what you want them to look like, or your capital structure targets.  And then maybe what the impacts of the absence of bonus depreciation starting next year is going to have cash flow?","Don Brandt","","Well a couple of thing on the Jim, obviously are, when we try to reach that at test year we\u2019re very happy with our 53 -54 equity ratio, for making purposes that obviously will fluctuate throughout the time frame, just based on the fact that we\u2019re not in a test year.","Our coverage metrics are fine. We will realize that a lot of the bonus depreciation for tax purposes next year as well, because we have a tax law set, you know, we have to carry forward. ","So, we\u2019re very pleased with cash flow, liquidity, and our balance sheet at this point. And it\u2019s not going to deteriorate throughout the sale period.","Jim (von Reesman) \u2013 UBS ","Okay, no worries, thanks.","Operator","","Once again ladies and gentleman, to ask a question please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad.","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman \u2013 Morningstar.  Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman \u2013 Morningstar","","All right, thank you. Assuming the Four Corners acquisition is consummated, would the FCR installation for those two units come under the EIS, or do you have to wait till the next rate case?","Don Brandt","They would come under the EIS once we started putting them into on the units, and of course you\u2019d like to try a time load, so you can maximize that.  I\u2019ll just point out that that EIS is capped about a roughly a $5 million revenue requirement on an annual basis.  So, it won\u2019t be one for one recovery, but of course every little bit helps.","Charles Fishman \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, that was it, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Good morning and congratulations on the continuance improvements.","Don Brandt","","Good Morning Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Just to revisit customer growth, and I apologize if I missed this. One percent customer growth in 2012 projected to double through the 2015 timeframe. I\u2019m just wondering what actually draws that?  Is it the economy, and if it is, what sort of the economic forecast that you guys have in that?","Don Brandt","Yes, you\u2019re right, it sort of accelerates throughout through \u201915.  What really drives that Paul, is we don\u2019t see the absorption of available homes are getting to a level until around the end of next year, early \u201914 where you\u2019ll see the construction side will start again.  And of course, when construction cycles starts, that leads to retail sales which leads to other jobs, which you know has a sort of snowballing affect. So, it\u2019s just the natural digging out of the inventory that we have in Phoenix. ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates"," ","So, there\u2019s still a lot of migration into Arizona, it\u2019s just right now absorbing the home building is being delayed as a result. Is that how we should think about it?","Don Brandt","Yes. I mean we had at the peak somewhere around 35,000 available homes and apartments, and we\u2019ve absorbed about 10,000 roughly of those. And until you get the construction cycle moving, that will be the driver, and it\u2019s going to take some time.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay. And then just in terms of that growth rate which seems to accelerate, looks like you guys still, you know, the APS energy efficiency advantage here, I mean, you guys are still, you know, projection that you are going to be able to keep it flat throughout that period. Or should we think that that\u2019s going to be accelerating as well, that growth rate. I mean, it\u2019s impressive how you guys have been able to keep sales growth flat with the energy efficiency efforts.  I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about that over time?","Jim Hatfield","","I think Paul, we have increasing standards each year going forward, so you\u2019re going to see acceleration of those programs. And we believe it\u2019s going to offset the increase in customer growth through that timeframe.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Very impressive, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Eli (inaudible) -  Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shelton \u2013","","Good Morning guys, it\u2019s Chris Shelton, how are you?","Jim Hatfield","","Hey, Chris.","Chris Shelton \u2013","  ","Quick clarification, I just want to see the, so the 6% rate base growth is off of 2011.

Final question. I know the equity layer at the utility will king of vary as we go through the years and (inaudible) you know, in time for the next case.  What equity layer rage I guess do you see over the period?","Jim Hatfield","","You know Chris, it stays above 50% throughout that timeframe.

The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website. Along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our third quarter 2019 Form 10-Q was filed this morning, please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 14.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thank you, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided significantly below average revenue in the second quarter and was mild in the third quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details of our third quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on current regulatory and operational developments.","The 2019 summer season was successfully completed by focusing on our core priorities, delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy. June began with relatively mild temperatures, which for resource planning meant heavy imports from California renewables and watching for over generation during the midday hours, while July and August had 23 days over 110 degrees. It was the driest summer in the last 20 years, with less than one inch of rain between June and the end of September.","The lack of humidity can impact peak demand, which was 7,270 megawatts in 2019, following 200 megawatts short of the 2018 peak. Our evaluation of the McMicken substation battery storage facility equipment failure is ongoing. The fire occurred on one rack containing 14 battery modules. The rack that experienced the fire has been disassembled and was shipped to a forensic lab in Michigan where it's undergoing a series of tests. While we remain committed to our investments in energy storage, it's imperative that we move forward safely. We expect that more specifics on what a safer path forward looks like shouldn't be available by the end of this year or early 2020.","Turning to our regulatory updates. We filed a rate case on October 31, 2019. Key components of the filing include a 10.15% return on equity, a 1% return on the fair value increment, 54.7% equity layer and 12 months of posttest year plant. We've requested an increase in annual revenue of $184 million. This includes $73 million for the four corners selective catalytic reduction project that is the subject of a separate ACC proceeding. We proposed that new rates go into effect on December 1, 2020. The rate case filing highlights technology-driven programs, we're already pursuing on behalf of our customers, including our participation in the western energy imbalance market. Our participation in this market not only provides greater ability to manage our grid and the intermittent resources in our service territory, it also provides access to the increasing availability of negative-priced energy.","Our customers have realized gross savings of over $120 million during the three years, EPS a member of EIM. In further support of our customers, our filing contains three proposals to benefit the most vulnerable. We propose increasing funding for our Crisis Bill Assistance program from $1.25 million to $2.5 million annually, expanding the ways in which customers may enroll in our limited income, bill discount program and deferring costs for our bill discount program, allowing for expanded program growth.","We're also responding to customers by proposing a flat bill pilot program. This subscription rate will offer customers an option to be billed the same amount each month similar to an unlimited use cell phone plan. Programs like this demonstrate our commitment to increase customer choice and provide options that fit our customers' lifestyles.","In addition, we have heard the commission's request for transparency in our financial status on a more frequent basis. In response, we have proposed an alternative formula rate concept for the commission's consideration. The benefits of a formula rate in addition to the annual transparency and accountability include annual earnings calibration, annual ACC approval, a reduction in the need for adjustor mechanisms and rate gradualism for customers. The commission has a number of other open dockets, including final disconnection, rules and retail choice. We anticipate another retail competition workshop may be scheduled in December or in early 2020 to continue evaluating the complexities of retail choice.","In the disconnection rules docket, commission staff has proposed draft rules for the commissioners to consider. We do not know the timing or next steps in this docket. On October 29, the commission approved our third tax expense adjustor mechanism filing, refunding, another $103 million to customers. Including this third filing refunds to our retail customers from Federal Tax Reform will total $547 million by the end of 2020, allowing us to continue investing in the system, while keeping bills affordable.","Earlier this year, I announced my retirement date of November 15. While I look forward to what's ahead, I can't say enough about the immense pride I have in the performance of this company over my tenure. The strength of our team and the dedication of our people drive our success, and I have no doubt that success will continue under Jeff's leadership.","I wish you all the best, and I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. We earned $3.77 per share in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $2.80 per share in the third quarter of 2018. A reconciliation of the earnings drivers can be found on Slide 3 of the materials. Given the impact year-to-date from below normal weather, we would not expect to hit the lower end of the $4.75 to $4.95, 2019 guidance range.","As illustrated on Slide 26, through the end of the third quarter of 2019, weather decreased gross margin, a total of $24 million or $0.16 per share. October sales are also below expectations due, in part, to another month of mild weather. For the full year 2019, we expect a negative weather impact will be partially offset by lower O&M and the approval of the TEAM 3 refund.","As we look ahead to 2020, we will continue to enhance our customer and shareholder value through our cost management discipline. We have a long track record of managing our costs and continuous improvement. The customer affordability effort challenges our employees to find ways to work better and more efficiently challenged bureaucracy and eliminate unnecessary work in our daily operations, all of which are based on lean principles.","Just working harder will not get us there. We must find different general rates to get the job done and cost savings will result. Although we are in the early stages of the customer affordability initiative, we have identified $20 million of potential O&M savings that will serve as a positive driver in 2020. We are introducing 2020 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Given the rate case outcome is unlikely to materially impact 2020 earnings. There are no assumptions regarding a rate case outcome incorporated into the guidance range.","Positive drivers for 2020 include lower O&M, sales growth, higher transmission revenue and the Ocotillo deferral. We expect our O&M will decrease approximately $25 million from 2019 to 2020. The main drivers for lower O&M include the closure of the Navajo Generating Station, reductions from our customer affordability initiative and lower planned outage expense. We expect these drivers will be partially offset by an increase in expense associated with revised disconnect policies, higher depreciation and amortization, higher property taxes, higher interest expense and lower AFUDC.","We currently estimate that the disconnection moratorium and revised policies could result in a decrease of approximately $20 million to $30 million of pretax income in 2020, depending upon certain assumptions, including customer behavior. The estimated effective tax rate of 14% for 2020 reflects benefits associated with the amortization of $45 million in excess deferred taxes associated with the TEAM 2 and TEAM 3 filings. These effective tax rate benefits are substantially offset by the refunds provided to customers as part of the team filings.","Going forward, we will need a modest amount of equity to support the growth in clean energy investments our customers want, while supporting our strong equity layer. We will continue to evaluate our equity needs, including the form and timing of any issuance as our capital expenditure plans progress. We expect to issue $300 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This may include a portion of our funding needs for the refinancing of the APS $250 million, 2.2% senior notes, which mature in January 2020.","We also expect to issue up to $1 billion of term debt at APS and $450 million at Pinnacle West during 2020. Overall, liquidity remains strong. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 and 2020 guidance can be found on Slides 5 through 7. In addition to our cost management, we stand to benefit from organic growth in our service territory as a result of economic development. According to the Arizona Technology Council's quarterly impact report, Arizona's tech sector is growing at a rate 40% faster than the U.S. overall. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average.","Through August of 2019, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% as compared to 1.6% for the entire U.S. Construction employment in Metro Phoenix increased by 10.8% and manufacturing employment increased by 5%. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. In 2019, we expect a total of 13,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018, driven by single-family permits. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 2.1% in the third quarter of 2019. So we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed.","In closing, our long-term rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7%, and we expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2020. As illustrated on Slide 8, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. When we reach the end of our rate case cycle as we will in 2020 , regulatory lag can slow our earnings growth. However, over the long term, the opportunity to partner with stakeholders across Arizona to build a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.","And this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","When I look at the slides on \u2013 I'll continue on the Four Corners SCRs, and I think there's a slide in here that shows about $0.07 of EPS reduction full year 2019 impact from Four Corners. It looks like perhaps the two of those things combined in 2020 would be probably about a $0.15 hit. Is that \u2013 would it be fair to say that, that $0.15 would be restored once the rate case is finished in 2021.","Jim Hatfield","That would be the math of the combined two. We can't predict the optimal rate case, obviously, but those are the two big components of our rate ask.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And do you have kind of any thoughts right now on what kinds of equity issuances you might do for the modest equity that you said you might need going forward? And what the timing of that might be? Is it a 2020 issue or a 2021 issue?","Jim Hatfield","I don\u2019t have any thoughts currently, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. Maybe starting with the economic data that you guys were pointing out, it seems like there is \u2013 continues to be a lot of growth in various industries in the commercial\/industrial side. Despite that, you \u2013 now you\u2019re forecasting the weather-normalized load growth for 2021 to be about 50 basis points lower than your prior forecast? Could you just talk a little bit about the usage trends that you\u2019re seeing in the various customer classes?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. So if I look at the \u2013 residential continues to be strong. The economy is doing very well overall, virtually all sectors. For stronger growth in the C&I customer base is being dominated by warehousing and logistics. Currently, retail stores and malls still appear to be weak, which is in line with national trends. So from an energy-use perspective, the rapid growth in warehousing and logistics sector appears to be reducing average use per customer in the C&I area, still showing growth but a little weaker than we expected.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And then maybe switching to the rate case. I think in the past couple of months, there\u2019s been conversations about the treatment of the fair value increment of the rate base. And I just \u2013 I\u2019m not as familiar with that in terms of \u2013 is that a PSC statute, is that a legislative item? Or is that just something that the ACC has discretion on whether to approve an increment or not?","Jeff Guldner","Hey, Insoo, it\u2019s Jeff. That\u2019s actually part of the Arizona constitution and so the state is adopted in the constitution in 1912, a fair value requirement. So it\u2019s somewhat unique to Arizona. And over the years, it\u2019s been addressed in a variety of different rate cases, not all of them, ours. And it really started to have more of a role, probably five or six years ago, a lot of rate case context. And so the commission has been applying it and discussing how to apply the fair value standard since that time. This was a workshop on it a few weeks ago. And so there\u2019s some moving parts on it. I don\u2019t know exactly how that\u2019s going to play out.","Insoo Kim","Okay. But the constitution would state that the PSC would apply some sort of fair value increment to rates?","Jeff Guldner","Yes.","Insoo Kim","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, team. So obviously, continue to cut costs in the 2020 versus 2019. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about earned returns and narrowing the gap versus authorized? And I\u2019m really trying to get at how you think about sort of a post rate case outcome, and continuing to focus on narrowing that gap, especially in the eventuality of any change in authorized returns here. And then maybe if I could follow-up on Insoo\u2019s question just in brief. How do you think about the delta in ask here on the fair value piece just given some of the commentary in other cases between staff?","Jim Hatfield","So Julien, I think in terms of narrow on the regulatory lag, we have some mechanisms now that work well from a rate gradualism perspective. Obviously, as an alternative in the case, we proposed formula rates would just be an annual filing, much like we do at FERC, which we would need adjusters. And those will be the sort of two things we\u2019d look at in terms of getting faster recovery in terms of the fair value.","Don Brandt","Yes. Obviously, on the fair value, Julian, each case is a little bit different. So if you watch right now in the Tucson Electric case, they had requested a 1.25% fair value increment and the staff testimony at fall was a little less than 0.5% increment. There\u2019ve been other cases before where the company \u2013 water company didn\u2019t get a fair value increment. But again, that\u2019s going to be in the context of that specific case. And so it is an area that\u2019s \u2013 the policy is evolving or at least being discussed. But it\u2019s just a part of the Arizona regulatory framework.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right. Fair enough. But with respect to earned returns, I mean, obviously, O&M coming down. I mean the broad framework, I think you guys have historically talked about is about a 9.5% earned return or better. I suppose, still broadly, even in going to the future, sticking to that mantra, is there no ability to kind of narrow that range?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I mean based on where we are now, obviously, beyond the right case outcome, we can\u2019t really focus or really say what that is because we don\u2019t \u2013 we can\u2019t predict the outcome.","Jeff Guldner","But we do try to get the delta between \u2013 you\u2019re always going to have some structural disallowances, right? And so you do try to narrow the delta between the earned and the authorized return. And so that obviously will continue to be a focus for us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then CapEx wise. I know it\u2019s a small bump in 2020. But how do you think about any potential to shift that around, obviously, I suppose it was earlier here, you made a more meaningful shift. Given the pendency of the case, we shouldn\u2019t be expecting anything more meaningful until the termination of that case, right? Or resolution, rather?","Jim Hatfield","Yes, I think as we\u2019re now almost on 2020, that\u2019s \u2013 we have a good plan for 2020 and 2021, and I wouldn\u2019t expect any big changes currently.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right. Fair enough, guys. I leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, First, hey Don, congratulations on the retirement. You\u2019ve served the customers of your utility in Arizona very, very well over your tenure and also put up good returns for shareholders, so well deserved.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Greg. I appreciate it, especially coming from you.","Greg Gordon","The \u2013 I\u2019ve been multitasking here. So I appreciate and apologize if I missed this, but when looking at the adjusted gross margin targets for 2019 and 2020, obviously, they came down a lot for 2019 and the 2020 adjusted gross margin target is actually below where you thought you were initially going to come in, in 2019. Your expectations for weather-normalized retail electric sales volume are lower for this year, but the same for next year. Can you just go through what you\u2019ve recalibrated there? And whether it\u2019s just a 2019 issue or there\u2019s also some uncertainty around where you think you\u2019ll end in 2020 versus initial expectations in 2019?","Jim Hatfield","Well, in a response to an earlier question, we talked about how in the C&I sector due to the customer mix that we\u2019re \u2013 we have now versus historically, we\u2019re seeing less huge per customer, that\u2019s really around warehousing logistics. And going forward, we have a slide with some of the other data centers and other things, which are highly uncertain in terms of timing and exact amounts. So I think we\u2019re just recalibrating to what we\u2019re seeing actually in the marketplace.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then back on Michael Weinstein\u2019s question. You did \u2013 thank you for putting a slide in the appendix on the impact this year of not getting the step increase. I think you annualized that at $0.07. Is it \u2013 will it annualize at a larger number in 2020 before it all gets worked out in the rate case, is that right?","Jim Hatfield","No, that\u2019s really the delta between \u2013 you\u2019re having it in as rates and earning an equity return versus just a debt return. And that project will continue to be deferred. There\u2019s a \u2013 they\u2019re concurrent ALJ rule out there for that, and that\u2019s not going to change. The impact will be \u2013 it\u2019s a non-cash return. So you\u2019re always \u2013 you\u2019re not getting your cash return, but it\u2019s fairly minimal over a one-year time frame.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you, guys. Have a great afternoon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you, good morning. First question, just to clarify, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re going to be below the low end of your guidance for this year, can you give us some calibration of how much lower we should be thinking about just as we think about finishing this year off?","Jim Hatfield","We\u2019ll be below $475 million. That\u2019s about as a finest point I can put on at the moment.","Ali Agha","Okay, Jim. I mean can you \u2013 I know you manage all your target towards the 9.5% or higher earned return. Any range or numbers we should think about for 2019, when the dust settles?","Jim Hatfield","No.","Ali Agha","Okay. Then my second question, I think in your comments, you mentioned in 2020, these revised disconnect policies will hurt you by about $20 million to $30 million. One, I wanted to confirm I heard that right? And two, does that impact continue in future years as well?","Jim Hatfield","Well, you heard it correctly, the impact based on various assumptions. The reality is we don\u2019t have a policy at this point going forward. So anything beyond the assumption of the number would be a pure guess at this point. And at some point in the future, those will ultimately be reflected in rates whenever we end up.","Ali Agha","I see. So there is some truing up that will happen in this rate case that\u2019s currently pending?","Jim Hatfield","We did do a couple of pro formas in the case to try to increase our uncollectible expense based on the increase we\u2019re seeing now.","Jeff Guldner","Ali, longer term, it\u2019ll depend on what the final rules are. So they\u2019re in a rule-making process now on the disconnect policy, and we\u2019re participating in that. And ultimately, it\u2019ll be reflected in what those rules come out with.","Ali Agha","I see. But just from, I guess, a big picture point of view, would we expect that there would be some headwinds from this? Or \u2013 I mean theoretically, the rules would be such that this would not be an issue going forward?","Jim Hatfield","There\u2019ll be headwinds until ultimately you get it reflected in rates, whether that\u2019s what we ask for in this case or down the road based on the final rules, which we don\u2019t have yet.","Ali Agha","I got you. And then lastly, Jim, I just wanted to confirm, you mentioned the need for some equity or small equity going forward. But you don\u2019t need that for this rate case, right? That 54.7%, that\u2019s based on your actual capital structure? Or does \u2013 is there some equity needed to calibrate to that level as well?","Jim Hatfield","No. Our capital structure is 54.7% as of June 30, that\u2019s what we filed in the case.","Ali Agha","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Don, I think I first met you over 20 years ago and sort of followed you around and the \u2013 or the Board at Pinnacle West certainly made a great decision when they took you out of St. Louis.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Charles.","Charles Fishman","The only question I have is effective tax rate, 14% that you\u2019re using in your key factors for next year. Can you give a little more color on that, Jim? Or \u2013 and what will likely \u2013 I mean, I assume that will rise as we go forward here in the next decade.","Jim Hatfield","Well, what it is, is it\u2019s really a reflection of the deferred tax flowback through TEAM 3, which really will be reflected in effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. But based on the fact that we\u2019re giving it back over 27.5 years, roughly.","Charles Fishman","Okay. So we can \u2013 it will stay at around this level over the next few years?","Jim Hatfield","All things equal.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Got it. That\u2019s the only thing I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you for joining us all today. This concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"17239":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call August  2, 2016 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Ted Geisler - Investor Relations","Don Brandt - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","James Hatfield - Chief Financial Officer","Jeff Guldner - SVP Public Policy, APS","Mark Schiavoni - Chief Operating Officer, APS","Analysts","Greg Gordon - Evercore","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ted Geisler, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Ted Geisler","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our second quarter 2016 earnings, recent developments and operating performance. ","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy; and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our second quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 9.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Ted, and thank you all for joining us today. 2016 continues to be inline with our expectations and we remain well positioned to meet our financial commitments this year. Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I\u2019ll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. On June 1st, APS filed its first rate review in 5 years. Our proposal moves Arizona forward with continued investments in a advanced energy grid, a cleaner energy mix and new technologies that will enable our customers to have more choices and control. ","Today, I\u2019ll highlight the key requests of the filing and their benefits. For your reference, those items as well as key underlying assumptions are summarized in the appendix to today\u2019s presentation. The rate review provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. ","The requested regulatory treatment will build upon the constructive regulatory framework established in the 2009 and 2012 settlements. Through this rate review, APS is asking for a change in the way customer rates are designed in an overall 5.74% bill increase or $166 million annually. APS has asked for an effective date of the new rates of July 1st 2017. ","Many of the key provisions in our rate review proposal are focused on constructive regulatory treatment that mitigates regulatory lag. For example, we\u2019re seeking post-test year plant additions for the period between the end of the test year and the date new rate take effect. This process has been used to mitigate regulatory lag in our last 2 rate settlements in another\u2019s case in Arizona. APS is also requesting a deferral order for our investment in the Ocotillo modernization project which will come into service after the rate case and a deferral and step increase for the selective catalytic reduction technology equipment now being installed at the Four Corners Power Plant. ","This type of step increase would be similar to the structure agreed to in our last rate settlement regarding the acquisition by APS of Southern California Edison\u2019s interest in the four Corners Power Plant. In addition, APS also proposed changes to the rate options it offers to customers ensuring that the price a customer more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. ","A three part bill with a demand component in addition to making the basic service charge itself more cost based will reduce inter-class subsidies that will reflect the actual costs to service and enable a sustainable deployment of new customer technology. APS already has more than 120,000 residential customers on demand raised today and our proposal expands its redevelopment to most residential customers. ","Our proposal also benefits customers by reducing the subsidy currently paid to support the rooftop solar industry by the 96% of residential customers who do not have rooftop solar. This change would not affect the 45,000 customers who already have rooftop solar. Our new solar customers who submit a completed interconnection application before July 1, 2017. We want to continue Arizona\u2019s solar leadership the right way with more solar for more customers without driving off the energy bills paid by non-solar customers. ","The administrative law judge has set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and interveners will begin filling their direct testimony on December 21 and this hearing would commence on March 22, 2017. The commission\u2019s staff supports completing the case within 12 months. In addition to the APS rate review filing, the Arizona Corporation commission is managing a very full schedule. On June 13th, hearings concluded in the value and cost of solar generic docket. Final, legal pleas are due on August 5th and we expect a recommended opinion and order later this year. While the initial round of testimony has recently been filed in the Tucson Electric rate case, hearings are now complete in the Unisource Electric case and a recommended opinion and order that was recently issued recommended 9.6% non-fuel rate increase. ","Turning to operational developments, we concluded planned outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and both units at the Four Corners generating plant. Tim will discuss the financial impact but the extended duration of the Four Corners planned outages was a headwind in the second quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2015. Palo Verde which is America\u2019s largest carbon fee energy source had a solid first half for the year, including successfully completing the Unit-1 planned refueling outage in 35 days. ","On a related note, APS recently announced changes to its senior leadership team at Palo Verde. Bob Bement who has been instrumental in Palo Verde\u2019s success has been promoted to Executive Vice President, Nuclear. Bob will continue reporting to Randy Edington, Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer until October 31st when Bob will then takeover as Chief Nuclear Officer while Randy transitions to Executive Vice President and Advisor to me. Jack Cadogan, currently Vice President, Nuclear Engineering, has been named to replace Bob as Senior Vice President, Site Operations. And completing the leadership team at Palo Verde, Chuck Kharrl has been named Vice President, Site Operations & General Plant Manager and Mike McLaughlin has been named Vice President, Operations Support. In addition, Bruce rash is joining Palo Verde from Exelon Corporation in the Position as Vice President of Nuclear engineering. These changes I\u2019m sure Palo Verde will continue to have the strongest nuclear leadership team in the Industry.","Looking to our capital investment program, we continue making good progress on both the Ocotillo modernization project and the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology in Four Corners. Our 40 megawatt utility scale solar plant Red Rock is more than 50% complete and on schedule for completion later this year. APS recently issued an all source request for proposals seeking 4 to 600 megawatt of capacity resources, it helped meet customer\u2019s peak energy needs. We\u2019re now evaluating the proposals with an expected decision later this year.","Last May APS announced plans to participate in the energy imbalance market. We\u2019re currently performing parallel operations and expect to go live on October 1st. Participation I this 5 minute energy market is expected to offer economic savings to our customers and improve the integration of renewable resources. ","Let me conclude by saying we\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead for customers, our employees and our shareholders. In April, APS celebrated 130 years of providing its customers with reliable electricity at an affordable cost. One month later, we filed a historic rate review which builds on the foundation established in previous rate reviews. The investments and proposals discussed in this filings provide a clear and compelling vision for the future. In many respects, this case serves as a transition from the challenges of the present to the opportunities of the future. Meanwhile we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for the balance of the year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you Don and thank you again everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016 which were inline with our expectations. As summarized on slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter 2016 we were at $1.08 per share comparing to a $1.10 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. The key drivers being higher growth margins which is primarily offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses.","Looking at gross margin, there were several factors that contributed to the $0.21 increase including favorable weather. Weather was a horizon record and when paired with the mild conditions in the second quarter of last year is a net effect of weather variations, increased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher sales in the second quarter of this year compared to the second quarter in 2015 added $0.04 to gross margin. In total, weather normalized retail sales were flat compared to last year but the sales trends by customer class was mixed ended up yielding a positive growth margin effect. More specifically, sales for higher margin residential customers increased 1.8% in the second quarter. And this growth was partially offset by a 1.5% reduction in sales to lower margin business customers. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to the gross margin as designed, contributing $0.04 per share. ","A final comment on gross margin, in April APS completed the sale of a 50% ownership in an existing 230 KW transmission which is older than a $0.03 contribution to gross margin. Now turning to operating expenses.","As I mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary offset to ongoing earnings per share in the second quarter. Included in guidance and inline with our expectations, the major planned outages at Four Corners at four and five that concluded in the second quarter were a headwind to quarterly activity compared to 2015. Another key factor that contributed to an increase in O&M in the second quarter of this year relative to last year was higher employee benefit costs including stock compensation costs. Higher D&A although increased earnings by $0.02 in the second quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional plant and service which were partially offset by lower depreciation related to the expense in the Palo Verde sale leaseback. The gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to Palo Verde Unit-II decommissioning recover the system benefit charge. The drivers that I discussed exclude these items as there was not net impact on second quarter results. ","As the Arizona economy continues to be an integral part of our business, I\u2019ll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular the Metro Phoenix area. Job growth in the second quarter in the 2000 Metro Phoenix area remains at about double the natural average, continuing trend we have seen for nearly 5 years. ","As seen on the upper panel of slide 5, Metro Phoenix added jobs at 3.4% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad based with construction, business services, financial services and healthcare showing strong sectoral strength adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. While job growth continues to have a positive effect on Metro Phoenix areas commercial and residential real estate markets. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the second quarter with combined 2 million square feet of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. Vacancy rates in both markets have gone onto levels last year in 2008 and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter.","We expect a continuation of business expansions and related job growth in the Phoenix market with flow and turn to continue commercial development. The residential real estate market reflects our strength as well. As you can on the lower panel side 5, housing construction is on phase to have its best years since 2007 driven primarily by the single family market and overall the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix was solidly backed to pre-recession levels. Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices with return to levels last seen in early 2008. ","We believe that we follow job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households to separate from foreclosures during the recession and it will allow the Metro Phoenix housing market an economy more generally to expand at a healthy pace over the next couple of years, reflecting a steady improvement in economic conditions APS\u2019s retail customer base grew 1.4% compared with the second quarter last year. ","We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually to accelerate in response to economic growth trends that I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting teacher population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appeared to be in place. ","In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect financial ways to consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. We will provide a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on slide 6 which remain unchanged. In terms of recent financings on May 06 APS issued 350 million of 3.75% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used for redeem and cancel certain pleas control box and to repay commercial payer and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenses. ","Additionally on August 1st, APS repaid a maturity 250 million of 6.25% of senior unsecured notes. We anticipate issuing up to 350 million of additional long-term debt this year. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and EPS at 64 million on commercial paper outstanding. Finally our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% to 2018 and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity. ","This concludes our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Our first quarter comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Hey, hello guys. ","Don Brandt ","Hi.","James Hatfield","Hey Greg.","Greg Gordon","If you look at the schedule for the rate case, I have a two part question. One is traditionally when do we get into the window where we can start to potentially settle certain items in the case or potentially get a global settlement, that\u2019s a little bit harder obviously. And two, what can we glean from the rate cases that have been going on in the Southern part of the state in terms of issues that have been settled or resolved that might be presidential for your case? ","Jeffrey Guldner","Hey Greg, it\u2019s Jeff Guldner. So on the scheduling and settlement, typically you would start looking at that after direct testimonies being filed by other parties and so that\u2019s probably the time you\u2019d first start to get really engaged in settlement discussions with both the staff. I mean obviously you\u2019ll be engaged in discussions along the way, we do and are doing right now technical conferences to help folks understand the filing itself. And so we\u2019ll continue that through the testimony piece.","On the other issues obviously rate design have been a pretty major topic in most of the cases and while it\u2019s certainly helpful in seeing what some of those issues are, one of the things I\u2019d be cautious of is all the utilities in the state are coming from a slightly different position. And so you\u2019ve probably seen the UNS order, the recommended orders are out in the UNS case and is proposing a move to TLU rates. We have also suggested in our testimony in that case that they move more towards the demand rates which is similar to our proposal but they are not in the same position as we are. And so one way that we\u2019re viewing that case now is potentially good step in overall rate modernization because they are moving customers on a TLU. We are in a better position with that, that have the customers on TLU and about 11% of the customers on demand rates, residential demand rates today. ","And so that\u2019s helpful in seeing what are the issues and discussions are but the cases are all going to be different as they ultimately move forward.","Greg Gordon","Okay, remind me what you said date for direct testimony filings?","James Hatfield","Direct testimony on revenue requirement piece is December the 21st and then the rate design piece would be January 27, 2017.","Greg Gordon","Okay, great. Thanks guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning. ","Don Brandt ","Good morning.","James Hatfield","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I just wanted to ask how has the election strategy evolved off late, just a broad brush and let everything going on, perhaps comparing this cycle with the last if you will.","James Hatfield","Well the most significant difference is there is three slots that are potentially open at the commission and Julien you know that alternates, every other year 2 versus 3 and we have five Republican candidates and two democratic candidates running and the primary is at end of this month.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But how is your strategy in terms of your approach to go?","James Hatfield","They are running their campaigns.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Okay, great. And then separately can you elaborate a little bit on demand charges especially versus fixed charges. Any commentary with respect to the ALJ that came out in the resource case and how does that differ from our own case, if you can comment. ","Jeffrey Guldner ","Sure Julien, this is Jeff. So one of the ways to think of the difference between demand rates and fixed charges is with the demand rate the customer can still control that. So one of the challenges if folks are just talking about mooting to higher fixed charges, that don\u2019t vary with demand. There is essentially nothing that a customer can do to manage that. And so what we\u2019ve seen with our residential customers who are on a demand rate and particularly with customers who transitioned from a more traditional or a used demand rate is that they actually can do things both behaviorally and with technology that can manage demand. ","And so there is a lot of value in moving to something that sends a better price signal that can actually sense some technology or some behavioral adaptation from customers that help us manage peak demand. And with all the solar we see in the Southwest, that\u2019s the major transition that we\u2019ve got to start looking at. And so when you look at the other utilities, we have done more, I think we have more customers on residential demand rates than anyone in the U.S. ","So we\u2019re in a better position to understand the dynamics of those rates, how the rate design matters and make those changes but I don\u2019t think there is a recognition of that from the folks that were involved in the hearings here, but overall in the Southwest, rate modernization is something that have to happen and so what you\u2019re seeing in UNS is a transition at the time of use. We\u2019ve done the time of used rate for over 30 years. So we\u2019re at a slightly different place, our metering technology is more advanced and so you have to be careful in looking at other cases for direct president, but they\u2019re certainly instructive in what some of the issues are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And how do you think about customer sort of education on demand charges that were raised.","Jeffrey Guldner ","Very important and so again what you want to do is make sure that customers understand the simple aspects. We have proposed in our case and are working on a pretty aggressive customer agitation program but then also what are the tools that we can provide to customers, some of them are very simple from just understanding the timeframe and there are things that we can do in the rate design that helps soften the impact of the rate, make it different from a commercial demand rate. But we also want to make sure that customers know of other things that they can do to take control of the rate. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, alright thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha ","Thank you. First question, when you look at the first half results Jim, you mentioned you\u2019re on track but the weather has been better, the cost obviously you have budgeted but overall what you said that through the first half the results are right on plan and budget as you would have envisioned the year?","Jeffrey Guldner ","As I said in my remarks Ali, we\u2019re meeting our expectations based on where we completed the year. The O&M is mostly possible maintenance and it was front-end loaded and we know that. So we\u2019re, no surprise here where we are today. ","Ali Agha ","Okay. Secondly, the budget is still for customer growth of 1.5 to 2.5% for the year, we\u2019re running at about 1.4% and also I know the second quarter is the shoulder quarter but weather normalized that you said were flat, it was up over 1% of the first quarter. So are those trends again pretty much as expected or is that giving you a better or a clearer picture on how the full year maybe shaping up based on how first half has shaped up so far. ","Jeffrey Guldner ","Yeah, we plan for gradually improving throughout the year and if you look at 2015, the first half we were 1.2 customer growth 2015, it will have 1.3 and now we are at 1.4. We thought for data gradual acceleration through time. So I think we\u2019re right on track.","Ali Agha ","Also for the usage as well in terms of weather normalized here.","Jeffrey Guldner ","Yeah, we\u2019re at 0.6% year-to-date, our plan this year is we\u2019ve got one. So we\u2019re deeply within that sort of range we expected.","Ali Agha ","And then lastly Jim as you mentioned your latest -- growth numbers call for 6% to 7% CAGR, they have actually gone up after you file the rate case and updated the numbers. Can you remind me again why that doesn\u2019t accelerate the earnings growth profile as well because rate base has gone up?","Jeffrey Guldner ","Because we don\u2019t have perfect regulations so we continue to have some regulatory lags as well as financing cost for every construction program or that earnings slightly. As we\u2019ve always said rate base growth is the sort of top and revenue growth is a bottom of sort of where we\u2019re going to expect earnings to come in if we were going to project earnings which we don\u2019t. ","Ali Agha","Yeah, understood and what is the plan for dividend growth?","Jeffrey Guldner ","The Board will look at it again in October. We\u2019ve accelerated from when we\u2019ve taken dividend growth again to 5 in 2014 and so we\u2019ll have to see where we have all our things considered in October. ","Ali Agha","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","With updates due for the preliminary IRP October 1st which is the same date you've begun energy in balanced market operations, so what extent do expect any incremental renewable opportunities at the utility that aren't already reflected in the preliminary IRP?","Jeffrey Guldner ","I would not connect the EIM and IRP, I think modestly as we look at additional renewals will be based on specific need and specific talk.","Michael Weinstein","It's just that one of the justification things for joining EIM was to benefit to give more opportunities for renewable, I am wondering to what extent was your decision to join the EIM?","Jeffrey Guldner ","EIM was really a customer benefit proposition that will allow integration of renewable more but that won't provide customer savings which is our motivation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Question on O&M a little bit, can you kind of bridge us O&Ms are -- and if include the energy efficiency and DSM charges roughly about 60 million on a year-to-date basis last year and the second half of the year, I think O&M was right around $440 million to $445 million, are expecting O&M to be down year-over-year in the second half of the 2016 more flattish, I am just trying to get a feel directionally for where you think is just given the kind of sizable uptake in the first half of the year due to the outages?","Jeffrey Guldner ","So if you look at the sort of middle of the range from 15 to 16 it's about 63 million of which 50 million of that is related to outages so that would apply to your comparisons moving forward will be fairly comparable?","Michael Lapides","Should we assume 2017 has a sizable roll-off or how much of O&M that you're incurring in 16 as kind of recurring longer term versus what kind of fall of when we get to next year?","Jeffrey Guldner ","We have overall schedules that are based on O&M run rates and how we use they and they are lumpy, but we're not really here to talk about 17 at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","I only one question left, this transition line sale was that just too bit of deal pay outside versus we'll read something more into that as well a strategy change?","Jeffrey Guldner ","No this was transmission line that 355 partnership band there have been discussions in prior years about the partner Washington that sub-points particularly that old matt lying and so posted about potential transaction it was favorable to use and so did that a consent with commission. We've been taking percentage of proceeds of a book value went back to customers than shareholders got 330%.","Charles Fishman","Okay so don't anything in direction, got it that's all I have.","Jeffrey Guldner ","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with Key Back Capital market, please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Could just kind of give 10,000 feet view kind of high point of what came out of the value of solar discussion in how you expect that to interplay with your pending case?","Jeffrey Guldner ","So the briefing still on0going so you've replayed bridge actually coming in on Friday and what will happen that has been ALG will business treat like put a recommender roader out. The commission will give that open leading and right now the only Teeda [ph] sort of concurrently what as being an escape so one of the questions will be then whatever comes of the value and cost for solar. Docket remember that docket was focused on two things, first how do you look at the cost to service so sit with solar to cost dollar and then what other ways that you guys are export energy and so that's been having to integrated into the rate cases and first question that is could be up without as you and us. Again our teaming a tiny is a litter better because we're in the process","Charles Fishman","[Indiscernible] There is no debt but scrip co in august so typically see that in month or after afer rethinking assistant?","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","There is a workshop later this year on reducing peak demand cost and you were just talking about TOU and which you guys have done what have you and I was just wondering, could you elaborate a little bit on what sort of driving this workshop and this looked that the commission having on it?","Jeffrey Guldner ","Paul, this is Jeff, one of the challenges that we're seeing up here on the wholesale market is that we've got a lot of solar when that solar production is on particularly in the spring and the fall, what it's doing as this creating a negative prices in the middle of the day and then shifting the peak out later in the day and so it means there is a very heavy focus on the peak demand part of the day and less on that overall energy consumption. And so folks are trying figure out in both rate design and use of technology and how we design the system, so things like the Okoteo modernization project how we deal with peak demand, this increasingly the challenge in running the system that workshop is I think positive sign this is where we're looking at how all of these play in, what role of technology has, what rate designs will have and so it's a constructive conversation.","Jeffrey Guldner ","And then on the value of solar I've seen some of the brief and there has been some sort of issue regarding the models and what have on, I am just wondering whether there is a potential for a settlement with some of the parties perhaps amongst some of the parties with respect to the distribute generation value proceeding or we should just expect to be kind of dually litigated. I am getting where out of the proceeding right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Fleishman","Just quickly the Bloomberg grabbed a story from our 10 -Q about the subpoena you got for the 2014 guidance I just wanted to clarify that is related to the predications [Indiscernible] [0:37:09.8] the subpoena to anything that we're investing at the Company.","Jeffrey Guldner ","We'll see just to reiterate in June, the Company received two subpoena issues and connecting with investigation by the U.S. attorney office pertaining to the 2014 statewide election raises in Horizontal, were quite at the same we would cooperate fully and that's stilt the case and we're not able to comment further on the investigation while it's going.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now like turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Ted Geisler","Thanks Christine. Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations for Pinnacle West Capital. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Paul J. Mountain","Thank you, Christine. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in this Conference Call and Webcast to Review Our Third Quarter 2013 Earnings, Recent Developments and Operating Performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. First, I need to cover a few details with you.","The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our third quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements cautionary language, as well as the Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days, and will also be available by telephone through November 7.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald E. Brandt","Thank you, Paul. And thank you all for joining us today. My comments today will provide an update on our operations, including the Four Corners transaction, as well as discuss the regulatory proposals that are in front of the Arizona Corporation Commission. Then Jim will discuss the results of the quarter and our earnings guidance.","First, let me highlight that last week, our Board of Directors increased the common dividend by 4%, effective with this year's December payment. The increase builds on the 4% increase last fall, and is in line with the value return goals we outlined 1 year ago at our Analyst Day.","Turning now to Four Corners. With the Arizona Corporation Commission voting to close the retail electric competition docket on September 11, APS is now moving forward to address the remaining conditions to closing our acquisition of Southern California Edison's interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5. The transfer of the mine from BHP to the Navajo Nation is progressing, with the Navajo president and the Navajo speaker of the Tribal Council signing legislation last week, necessary to complete the acquisition of the mine. The other co-owners of the plant must also finalize their internal approvals of the coal contract. Assuming all closing conditions are met, we anticipate the Four Corners transaction will close in December. Around the time of closing, APS plans to issue debt to provide permanent funding for the acquisition.","Once the transaction is closed, we have 2 actions that need to occur by December 31, 2013: First, a provision in APS's 2012 settlement agreement allows APS to file for the recovery of the Four Corners transaction-related revenue requirement with the Arizona Corporation Commission, and to implement new rates prior to the company's next rate case. The Commission will review the revenue requirement request and make a decision, which is expected in 2014.","Second, APS and the other Four Corners participants will notify the EPA of their chosen \"best available retrofit technology\", as you know as BART compliant strategy, which would include shutting down Units 1, 2 and 3 by January 1, 2014, and installing selective catalytic reduction technology on Units 4 and 5 by July 31, 2018, again, assuming the Four Corners transaction is completed.","Turning to the rest of our operations. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had another solid operational quarter with a capacity factor of 100%. Unit 3 began a refueling outage on October 5, with a continuous run of 160 days by all 3 units. This was the second longest run for the 3 units simultaneously in plant history, spanning from the completion of a planned Unit 1 outage in April to Unit 3's current planned refueling and maintenance outage.","Early in the Unit 3 outage, during routine visual examinations, we discovered a very small water leak where an instrumentation tube connects to the bottom of the reactor vessel. The tiny leak was located inside the containment structure and was isolated from the environment. Multiple independent monitoring devices inside containment confirmed that this leak is exceptionally small, and no other leaks have been detected. The Palo Verde team is currently making all necessary repairs before the unit returns to service, which we expect later in November. Our share of the costs, which are mainly capital, are not expected to be material. Units 1 and 2 remain at full power.","Our solar portfolio achieved an important milestone, with the 250-megawatt Solana plant reaching commercial operation earlier this month. As you know, APS will purchase 100% of Solana's generation, which will make a significant contribution towards our Renewable Energy Standard target. Solana represents an important technological step forward with the ability of Solana to store the sun's heat, and thereby, generate electricity long after the sun has set.","Work continues on Yuma Foothills Phase 2 and Hyder 2 as part of our AZ Sun utility-scale solar platform, with these plants expected to come online later this year. In addition, work has begun on the 32-megawatt Gila Bend plant, which is expected to come online in mid-2014, which will bring the total to 150 megawatts in commercial operations through AZ Sun.","As we discussed on our second quarter call, APS also filed its annual Renewable Energy Standard Implementation Plan covering the 2014 to 2018 timeframe, on July 12. The plan does not propose any new programs, but it does seek approval to conduct RFPs, sign contracts and begin construction on the final 50 megawatts of the 200-megawatt AZ Sun program. On September 30, 2013, the ACC staff issued a report recommending approval of APS's plan and the proposed budget.","We filed APS's proposed solution with the Commission on a policy revision for net metering in July of this year, with the goal of ensuring that APS residential customers who installed rooftop solar, pay a fair price for their use of the electricity grid, and also receive incentives and appropriate compensation for their solar production. We believe the cost shifting should be resolved now. The recommendation by the ACC staff last month proposes a range of solution from addressing the cost shift now, to waiting until APS's next rate case. Every serious stakeholder in the net metering debate, including ACC staff and RUCO, has acknowledged the cost shift problem.","Media coverage on the net metering issue has evolved from a debate about whether there is an issue to the coverage we're seeing lately in the Arizona media, which is more about finding a fair solution with RUCO's acknowledgment of the cost shift as the final confirmation. We expect the Arizona Corporation Commission to discuss both net metering and the Renewable Energy Standard Implementation Plan at its open meeting in a couple of weeks.","To conclude, our value proposition remains clear. Our management team remains focused on executing our strategy and delivering long-term rate base, earnings and dividends growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James R. Hatfield","Thank you, Don. The topics I will discuss today are outlined on Slide 4. I'll begin with a review of our third quarter results, including earnings and the primary variances from last year's relative quarter, followed by an update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy, and we'll conclude with a review of our 2013 and 2014 earnings guidance and financial outlook.","Slide 5 summarizes our ongoing and GAAP earnings for the quarter and year-to-date. On an ongoing and GAAP basis, for this year's third quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $226 million or $2.04 per share, compared with net income of $245 million, or $2.21 per share, for the prior year's third quarter. As usual, my remaining comments will focus on ongoing results.","Slide 6 outlines the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. A decrease in our gross margin reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, compared with the prior year's third quarter. I will cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","Higher operations and maintenance expenses reduced earnings by $0.04 per share, including communication costs associated with net metering and deregulation, partially offset by lower generation cost resulting from less plant maintenance being completed in the third quarter of this year than in the same quarter 1 year ago. Both the gross margin and O&M variances exclude expenses related to the Renewable Energy Standard, or RES, energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which were essentially offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms.","Higher infrastructure-related costs reduced earnings by $0.07 per share, reflecting increases in depreciation and amortization and property taxes, which is driven by both additional property and higher rates.","Turning to Slide 7 and the components of the net decrease of $0.06 in our gross margin, the main components of this were as follows, starting with the positive drivers: The effects of weather improved earnings by $0.02 per share. Although weather in the third quarters of both this year and last year were less favorable than normal, this year's quarter was relatively warmer. During the period, residential cooling degree days were 4% higher than last year's third quarter, but 3% below normal. The middle of September was particularly mild compared to normal. The net effect of other miscellaneous items improved gross margin by $0.02 per share.","Offsetting these items, lower usage by APS's customers compared with the third quarter 1 year ago decreased our quarterly results by $0.09 per share. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were down 1.3% compared to last year for the quarter. While our customer programs and conservation are the largest source of the reduction in sales, this variance also reflects a convergence back to a more normal usage trend after stronger-than-expected usage for the year-ago quarter, and is very much in line with our expectations.","On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales are relatively flat, in line with our guidance. Lower transmission revenue decreased earnings by $0.01 per share, including an unfavorable variance of $0.03 related to the transmission accrual that we recorded in the third quarter of 2012, following the modification to the Transmission Cost Adjustor under our 2012 settlement.","Turning to Slides 8 and 9 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook and the Arizona economy. Economic growth in Arizona continued its overall improvement in the third quarter 2013, although the growth remains modest as has been the case through the last year or so.","As shown on Slide 8, the prices of existing single-family homes in Metro Phoenix reflect the benefit of these improving economic conditions. The steady job growth over the last 2 years has helped with the absorption of vacant homes and apartments in the Phoenix area, and housing prices have responded. Prices have now recovered to mid-2004 levels, a healthy improvement from levels seen in recent years.","Additionally, the rate of overall job growth has been positive the last 2 years and appears to be stable at around -- at the 2% level. Nearly all of the major industrial sectors are experiencing some growth. The sustained growth in jobs has been helpful in supporting a gradual increase in incomes, business and consumer confidence, and thus, consumer spending. Arizona's unemployment rate reflects those improving economic conditions and has seen steady year-on-year declines.","The resurgence of existing home prices has sparked more demand for new housing. Permits for new single-family homes are up substantially this year, and 2013 will likely end up as the best year for new construction since 2007. However, homebuilders continue to face hurdles in acquiring and developing land at reasonable prices, attracting skilled labor and controlling building material cost, particularly at the entry level of the market. The ability of homebuilders to successfully navigate through these challenges will have an influence on the pace of the Phoenix and Arizona construction recovery over the next several quarters.","The top right chart indicates that the commercial real estate market has been gradually improving as well, but may have a longer recovery period than housing. Vacancy rates for office and retail space have begun to fall from their peak levels, but remain quite high, while those for the industrial space have fallen more dramatically. On balance, we see signs of sustained improvement in all economic indicators, which paint a picture of a continued steady recovery. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's customer base grew 1.3% year-to-date compared with the year ago.","On Slide 9, looking over the long term, we believe that fundamentals that have been important to Arizona's growth are still here, and that our customer growth rate will return to more typical levels. Looking at the next several years, we continued to expect annual customer growth to average about 2% for 2013 through 2015, with higher growth rates at the end of the period than in the near term for the reasons I have just discussed.","Additionally, we also continue to expect our annual weather-normalized retail sales and kilowatt hours to increase by less than 1% on average from 2013 through 2015, primarily due to our customer programs and conservations offsetting their continued recovery in the economy and customer growth.","Finally, I'll discuss our earnings guidance and financial outlook. As shown on Slide 10, we continue to expect that Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2013 will be in the range of $3.55 to $3.70 per share. However, we know much of the favorable weather we saw through the second quarter has been reversed in September and October, but it is included in our guidance. In fact, in terms of the number of cooling degree days, this October has recorded the fewest cooling degree days in the last 15 years.","We are also introducing 2014 ongoing guidance of $3.60 to $3.75 per share. Key assumptions in 2014 include customer growth of 2%, with retail kilowatt hour sales increasing about 0.5%. The impact of the Four Corners acquisition affected midyear, and no equity issuance planned. A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our 2013 and 2014 guidance is included in the appendix to our slides.","As Don discussed, the Board of Directors increased their indicated annual dividend by $0.09 per share, or about 4% to $2.27 per share effective with the December payment. The company goal continues to be an annualized consolidated and return on average common equity of at least 9.5% through 2015. This underpins our ability to expect to grow our dividend by approximately 4% per year. In addition, we remain on track for 2013, consistent with our earnings guidance range.","Lastly, I just want to make a brief point on our liquidity. As Don remarked, around the time of closing of the Four Corners transaction, APS plans to issue debt to provide permanent funding for the acquisition. At the end of the third quarter, both the parent company and APS had no short-term debt outstanding, and we have ample liquidity.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Citigroup.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The midpoint of your guidance range, $3.60 to $3.75, seems to imply a little bit closer to an earned ROE of 9.5%. I think, historically, you've guided, and even in the prior call you mentioned that you should see probably lag close to about 10 basis points, so maybe an earned ROE close to like 9.8%, 9.9%. I mean, there's no real change in your customer growth assumptions or weather-normalized growth assumptions from a volume basis. So I guess, I'm kind of curious what the delta is? And is it energy efficiency or what are you seeing down there?","James R. Hatfield","Well, Shahriar, I would say, our guidance, sort of booking of the 9.5% to 10%, earned ROE. And I think no real change in our outlook as we look to '14 and beyond, the pieces of the rate base growth, earnings growth and dividend growth are still intact.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. got it. And then let me just ask you one question on Four Corners. The transaction is going to close pretty -- timing-wise, pretty close to when the EPA can announce potential carbon legislation on existing assets. Can you give us an update on where the ACC or APS or the governor is with the EPA on potential impacts? Because obviously, there's going to be a litigation as a result of it, but ultimately could lead to pretty high capital requirements for these assets. Can we get a status on that?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, and just in terms of Four Corners and the EPA, I think the EPA came out earlier this year which was for new sources, and they are coming out with existing sources won't be for an additional amount of time. So our plans right now are to just close the transaction, and so SCR is in '17 and '18, and we think that'll fit within the EPA guidelines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to be clear on the third quarter and year-to-date numbers, because I think the decline in sales was a little bit disconcerting to some people. The year-to-date numbers, you are seeing about -- you've seen about 1.3% customer growth and more or less flat sales growth. So despite the fact that the third quarter was a bad comp versus last year, you are actually on plan relative to your expectations?","James R. Hatfield","Absolutely, Greg. Like I said in my remarks, we were off in the third quarter. It's consistent with last year, where we're off to the third quarter as well, and it certainly met our expectations from sales growth.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then you've given guidance for 2% customer growth, 0.5% sales growth in '14. But if I triangulate around what you've said about an expectation of accelerating customer growth and sales growth, and you expect any averages that you said you expect through '15, just mathematically speaking, you think that customer and sales growth should accelerate into '15 versus '14. Is that correct?","James R. Hatfield","Absolutely, Greg.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And you've said before you see an ability to keep your O&M relatively flat over that period? Is that still a fair assumption?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, that's still our assumption.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. The final question on this subject, and then one other. Don, I know Jim just said that the $3.60 to $3.75 guidance for 2014 more or less bookends a earned ROE of 9.5% to 10%. And I know weather variations can do a lot to your earnings throughout the course of the year, and there is other factors that are hard to manage. But is it still your aspiration and assumption that you could default, if your plan is executed earned towards your authorized return on equity?","Donald E. Brandt","That is correct, Greg, that it would be our direction to earn towards our allowed rate of return. Let me add, before we get too far away from your last question about customer growth, and I know you and others would be interested in this. I just had a discussion day before yesterday with some representatives of the homebuilders industry. And to use their words, the builders are not able to meet the current demand for housing in the area, and the key issues are 3: they identified labor shortage, which they have actually built some trade schools to get construction labor back up to speed; the permitting process, and that's going through the various city and county government entities; and a lack of improved lots right now, which they're going at gangbusters. So my word is not theirs. I think theirs is initial hurdle to get over, to get those pieces in place, and we'll see things start to accelerate relative to solar -- excuse me, sales growth, which is in line with essentially what Jim was telling you a few minutes ago.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my final question with regard to solar stuff. I guess the next open meeting is in mid-November. Do you think that it's possible you'll get a decision both on the net metering issue and the 50 megawatts of Arizona Sun that you've recommended -- that the staff has recommended be approved? And if they do approve that, is that in your current CapEx forecast or would that be accretive to CapEx and rate base?","James R. Hatfield","We do not have the last 50 megawatts of Arizona Sun in our forecast at the moment. It would likely be in a '15 event.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And that would get recovered through a rate rider as the rest of the Arizona Sun program has?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just wanted to touch on the '14 guidance again just real quickly here. You're talking about some pretty robust growth, obviously. And I'd be curious -- looking at the gross margin component of this, right? It seems more flattish year-on-year. I mean, obviously, the top end is a little higher. Can you talk about maybe the composition of growth and kind of reconcile those 2 comments a little bit?","James R. Hatfield","Sure. I think you have a couple of components here: one, obviously, is 0.5% sales growth; and the others would be, as we've talked about, the mechanisms we have in place that continue to add the gross margin on an annual basis. You have the TSA. You have the RES. You have the LSCR. And of course, we've assumed that 1\/2 year at Four Corners. So you would get 1\/2 of that -- roughly 1\/2 in '14 and 1\/2 in '15, assuming it goes in on July 1.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. How much of the growth in gross margin here is attributable to growth in sales, if you will, versus, say, rate increases? And perhaps just to be clear, how much year-on-year, in aggregate, are we talking about a reversal of sort of 1x weather-related benefit this year, just to kind of make it more apples-to-apples?","James R. Hatfield","Well, I think so far, and we don't know what October is yet, because it's last day of the month. We know it was terribly mild. Like I said, we haven't had an October like this since 1998. So I think at the end of September, we still had about $0.06 or $0.07 of weather. Positive weather, so you'd have to weather-normalize from that. Our rule of thumb on 1% sales growth is roughly $10 million of net income, which equates to about $0.09. So you would have $0.04 or so just based on sales growth.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And I just wanted to clarify this. I mean, been a lot of talk out there about distributed gen and solar and all that. But just to be very clear and perhaps quantify it, I mean, what kind of variability could DG put into your numbers? I mean, it seems relatively small but just put a finer number on that.","James R. Hatfield","Yes. Well, right now, we're seeing the DGPs probably take away about 0.5% of sales growth or so. And the rest is, as we talked about EE and conservation. And we don't see a lot of variability in that number, obviously. We expect DG will grow but so will a number of customers and so you'll see fairly consistent sort of 0.5%.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And kind of taking the same analogy of growth in '14 and looking further beyond, we've seen some of your peers out there talk about long-term EPS growth, the trajectory coming down a little bit. Obviously, you guys have some EPA-related spend and some demand growth that I suppose longer-term outlook. What are you guys thinking, I mean, if you can put kind of any kind of ballpark sense there? I mean, are we talking about, at a minimum, maintaining your current growth trajectory, or is there actually an acceleration here that you're talking about '15 onwards?","James R. Hatfield","Are you talking about what kind of growth, EPS growth?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, I think. Yes, bottom line EPS growth.","James R. Hatfield","Yes, I think, Julien, you think you have really in '14 somewhat of a lull in growth, but our growth rate hasn't changed. And we talked about our forecast of '15, but beyond that, we have, as we sit here today, planning peakers in the valley that was our '17, '18 event, you have SCRs which are '17, '18 events as well. So we don't really see a slowdown in our growth rate as we sit here today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is it arguably an increase or...","James R. Hatfield","We haven't talked about increase or decrease. We think it's going to be consistent steady growth which supports our dividend growth outlook.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And perhaps just lastly here, I mean, obviously, a lot of focus again on DG. Is that an opportunity in the long term here for you guys to get involved somehow beyond AZ Sun?","James R. Hatfield","We have not\u00a0-- it's something we've looked at, but right now, we have no plans to get into DG. Our plans in the solar space would be more utility scale with PPAs to creditworthy customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Jim, wanted to clarify a couple of things. One\u00a0is just to be clear from your commentary, the third quarter financial results that you just reported, were those in line with expectations or below because of the sales growth or can you just give us a sense of that?","James R. Hatfield","No, I would say it's in line. I don't think we're\u00a0-- as I said, the sort of sales reduction was not outside our expectation. We did have a little higher property tax, which is something that we probably didn't expect. We see property tax rates going up about 10%. Remember, we have the deferral mechanisms, we are able to deferral a good part of that. Other than that, I'd say it's in line with expectations.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then second, as you point out in your '14 guidance, you're not assuming any new equity issuance. So at this stage, when are the earliest, do you believe, equity would be required for you guys?","James R. Hatfield","Well, right now, we're assuming no equity in our forecast period, which goes through '15.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Oh, through '15 as well, okay?","James R. Hatfield","Right.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And does that also influence your thinking on the next rate case filing?","James R. Hatfield","They're somewhat connected but obviously, our goal would be to stay out as long as we can. It's likely to be pushed off but we do have the peakers and the SCRs, which at some point will want to make sure we recover.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about the dividend, the 4% growth rate that you've assumed will continue going forward. Does that assume a pretty steady current payout ratio? Does the payout ratio go up? Does it go down? How should we think about that for the dividend?","James R. Hatfield","It's pretty much steady with the 4% dividend increase.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we should assume a 4% EPS growth to go over that dividend growth?","James R. Hatfield","Well, as we said last year, we have 4% dividend growth and sort of 6% rate base growth long term. And so earnings are going to\u00a0-- that would be your bookends from an earnings perspective.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right, got it. And last question to be clear, just confirming, I think you mentioned. So in your '14 guidance, you've got Four Corners contributing earnings for 1\/2 a year?","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cole with Credit Suisse.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just kind of following up on Agha's question. So, there's no equity through 2015. Should we think about, I guess, the next test here being 2016\u00a0and then you're filing mid-'17 and rates effective '18. Is that kind of how we should think about it?","Donald E. Brandt","Kevin, I think you're probably far ahead of our thought. Our objective is to run the business exceptionally well, control our costs, deliver outstanding value and service to our customers. And as Jim said, we have no plans for equity in '14, and it's not our objective, or I doubt many other electric utilities in the country to file rate cases as a first course of action. So, we'll deal with that as our plans evolve.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And is it still right to think of you would file\u00a0-- you would tear up your balance sheet during the test year versus prospectively like how you cut for the CapEx?","Donald E. Brandt","Yes, during the test year likely, yes.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess you guys have long pointed towards your 4% dividend growth to keep the payout ratio flat, which is perfectly in line with your\u00a02014\u00a0guidance. Should we think about your growth rate remaining in line with the dividend growth? Or, I guess, can you help me kind of bridge the gap between the 4% growth rate and your 6% rate base growth for 2015\u00a0and '16?","James R. Hatfield","Well, Kevin, we haven't come out with a long-term EPS growth rate. But like we said at the analyst meeting last year, you have 6% rate base growth, 4% dividend growth. That's going to be your bookends for earnings growth on a sort of a CAGR, knowing that any year could be plus or minus, depending upon various factors.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the reason that\u00a02014\u00a0is maybe not towards the 6% because of a delay in Four Corners. If Four Corners wasn't delayed, then you'd probably be closer to 6%. Is that how we should think about it?","James R. Hatfield","No, I think some of the factors for next year are things like a smaller\u00a0-- we're basing it as a smaller TCA this year. That will pick up in '15 just based on transmission spend and the way our formula works. And we are only have Four Corners for 1\/2 a year, you're exactly right.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess when I think about energy efficiency. So for this quarter, I saw we had 1.3% population growth, but weather-normal is negative 1.3%. And so that's roughly 2.5%, I guess, energy efficiency netting. What was unique about the third quarter which drove so much, I guess, energy efficiency versus the future periods?","James R. Hatfield","I don't think there's anything unique about this year's quarter. Sales were off 1.2% last year, which was actually a little better than we thought it'd be last year. So nothing really unique about the third quarter. Keep in mind, you have a lot of weather variability in our largest quarter. That always has an impact on numbers as well.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So the big net energy efficiency loss could be a little bit of weather kind of baked in there just from...","James R. Hatfield","Weather is an art, not a science. I know guys disagree with that assessment, but you look at average temperature and you get peak highs and lower lows and it always has an impact. But that's our calculation that we came up with.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So let me just ask one\u00a0last question. So I know Jim, you spent a lot of time just on O&M generally. When you're thinking about flat O&M, is flat to\u00a0-- is it on absolute basis? And are you thinking flat off of year end 2013, so whatever the numbers is this year should kind of hover that level until you file another rate case? Or are you seeing\u00a0-- or you're already pegging that with volume growth or can you actually see maybe expected year-on-year cut in O&M?","James R. Hatfield","Well, I would pick if we see, sort of, net kWh sales growth, our aspiration is to be at or lower than the rate of sales growth. So, as we look to next year, with the 0.5% kWh sales expectation, I would think you could assume that we're going to be fairly flat in '14 over '13.","Kevin Cole - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So still it's flat to volume growth, not flat on absolute basis?","James R. Hatfield","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you just remind us again, what is the CapEx guidance for '13? And then, I know you didn't give it explicitly in the '14 number, but is there a CapEx number that you're thinking of '14 is well? Just so that we can triangulate properly.","James R. Hatfield","Yes, so the '14 number is roughly a little over $900\u00a0million. Our '13 number is about $1.1\u00a0billion. Keep in mind, we've assumed the Four Corners in there for '13, which pushes that number up a bit.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, great. And then for '14, is there a depreciation and amortization number that we're thinking...","James R. Hatfield","It's about $400\u00a0million a year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been addressed. Just on the inclusion of Four Corners, the settlement in 2012\u00a0envisioned that going into rates. What does the Commission need to decide or consider in order to grant approval for that to go into rates?","James R. Hatfield","Well, the docket was held open for Four Corners. We will file the cost of service and ask before the end of the year. And like we said earlier, that pace has been adjudicated once and we will just update our expectation for cost of service with our filing and we expect it to go into effect July\u00a01.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So you expect it to be\u00a0-- I mean, do you expect this to be a contested issue? Are people going to look at your cost of service and come back and say, \"This is way too high\", or something to that effect?","James R. Hatfield","Well, any sort of regulatory filing has people on all sides. I will say, this came out in the last case that was adjudicated what we believe our cost of service should be. I think you could expect people to question any sort of changes in that. But the cost of service has been put out there and explained in our last\u00a0-- in the original filing. So I don't think it will be a surprise to anybody.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And one\u00a0other area on net metering. If you got what you would like to see, the changes you'd like to see made, how would that affect rates?","James R. Hatfield","Well, our proposal, staff proposal, and I haven't read through the whole process yet, so I can't really comment, although I'm sure it's probably similar, is it's some sort of monthly charge. But keep in mind, all of the\u00a0-- there's no new money to APS. Any fee collected in the near term would go to offset the LFCR. So there would be no net revenue to APS and a reduction in LFCR going forward until the next rate case will use that rate case design.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Right, understood. Okay.","Donald E. Brandt","Kit, let me -- this is Don. As I know you know, net metering is a cost shifting issue. It's fundamentally a customer issue. It's no secret to the current net metering structure creates a cost shift that unfairly burdens nonsolar customers. Other important stakeholders like the ACC's staff and RUCO has acknowledged this fact. And without a doubt, the time to fix this problem is now before it gets worse. And that's the key, is fix it now while it's easily fixable. The best way to encourage the continued growth of rooftop solar is not through hidden subsidies as currently exist with the net metering structure. And those subsidies are funded by nonsolar customers. But rather, through transparent upfront incentives funded by all customers. And fixing the current net metering policy will help continue Arizona's national leadership in solar energy.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Understood. So I was kind of trying to get at the idea of how much would rates change for nonsolar customers? Is this a big impact or is this spread out over so many customers that it's relatively small and they're relatively indifferent to how this proceeding turns out?","James R. Hatfield","Near term, there will be no change to nonsolar customers. As proposed by us and staff, it would be a monthly charge other than whatever they decide to do with upfront incentives, which should be collected through the rest.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you provide some clarity on the major transmission projects that you're currently working on right now? And what are the incremental opportunities that sit in front of you that could present some upside to your transmission budget?","James R. Hatfield","Well, our biggest project\u00a0-- I mean, we have several projects, as we talked about. Our biggest project is our Hassayampa in North Gila, Substation 2, which is about a $230\u00a0million spend that does not go into service until May of '15. So that's our big\u00a0one. Everything else is pretty fairly routine. We're always adding substations and adding capacity to make sure the system's robust. So between now and '15, I don't really see any incremental opportunities. Longer term, as growth picks up, we've got to do more and more transmissions just to support the system load.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Lucas with Nexus Asset Management.","Craig Martin Lucas - Nexus Asset Management LLC","I have another\u00a0-- I have a question about net metering. I know that this -- didn't head over the last couple of questions. But my question is that your guidance for next year, as well as your comments around the 9.5% ROE, are they assuming that the net metering issue is fixed within that guidance or does it\u00a0-- does your guidance assume status quo regarding TG?","James R. Hatfield","Well, as I said earlier, Craig, let's assume that Commission rules on the staff proposal, for example. That offset is a reduction in the LFCR. So again, there will be known net gross margin to APS until such time we have our next rate case.","Craig Martin Lucas - Nexus Asset Management LLC","Well, that may be true but it's obviously also true that about 0.5% of sales growth then would obviously benefit the company even though the money would go essentially to obviously properly incentive the real economics of solar and that cross subsidy. But obviously, there would be 0.5% of better sales coming through...","James R. Hatfield","The 0.5% is not going away. It's here and it's on the system.","Craig Martin Lucas - Nexus Asset Management LLC","Right, but I apologize. That existing solar customers would not change, but the continued growth in that class would obviously change, right?","James R. Hatfield","The growth\u00a0-- it would be so incremental and small as to not be noticeable in our '14\u00a0guidance.","Craig Martin Lucas - Nexus Asset Management LLC","I see. So basically, what you had would stay and then the stick would kind of the property attuned, let's say, going forward?","James R. Hatfield","Yes, I mean, again, it right now is 0.5%. We have about 20,000 residential installations. That's a small piece of the system. And any up or down of sort of installation is not going to really impact our key number.","Craig Martin Lucas - Nexus Asset Management LLC","I see. One more little question, though. Also, so if you're able to fix this through the cross-subsidy issue, that really\u00a0-- there's really no reason to go in for a rate case until the '16 timeframe. Is that kind of the way we should think about it, or beyond?","James R. Hatfield","This is U.S. nothing to do with our thinking of the next rate case.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just in comparing Slides 16 to 17 on '14\u00a0guidance, the gross margin stays about the same. Expenses stay roughly the same. Interest expense actually goes up. Tax rate sure is about the same. Is it because of the footnote that you've got a little bit of a bump up in your guidance versus '13? Is it because of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs? Where does the little bit of increase come from?","James R. Hatfield","Well, they come from our mechanisms: 1.5 a year Four Corners; interest in DNA is going to go up. But that's sort of\u00a0a-- and then that's sort of a difference in our guidance would be those 2 factors: a little higher gross margin; a little higher interest in G&A in 2014.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","But does the renewable energy programs and efficiency programs, they add a little bit, don't they, to make up for the gross margin loss or...?","James R. Hatfield","Well, we have the LFCR, which part and then we have the Renewable Energy Standard, which is our implementation plan. So any of the Arizona Sun projects, we know we're going to get 32\u00a0megawatts in '14\u00a0and that will help gross margin as well.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. I probably need plug in your '14 numbers and talk to Paul and get clear on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I just wanted to sort a follow-up with the\u00a0-- sort of, on Craig's question in maybe a different way. What I'm wondering here is what is the impact of taking away the subsidy on this 0.5%, let's just talk about going forward perhaps or in other words, what the sensitivity to\u00a0-- in other words, if you do away with the subsidy for solar, which seems to be precipitously defended by the solar advocates, what would be the impact on new installation? Could you give us a little bit of a flavor as to what would happen in terms of new solar, what you would estimate would happen as a result of new solar applications?","Donald E. Brandt","Well Paul, Don Brandt here. It's important to take our proposals in their entirety. And most importantly upfront, we said is the existing -- whether it's 18,000, 20,000 customers that are already on rooftop to grandfather them, so they're not impacted. If you like, there's a takeaway. To fix and we had 2 different proposals basically to fix the nontransparent subsidy that is inherent in the current net metering structure. But then, equally importantly is to provide an upfront transparent subsidy. We didn't recommend any specific number but our idea is a number that would continue to allow the rooftop solar market to continue to flourish in Arizona as it has been. But to do it in a transparent manner that in future years, every year, the Commission could reconsider that amount of subsidy to reflect: one, changing an overall public policy goals; but also, the expectation is that solar panel prices and installation costs will continue to decline dramatically as they have in the past few years.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, that sounds great. And I think it makes a lot of sense public policy wise. I guess what I'm sort of wondering is from what I've seen from the solar industry, they seemed almost apoplectic at the idea of changing this. Which would suggest to me that perhaps it would\u00a0-- it has a potential for threatening their business. And I'm not sure if that's because of just simply the profit margin that's associated with it or if it's because of the level of installations, or what have you, being less. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense as to, I mean, when you put forward this, I mean, do you think this would lower the level of solar deployment...?","Donald E. Brandt","It is lower. But we thought it was a fair and equitable solution. It's a customers issue balancing the interests of customers without solar and those that are going to elect to install solar. There's no expectation that it would decline. And just to sort of set the record straight, I mean, APS is one\u00a0of the strongest proponents of solar energy in Arizona and we have the record to prove it. Arizona has the largest percentage of per capita solar per customer in the nation. And this is a cost shifting and fairness issue, the current net metering structure. When it became apparent, we took action at the Corporation Commission that we believe is in the best interest of Arizona and all electricity customers. And we look forward to a constructive discussion that we started earlier this year. And as you point out, and I think you used the perfect word to describe it, but instead, we immediately became the target of intense political attack from Solar City and Sunrun and a few other organizations, that established organizations that twisted the facts, misdirected the conversation from the actual issue and proposed ideas that would further harm our customers. It wasn't a fight we sought, and we would have preferred to avoid it. But we had to set the record straight. We have an obligation to our customers, our employees and shareholders. And I think it's going to be very evident in what's been filed already with the Commission and their hearings middle of next month.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. Just to further\u00a0-- not to put too fine a point on it, but basically you don't see it having a material impact one\u00a0way or the other in terms of your projected sales growth to the level of sales growth going forward in terms of the foreseeable future the next at least 2 or 3 years. Is that the best way to think about -- am I correct in understanding that?","Donald E. Brandt","I think that's very correct. Kind of add my point of that, I'd direct you if you want to take a look at the editorial in the Wall Street Journal, the Monday before last, about how government is making solar billionaires. And that's how you get apoplectic behavior, when they feel their profit margins are threatened.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","James R. Hatfield","Thanks, Christine. That concludes our call.

At this time, all participates are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast, to review our second quarter earnings, recent developments, and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's President; and Daniel Froetscher, APS's Executive Vice President of Operations are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations Web site, along with our Earnings Release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because the actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our second quarter 2019, Form 10-Q was filed this morning, please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our Web site for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through August 15th.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our operating performance and financial management remain in line with our expectations for the year. As you know, weather provided above average revenue in the first quarter, and significantly below average revenue in the second quarter. Before Jim discusses the impacts of weather on our expectations for 2019 and details our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments. I have repeated many times over the years that our top priority every day is safety. The safety of our team, our customers, and our communities takes priority over all other objectives.","Recently, we experienced the loss of an APS team member, Rico Costello, from an event that occurred while performing planned underground construction work in Downtown, Phoenix. This event is being fully reviewed, and we continue to keep Rico's family in our thoughts and prayers.","Turning to our operations, Palo Verde generating station completed its planned refueling maintenance outage for Unit 1 on May 9th. Additionally, the Ocotillo modernization project was completed on budget and with all five units in service by May 30th. This valuable asset in the Metro Phoenix load pocket has been performing well, and is available to serve our customers through the summer peak. In preparation of summer, we not only ensure we have adequate generation resources to meet our peak demand we also prepare for the summer wildfire season. In fact, we work year-round to minimize the risk of wildfires. Our fire mitigation efforts include maintaining safe clearances, removing vegetation around equipment, physical pole inspection, coordination with fire and forest service authorities, and partnering with community organizations that educate the public on how to protect their property from wild fires.","As you know, on April 19th, we experienced an equipment failure at the McMicken substation battery storage facility. We're looking into the cause of the failure. At the site, discharge of the batteries has been completed. And we have now begun a forensic analysis. The review is progressing but will take time to complete. We will continue to post updates at APS.com\/mcmicken. Because safety is our top priority, we will temporarily be delaying our investments in new battery storage resources to incorporate our learnings from this incident. Accordingly the request for proposals, issued in April, for 60 megawatts of storage on our existing solar facilities, and a new 100 megawatt solar facility paired with 100 megawatts of batter storage had been put on hold.","I want to reinforce that we remain committed in investing in new clean energy resources, including battery storage. This delay simply reflects a thoughtful and responsible pause to ensure we move forward in a safe and informed manner. Although storage facilities are delayed, we will be issuing two new requests for proposals. The first RFP is for up to 150 megawatts of APS-owned solar generation to be in service by 2021. This solar generation will be designed with the flexibility to install energy storage in the future. The second RFP is for up to 250 megawatts of wind generation to be in service as soon as possible, but no later than 2022. These new RFPs will expand our renewable energy portfolio to about 2,500 megawatts by 2021.","On August 1st, we filed a preliminary integrated resource plan, or IRP, which includes a 15-year forecast of electricity demand and the resources needed to reliably serve our customers in the future. The IRP is designed to explore a variety of options. It can provide reliable and affordable power for our customers. In drafting the IRP, we worked closely with a diverse group of stakeholders. The stakeholder group was engaged, provided constructive input and valuable feedback. We appreciate the collaborative effort of this group and look forward to participating with interested stakeholders in the future.","Going forward, we project that our annual peak demand and energy need will both increase at a compounded annual growth rate of more than 2% from 2020 through 2035.this forecast incorporates future demand-side management and distributed generation. The future growth is primarily driven by population growth, economic growth, and changing customer trends related to electric vehicles and distributed generation. The final integrated resource plan will be filed with the commission in April of 2020.","Turning to our regulatory updates, at their June open meeting, the Arizona Corporation Commission implemented a requirement that APS file a rate case no later than October 31, 2019, using a June 30, 2019 test year. At the July open meeting, the ACC resolved a customer complaint, and ordered APS to implement additional customer education and outreach programs. The commission also approved an electric vehicle policy implementation plan at the July open meeting. The EV policy implementation plan is intended to support EVs, EV infrastructure, and the electrification of the transportation sector in Arizona. The plan encourages utilities to propose EV pilot programs focusing on infrastructure, incentive, and cost recovery among other items, to the commission by September 1, 2019.","We're aligned with the commission in exploring the opportunities electric vehicles present to advance our clean energy objectives. Our goal is to make driving EVs more convenient by reducing range anxiety through access to charging infrastructure. Our new Take Charge AZ pilot program does just that. Take Charge AZ provides charging infrastructure for fleets, workplaces, and multifamily housing communities, as well as highway fast charging infrastructure. We're also exploring innovative strategies to own and operate the fast charging stations, while partnering with local businesses to identify the most useful locations. On July 30th, the Commission held a workshop discussing both staffs draft retail competition rules and Commissioner Olson's recommendations on retail competition among other challenges, the proposed retail competition rules report with the Arizona constitution, put reliability in jeopardy required the creation of the regional transmission operator or Independent System Operator and conflict with the interest in establishing clean energy rules.","It report sponsored by Arizona energy policy group and prepared by concentric Energy advisors analyzing retail competition over the past 20 years was filed with the commission on July 26th, the report illustrates it states with three paled competition higher residential rates than traditionally regulated states recognizing the potential negative impact on residential customers and the challenges I discussed, we, no doubt, believe that retail electric competition is in the best interest of our customers are the State of Arizona.","As I mentioned at the beginning of this call, safety is our top priority after we recently became aware of a customer's passing last September we temporarily stopped residential tower disconnects for non-payment. Subsequently the Arizona Corporation Commission issued a temporary rule proposing a statewide moratorium on disconnects through the warmest months into mid October. Addressing the needs of vulnerable Arizona and is a statewide objective that's why we have committed to work with a broad range of Arizona stakeholders to develop solutions that help ensure Arizona have access to assistance when they need it most.","In closing, as a company, we have so much to be proud of, in 2019 Public Lands Alliance awarded APS, the corporate Stewardship Award for our support of the Grand Canyon Conservancy. The annual award recognizes a company that demonstrated exceptional achievement to enhance the quality of visitors experience in Americas public lands.","In addition, we are in the AEI Advocacy Excellence Award for our efforts around the defeat of the 2018 ballot initiative. This award highlights of Public Policy engagement of DEI member companies like APS. I'm continually honored and proud to work with such a dedicated and talented team, we remain focused on preparing to meet the future needs of our customers and continuing to deliver long-term value to our investors.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don, and thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. We earned $1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $1.48 per share in the second quarter of 2018. The lower results were largely due to unfavorable weather as shown on slide 2 of the materials.","Adjusted gross margin was down $0.53 per share compared to the prior year's second quarter period. Higher sales the LCR and transmission revenues were more than offset by unfavorable weather, which negatively impacted gross margin by $0.31 per share to understand the magnitude of weather May was accruals May since 1980 in the Memorial Day high temperature and Phoenix slide for the coolest on record.","Additionally, June was accruals in the last few years. Also contributing to lower gross margin work lower other margin and refund to customers due to tax reform. This quarter we had a negative net impact from tax reform due to the timing of the FERC corporate tax rate plan to customers, which was implemented in June of last year.","Continuing with the drivers lower adjusted operations and maintenance expense positively impacted earnings $0.20 per share, primarily due to lower planned outage costs and lower parent level costs last quarter I shared that we will be implementing lean principal initiative to continue our track record the past management discipline and streamlining our processes.","This process of part of a larger effort, what we are calling customer affordability to identify sustainable savings that have a positive impact on customer bills by simplifying the way we work over the past few months, we have engaged many employees from across the enterprise and hosted workshops within five ways to streamline our processes deploy technology and ultimately reduce costs while this effort will take time to mature. We continue to manage cost, consistent with our historical track record.","Turning now to Arizona's economy, as you can see on slide three, the state's focus on growth is continuing to pay dividends. In particular, we continue to see datacenter and other manufacturing development on the West side of Metro Phoenix. Last week, Microsoft confirmed plans to build three world-class datacenter campuses in Goodyear in El Mirage. Construction on all three sites has begun and Microsoft tends to power the facilities with a 100% renewable energy.","In addition, Nike announced plans to build a multi-million dollar manufacturing plant in Goodyear bringing approximately 500 jobs to the area. Last month, Compass datacenters announced the construction of its first of two data centers, which are projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The two datacenters are expected to utilize 72 megawatts of new load. Going forward Compass datacenters expect to campus grew up 350MW with the non-side 230 KV substation.","As a result, the Metro Phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average. Through May of 2019 employment in Metro Phoenix increased 3% compared to 1.7% for the entire U.S. Construction employment increased by 11.6% and manufacturing employment increased by 4.5% the strong job growth in the construction sector in easily be seen and downtown Phoenix. Numerous job sites equipped with cranes and staffs of construction crews are visible across the downtown area. We expect business expansion and related job growth to continue to support economic development. The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend. In 2019, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 2,900 compared to 2018 driven by single family permits. We believe that solid job growth and income growth and relatively no low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market in the economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average.","Reflecting the stay improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.8% in the second quarter of 2019. We expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona remain.","Turning to guidance on our financial outlook, as we look to the second-half of 2019 we continue to evaluate our financial expectations and opportunities, as Don mentioned, we are temporarily delaying investment in new energy storage although the projects are delayed our total projected capital expenditure levels through the forecast period remain the same. We have reallocated the capital that would have been on energy storage to accelerate other distribution and parcel projects.","Also, with the change in timing of for our next rate case, we have reevaluated our financing plans. As a result, we will not require any additional equity or parent level of long-term debt for the remainder of 2019. However, we will continue to have a strong equity layer, the equity ratio at the end of the test here was approximately 54.7% despite the mild weather in the first-half of the year we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share.","However, I would guide you to the low-end due to weather today. The third quarter represents over 60% of our full-year results and as we have experience whether in the third quarter can vary significantly keys to success we'll be managing our costs, the impact of increases in customer load primarily from the data center as I mentioned earlier and normal weather for the remainder of 2019, a complete list of our key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on slide six and seven of the materials.","We expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2019. This excludes any funding for the refinancing of APS with $250 million at 2.2% senior notes which mature in January 2020. Overall liquidity remains strong and that concludes our prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Don Brandt","Hi, Michael.","Jim Hatfield","Hi, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Thanks. Thanks for the update. Do you have any kind of update on what's going on with the Four Corners SCR step up order at this point?","Jeff Guldner","Michael, it's Jeff. So the -- as you know, we've got a recommended opinion and order out on that. It went through a hearing process. It has not moved to the commission yet, and I think given the timing of the upcoming rate case, there's three potential as you could see. It could go before the case gets filed. It could be decided some time while the case was pending, or it could end up just being consolidated with that rate case, and then both the rate case and that decision being voted out, but we don't have clarity as to which of those passes on.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. And on the rate case filing, there was some discussion I remember at the commission meeting about that it's a tight deadline to get done by October 31. I'm just wondering if you guys are -- or how you're coping with that deadline at this point.","Jeff Guldner","Yes, it is paid, it normally takes about six months to put a case together, but we just had to accelerate the work that we're doing on it. So it's in process of being prepared right now, and we'll hit the target.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","It is sort of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again with this. This commission thinking about the efficacy of retail competition ultimately based on my history of looking at the state, I would tend to agree with your view of the outcome. But what is the timeline and the next milestones that we should look forward to over the next, I don't know how long period of time that we get to a point where we know sort of that commission has been fully educated on this and we might get a better view as to the next steps.","Jeff Guldner","Greg, it's Jeff. This was discussed at the commission staff meeting yesterday and I think what not surprisingly what they're looking for is more information on what the potential impacts are, what the technical issues would be, all the analysis that you would need to make a decision on whether it's appropriate to move forward. I think it is clear on that that they're going to have another workshop on it and they're working on getting additional questions and whether that next workshop will provide enough information. As you know this is a really complicated issue to work through particularly in the situation that we're in without being already in an RTO or an ISO. And so I think watching for that workshop probably in October will be the next milestone. And then how it progresses from there is hard to see right now.","Greg Gordon","Can you refresh my memory though I mean last time we went through this process, there were very, very large number of educational sessions like that before they came to the conclusion that they shouldn't move forward. Can you refresh my memory roughly how they that last processed it?","Jeff Guldner","So last process actually took multiple years and it started kind of similar to how the California, the California Blue Book process started as they'd broken into a number of different working groups, so a legal working group, technical working group and again that was before you had retail competition in a lot of states. But it took multiple years of folks working through the different issues and then it took multiple years to move forward on the implementation path that we were pursuing then, until the California energy crisis hit. And that's what put everything on hold. And then we had to unwind some of the work that had been done during that process. But I don't know that it would take as long this time given that there's been more experience in retail competition, but as if you're actually talking about standing up in RTO. There is a lot of issues that you have to work through particularly how it would interface with California and what impact it would have since we're participating in the energy imbalance market and crediting customers with hospice and sales revenues that we get from that. If you stop doing that, because you stand your own RTO up, that's going to affect all customers. And so they've got to work through a lot of these technical issues, I think to come to the conclusion of whether to move into a formal rulemaking or how that formal rulemaking would develop.","Greg Gordon","Last question for Jim, as I look at the guidance drivers on Page 6 and I think about you guiding towards the low-end of the range, because whether and I think, should I just be flexing, the adjusted expected gross margin down towards the lower end of the range or are there other moving parts here? Other share count is obviously a bit lower given the change in the financing package. But inside those guidance ranges, can you give us some sense of what the moving parts are?","Jim Hatfield","So, I would say that O&M would be towards the lower end. Thinking about R3 sort of things, we have to focus on O&M. I think sales will be within the range. We had really fairly strong residential sales in the first-half. We had a commercial customer at a one-time outage that hurt commercial sales. But I would think with pursuing the impact of data centers can depend upon the timing that they actually come on that there is a little flap there. And then I think you'll see gross margin towards the lower end just due to weather as we go forward.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you, gentlemen.","Jim Hatfield","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Julian. Just had a question around the renewable RFPs that you said you will be issuing shortly. Any sense as to like what the associated CapEx spend with those will be?","Don Brandt","Well, I don't think there's no incremental CapEx associated with that. As we go forward, we had battery storage and we had other renewable baked in our plan. So I'll -- we'll know more when we get to the actual art piece back by that I don't see any incremental capital at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you. And maybe Can you talk a little bit more just about the plan going forward as far as energy storage? I know the investigation is ongoing. Can you talk a little bit as to the sense of the timing of when you will know more and when you'll be able to kind of proceed more on the plan there?","Daniel Froetscher","There is Daniel. To your point, the first phase of the main event investigation has been completed. And we've moved on to the second phase as the forensic phase, if you will, of the actual equipment to the first phase involved to just charging the remaining modules at the mechanism, facility, ","I have to say a little bit to speculate to a specific timeline. I know that the second stage forensic look, will involve a couple of months. We're cautiously optimistic that we will have some returns back in the late September, October timeframe but that is speculation at this point. In the meantime, I think to echo, Mr. Brandt's comments, and his remarks. We want to make sure we approach this prudently, safely and with full confidence in the technology. And so, we're just on pause in that space at present.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Insoo Kim","Thank you. Starting with, I think the recent consideration for extending the gas generation moratorium I think the proposal or the consideration was that it would only be until early 2020. But if that were to happen and stretch out further, what other items do you have to offset any potential in a FIFO bill that you have in your CapEx plan?","Jeff Guldner","Insoo, this is Jeff. Just to clarify if the gas moratorium is extended. And if you look at the language of it, what it requires, is that if we needed to construct, so I just want to clarify to us that if we needed to construct that we would have to go get commission approval, essentially to do that, which I think and that's something we would do, irrespective of whether there was a moratorium in place. And it's limited to gas generation that's going to be likely discussed on September Open Meeting. But I don't think it would have any impact on capital.","Don Brandt","Yes. Also, it wouldn't prohibit PH-14 to extent that we needed to fulfill that need.","Insoo Kim","Understood and then in terms of the revised financing plan, you mentioned that the APS equity layer was around 54.8, I believe, at the end of 2019. And with no plans for additional equities, does that just imply that will be likely the amount that's filed in the upcoming rate case?","Don Brandt","Yes, I would expect that in the end of the test year, June 30, that you'll see the equity layer, approximately 54.7%.","Insoo Kim","Okay. Thank you very much.","Don Brandt","For a consistent and within our 538 to 558 that we've had historically, so -- ","Insoo Kim","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Jim Hatfield","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha","Hey. First question, on Slide 18, you laid out the implications for the Four Corner step increase, not taking place all the pluses and minuses? I just wanted to clarify, Jim, when you talk about sort of guiding towards the lower end of the range this year. Does that the Four Corners step increase does not happen this year? Or are you still counting on some earnings from that, even within that scenario?","Jim Hatfield","Well, Jeff, talked earlier about the path going forward. So again, we don't know that path. But assuming we get it or don't get it, we're still going to be towards the low-end of guidance, just based on the practice I talked about earlier.","Ali Agha","I Got you. Okay. And then secondly, more general question, you've had a couple of new commissioners come on board this year. Just wondering, your current interactions with the commission, in general, how are you seeing that today versus say 18 months ago, 12, 18, 24 months ago, in general, as you're dealing with the commission on various issues?","Jim Hatfield","The commission's dynamic. So you always have changes when other commissioners come in and that they'll have different priorities. And so, we're kind of in the process, we try to make sure, we're open and explaining the issues and the policies we are seeing.","Ali Agha","And in general, the interaction has been similar?","Jim Hatfield","It's similar. I mean, it's challenging, because when you get into rate case issues, and you get index party situations, you can't discuss pending matters. And so, depending on how busy your docket is, that affects sometimes how much interaction that you can have.","Ali Agha","Right. And then lastly, Jim, also I wanted to clarify, as you mentioned, in this rate case filing, you won't need any equity, as you plan out long-term and you've laid out some longer-term CapEx plans. When are the earliest you think equity comes back into the scenario for you guys?","Jim Hatfield","I don't really have a view on that today. And progress is found on the right case and gain a constructive outcome, and we'll go from there.","Ali Agha","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Good morning on the IRP. Don, if I could just make sure I got this right. The 2% CAGR in low growth between 2020 and 2035 that is net of distributed generation?","Don Brandt","Yes.","Charles Fishman","So that's like a wow, huh?","Don Brandt","Yes, that's I said it was both peak demand and energy. We expect to grow at that bigger 2%.","Charles Fishman","So is this -- you had that one slide with all the data centers? That's some of what's driving this, I guess all of the above. But those things are huge. Energy users, correct?","Don Brandt","Yes, they are. We're very attractive areas due to low probabilities of natural disasters and reasonable prices on energy, living conditions for their employees, very attractive for energy centers. But as we look out the window here, there's cranes all over Downtown Phoenix, And if you drive around the valley and other growth areas of the State, there is a lot of activity going on and I continue to hear from developers that labor shortages is the only thing that's holding some of it back.So we're pretty convinced there's a lot more to happen here in Arizona.","Charles Fishman","So when Microsoft says they're going to source it with renewables, is that the standard thing, or that those renewables could come from other locations? They're just saying that to offset what they use in Arizona?","Don Brandt","Yes, Charles, we did a special contract arrangement with Microsoft, which allows them to do something that in the industry is similar to what's called a contract for differences. So it lets them go out and construct renewable energy kind of wherever and we give them a market cost price. And so it gives us flexibility to the customer to go out and achieve the energy objectives that they're looking for. And so that was a relatively unique tariff arrangement. But we're looking at, again, it's a model that we can apply to other data centers and we expect to see more data centers and we've tailored our rate designs to also be attractive to these high load factor customers. And just to underscore the benefit of this for all customers, when these customers come on because they're using a system, it increases the efficiency that we are able to use our system and it actually takes price pressure off of other customers.","Charles Fishman","Right. Last question, I didn't slug my way through they IRP. Just a little bit I read. I see what you talk about the importance of natural gas, but is there - do you address the actual need to build some more natural gas in addition of all the renewables and storage in the IRP?","Daniel Froetscher","Charles, this is Daniel. We don't make the distinction, if you will, from a natural gas build standpoint. Given the deferral and the whole status of our energy storage, we've obviously come forth with the interest for the additional solar and wind. Gas has been, will continue to be needed as a bridge fuel, as a peaking resource while we move through the next three to five to seven years, and that will inform our decisions relative to additional gas acquisitions either through PPA or should we have better candidate at some point having discussions about build.","Jeffrey Guldner","And Charles, this Jeff, just the policy issued to watch on that and how the IRP and the stakeholders are engaging, this is kind of a fundamental policy issue around this future of clean energy. Do you have a 100% clean energy, is that the path that you move to with the understanding that getting that last 10% or 20% could be very expensive, or do you move more quickly and have gas involved in the resource mix, but then electrify and move things on to a lower carbon system. And so that's going to be a policy issue to get out further in pass the five to six, seven year horizon that I know we're going to have that discussion. I expect we'll have it in Arizona, but it's similar to what you're seeing around the country I think.","Charles Fishman","Okay, fascinating. It sounds like it's worth reading the rest of the IRP. Thank you. That's all I have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Hey, good morning.","Don Brandt","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson","So there was this emergency moratorium on shut off. And I just was wondering where that stood? Is it still - did they make this a final rule or not and what's your experience been so far with a rear edge if you follow me or sometimes when you have these moratoriums you have these problems where people who have tight budgets stop paying their bills and then get behind and what have you, I'm just wondering if you guys have experienced anything like that or if you have any update on that?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes, Paul, this is Jeff. The emergency rules are in place. The emergency rules are meant to be in place while the commission conducts a formal rulemaking on whatever the disconnect policy will be going forward. And so, the emergency rules are in place through the summer and then the formal rulemaking is likely to start fairly soon. We are seeing and we report to the commission what the rear edges are. And they've asked for monthly reporting on that, and you're right. As expected, we're seeing the rear edges go up. And so one of the things that we're focused on is how we're going to engage and Don mentioned it, how we're going to engage customers with community support organizations on October 15th when the moratorium comes up and we know we're going to have circumstance where a lot of customers will be behind four months of summer bills. And so we're working forward with how we'll deal with that, with the number of stakeholders who are engaged in supporting those customers.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then just to back to Greg's questions regarding the retail choice issue, I mean, having been around long enough to remember when this was a fad in parts of the country and how it became not so much, it is a little bit surprising seeing sort of the enthusiast -- I mean you guys have put forward a report and what have you. There has been considerable amount of process already and there still seems to be at least on the part of a few of the commissioners, it seems a lot of enthusiasm for this. And the staff, I think, seems to be sort of okay with everything but residential switching or at least that seems to be where they seem to voice their concerns. So I guess what I'm wondering is, if you could give a little bit more color as to why so much enthusiasm for something that we're hearing actually sort of unpopularity around, at least from consumer groups and what have you around parts of the country?","Don Brandt","I do. And certainly you can read Commissioner Olson's letters and if you watch the workshops, he's certainly proponent of broad retail competition, commissioner Burns -- Chairman burns, I'm sorry, has been proponent since he has been on the bench. I think the staff's concern is, let's make sure we do understand all the consequences, all the potential impacts. And so it's not a new pressure, it certainly has more attention now. But we've worked - on the commercial side, in our last couple of rate cases and putting some creative by through provisions that allowed those customers and some customers to go out and kind of working through us go out and secure power resources for themselves, it's a limited number of megawatts that can do that because of the need if you scale that up, you've got to get an RTO in place.","And so we've done it to where we can accommodate it, but there is interest in saying can you go do more? And I think you're right. I mean, this is primarily something that is of interest to the large commercial customers who see an opportunity to go out and buy on an energy-only basis.And part of what you have to talk about is how do you fairly reflect the capacity value that the incumbent utilities fleet spring to the system? And so that's where a lot of the interest is. And residential, I think they're interested in talking about it. But that's a really hard one to do and certainly hard to do Community Choice Aggregation. I think it's probably impossible to do Community Choice Aggregation without being in an RTO and having some kind of underlying mismatch going on.","Paul Patterson","Okay, I appreciate. Yes, I have been. I have been at the hearings. It's little exhausting, but you guys have so much going on there. Thanks again and have a good one.","Don Brandt","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Management, for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Mountain, Director of Investor Relations for Pinnacle West Capital Corporation. Thank you Mr. Mountain, you may begin.","Paul Mountain","Thank you, Jerry. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and Webcast to review our second-quarter 2015 earnings, recent developments, and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt, and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Senior Vice President of Public Policy and Mark Schiavoni, APS's Chief Operating Officer, are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will using are available on our Investor Relations Web site, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our second-quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those the contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our Web site, and it will also be available by telephone through August 6.","I'll now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thanks Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. Before Jim discusses the second-quarter results, and our updated financial outlook, I'll provide a few operational and regulatory developments.","Our operations continued to be strong this summer, despite a couple of short-lived but powerful storms here in Arizona. On the regulatory front, we are focused on rate modernization, and exploring technologies that may improve customer options while maintaining the reliability of our system.","The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station had a solid first half of the year. In early May, Palo Verde completed the Unit 3 planned refueling outage in less than 30 days. This is the third time that Palo Verde has completed a planned outage in less than 30 days, and the first time for Unit 3.","We have two transmission projects to update you on. First as we call it, Hang 2, or the Hassayampa to North Gila 2 line, a 500 KV transmission line was energized in late May, as we planned. This 112-mile line is an important project for reliability in southwest Arizona.","Second, the Cal ISO announced the winner of the bidding process for the Delaney to Colorado River transmission line earlier this month. Our bid, submitted by TransCanyon, was not selected. The winning bid was cited by the Cal ISO as having the lowest revenue requirement of the five bids received.","We are analyzing the process to inform our bids on other projects, but we were comfortable with the discipline our team demonstrated on the DCR bid. We did not have CapEx for this project in our projections. We will continue to pursue transmission development opportunities in the Western United States consistent with our strategy, and look forward to future successes with this team and our counterparts at BHE US transmission.","Solar also continues to be an important area of investment and research. Our utility scale program, AZ Sun has two 10-megawatt projects in the Phoenix metropolitan area that are expected online in the third quarter. These two projects will bring the program total to 170 megawatts.","Our APS solar partner program, where APS will be installing and owning residential rooftop solar on 1,500 homes, equal to 10 megawatts, is now being rolled out. We had our first installation earlier this month, completed by one of the local Arizona installers who is also a member of the Arizona Solar Deployment Alliance.","Our team continues to sign up customers on the selected feeders we've chosen for this program. This innovative program allows us to conduct research in collaboration with EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute, on maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of distributed solar generation, and its interaction with the grid.","Our understanding in this area will better inform our efforts to create a modernized rate structure tailored to our customers' energy needs.","On a related note, we are in the early stages of a 200-home rate study intended to provide insights on how solar, storage, and other technologies interact with demand rates, aimed at reducing electricity used during peak periods.","Similar to our 10-megawatt program, we will work with local Arizona installers on this program. APS will own 75 of the systems, while another 125 systems will be customer-owned, with those customers receiving an incentive for their participation in the research project.","This is an exciting new program that will allow us to realize several benefits. First, customers can take charge of their energy envelope by learning how to manage their energy use during peak times.","Next, local installers can remain viable in our economy, and evolve as the market and new technologies evolve. And here at APS, we can better learn how to manage these advanced technologies, and the demands they place on our system, all of which will enable us to continue to safely provide our customers with the reliable electricity they've come to expect.","Both of these programs are leading edge in our industry and will be the first time a utility has had full control of a large number of advanced inverters in the field to perform testing.","APS is partnering with several providers to drive this technology in a direction that makes it easier to integrate and results in greater benefits for both customers and grid reliability. On a related note, in the recent JD Power residential survey, APS improved its score in all six of the study's categories, and ranked in the top quartile among 54 large investor-owned utilities.","On the regulatory front, we're focused on advocating for rate modernization and laying the groundwork for our rate case filing, which we still expect to file next year. Rate design continues to be an important priority across the country.","Other Arizona utilities have made filings to modernize their rates, and California has taken steps to begin modernizing their rate structure. UniSource Electric followed a rate application on May 5, which includes several proposed changes to rate design in line with what we have advocated for, and similar to what Salt River Project implemented this past spring. Tucson Electric and Trico are expected to file a rate application later this year, so both of them recently withdrew their net metering specific filings.","The proceedings at each of these companies will be interesting to monitor; however, our grid access charge filing is based on a precedent we have from the 2013 net metering decision. Since then, we have seen steady growth in rooftop solar applications and installations, with May and June showing record levels.","Our proposal would not fully resolve the cost shift, but rather is intended to be an interim solution until the issue is more fully addressed in the next rate case. Other components of the future rate design would include use of the demand charge on a broader scale, and sending better price signals to customers by modifying the time of use rate structure.","Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We have a clear investment plan which gives me confidence in our rate base growth.","Given the unique strength of our balance sheet, we are well-positioned to execute on our plan and also return capital to shareholders in a predictable and sustainable manner.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don. The topics I will cover today include a discussion of our second-quarter financial results, an update on the Arizona economy, and a review of our financial outlook.","Slide 3 summarizes our GAAP net income and ongoing earnings. For the second quarter of 2015, we reported consolidated ongoing earnings of $123 million, or $1.10 per share, compared with ongoing earnings of $132 million, or $1.19 per share for the second quarter of 2014.","Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I'll highlight a few of the more significant drivers. Lower gross margin decreased earnings by $0.02 per share. I'll cover the drivers of our gross margin variance on the next slide.","Higher depreciation and amortization expenses decreased earnings by $0.07 per share. Similar to the first quarter, this variance includes the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals and costs associated with the acquisition price.","G&A expenses were also higher due to additional plant in service. Lower interest expense, net of AFUDC, benefited earnings by $0.04 per share. The decrease largely reflects reduced interest charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt at a lower rate.","There is not an operations and maintenance expense variance on this slide, since it is flat year-over-year, as higher generation expenses, primarily due to the effects of planned maintenance, were offset by lower employee benefit costs.","Turning to Slide 5, I'll cover a few of the key components of net decrease of $0.02 in our gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales, after the effects of energy efficiency, customer conservation, and distributed generation increased 0.3% in the second quarter of 2015 versus 2014, although the earnings impact was immaterial.","Collectively, the adjuster mechanisms continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.10 per share primarily to the Four Corners adjuster that went into effect on January 1. Offsetting Four Corners expenses are included in the other drivers, primarily D&A, which I mentioned earlier.","The effect of weather variations decreased earnings by $0.06 per share. This year's second quarter was milder or less favorable than normal, while the second quarter of 2014 was warmer, or more favorable compared to normal conditions.","In total for the quarter, cooling degree days on an 80-degree base were on par with normal conditions, but this one statistic does not do justice to the variance in daily weather we experienced throughout the quarter. In particular, the entire month of May and the first half of June were quite mild, followed by a snap to high temperatures in the second half of June.","While we saw usage behavior very much in line with expectations, once the hot weather arrived in mid-June, prior to that period, weather-sensitive usage remained well below where our models would have predicted, an indication that our customers took advantage of the mild conditions to essentially not use much air conditioning at all.","With 21 days in May below 95 degrees for the high temperature, and most overnight lows in the low 70s or 60s, the typical heat buildup we would expect to see did not materialize, and allowed customers to ignore a handful of warm days that did occur during the month.","The net effect of lower transmission revenues decreased quarterly results by $0.04, driven by a formula rate true-up in the second quarter of this year, included in our annual filing in May. We anticipate transmission revenues will be a positive driver for the full year.","As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude expenses related to the renewable energy standard. Energy efficiency and similar regulatory programs, all of which are offset by comparable revenue amounts under adjustment mechanisms.","Also, the impacts of our non-controlling interest for the Palo Verde lease extensions are treated in a similar manner. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, so there was no net impact on second-quarter results.","Slide 6 presents a look at the Arizona economy, and our fundamental growth outlook. Arizona's economy continues to grow, much like it has in the past several quarters.","Job growth in the second quarter in Arizona in the Phoenix Metro area remain data were above the national average, as they have for 14 of the last 16 quarters. As seen in the lower right-hand side of slide 6, Arizona added jobs at a 2.2% year-over-year rate. For the first six months of 2015, Arizona has added jobs at the fastest rate since the first half of 2007.","As I've mentioned before, business services, healthcare, tourism, and consumer services are the sectors with the strongest job growth. Each of these sectors is adding jobs at a rate of between 3% and 7% over the prior year, and is helping to fuel continued demand for office and retail space in metro Phoenix and elsewhere.","Absorption of vacant office space in Metro Phoenix has averaged between two million and three million square feet per year since 2011, and similarly, absorption of vacant retail space has run at about two million square feet per year.","As seen in the upper right-hand side of Slide 6, vacancy rates in these sectors continue to work their way down from their highs in 2010, and new investment activity in these sectors has picked up. Almost four million square feet of office space is currently under construction, virtually all of which is scheduled to come online in late 2015 or 2016.","A multi-building development by State Farm Insurance at Tempe Town Lake accounts for half of this activity. At only half a million square feet, retail construction can be considered soft at the moment, but with the vacancy rate below 8% in several sub-regions within the metro area and strengthening single-family home market, we expect retail construction to accelerate in the coming quarters.","Finally, as I have described before, the industrial building sector remains a source of strength for the Valley. Over the last couple of years, the amount of new industrial space added to the market has ranged from four million to eight million square feet per year, all of which has been absorbed.","At 11%, the industrial vacancy rate is at its lowest level since the beginning of 2008. Only two million square feet of industrial space is under construction currently, so we fully expect industrial vacancies to continue to decline and motivate additional construction in the coming quarters.","Turning to the residential sector, metro Phoenix housing permits were relatively flat for the first six months of 2015 on a year-over-year basis. However, there were some sizable shift between the single-family and multi-family sectors.","Single-family sales and permit activity were up about 35% over the prior year, while new development in the apartment sector slowed considerably. Our expectation for year-end housing market permit activity can be seen in the panel at lower left.","The dynamics we are seeing in the residential housing market today are influenced by incredibly tight vacancy levels in apartments, rapidly increasing apartment role rates, continued low interest rates maintaining a higher level of single-family home affordability, and the expiration of the mortgage blackout period for the first substantial wave of foreclosed homeowners.","Back in 2008, 37,000 homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure in metro Phoenix alone. In 2009, 43,000 homes were foreclosed upon. After seven years, these families will now have much more accessibility to owning a home while homes remain quite affordable.","In addition to the favorable trends in job growth and the prospects for new construction, Arizona consumers are also participating in the recovery. Real consumer spending on retail and restaurant and bar sales increased by 10% in the second quarter, the best rate in 10 years.","Purchases were led by home and garden sector, and new auto sales. Steady income growth, improving consumer confidence, and lower gas prices are all contributors to this most recent surge.","In summary, we can see continued healthy job growth, especially in certain sectors, providing the momentum for absorption of commercial space in vacant housing, which in turn is providing for an environment of increased investment and new development.","As I have mentioned before, Arizona and metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is positioned relative to the high-cost California market. We expect 2015 to be better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending, and new construction.","Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.2% compared with the second quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.","Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.","Slide 7 outlines our financing activities. Our balance sheet continues to be one of the strongest in the industry. We are now rated A-minus or better at all three rating agencies. In May, Fitch announced its upgrade to APS's senior unsecured rating to A from A-minus, as well as similar upgrades to Pinnacle West and APS's corporate credit rating.","Additionally in June, Moody's upgraded APS's senior unsecured and corporate ratings to A2 and Pinnacle West's corporate credit rating to A3. In connection with these rating actions, the rating agencies cited the Company's strong financial and credit profile, as well as increasingly constructive and supportive regulatory environment in Arizona.","In terms of our recent financings, on May 19 APS, issued $300 million of 10-year, 3.15% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from this sale were used to refinance the $300 million 4.65% May maturity. Also in May, APS purchased all $32 million of the Maricopa County 2009 Series B Pollution Control Bonds which we may later remarket. Overall, liquidity remains very strong.","At the end of the second quarter, the parent Company had no short-term debt outstanding, and APS had $158 million of commercial paper outstanding.","Finally, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continued to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2015 will be in the range of $3.75 to $3.95 per share.","A complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included on Slide 8. The adjuster mechanisms and cost management remain important drivers, particularly in the second half of the year.","We have maintained our earnings per share guidance but adjusted certain line items, primarily due to what we have realized year-to-date for gross margin and interest savings, while moving planned coal unit outage from 2015 into 2016.","Our guidance assumes normal weather. Our rate base growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018, and we continue to forecast that we will not need additional equity until 2017, at the earliest.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Shahriar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","On the rate design changes that you're seeking, how should we think about that from a timing perspective, with a potential filing for GRC next year? And is there an opportunity to reach a conclusion with the rate design prior to you filing?","Jeff Guldner","This is Jeff. So part of the discussion that has happened out here, is when you make a more structural change in rate design to be more sustainable, you do that in a general rate case filing.","And so that would be part of, normally you go through revenue requirement phase and then rate design is the second phase of the filing. And so I think that's what we're expecting to happen right now.","Don Brandt","Next question","Operator","The next question is from Dan Eggers, Credit Suisse","Dan Eggers","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers","Hey, just on the housing outlook and the home builders have been pretty constructive on the Phoenix market, what do you think is the follow-through if you look at what's queuing up for this year and for next year? Is that having an effect on moving up the distribution CapEx for next year, just you're seeing more pull through or what's the linkage of those two right now?","Jim Hatfield","We're not, Dan, seeing a big increase in distribution spend currently as we are queuing up for the market, but keep in mind that there are lots out there that are already improved, meaning they have basic services already installed.","We think that the beginning of the customer growth will take relatively less capital, although as the inventory builds, we will have to move up distribution capital, and hope to capture as much of that in the next rate case as we can.","Dan Eggers","Okay. And on guidance for this year, that's taking -- that's excluding the $0.09 of negative weather that you have incurred this year. Is that correct?","Jim Hatfield","In terms of the guidance for this year, I really see four key elements of driving growth in the second half. First of all, our adjuster mechanisms, so we'll see a higher benefit year-over-year from LFCR.","Obviously, Four Corners came in this year, Arizona Sun, as we complete projects in metro Phoenix, and then the TCA will be higher as we look toward accruing a FY16 filing. We expect to see positive usage in the second half, year over year.","We are, as I said in my remarks, we have moved a fossil outage so we expect O&M to be down, as we have less planned maintenance in the fossil fleet this year. And then, we expect the interest savings to continue throughout the year.","So that's really what's driving the second half of the year. In terms of weather, I'd say this. If you remember 2011, we were $30 million other under on weather in the second quarter. We reduced guidance, and we made it all back in the third quarter. So weather is what it is. We'll continue to manage those factors I just mentioned.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Got it. Jim, can you explain the transmission adjustment, the $0.04 negative? What caused that true-up to go negative on you this year?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I think if you remember, as we file every year at FERC, we plan what the next fiscal year is, and we can accruing that increase as we're earning it throughout the year. The big issue in the May true up was really the late passage of the deferred tax which reduced rate base and reduced our ask, so that was a catch-up adjustment. Every year we've had catch-up adjustments, most of the time, they're very minimal. This just happened to be a bigger adjustment than we normally have.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning.","Don Brandt","Good morning, Dan.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I suppose first question, just in terms of the grid access charge, what kind of a decision are we looking for here? Are we going to get tangible numbers?","A - Jeff Guldner","Julian, this is Jeff. The next step in that proceeding is going to be a recommended opinion order from the administrative law judge. And the issue that's teed up right now is procedural.","So it's do we move forward with a substantive proceeding on increasing the grid access charge from its current level, or do we wait until the next rate case and do it through rate design? And so we haven't seen, we're expecting it soon, but we haven't seen anything yet from the judge.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right. Excellent. And second, moving back to transmission here for a second, I'd be curious what kind of complementary opportunities do you see this latest large-scale line back to California, as well as can you elaborate a little bit more on the other opportunities inside the context of your partnership here in the Western US, that you're evaluating?","Jim Hatfield","I would comment on pipeline in terms of our partnership with Berkshire. Much like DCR, which we're very disappointed we didn't win after working four years on that development, on that subject I would say that us and our partners are very proud of our disciplined approach, but there's other opportunities in the pipeline much like DCR. DCR was an economic project.","Much of the other we're pursuing at this point will be reliability type projects. And so I would say our partnership continues, and we're pursuing other types of transactions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Are there any complementary opportunities arising out of DCR?","Jim Hatfield","Not for us. No.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. Great. And then lastly on the solar front, you all have obviously had a pilot going on for a little bit here. I'd be curious, either outside of the context for a rate case or in the context of the subsequent rate case, is there a thought to scaling up your pilot to a full-scale deployment of a rooftop program at APS?","Don Brandt","We'll be looking at that as this pilot program folds out over the next couple months. Certainly a potential opportunity.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Although presumably that would necessarily need to be addressed in any more formal filing? IE the rate case?","Don Brandt","Not necessarily. We'll get to that when we get to it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. All right. I won't belabor the point. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. A couple of my questions have been answered. I just had a few more. I just wanted to get a clarification, the earnings guidance, Dan asked a question, Eggers asked the question on earnings guidance. Your earnings guidance reflects what's happened with the weather year-to-date, and you still expect to be inside your guidance range; correct?","Jim Hatfield","Correct.","Greg Gordon","Okay. The second question was, just looking at the detailed slide on page 16 of your CapEx forecast, it moves around every quarter, and it's moved around a little bit again this quarter, and distribution CapEx has moved and traditional generation CapEx has moved up a bit in 2016.","Can you comment as to -- I'm sorry, distribution has moved up, and generation has moved down a bit. Can you comment on whether that's a pull forward or whether that's other factors?","Jim Hatfield","Distribution, we pulled about -- a few million dollars from distribution into 2016 from 2017, and with the Ocotillo being delayed a year, we pushed back a little generation to 2017. All in all, I think if you look and those all up, the projection for the three years has not changed. It's really been cash flow between years.","Greg Gordon","Right. Great. And then on cost profile, notwithstanding just the deferral of an outage into next year from this year, you still have a bunch of programs in place to try to keep O&M flat relative to kilowatt hour sales growth. Correct?","So if you were to have some fluctuation either up or down in expected economic demand for power, you feel like you have the ability to flex your O&M to maintain your margins?","Don Brandt","Yes, we do, Greg.","Greg Gordon","And then finally going into next year, and up until the next base rate case is finalized, you still do have some significant cost saves that you'll be able to capture from the Palo Verde lease refinancing; correct?","Jim Hatfield","Right.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jim Hatfield","Thanks Greg.","Operator","We have a question from Charles Fishman, Morningstar.","Charles Fishman","Hi, Thanks Don, you mentioned the UNS Tucson filing. How good of a proxy is that for any kind of change in rate design? As far as similarities of solar penetration, and things like that?","Don Brandt","I don't think it's a very good proxy. Their service territories are very much different. The sources of generation and traditionally, the rate design has been significantly different in Tucson than across APS. Jeff may be able to add a little more color to that.","Jeff Guldner","Charles, this is Jeff. Remember, we've got about half our customers on time use rates, and we're also one of the only utilities in the country that has a significant amount of residential customers on a demand rate, and so we've got about 10% of our customers today on a residential demand rate with time of use.","And so we certainly are going to be involved in the proceeding in Tucson and watching that, but we have historically had different rate structures than both TEP and SRP. And so we'll watch it, and we'll see if -- there's obviously procedural things we'll want to be paying attention to, and conceptual stuff that we'll be talking about.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Thanks. That saves me some work looking at it. That's it.","Operator","We have a question from Ali Agha, SunTrust. Please go ahead sir.","Ali Agha","Thank you. First off, I just wanted to clarify the timing on the interim fixed charge that you have applied for. I think I heard you say ALJ is to opine on just the logistics of when that should be looked at. I know you'd asked for an August implementation, so is that not realistic now or how should we look at the sequence of timing?","Jeff Guldner","Ali, it's Jeff. Originally, we had asked for an August implementation date. Now, the process would be if the ALJ issues a recommended decision that says -- and the commission decides based on that decision, the ALJ will issue a proposed decision, the commission will presumably hear it at an open meeting, and then the decision would be if you move forward, you're going to have a proceeding after that. So that's going to push it into later in the year, at least.","Ali Agha","Okay. Got it. Separately, Jim, if you look at your results on an LTM basis, what's the earned ROE you'd be earning right now, based on the calculation, the way you look at ROE?","Jim Hatfield","Weather normalized would be in excess of 9.5%.","Ali Agha","Okay. But the weather impact in last couple of quarters will pull it down?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. But again, you have to weather normalize the quarters. In both the first two years of this year and the last two quarters of this year, and last two quarters of last year.","Ali Agha","Right. Okay. And then, you had mentioned that you expect, as you go through this year and beyond, customer growth, usage patterns, et cetera, to pick up.","So far as you've been looking at the data, is there following that pattern, looking in July and into the rest of the year as well, I think 0% to 1% from a weather-normalized load growth perspective, you were looking at for electric sales, any more granularity in that? Should we think of midpoint of that or how is it's trending as you're looking for the rest of the year?","Jim Hatfield","Well, as we build our forecast for 2015, we expected we'd see acceleration of customer growth and sales growth throughout the year. So as we look to the second half of the year, we would expect sales growth to be higher than the first half of the year. And what materializes, we'll wait and see, but we feel pretty confident that we'll be between 0% and 1% sales growth.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then last question, I know you had mentioned it in your comments as well in terms of equity 2017 at the earliest. So is that going to be driven more by credit matrices and liquidity profile, as opposed to the regulatory needs that you've said before you don't need to equitize for the rate case filing? What would be the trigger in your mind, when it's the appropriate time to raise new equity?","Jim Hatfield","We'll certainly look at our credit metrics. And we'll look at where we are in the regulatory cycle, obviously, with the rate case filing in 2016. But we're sitting here today with an equity ratio at APS of about 56%. Very strong balance sheet, so we have a lot of flexibility in financing our CapEx program with long-term debt.","Ali Agha","All right. So given that, reiterating, you said before you don't need any equity for the timing around the rate case, basically?","Jim Hatfield","Correct.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead sir.","Steve Fleishman","Just wanted to clarify, if you look at your slide on the factors and guidance for 2015, so, it looks like you lowered gross margin $30 million versus last quarter for the year. You, to the positive, lowered O&M by $20 million and to the positive lowered interest by $20 million. The $30 million on lower margin, is that just the weather impact year to date?","Jim Hatfield","It's weather. It's also transmission. And keep in mind, we would have had originally all of the Four Corners rate increase that we got about $8 million less, so we incorporated that in this quarter as well.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then the lower O&M of $20 million is that pretty much the delay in the outage to 2016?","Jim Hatfield","That's correct.","Steve Fleishman","And then the interest savings, is that just all refinancing benefits?","Jim Hatfield","Yes. We've realized significant interest savings in the first half of the year net of AFUDC. So we expect that to continue.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And net interest savings is an ongoing benefit?","Jim Hatfield","Until the next rate case.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Got it. That was it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead sir.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Congrats on a pretty good quarter. Real quickly, looking at the transmission rate change, I'm looking at Slide 17, that $18 million, that, basically the best way to think about that is seven months of that in 2015, five months of that in 2016, but did you actually book the charge for all of that in this quarter, or will it flow through from an income statement impact over the next 11 months?","Jim Hatfield","We booked the true-up adjustment in May. So I would think of it more as a one-time. In that regard, it will flow-through to FY16, but we're also booking on top of that reduction, the increase we expect to file in FY'16. So net-net, it's a positive for us.","Michael Lapides","I hate to respond this way, but I'm totally confused.","Jim Hatfield","Okay. What we'll do, we'll take it off line and we'll have Paul call you after the call and walk you through the timing of our PPA.","Michael Lapides","That sounds fine. One other item. Any update, I know you've talked at length about the need for Ocotillo. But any update at all on either a process for a need for other gas-fired generation, whether it would be under PPA or whether it would be something you would actually go out in the market and buy and own, if you could get it at an attractive price, or do you feel that once Ocotillo's done, you're good through the end of the decade?","Jim Hatfield","We have a couple of significant PPAs rolling off by 2020. We have the 515 megawatts at Gila River in 2016. And then we have a toll on Arlington through the summer of 2019. Obviously, we'll have to -- we'll look at how we replace those that capacity in the context of our reserve margin, and we feel like we have great optionality as we move forward, as it relates to a PPA or some other outcome.","Michael Lapides","Do you have to file and go through an RFP process to either replace either the Gila or the Arlington PPA?","Don Brandt","No. So we don't follow the California process. That's not done here. We do an IRP, so there's an IRP where we talk about it. And then we follow essentially best practices when we're out doing procurement of power resources. But it's not like it's strictly regulated. It's like the California process.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Thanks. I'll follow up with Paul off-line. Much appreciated.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Von Riesling, Mizuho.","Jim von Riesemann","Hey guys, good afternoon.","Jim Hatfield","Hi Jim.","Jim von Riesemann","Hey, two quick questions. The first one is, could you just talk about the cash flow impact an extension of bonus depreciation might have on you?","Jim Hatfield","So what passed the Senate, which would be a two-year extension is approximately $200 million of cash, and you can think of about $100 million a year that we would realize from the extension of bonus depreciation.","Jim von Riesemann","Fair enough. And then second question is, given the fact that the interest expense is coming down so much, net of AFUDC, where do you think your embedded cost of debt is going to be at the end of the year?","Jim Hatfield","I don't know. It will be roughly in the 5% range. Down from high-5s in the last case.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Hi. Good morning. Most of my stuff has been asked and answered, but I want to follow up on a few things. One was on Ali's question about the sales growth. I understood what you guys said about 2015, but I'm wondering with this 0.5% to 1.5% through 2017 as being a potential range, has that changed at all?","Jim Hatfield","It has not changed from the prior guidance. Obviously this year, it's 0% to 1%, 0.5% to 1.5% by definition means just acceleration through 2017 of growth.","Paul Patterson","Okay. So what we've seen in terms of the weakness so far, you don't think that's going to -- there hasn't been any change, in terms of where you might see that range?","Jim Hatfield","No.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then on the DCR, it sounded that you were talking about the potential for reliability projects. But that seemed to indicate that perhaps because of your experience, and I just want to check on this, that you're not perhaps interested in the kind of opportunity that DCR had.","And I'm just wondering if you could talk about what the takeaways from this process have been. Is it just basically Abengoa and Starwood? What would you say was their competitive advantage, was it simply cost of capital? What do you think is the dynamics in that, if you could share with us your thoughts about any\u2026","Jim Hatfield","I think the Cal ISO cited that Abengoa Starwood partnership would have the lowest revenue requirement over the life of the project. It's simply a cost and I guess as we look at what we did in the four years of development, we're very comfortable with our process, and our bid.","And we are not going to go out and buy projects, just for the sake of buying projects. We're going to continue to focus on earning a strong return on a project that we can comfortably site and build in the timeframe and a dollar amount we bid.","Paul Patterson","I understand, but I guess what I'm trying to understand, I mean, I saw the Cal ISO report. What would you say was their competitive advantage? Obviously, they came in at a lower cost, but is that because their return requirement you think is less, or do you think in general that there was some deal in terms of the ability to construct these things or what have you?","I'm just trying to get a sense as to what the competitive environment is, and whether what you saw happen there, and it's not just them, there are other competitors, whether you think that isn't going to be an area of interest going forward, in general? Do you follow what I'm saying, or is there something unique to that situation?","Mark Schiavoni","This is Mark Schiavoni. To answer your last question first, no, we're open to all projects. This is the first one that's gone through this type of process. So there's things to learn as a result of what happened, not just for us, but there were five finalists, as you may be aware of. And until we can look at the structure of what they did, it's very hard for us to sit here and really try to answer your first question, as far as what did they do that we didn't do or should be doing? That will come in due time.","We've had conversations with Cal ISO. We've opened that door. We want to learn from it. And as Jim said, we're not going to increase our risk, just to get a project.","We're going to do things the way we've always done it, measured risk. And then bids for it, for whether it's reliability or economic. It really doesn't matter to us. And our partner feels the same way. So we're confident that we'll continue to play in this space for the near-term.","Paul Patterson","Okay. That's great. I thought maybe you guys had more insight on what was going on there than I did. So I appreciate that. We'll find out maybe more later. Thanks.","Don Brandt","Thanks. This is Don. Let me underscore what Mark said here, both we and our partner at Berkshire are very disciplined in this approach. And we're here to make thoughtful investment decisions, and not to buy a project. And this is one of many to come.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Mr. Mountain, at this time there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to you.","Paul Mountain","Okay. Thank you, everyone. That concludes our call and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Your may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"17341":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call May  2, 2018 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Stefanie Layton - Director, IR","Donald Brandt - Chairman and CEO","James Hatfield - CFO","Jeffrey Guldner - EVP, Public Policy, APS","Daniel Froetscher - EVP of Operations, APS","Analysts","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Insoo Kim - RBC","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Operator","Greetings. And welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation 2018 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our first quarter earnings, recent developments and operating performance. Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Jeff Guldner, APS's Executive Vice President of Public Policy; and Daniel Froetscher, APS\u2019s Executive Vice President of operations are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information.","Today's comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.","Our first quarter 2018 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language, as well as the Risk Factors and MD&A sections, which will identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through May 9th.","I will now turn the call over to Don.","Donald Brandt","Thanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. In the first quarter of 2018 we executed on our priorities and remain well positioned for a solid year. Before Jim discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments.","The installation of selective catalytic reduction or SDR emission control equipment at the Four Corners Power Plant was completed on April 24th on time and under budget. This project provides substantial environmental benefits, including a 90% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions at the plant.","On April 27th, we filed for a $67.5 million step increase to recover our investment in these improvements. The step increase is an effective tool that eliminates the need to file a full rate review immediately after the conclusion of our last rate review and provides rate gradualism for our customers.","The commission previously approved the use of a step increase for the SCR installation. We've calculated that the step increase request would result in approximately a 2% customer bill increase, which will likely be offset by a reduction in customer bills from other adjustor mechanism decreases. We\u2019ve requested the commission approve the rate increase effective January 1 of 2019.","Turning to our operations, Palo Verde generating station had another successful quarter operating at full capacity. A planned refueling outage for Palo Verde unit 3 began on April 7th and is proceeding very well.","Additionally construction activity is on track for our Ocotillo Modernization Project. The units at Ocotillo are expected to come online in the fall of 2008 18 and the spring of 2019 to meet our 2019 summer capacity needs.","Technology continues to play an important role, excuse me, an important role in the efficiency of our operations. In 2012 APS became one of the first utilities in the nation to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones and shared airspace. Since then the use of drones for inspecting lines, building substations, monitoring solar fields, citing new power lines, inspecting storm damage and accessing hard to reach areas has produced significant savings for our customers.","Looking to the future, our resource plan is designed to achieve a cleaner, sustainable energy mix that is anchored by Palo Verde, the largest carbon free electric resource in the United States. In fact, we've already reached a significant milestone in this effort.","At the end of 2017 over 50% of our energy mix was carbon free. Our next integrated resource plan filing scheduled for April 2020 will continue to support the goal of achieving a clear sustainable energy mix and we\u2019ll incorporate updates as the commission's discussion around a possible energy modernization plan progresses.","We recently announced our plan to issue multiple resource RFPs this year. On April 26 we issued an [RFP for 800] megawatts of peaking capacity within in-service date of 2021. The peak period is between June and September and from 3 pm to 9 pm.","We also plan to seek competitive proposals that utilize Arizona forest bioenergy solutions and that provide battery retrofit opportunities for APS owned solar facilities. These RFPs are part of a comprehensive effort to meet our resource needs beginning in the early 2020s. More specific information about these solicitations will be released in the coming weeks.","As you may be aware, an out of state group primarily funded by California billionaire Tom Steyer has filed a ballot initiative that would require some Arizona utilities to obtain 50% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030. The sponsors must gather approximately 226,000 valid signatures by July 5th to place the proposal on the November 2018 ballot.","This initiative is overly prescriptive and irresponsible. Pinnacle West is actively opposing this ballot proposal. The initiative seeks to impair Arizona's oversight and regulation of utilities which has provided Arizona residents with some of the safest, cleanest and most reliable and affordable energy in the country over one hundred years.","It would enshrine in the state constitution a regulatory mandate that is bad for customers, potentially doubling the average customer electricity bill by 2030. At least, 13 chambers of commerce including the greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, in addition to numerous other local organization - organizations have voiced opposition to the ballot initiative.","The sponsor\u2019s campaign contains inaccurate information about clean energy, its economic impacts to the state and the cost to customers. We believe it's important for customers to have accurate information to make an informed decision if this proposal is on the November ballot.","As a company that's dedicated time not only providing safe, reliable and affordable electricity, but also to maintaining and improving the communities we serve we will continue to actively oppose this proposal.","Lastly, I would like to share with you that crews from Arizona Public Service were part of a nationwide mutual assistance effort coordinated by the Edison Electric Institute to assist Puerto Rico with power restoration following Hurricane Maria. We said 83 line workers and support staff, as well as 42 vehicles to Puerto Rico in mid January when our crews returned on March 31 restoration on the island had reached 95%. Crew members who took this special assignment are proud to have helped. Throughout their deployment they did more than just restore power on their own time and their days off. They immerse themselves in the community helping to clean up storm damage, rebuilding homes and providing household essentials to families in need.","One of our crew members even bought a bicycle for a child so that he could ride with other neighborhood children. I'm extremely proud of how each and every one of these individuals represented our company in the state of Arizona.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim.","James Hatfield","Thank you, Don. And thank you again everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2018 which were in line with our expectations. As shown on slide three of the materials for first quarter of 2018 we earned $0.03 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the first quarter of 2017.","Slide three also outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. I\u2019ll highlight a few of the key drivers.","Adjusted gross margin was up $0.13 per share compared with the prior year first quarter period, supported by the rate increase, higher transmission revenues and higher sales related revenues. Deposit factors were partially offset by effect of the federal tax rate change and unfavorable weather.","Specific to tax reform, the financial impact decreased gross margin by $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2018, including a reduction in customer rates passed through our tax expense adjustor mechanism, or TEAM and estimate reductions was always a maintenance tax changes in our wholesale transmission rates.","You will notice there is not offsetting effective tax rate driver initiative for the quarter. To refund the customers through their TEAM is based on a per kilowatt hour sales credit and will generally follow our seasonal kilowatt hour sales pattern. The impact of the lower federal income tax rate is based on pre-tax earnings and were more closely aligned with our quarterly pre-tax earnings pattern. As a result there will be timing difference throughout the year.","Looking now to operating expenses, higher adjusted operations and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.18 per share, primarily due to higher planned outage costs related to the SCR installation at Four Corners Unit 4.","Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.09 per share. The increase is primarily related to the higher DNA rates approved in the 2017 rate review orders and planned additions.","Also on slide three, new quarterly driver related to pension and other post-retirement benefits non-service credit. We adopted the new pension accounting standard in January resolving in the presentation of non-service credit component and other income. In addition we are no longer capitalizing a portion of the non-service credit.","In 2018, the change changing capitalization, combined with the increased returns increased pre-tax income by approximately $7 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, from the 2017 reg review order, we were granted accounting deferral related to Four Corners SCR's installation and the Ocotillo Modernization Project. The drivers I discussed a capital deferral associated with the Four Corners SCRs as there was no net impact on the first quarter 2018 results.","Turning now to Arizona economy, as it continues to be an integral part of our business story. Arizona Metro Phoenix continues to be an attractive place to live and do business. Arizona's population surpassed 7 million in 2017 and Maricopa County has been ranked as the fastest growing county in the nation for the past two years. The Metro Phoenix area continues to show job growth above the national average.","This February, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 2.8% compared to 1.5% for the entire US. The Metro Phoenix employment rate at 4.4% also reflects the strength of the job market.","The solid job growth continues to have a positive effect on Metro Phoenix areas, commercial and residential real estate markets. As seen in the upper panel of slide four, vacancy rates in the commercial markets continue to fall and are at levels last seen in 2008 or earlier.","As a result the increase in activity and low vacancy rates about 6 million square feet of new industrial space was under construction at the end of Q1. Additionally about 4 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter as well. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market which will in turn support continued commercial development.","Metro Phoenix has also had growth in the residential real estate market. As you can see in [lower parts] slide four housing construction is expected to continue the upward post-recession trend. In 2018 housing permits are expected to increase by about 4000 compared to 2017, driven by single family permits.","To reduce - reflecting the steady improvement in income conditions. ABPs has retail customer base to 1.7% in the first quarter of 2018. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed.","In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2019 will be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share. The rate increase, our adjustment mechanisms and sales growth will remain important gross margin drivers, which we expect will be partly offset by higher profitable planned outage costs and higher other operating expenses related to more plant and service and for the entire DNA and property tax.","As a reminder, we have higher focused planned outage cost in the first half of 2018. a complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our guidance is included in the appendix to our slides, which has been revised to reflect the changes in guidance related to the adoption of new pension and other postretirement benefits accounting standard I disused earlier.","We continue to expect to issue up to $600 million of long-term debt at APS this year and overall liquidity remain very strong. Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% percent on average through 2020. The company also continues to expect to achieve an annual consolidated earnings return on average common equity of more than 9.5% through 2019.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning, good afternoon.","Donald Brandt","Hey, Julein.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So I just wanted to understand a little bit more about the O&M situation. As you roll forward in the \u201819 and \u201820 because I know that you've talked about before some of the other outages and upgrades that are going on. Can you just elaborate a little bit and perhaps give a little bit of a preview on how you're thinking about the cadence of the O&M normalizing off this, this higher figure if you will?","Donald Brandt","Go for it.","James Hatfield","So we'll be done with major work in Four Corners and you know, we've gone through really two to three years here where we've had increased outages preparing for the SCRs, as well as the combined cycle. As we get beyond 2018, we would expect with Navajo closing for one thing next year and just more normal run rate on the coal units, you're going to see that more normalized outage O&M be in that 40 million, $45 million range, what we had prior to 2016.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, right. So the normalized level being more than 13 to 15 range rather than 16, 17, 18 as you said.","James Hatfield","Yes, right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And actually you brought up another dynamic to keep Navajo open, there were some recent media indications that there was some potential hope there, but can you elaborate on that and obviously it seems like a small detail to you, but is there any interest in maintaining any megawatts on a contracted basis or otherwise and or would you receive proceeds if this were actually to happen?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yes, Julien. Its Jeff. So the Navajo situation is obviously being led by SRP since they're the operator of the power plant and so there's been a lot of activity over the last year on that. But I don't think the current situation has changed.","I think there's an effort going to see if they could continue to operate that plant after the other owners have left. But just watching that continue to develop. It's really in SRP hands.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Just curious on some of the comments about the ballot initiative. I really don't really want to go into the ballot initiative, I'm going to go in the economics of renewables which is - do you see the addition of incremental renewables to your system using costs that are - that folks either bid into PPA, as raising or lowering the all-in cost to customers right now. And then if you could think about where you think this is going n over the few years, kind of give your view on how you think that plays out?","Donald Brandt","Well Michael, it depended on how one approaches it and one does it and if one does it in a constructive, deliberate fashion working with the company obviously and the commission towards a goal that's good for our customers and good for the environment it can integrate quite well. In this case 50% renewables by 2030 is relatively ridiculous and the costs are extreme and the impact on the rest of the company's operations would have a dramatic impact - dramatically negative impact on cost.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you. Can you also talk about upcoming RFPs and supply needs and can you remind us there were some pieces of the last rate case settlement that kept Arizona Public Service from being able to self supply and then other aspects of that where you could actually be a supplier. And I'm thinking both for renewables and for conventional generation?","Jeffrey Guldner","Michael, this is Jeff. So we've got RFPs out - we can get you the language in the last - in the last settlement. There are exceptions and provisions to that. So you know, we continue to move forward with RFPs and the timing of that is in the 2020, 2021 timeframe.","To Don's point, you know, one of the things we do and when we do these RFPs is we're resource agnostic in some cases, so when we go out for a peaking capacity RFP we don't specify the resource and people have bid in. We saw that a bid that came back in our last RFP for that, that was actually a combination of renewables and batteries. And it came in as the most economic resource for the need that we were trying to fill.","So to that point you can use these RFPs in a way to constructively build in the portfolio and to continue to develop renewables, but it's better to do it in a thoughtful way.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then one for Jim, the increase in transmission revenues does that drop to the bottom line or is that just - and it looks like it does. And is that just to the higher transmission rate base year-over-year or some other factor?","James Hatfield","So that is really third-party winning - or contract wins. These come off as a revenue credit when we do our next formula rate. So it has a benefit of the year when it happened, but it is a bottom line impact.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with RBC. Please proceed with your question.",": Insoo Kim","Hey, thank you. My first question is on the CapEx plan, especially in 2020. The current plan that you guys have in place, I assume, incorporates the replacement, I guess, generation that you guys were contemplating the previous RFP. Given the potential changes that you may make with regards to renewables and the more cleaner resources, could that number, all else being equal, trend up in the next revision?","James Hatfield","I mean, it could - it turns out for several reasons, but we - as you can see on the chart we have new gas generation which is really Ocotillo, finishing up in the first quarter of '19, as Don alluded to and then we don't have anything in 2020. So obviously things have changed with battery storage and other things, but nothing currently contemplated.",": Insoo Kim","Got it. And then in regards to whether normalized sales growth, I think year-over-year on the drivers tables you guys had a pretty meaningful increase. I was just looking at the appendix in the back and weather normalized retail sales were \u2013 it seems like it was down 24% percent, unless I'm reading something wrong, what\u2019s the\u2026","James Hatfield","What you have is the same dynamic we really had in the fourth quarter last year, which is even though quantity is down slightly, you do have pricing, when people are using the power, benefiting. So put those together you do have revenue [growth based on sales]. But it's not quantity driven, its more price driven.",": Insoo Kim","Got it. Okay, so the benefit was more price driven, okay.","James Hatfield","Yeah.","James Hatfield","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","Thank you. First question, as you pointed out the rate base growth you have is you know, 6% to 7% percent. Recently you also raised your dividend growth target to around 6%. So when we think about you know, your earnings outlook from the 2018 base with O&M with normalizing et cetera, as you mentioned going forward, is it fair to say that EPS growth will pretty much be in line with how you're looking at rate base and dividend growth going forward?","James Hatfield","Yeah, we don\u2019t give earnings growth targets, but we've always talked about the earnings growth over the long-term being sort of bracketed by rate base and obviously the board looked at earnings growth when they raised the dividend in October, so\u2026","Ali Agha","Yeah, okay. And then also you know, Jim one of the other things you also talk about is as you're thinking about \u201818 through \u201820 on a consolidated earned ROD basis. You know the plan is earn 9.5% or higher. I know there's no sort of ceiling per se on consolidated earned ROE, but how should we think about that realistically? Can you theoretically earn more than 10% on a consolidated basis or is that a good proxy to think about in terms of if things are going in your favor et cetera, as we think about 9.5% being really the target to be on the floor?","James Hatfield","Well, we\u2019re locked in at APS and Pinnacle relies on APS for most of its earnings. So let's say could we go above Pinnacle's consolidated level, we could, but that's not likely because the APS was going to be you know, on that \u2013 probably less than 10% ROE, so I don't know exactly how else you get there.","Ali Agha","Got it. And the delta between, say, consolidated and EPS would be \u2013 is that good rule of thumb to think about?","James Hatfield","What? I'm sorry, Ali?","Ali Agha","Or on ROE, when we think about APS and consolidated is that a good rule of thumb to think about what the delta is?","James Hatfield","Well, you have APS and you're going to have holding company debt and some other things. So yes, I think looking at APS as a starting point and then going from there is a fairly good way to construct that.","Ali Agha","And lastly, just reconfirming, you were talking about the timing differences on how tax reform is, you know, given back to customers the impact, but on an annual basis just to be clear, it should merit itself out right, so the annual impact will still be neutral, is that right?","James Hatfield","Yeah, it's the timing between quarters and we have a slide in the appendix on slide eight, that actually shows pre-tax earnings expected spread and sales expected spread across the quarter. So that gives a good look at sort of the mismatch.","Ali Agha","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Can you talk about the energy efficiency and DSM filings that I think are still pending approval. My understanding is that the energy efficiency program you were looking at trying to attack more peak load reductions to ease the duck curve ramping and that might reduce some of lag that you experienced between customer growth and load growth?","Jeffrey Guldner","Yeah, Michael. Its Jeff. It's really reflecting the change. The duck curve is part it, but it's the idea that you've got situations where you want to encourage load and consumption in the middle of the day. And so traditional programs like light lightbulbs that don't really look at the time difference aren't as effective in the environment that we're in. And so we've - we haven't looked at trying to shift that more in towards attacking the peak, which is really where you can grab more value out of the programs.","So they\u2019re still being reviewed by the by the commission. Not sure when that's going to work its way out, but that's probably the trend that's going. And you know, assume you have to assume some level of customer adoption for that to happen, so.","Michael Weinstein","All right. And then you indicated that electric sales went to normalize or improving this quarter. And you know, how many quarters in a row do you think you'd need before you started - where it started to flow into long-term guidance?","Jeffrey Guldner","I don't know that we would do much with guidance. At this point, we had fairly modest sales growth of near half or 1%, 1.5%. So you know, a little upside would be good. You know, I - based on where we are, I don't really see that happening right now. But we will take that - we'd go to update guidance later this year if it happens.","Michael Weinstein","Is there a certain number of quarters you'd like to see to make sure the trend is shaping up?","Jeffrey Guldner","No.","Michael Weinstein","No, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","In the first quarter rate relief was basically offset by tax reform timing impacts, the right way to think about this on that on an annual basis and that's about $20 million?","James Hatfield","There should be no impact from income tax because\u2026","Paul Ridzon","But we though actually is income tax offsetting part of the rate increase and that delta is about $20 million?","James Hatfield","Well, we had a rate increase of slightly less than $90 million and the rate reduction for the tax impact is 119, but 119 doesn't really impact the bottom line over the course of the year. So\u2026","Paul Ridzon","All right\u2026.","James Hatfield","Yeah.","Paul Ridzon","What was weather relative to normal?","James Hatfield","So whether relative to normal is off about $0.09 or $13 million and it really relates to heating degree days that the residential side was way down year-over-year.","Paul Ridzon","You also have year-over-year down $0.09, so last year was essentially normal is that\u2026","James Hatfield","Yes, that's correct.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Fishman","Hi. I think that this question is for Jim, I just want to make sure I understand this. If I look at slide six, you\u2019ve added this line under income, excuse me, $45 million to $55 million and that's primarily the new accounting for pension?","James Hatfield","Correct.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And then on O&M, go ahead.","James Hatfield","It was embedded in O&M previously.","Charles Fishman","It was included in O&M?","James Hatfield","Yes.","Charles Fishman","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s okay. But sort of that leads to another question. Now you have this other line to manage although it was included no O&M but the accounting is treated different. So you're going to have to manage that as part of your commitment which I respect and a lot of other people do that you know, to hit that 9.5% ROE, now you have this other line to manage. Is that going to be change the way you manage the pension fund?","James Hatfield","No, and we had to manage it before. We feel good about our pension funding, 95% funded on a GAAP basis. OPEB is actually overfunded. So we feel good about the line - all the accounting treatment did is take - separate your service from non-service pension OPEB costs, that's all it did. So no difference in how we would approach the business.","Charles Fishman","Okay, got it. Thank you. That's all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson","Good morning. How are you?","Donald Brandt","Good.","Paul Patterson","So just a few quick ones here. The Steyer initiative, you guys - do you have just any thoughts on how that might impact sort of broader turn out in the upcoming election? And just any other thoughts about how you see some of the things that we might think about, about sort of the local stuff down there that we should think about? I know it's always, away, I apologize for that. But just any thoughts that we should have in terms of the upcoming election?","Donald Brandt","So Paul, November is, in political talk, a light year away, so that can happen between now and then. The most critical aspect on this ballot initiative is a big if, whether it qualifies for the ballot or not. And we'll take a one step at a time. Going forward we are actively opposing it and pretty much universally across the business community people understand the implications that are all negative for Arizona, for our customers and basically all the residents of Arizona.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Fair enough. And then just we've seen some M&A activity out there, and I'm sure you guys have been watching this as well. Just any thoughts about what you're seeing there in terms of what some of these companies are going for? And - I don't know, so if the leverage, in some case, is deployed and just sort of your own balance sheet? How attractive you guys might be?","And - I don't know, any thoughts that we might have or any thoughts you guys have - excuse me, in terms of how - what you're seeing out there? Any sort of - any insights you might have with respect to that?","Donald Brandt","Well, just as you do, we stay abreast of what's going on out there. And every transaction is unique to that \u2013 those companies involved in that particular transactions and \u2013 I\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Thanks so much.","Donald Brandt","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day."],"17343":["Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (NYSE:PNW) Q3 Earnings Conference Call November  9, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Stefanie Layton \u2013 Director of Investor Relations","Don Brandt \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Jim Hatfield \u2013 Chief Financial Officer ","Daniel Froetscher \u2013 APS' Executive Vice President of Operations","Barbara Lockwood \u2013 APS' Vice President of Regulation","Analysts","Michael Weinstein \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Insoo Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Stefanie Layton, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everyone for participating in this conference call and webcast to review our third quarter earnings, recent developments and operating performance.","Our speakers today will be our Chairman and CEO, Don Brandt; and our CFO, Jim Hatfield. Daniel Froetscher, APS' Executive Vice President of Operations; and Barbara Lockwood, APS\u2019 Vice President of Regulation are also here with us.","First, I need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using our available on our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today\u2019s comments and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements.","Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our third quarter 2018 Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and MD&A sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.","A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 15. I will now turn the call over to Don.","Don Brandt","Thank you, Stefanie, and thank you all for joining us today. Throughout this year, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet financial commitments. The Pinnacle West Board also displayed confidence in the company\u2019s outlook by approving a 6.1% dividend increase, effective with the December 2018 payment.","Before Jim discusses the detail of our third quarter results and guidance, I\u2019ll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments, including the ballot initiative and certain elections. Our operations team did an excellent job, maintaining the generating fleet and electrical grid again this summer. Our workforce quickly restored service to customers after several storms toppled a combined 451 poles, which is almost as many as the 2016 and 2017 summers combined.","The Palo Verde generating station also performed well, with all 3 units operating at a combined 97.3% capacity. To meet customer demand and increase our clean energy mix, we issued 3 request for proposals this year. We\u2019ve received bids on our request for forest, bioenergy solutions, peaking capacity and energy storage. Our energy storage RFP is particularly noteworthy because it will allow customers to use energy from our existing AZ Sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating the bids and anticipate making our selection for each in the late 2018 or early 2019 timeframe.","Our capital investment program continues to be robust, supporting investments in clean energy resources and maintaining safe and reliable service for our customers. Approximately 51% of our distribution capital investment from 2018 through 2020 will be driven by customer growth. For generation-related investments, the installation of 5 new fast-start flexible generating units at the Ocotillo power plant is on track to be completed in the second quarter 2019.","Turning to our regulatory updates. The hearing for the Four Corners step increase request concluded on September 7. On September 24, the Arizona Corporation Commission staff filed its closing brief, which recommended a $58.5 million step up in revenue compared to our filed request worth $67.5 million increase.","Next, the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order. The step increase request will then be scheduled for an open meeting and the ACC will issue a decision. APS\u2019 installation of pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant is part of our continued investment in a cleaner energy future.","We commissioned the selective catalytic reduction equipment earlier this year and now are achieving an 88% reduction in nitrous oxide emissions. In August, APS filed their second request with the Arizona Corporation Commission to return an additional $86.5 million in tax savings to customers beginning January 1, 2019. If approved, the second layer savings from tax reform will offset the requested Four Corners step increase. The total tax savings for customers, when combined with the first reduction implemented in March of 2018, would be $205.5 million.","Over the last 20 years, our price increases have been below the rate of inflation. With the rate reductions from tax reform and other price reductions, customer rates will be lower at the end of 2018 than they were at the beginning of the year.","As required by the 2017 rate review decision, each year, the resource comparison proxy must be recalculated to determine the amount new rooftop solar customers will receive for the generation they export back to the grid.","Beginning October 1, 2018, the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a rate of $0.116 per kilowatt hour, which is 10% less than the previous rate of $0.129 per kilowatt hour. This reduction continues to move the amount received by solar customers or excess generation closer to our avoided cost and further mitigates the cost shift between solar and non-solar customers.","Lastly, on October 1, the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded its hearing regarding a customer complaint, alleging the average residential bill increases higher than the average approved from the 2017 rate review order. We\u2019re confident that the rate increase was implemented appropriately and is consistent with the rate review order.","Final briefs in this matter are due on November 16, and a recommended opinion in order will subsequently be issued by the administrative law judge. We anticipate that commissioners will issue a decision in this matter in 2019. As you are aware, Arizona held its midterm elections on November 6. While the Corporation Commission race has not been officially declared, as of this morning, Commissioner Olson and Republican Rodney Glassman are ahead of the Democratic candidates. Commissioners Dunn, Tobin and Burns will continue serving through the remainder of their terms, ending in January 2021.","Importantly, the residents of Arizona voted overwhelmingly to defeat Proposition 127, insuring the energy policy in Arizona will continue to evolve in a thoughtful and constructive manner. With Proposition 127 behind us, we can now work with stakeholders to establish forward-thinking energy policies that move towards an increasingly clean energy mix.","Arizona is number three nationally in solar energy installed, and our APS energy mix is already 50% clean. We\u2019re on the cutting-edge of advanced battery storage technology. Arizona is uniquely positioned to achieve a cleaner energy mix with our abundant solar resource, leadership in advanced technologies and Palo Verde generating station, the largest clean energy generator in the nation.","Additional infrastructure investments will not only support our clean energy focus, they are also necessary to support our robust customer growth. Maricopa County was the fastest growing in the United States the last 2 years in a row. We estimate that 340,000 new customers will move into the APS service territory by 2030, and our customers' energy needs are expected to increase by more than 30% over that same period. Significant investments in new resources, including grid infrastructure, cleaner power generation and advanced energy technologies will be required to support Arizona\u2019s growing economy.","Let me conclude by saying that I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s commitment to our customers and our community. We not only supported the effort to protect Arizonians, but we also remained focused on our operational performance and delivering on our commitments. Our capital investment opportunities and emphasis on cost management continue to create value for our shareholders.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. I\u2019ll discuss the details of our financial results, provide an update on the Arizona economy and introduce 2019 guidance.","As shown on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2018, we earned $2.80 per share compared to $2.46 per share in the third quarter of 2017. Slide 4 outlines the variances that drove the change in our quarterly earnings per share. I\u2019ll highlight a few of the key drivers. Adjusted gross margin was up $0.04 per share compared with the third quarter in 2017, supported by favorable weather, the price increase from the 2017 rate review, higher sales and transformation revenue, sales net of energy efficiency and distributed generation were up 1.2% in the quarter, driven by strong commercial sales growth and robust residential customer growth.","The strong commercial sales growth reflects the positive economic trends we have seen in the Metro Phoenix area. Offsetting drivers include the refunds to customers resulting from the federal tax reform, and a shift in the seasonality of revenue resulting from the residential rate design changes approved in the 2017 rate order review.","As previously discussed, the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers. The new rate shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non-summer months, better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve. Looking out to our operating expenses, higher adjusted operating and maintenance expense decreased earnings by $0.12 per share due to a higher cost at APS for transmission, distribution, customer service and information technology. And at the parent company level, for public outreach cost primarily associated with Prop 127.","Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, reducing earnings by $0.08 per share. The increase was primarily related to higher depreciation rates approved in the 2017 rate review order and plant additions.","Pension and other postretirement benefits, nonservice credits, increased pretax income by approximately $6 million or $0.04 per share in the third quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher market returns in the adoption of a new pension and OPEB accounting guidance for 2018.","Lastly, the refunded customers resulting from federal tax reform was positively offset by a lower effective tax rate. The net impact of pivotal corporate tax cuts in the quarter was of $0.14 per share benefit to net income.","Turning now to the Arizona\u2019s economy, customer growth and sales growth. Metro Phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average, as shown in the top panel of Slide 5.","Through August, employment in the Metro Phoenix area increased 3.1% compared to 1.6% of the entire U.S. Job growth is particularly strong in the construction sector. A sign of strength in the areas commercial and residential real estate markets. Construction employment has increased by 10.4% versus 2017. We expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial development.","The Metro Phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward postrecession trend as shown in the lower panel of Slide 5. In 2018, we expect a total of 30,000 housing permits, an increase of about 4,200 compared to 2017, driven by single-family permits. We believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average. Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.6% in the third quarter of 2018. We expect this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed.","Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place, and we believe Phoenix should remain one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing large metropolitan areas. As I mentioned earlier, net sales were up 1.2% in the quarter. Commercial and industrial sales increased 2.3% over the third quarter of 2017, reflecting the positive economic growth trends we have seen in the region.","Finally, I will review our financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On August 9, 2018, APS issued $300 million of 30-year 4.20% unsecured senior notes. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had approximately $128 million of short-term debt outstanding. Later this year, we expect to infuse up to $150 million of equity capital from Pinnacle West into APS.","Turning to guidance, as shown on Slide 6, we continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated earnings for 2018 will be in the range of $435 million to $455 per share. While we benefited from a hot September, we also had a very mild October. We expect October weather will negatively impact the full year 2018 earnings by approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Offsetting updates to our 2018 guidance can be found on the appendix to our slides.","Before I introduce 2019 guidance, I would like to confirm that we do not intend to file a rate review request in 2019. As a reminder, the 2017 rate review order prohibited APS from filing a new general rate review before June 1, 2019. After reviewing our financial expectations, we have determined that filling our rate review in mid-2020 will meet our financial objectives. In preparation for this filing, we expect to keep our capital structure similar to the level approved in our last rate review.","Continuing with guidance, we\u2019re introducing 2019 guidance of $4.75 to $4.95 per share. Positive drivers for 2019 include the anticipated Four Corners' SCR revenue increase, higher weather normalized sales, higher transmission revenue, flat to lower interest expense and lower operating and maintenance expenses, primarily due to lower planned outages in our continued cost management.","We expect these drivers to be partially offset by higher D&A related to more plant in service, higher property taxes and lower AFUDC. We estimated effective tax rate of 10% for 2019 reflects the amortization of $71 million of excess deferred taxes associated with the second team filing. The decrease in the effective tax rate is offset by the proposed $86.5 million refund to customers, which is also part of the second team filing.","Our 2019 capital expenditure forecast remains at $1.15 billion. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and rate base on our fourth quarter call. A complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2018 and 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides.","Our rate base growth outlook remains at 6% to 7% through 2020. And we still expect to achieve a weather-normalized annual consolidated and return on average common equity of more than 9.5% over the same period.","As we have said, our earnings are not linear and will fluctuate from year-to-year. However, over the long term, the opportunity to lead Arizona to a cleaner energy future positions us well to continue our track record of success.","This concludes our prepared remarks. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","Hi good morning guys. Hi I\u2019m maybe we could just start and talk a bit about the process going forward now that Prop 127 is defeated. What can we expect to see going into next year and maybe then later this year in terms of kind of a collaborative process of some kind of stakeholder review of options going forward?","Don Brandt","Well, I think, Michael, it remains to be seen exactly what that process looks like. As you know, and we\u2019ve talked about Commissioner Tobin has a docket open on 80% claim by 2050. A lot of things are also been attached to the docket. And so the exact way forward is sort of unknown at the moment. It would be our intent to participate in that docket and all of those factors. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see where it ultimately goes from a timing and outcome perspective.","Michael Weinstein","Do you expect to have something, I guess, solidified by the time you file your next draft IRP?","Jim Hatfield","Draft IRP is in April. So not sure we would be able to go fully through a process at that point. I think our \u2013 remains to be seen exactly how the RFP unfolds. That\u2019s one of the sections in a 80 by 50 is reviewing how we go forward on the IRP. So again, it remains to be seen.","Daniel Froetscher","Yes, it\u2019s Daniel. I think the timing of the informal docket on the energy modernization plan is a little bit ambiguous. And therefore, as it relates to flanging up with the preliminary IRP, we can\u2019t make that call. I think Don put out a press release here a couple of days ago, post-127 bill indicating that we\u2019re going to build on the coalition that works on Prop 127, in terms of trying to shape and formulate what a cleaner energy future looks like for Arizona. So we\u2019ll continue to engage in that space.","Michael Weinstein","Great. Just one final question, I\u2019ll let other people get on. The weather-normalized retail electric sales volume that you\u2019re assuming for 2019 guidance is still the 0 to 1% range. Now for the three-year period, it\u2019s a little higher than that. I\u2019m just wondering at what point does that three-year forecast kind of roll into those one-year forecasts?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I think what we\u2019re seeing is a continual gradual improvement in the overall economy. And exactly when our three-year period rolls into the higher remains to be seen. But I think we saw this quarter sort of the example of a improved economy, and we have a site to a pipeline of a lot of projects in West Phoenix as well, which will continue to build that momentum.","Michael Weinstein","Okay thanks a lot nice job and guidance and congratulations on winning your argument against Prop 127. Thank you.","Jim Hatfield","Thanks Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question","Insoo Kim","Hai good morning guys. As you prepare for the 2020 rate case, would any potential equity issuance to boost the equity layer likely be done sometime in 2020 in the early half of the year? And have you also considered whether potentially a fuller sale was as an option given where your stock is trading at the current moment?","Jim Hatfield","So last year, we injected $150 million from Pinnacle into APS. We expect to do some more here in 2019. Any additional equity that we\u2019ll need can be handled through a draft type of program. And we\u2019re not contemplating a fuller sale at the moment. It won\u2019t \u2013 certainly won\u2019t be a lot of additional equity, we\u2019ll need to raise through a dividend or reinvestment.","Insoo Kim","Understood. And turning to the renewable discussions going forward. Given the uncertain timelines to when the final RPF standards or the IRP will take place. Do you not see any meaningful tick in renewable investments until maybe 2021 at the earliest? Or could you see some meaningful amounts in 2020, especially to take advantage of some tax benefits?","Jim Hatfield","Well, look, we\u2019re obviously cognizant of the ITC and the timetable there. I think from a renewable right now, nothing planned. Don referred to the battery IRP, which \u2013 how the prices tick out, and we\u2019re on discussions now. It would be attached to our utility of solar, be able to \u2013 when we have the negative pricing peak the batteries, should be able to provide peaking power later in the day. I think we have to see how this conversation unfolds over the near term before we think about any large-scale renewable bill. At this time, that obviously continues to change as we talk to customers and other things.","Insoo Kim","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question","Paul Ridzon","You touched on it earlier. But as you look at Tobin\u2019s proposal of 80 by 50, is that workable? Or do we get into cost pressures under that plan?","Jim Hatfield","Well, I \u2013 well, the \u2013 there\u2019s a \u2013 Prop 127 was a constitutional amendment that was just a rigid. And it was irrespective of cost. I think the value of a commission-driven processes is, you think about claim, you think about reliability, but you also think about affordability. And so that will be a key gauging factor as we move forward will be what can customers afford. And we\u2019re very cognizant of that from a \u2013 as we think about CapEx and other things. It\u2019s always how much is this going to cost customers and we\u2019re very mindful of that.","Paul Ridzon","So this proposal has some off ramps?","Jim Hatfield","Well, yes. The thing about it is, as you sort of bill as you go forward, and so they come up with a prescriptive plan today that says, this is what we\u2019re going to do, and that\u2019s a value of a more of a commission-driven process.","Paul Ridzon","And Jim, just a clarification that the inter-quarter tax items will be net neutral from the calendar year?","Jim Hatfield","Correct. But we haven\u2019t applied in the appendix, it sort of shows how that\u2019s been laid out over the course of the year.","Paul Ridzon","Great thank you.","Jim Hatfield","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Levy with ExodusPoint. Please proceed with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","Just two questions. One, just on the CapEx post-2020. This $1.2 billion level that you\u2019ve kind of been averaging, should we just assume \u2013 you haven\u2019t given guidance yet on that. That\u2019s kind of like your sweet spot CapEx level, and then anything that would occur on the renewable side as far as any type of new initiatives would be incremental?","Jim Hatfield","Well, certainly, as we look out over our CapEx forecast. I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t comment specifically about 2021 beyond. But as we look at things, for example, battery storage on our 6 megawatts, will that be supplemented in our base CapEx plan?","And so don\u2019t know how that takes out. That could be incremental, renewables could be incremental, electric vehicle infrastructure could be incremental. We filed four pilots in the 2018 DSM plan, and we\u2019re waiting to get that from the commission. So how it plays out and when, it\u2019s sort of TBD. But we feel good about our fundamental ability to continue to grow rate base and keep it cost affordable to customers.","Unidentified Analyst","That sounds good. And then when do we get a refresh on the CapEx?","Jim Hatfield","We\u2019ll do rate base in CapEx in our year-end call, and they\u2019ll be \u2013 2021 CapEx will be in the 10-K.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then one last question just on the 2019 guidance because I think there was a little confusion. But I think if I heard you correctly, there was an offset. So the lower tax rate is offset by a customer credit? Is that what you were saying?","Jim Hatfield","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And that\u2019s why you have a lower tax rate, I guess, right?","Jim Hatfield","Correct. Right.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay perfect thank you guys.","Jim Hatfield","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi good morning guys. So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the composition of the CapEx here quarter-over-quarter. Roughly the same magnitude of capital here, but just shifting around the bucket. Can you talk a little bit about the two buckets? The traditional gen and the clean gen? And what\u2019s shifting that around? I suppose why \u2013 perhaps to start with the why, why the downtick in traditional gen?","Jim Hatfield","Well \u2013 go ahead.","Daniel Froetscher","Excuse me, Julien, it\u2019s Daniel. So the downtick in the traditional gen is reflective of the completion of the SCR projects, and a different outage plan for 2019 going forward in terms of number of majors and minors so on and so forth. The uptick in clean gen is a reflection of Palo Verde Generating Station fuel, the clean battery technologies that Jim mentioned, that won\u2019t be determined, if you will, until we settle and make our decision relative to the three RFPs that are out there.","But we certainly anticipate some level of investment in that space. And we\u2019ve got a segment with our residential low and moderate income customer base, a program called community solar, within which we are installing and rate basing residential distributed generation rooftop solar on customer rooftops. That\u2019s a multi-year program.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And maybe to clarify that. The traditional gen, is this the \u2013 probably a new lower level on a consistent basis? Or for the 2019 and 2020 this $100 million-ish type number, is that probably just a transient based on outages, et cetera?","Daniel Froetscher","No. It\u2019s a \u2013 major outages at our power plants are cyclical in nature. Certain work is every 3 to 4 years. Certain work is every six to eight years. So this is just a reflection of the normal cyclical nature, if you will, of our major and minor outs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. And just to clarify on the capital recovery piece or that the clean gen uptick, is that fairly straightforward in the context of the next case?","Jim Hatfield","Well, we\u2019re recovering the residential through the res surcharge currently. The rest will be just included for recovery on our next rate case.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thank you very much all the best.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Stefanie Layton","Thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."]}}
