Welcome to Abbott\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Scott Leinenweber","Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjust the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current year and historical results for Abbott\u2019s Medical Optics and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude\u2019s historical sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott\u2019s presentation.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.62 which exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects double-digit growth. Sales increased 3% on a comparable basis in the quarter and we continue to expect accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year.","We started the year targeting double-digit EPS growth and we\u2019re adding to it today by raising midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance from $2.45 to $2.48, which represents 13% growth over last year.","Halfway through the year, we\u2019re on track with all of our key priorities. The integration of St. Jude continues to go well and we\u2019re right on track with our deal model and projected synergy targets. We\u2019re also right on track in terms of our new product launch expectations, which includes bringing our MRI compatible rhythm management devices to the U.S.","During the first half of the year, we received FDA approval for our MRI compatible pacemaker and we completed regulatory submissions for our MRI compatible defibrillator devices including submission of our CRT-D device in June. We\u2019ve also seen significant growth contributions from several recently launched products across our portfolio, which I\u2019ll highlight, as I summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian.","I\u2019ll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by strong performance in core laboratory and point of cure diagnostics. This business, which is already a global leading and growing faster than its market, is in the early innings of significantly enhancing its competitive position with the launch of Alinity, a highly differentiated and innovative suite of new systems across all areas where we compete. During the quarter, we achieved CE Mark approval for Alinity hq, our new hematology system which quantifies different types of blood cells to help diagnose blood-related diseases. This represents the fifth new Alinity system we\u2019ve launched in Europe since November of last year and will continue this launch cadence next year by bringing these systems into the U.S. market.","In nutrition, sales grew modestly in the quarter. Internationally, as you know, market conditions are expected to remain challenging in China over the near-term in advance of pending regulatory changes in that country. Outside of China, we\u2019ve seen some softening in our few international markets. While volume continues to grow at levels consistent with historical trends, pricing power which has previously contributed to overall market growth has moderated. As a result, we lowered our full year nutrition growth guidance earlier this year and we now expect the global nutrition market to grow in the low to mid single digits over the longer term, which is still a healthy growth rate for a market this size. We remain focused on outperforming the market with our well-balanced portfolio of leading brands which we\u2019re achieving in U.S. pediatric nutrition where sales grew 8% in the quarter as we continue to capture share with recently launched infant formula products as well as our strong growth of our nutrition toddler brand.","In established pharmaceuticals or EPD, growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in China, Russia and several markets in Latin America including Brazil. During the quarter, sales were impacted by channel dynamics associated with the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax system in India. Excluding this impact, EPD sales would have grown high single digits overall, in line with our previous guidance. This business is fulfilling the vision we had when we created it. There is no other business like it in the world. We\u2019re in the right countries, in the right therapeutic areas, and our unique model is driving consistent above market performance in the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.","In the medical devices, sales growth was led by continued double-digit growth in electrophysiology, neuromodulation and diabetes care as well as high single-digit growth in structural heart. In neuromodulation, sales growth of nearly 50% further strengthened our leadership position in a fast-growing market for treating chronic pain from spinal stimulation. Our strong growth in this market has been led by recently launched products that offer improved pain relief and fewer side effects.","In structural heart, sales were led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market- leading device for the minimally invasive repair of mitral regurgitation. In June, we completed patient enrollment in our trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MitraClip in patients with functional mitral regurgitation. We expect the final results from this trial around this time next year, which could result in a significant expansion of U.S. market opportunity for MitraClip.","In electrophysiology, which achieved another quarter of double-digit growth, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval of our Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor during the second half of the year. And at heart failure, we continue to anticipate U.S. approval of HeartMate 3 later this year.","I\u2019ll wrap on medical devices with diabetes care where international sales growth of 25% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks.","During the quarter, Libre achieved regulatory approval in Canada and we continue to achieve national reimbursement status in a number of counties, most recently France and Switzerland. Today roughly half of our Libre sales come from patients with full or partial reimbursement. And just last week, we announced an agreement with Bigfoot Biomedical to develop and commercialize diabetes management systems. This collaboration will help bring these best-in-class technology to more patients with the goal of transforming the way diabetes is managed.","So, in summary, we\u2019re on track with all of our key priorities, including growth contributions from recently launched products and achievement of important regulatory milestones across our pipeline. The integration of St. Jude continues to go very well, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And we\u2019re raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range which continues to reflect double-digit growth.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and our outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay. Thanks, Miles.","As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis, which is consistent with the guidance we previously provided.","Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 2.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the transitory impact of the new goods and service tax system implementation in India which lowered our sales in our established pharmaceuticals, total operations sales would have grown 3.7% in the quarter, which is in line with previous guidance.","Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on total sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2% in the quarter. As you know, exchange headwinds have eased somewhat since the beginning of the year. I\u2019d note that the majority of the lower foreign exchange impact on our sales has been driven by strengthening of the euro and other developed market currencies. And when these particular currencies move, the follow-through impact on our result is relatively modest, taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.8% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 30% of sales.","Before I review our financial outlook, I\u2019d note that our sales and adjusted earnings per share forecast do not include any contribution associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2017, subject to certain closing conditions. As previously communicated, we will provide an update regarding expected financial impact of this transaction at a later date.","So, turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.43 to $2.53. We continue to forecast full year 2017 operational sales growth in the mid single digits. And based on current rates, exchange would have a negative impact of around 0.5% on our full year reported sales, which is modestly lower than the negative exchange impact of around 1% back at April rates. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat about 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% and SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2017. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.64 to $0.66. We forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits and at current rates expect exchange would have a negative year-over-year impact of around 0.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense around 29% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.35 in the third quarter, primarily reflecting intangible amortization and expenses associated with St. Jude acquisition.","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter comparable operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high double-digit sales growth. In nutrition, we forecast low single-digit sales growth. In diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits. And finally, in medical devices, for cardiovascular and neuromodulation, we forecast sales to increase double-digits across our combined high growth areas of electrophysiology, structural heart, heart failure and neuromodulation which will be partially offset by sales in our foundational areas of rhythm management and vascular, which we forecast in combination to be down low to mid single digits in the third quarter. And in diabetes care, we forecast double-digit sales growth.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Mike Weinstein","Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones to start with. So, first, the FX delta since the start of the year, Brian, what does that mean to EPS? I know you moved your guidance since. Is that the full impact of the EPS swing from FX or is there a greater impact or are you giving yourself more push? And then, second, Miles, could you just spend a minute on the adult nutritional business? We focused so much time on pediatric at the U.S. adult business, has been disappointing so far this year. Probably you could spend a few minutes talking about why that is and kind of what drives the turn around.","Miles White","Okay. Brian, do you want to talk FX first and then\u2026","Brian Yoor","Yes. Mike, I would say that 3 -- and we acknowledged in the first half, maybe $0.02 or $0.03. And could it be a little more? Yes, if rates continue to hold. It depends on the mix of currencies. But right now, we\u2019re not factoring that in because that\u2019s getting down to a level of precision that for a penny or two, we\u2019re just not ready to project that yet, as we don\u2019t want to necessarily forecast the mix of currency changes the rest of the year.","Miles White","Okay. Then, U.S. adult nutrition, I agree with you, Mike. We\u2019re disappointed too. And I would say, what we\u2019re seeing -- first of all, I commented in my remarks that we\u2019re seeing softening markets worldwide here, at least in a lot of markets. And as I\u2019ve looked at a lot of the data, first, the volume rates are all still there; it\u2019s mostly loss of pricing power in some of these markets. And we see the same phenomenon in both ped and adult nutrition.","In the U.S., it\u2019s a little different version than other markets. In the U.S., we\u2019re seeing a fair amount of intensity around private label competition. And every few years, this will happen. We got a competitor in U.S. in Nestle that is also feeling the same pinch, as we look at our market data. We know that the competition right now is private label and there is contingence and the way private label is being marketed I guess on the shelf and so forth in terms of its positioning, proximity to our brands and so on. So, we\u2019re seeing some of the impact of that. It\u2019s something we\u2019re addressing. Every few years, we see private label crank up and then it subsides again. Right now, we\u2019re having one of those years when we see a lot of intense pressure on that particular segment, and that\u2019s taken some of the growth off that.","Last year and year before, both we and Nestle invested in the category. And when any of us invest in the category, all of us benefit. As soon as that larger investment sort of subsided, the private label cranked up and went right back at it. So, it\u2019s kind of an ebb and flow thing, but it\u2019s definitely taking an edge off the growth that we\u2019ve seen historically. We\u2019re aware of it, we know it, we\u2019re taken the actions we think we can and should to mitigate and deal with it, try and correct it and so forth. But that\u2019s what the intensity that\u2019s coming from.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. And then just one quickly follow on Libre. You didn\u2019t give us much of an update on the U.S. I know inter quarter miles and we\u2019ve talked about this; you started a couple of trials to confirm the accuracy of Libre to the FDA. Does that mean that approval is likely more like yearend or early next year? And do you have any sense of whether the FDA has gotten comfortable with the idea of a factory calibrated device?","Miles White","Well, there\u2019s been a lot of conversation back and forth with the FDA. We\u2019ve explained to the FDA how our factory calibration is done. And I think that conversation has gone well. I never want to predict the FDA. I think we have what we consider to be a fairly proprietary process for this factory calibration. So, it\u2019s not something we are anxious to share widely. And it\u2019s unique. So, I guess I\u2019m not surprised that it needed further discussion. But I think that\u2019s gone well. I don\u2019t know that I can predict at all, Mike, when the FDA will come to a conclusion of its process. It was submitted almost a year ago. So, we are coming up on a date here, an annualized date. But, I don\u2019t have any evidence that says, gee! It\u2019s going to be a year end or longer. So, I don\u2019t know that I could -- I certainly wouldn\u2019t say that because that may not be true. So, I don\u2019t have that common indication. And I would say look, there is good, active, ongoing dialogue back and forth. That\u2019s always a good sign. It\u2019s the right kind of dialogue. I just wouldn\u2019t forecast it. I don\u2019t know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Barcalays. Your line is open.","Matthew Taylor","The first thing I wanted to explore was you mentioned in your opening remarks, thinking about your MRI safe device approvals in the U.S. is being on track. And I was hoping you could talk about, not the submission but what\u2019s going on with Sylmar, any progress you have made there and confidence that you can get timely approvals, just given what we have seen with the warning letter?","Miles White","Yes. No problem. Thanks for the question, Matt. First of all, with regard to Sylmar, we are making good progress. And I don\u2019t mean that just in a generalization. We had a very detailed plan that we shared with the FDA of course after we received the warning letter. The good news is, as I mentioned in previous call, we have been in Sylmar with the St. Jude management since August of last year. And St. Jude was very open to us and allowed our quality operations, GMP people and so forth in to participate with them. So, we have been working with them on a lot of issues, questions, processes and so forth in Sylmar for a year now. And that is a huge positive because it gave us a real running head start on things the FDA observed when did it inspection early in the year. So that gave us a big lead.","So, we have the ability to put before the FDA a very comprehensive plan of corrective actions, remediations et cetera at the site. And that plan is nearly complete. So, we are coming up on -- we will put all the things in place, change processes and so forth that we needed to change. That\u2019s all positive. We will be updating the FDA on that in the coming weeks. I won\u2019t give you a specific date, because I don\u2019t want to create a trigger here. But I would say, look at this point, we are absolutely on schedule with our own pace. And it was seem as if we did it rapidly. The fact is, it will be about a year and all by the time we are done here. But relative to the timing of the warning letter itself, it was seem like a rapid turnaround but there was quite a lot of work before that inspection that took place. So, we are getting through the completion of that comprehensive plan we put in front of the FDA and we\u2019ll have dialogue with them. I\u2019m very optimistic about what we\u2019re doing with Sylmar. I\u2019m very happy with the progress of our theme there. So, I feel good about that.","And as I said in the last call, I have no reason to change in a meaningful way, the expectations around the couple of key product licensors of products that come out of that facility. And I know that there is a fair amount of question about, well will they be impacted or not. I think I\u2019d have to say look, they might be impacted by couple of months. But in a meaningful way, I don\u2019t think so. So, I\u2019m not willing to change those launch dates for the purposes of projecting or modeling or anything yet, because to be honest, we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve not had a conversation with the FDA, specifically about that. I know that the review side in medical devices has continued to review all of our products; they\u2019re licensor on the same pace anyway. And I know what that pace is and I know where the standing of those products it, and it\u2019s all very good. So at the end of the day, the agency\u2019s reaction to the remediation actions and so forth will obviously influence it. It clearly has the ability to license those products, if it chooses to. And we will wait and see.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks for the feedback on that. So, one other area I wanted to ask you about that has been very active is in diagnostics for the Alinity launches outside of the U.S. I guess the core of my question is I was wondering when you think we might start to see a pickup O-U.S. growth from those launches. I know it\u2019s kind of a slow battleship that\u2019s turning here through your install base. So, when could we actually see some pickup, and how much might that be?","Miles White","Well, let me just correct one thing that you might have inadvertently said. You said when do we see the growth in the U.S.? U.S. won\u2019t start launching until next year but they\u2019ve been in effect and licensed and launched in Europe. So, let me respond to Europe. And frankly, the question you\u2019re asking is the same one I keep prodding our management with. And I do that just to keep the feet to the fire. But, the launch itself is going well. And customer response has been very positive. We\u2019re taking what I would call a fairly systematic and careful and methodical approach. Because when you launch new systems, you don\u2019t want your customer to have to debug something in the field. You want it to go to the field day one. And the history of launches of instruments in diagnostics in general as an industry has not been that. As you may know, I used to run that business years ago before I was the CEO of the Company and was responsible for R&D at point When we launch systems, you get so much data, so much use early on from your -- clinicals but you tend to find all the little bugs you missed in development. So, when we launch products or systems in diagnostics, you\u2019ve got a big installation or big changeover from their current systems and so forth. So, it does take time. And because of those early installations are where you do a little bit of your learning, you want it to go well.","So, I would say I give them that slack early on in the launch in terms of early, slow, methodical, careful whatever and yet there has actually been really good order activity, really good uptake. We\u2019re on track I would say with numbers of closed accounts, instruments placements et cetera, we\u2019re getting some pretty nice sites closes; we\u2019re getting some pretty I\u2019d say great reference accounts in all of this. So, while it starts a little slow, I think we will see that order rate pick up. We will see it in Europe, we will begin -- in 2018, we will see clearly some impact there. A lot of our early installations will have heavy cannibalization of existing systems and existing volume, but we are getting new accounts as well. And I like the mix of what I\u2019m seeing, both in experienced Abbott customers and those who have the competitive take away and so on.","So, I think the launch is going well. I think it is going to be hard to see for a little bit here, at least in 2017. We are trying to figure out how we show you, investors, the success of that launch and how it\u2019s going, without giving away a lot of competitive information to our competitors and so forth. That\u2019s a little bit of an issue or least a challenge, communication wise. But I would say that launch is going really well. And I\u2019m pleased with that. It\u2019s one of those things we are -- it\u2019s kind of a slow motion launch. It\u2019s not an instantaneous kaboom, but it\u2019s a rolling launch where you are going to see rolling impact that picks up more and more momentum over the next couple of years, and you will see that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Let me start with a Alere, which seems to be marching toward completion here. A couple of things. We saw an asset sale announced. Is that it? Is there more to come? And maybe, I know it\u2019s early and I know you would like to be conservative. But, can you just help frame in those general sense, is it fair to assume that Alere is neutral this year to EPS? How do we think about it just directionally, broadly in 2018? Is it neutral, is it accretive, is it dilutive? Any color would be really helpful? Thank you.","Miles White","I assumed somebody would ask that. Well, couple of things. First of all, there is one more asset sale that has not been made public. It was one that was required by the regulatory bodies for antitrust proposes and so forth. And we\u2019ve got a good buyer, good price et cetera. The other party just hasn\u2019t said anything publicly. So, we don\u2019t want to say if they haven\u2019t said it. But yes, there is one more and it\u2019s modest in size. But, it\u2019s on track. I don\u2019t see any hiccups with it or anything. It just hasn\u2019t been made public. And I expect that that will be soon. And that\u2019s progressing really well. I would say, we are very happy with the status of divestitures for antitrust purposes, where that stands. We are happy with the buyers; we are happy with price; we are happy with transition, plans and so forth. That\u2019s all good.","We are in fact, I would say, racing toward close. I\u2019m anxious to get it finished and I\u2019m quite confident that it will. At this point, I would love to have one of those surprises you didn\u2019t expect where all of a sudden regulatory bodies approved it and you weren\u2019t ready but we are ready. And we have named our transition team internally here at Abbott and how we are going to manage it, how we are going to integrate it and so forth. Those plans are all very well underway. And so, we are prepared for that and ready to go.","With regard to this year, I had indicated and I would continue to indicate, neutral. I wouldn\u2019t plan for any accretion. I think because this particular deal has gone on so long, I am reluctant to make projections about accretion. As we are into the second half of the year and if the deal doesn\u2019t close until September as is currently projected, that gives us all of about three months with the business in our hands. And so, at that point, I think look, -- I don\u2019t know that I could project any accretion. I would like to get the business on the path to integration as rapidly as possible in anticipation of rolling into 2018. And so what I\u2019m communicating and the guys are communicating here is assume it\u2019s neutral, assume there is no accretion in 2017 and the question then rolls to 2018.","And originally, I think we estimated, this is probably well more than a year ago now when we first announced the acquisition of Alere. We had estimated I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.11 to $0.13, something like that of accretion for the first full year. At this point, I have no reason to change that however and no negatives that I would tell you cause we pause. And I don\u2019t intent to be conservative for cuteness or sandbagging or anything else. But I would say, I want the get the business in our hands and evaluate that more directly than we\u2019ve been able to over the last year and a half. So, before I reconfirm with any precision or any estimate, accretion for 2018, I want to have few months of the business in our hands, so we can reconfirm for ourselves while managing the business, synergies, sales rates, all that sort of stuff. Because when we gave that first estimate of accretion, we had not taken into account the divestiture of the Triage business or the pieces we had to divest for antitrust. And they had not at that point lost the Arriva business with CMS in U.S.","So, I would like see, during the first few months when we have this business, what we\u2019ve really got, before I give any kind of accretion estimate for 2018. I do expect that it will be accretive, I just don\u2019t know exactly where. I don\u2019t mean that to be an indication of, gee! It\u2019s likely to be less or whatever. I\u2019m not even prepared to say that. I\u2019d just like to be able to evaluate it in our hands because we\u2019re well beyond deal model in terms of timeframe for close here. So, I think we\u2019ve got to have it in our hands, so we can make those estimates more directly.","With regard to Arriva, we\u2019re looking at whether or not we can restore that and at what level restore that standing with CMS that makes a difference in our estimates. There is a number of things that would make a difference in how we evaluate the ongoing performance of the business and the timing of that. So, we got a few moving parts on Alere before I can be -- even give you a range of accretion but I would tell you that I expect it to be accretive. And at this point I\u2019m not prepared to change what we already put out there as an estimate little over a year ago. ","Rick Wise","That\u2019s really helpful. And just on a separate topic. One of the compelling aspects of combining St. Jude and Abbott on the device side, it does seem to be -- obviously be the compellingly broad portfolio. Can you talk, Miles, a little bit about the progress you\u2019ve made on the contracting side, dealing with large hospitals, large integrated delivery networks, GPOs et cetera, presenting the whole bundle, just progress you\u2019ve made broadly since post merger? And do you see that contributing to growth in 2017 and 2018 that aspect of the story? Thank you very much.","Miles White","Yes. Thank you. I\u2019d say, since we announced the acquisition a year ago, St. Jude had already started to make changes in the way it approached large national account type organizations in United States. And we with them took that further. There were some promotions, management hires, new changes, new changes in the way we went to market at St. Jude; we contemplated the, call it the full offering across our product lines. And I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve made terrific progress internal in our approach to St. Jude. We have had some success. We\u2019ve had a lot of positive reaction from customers, in general, positive reaction to Abbott, positive reaction to the breath of product line, positive reaction to St. Jude\u2019s pipeline and the products that are coming. So I would say all in all, I think all that\u2019s been really good.","I also would stress, a lot of times when people refer to bundling with large national accounts, hospital groups and so forth, there is a presumption of one product line subsidizes another and there is leverage in that. And while that\u2019s true and can be true, there is also a greater positive synergy of the full offering, the full service level, and the service and account gets across product lines. And as you know, these large integrated health groups, they don\u2019t want to deal necessarily with five or six suppliers in a given area; they generally deal with two or three. And we are finding that in the mix, in the breadth of our portfolio, one of the places it really benefits us and St. Jude is that it\u2019s very easy for us to be one of the two. And it\u2019s a lot easier when you got the broad product line, when you got innovation with those product lines, when you got a good compelling medical and value proposition. And it\u2019s not always about just subsidizing. And so, I find that with the mix, and this is one of the strategic reasons we wanted this acquisition, I find that the breadth of that product line, the innovation across the product line, the depth of products, that full offering makes us extremely competitive, and I think both from a medical and the value proposition standpoint. So we definitely see that. I think we will see that increasingly over the course of 2017, 2018 and beyond.","I think if you just look at the dynamics in the medical device business at large, the consolidation that\u2019s taken place across a lot of product lines has been well-documented and talked about for several years. I think this puts us in a really strong position in the field now. As we look at our product line, of course we and other competitors think there are holes. Well, we need this product, or we need that product, but I would say small holes but all of us one way or another are always looking to fill either through our own R&D here or other M&A activity. But I feel like we are very, very competitive in all regards now. And that\u2019s a good positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Novarro","My first question is on the cardio and neuromodulation line. It came in better than expected, and I have got to believe that\u2019s function of St. Jude. So, Miles, can you comment on how St. Jude performed in the quarter? What was the growth rate that the St. Jude business in total deliberated in the second quarter? Thanks.","Miles White","Yes. St. Jude, if we carve them out standalone, was up by 4%. And if you recall, before we acquired St. Jude, its prior -- or before we announced the deal, its prior four years have been flat. And we discussed how we thought over that period of time. They\u2019d made great investments in their product pipeline across their businesses, their internal organic R&D I thought had been very productive and very successful, so had they. And it was a point of quite a bit of, let\u2019s call it, negotiation during the deal process. They had rather robust forecast for their sales going forward. And of course that ultimately is part of a whole negotiation. I would say this, their representation about their pipeline I thought was valid and proves to be.","And as I have said before, both in the calls we\u2019ve made about the deal itself or in our quarterly earnings calls, our forecast or our deal model was built on the expectation of sequential improvement in their sales going forward due to first of all, correcting the MRI compatible issue, which is well-underway; and then the launch of a lot of new products, and we\u2019re seeing that. And then frankly, in our own deal model, we had pretty much aligned it with what analysts collectively viewed as how St. Jude would look going forward. And so far, the expansion of the growth rate and its sequential performance quarter to quarter has been on our deal model and is steadily growing. And we estimated in our deal model, they get up to 4.5%, 5%, something like that and this quarter they were at 4%. And each quarter is successively better than the last. We\u2019re seeing improvement in CRM and we\u2019re seeing share recovery with the low voltage pacemaker.","As I mentioned, I guess it was at the end of the first quarter, St. Jude, we estimated lost about, I think it was 7 points of share in the low voltage pacemaker business last year between April and December and in the first two months or three months here of launch with the MRI compatible claim, they\u2019ve regained 4 of those share points already. So, we\u2019re seeing quarter to quarter sequential improvement in share in CRM; you can see it in the growth rate comps; it\u2019s getting better and better and quarter to quarter. We expect that to continue. New products launches are occurring according to expectation. I think the whole thing is remarkably going according to our deal model, according to our forecast and according to what we told analysts. And right now, I think the quarter of 4% out of St. Jude is pretty good thing.","Glenn Novarro","Yes, I agree. And then, just I don\u2019t know if you or Brian have these numbers, but just as a follow-up, would you be able to give us your U.S. and worldwide pacing growth and U.S. and worldwide ICD and CRT growth? Thanks.","Miles White","I don\u2019t think I can do that right this minute. You prepare a lot of things for these calls. That\u2019s one I don\u2019t have at my fingertips. We can probably follow up with you Glenn. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","I wanted to ask one about how to think about Q3 given some of the onetime items in Q2. And then I have product related question. So, I think it was 2.9% growth in Q2 on a comparable pro forma basis, but I think you had an 80 basis-point hit from headwind from EPD, and I think you had about a 50 basis-point hit in vascular from the royalty. So, is the starting point really about 4.2%, 2.9 plus 1.3 and we get back the 80 bibs or about the $50 million loss in EPD from the general services tax in Q3? And I had one follow-up.","Miles White","Yes. I would say a couple of things. First of all, what you describe there, the ins and outs going into the third quarter, you\u2019re right, and that\u2019s a good assessment. And your assessment of, I think it was a little bit better than 4%; I think that\u2019s a good assessment too. With regard to EPD, this Goods and Services Tax in India, as you -- I think others have already noted, clearly impacted the second quarter. I think it\u2019s been hard for everybody to forecast how it\u2019s going to come back in the third quarter. In the first couple of days of the quarter, we saw a clear response to restocking by distributors, and then it softened for a couple of days, and then it came back again for a couple of days. So, we are seeing it restore. Whether we will see it completely restore in the quarter, I don\u2019t know, but so far so good. It\u2019s going according to what we projected. So, whether it will come back like full dollar per dollar, I don\u2019t know, but so far it looks that way. And I would say so far projections look good that way to truly be a quarter-to-quarter shift. And that\u2019s kind of the experience we are seeing thus far.","Larry Biegelsen","And then, Miles, XIENCE has been an amazing product, but given the issues with Absorb, do you feel -- what is the pipeline, the long-term strategy there? Do you feel you need a drug eluting stent with the bioabsorbable polymer, similar to Boston Scientific SYNERGY, which seems to have been successful? Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles White","Yes, I\u2019ll tell you what, Absorb has become a very much in niche product; that\u2019s for sure. And I would have wished for it to be a lot bigger than that. But XIENCE remains best-in-class stent. That\u2019s still true. Do we need a bioabsorbable coated stent? I\u2019ll tell you, I think the bigger issue is I think we need an even more deliverable stent. The issue right now with physicians is deliverability. And I think that\u2019s been one of the hallmarks of Boston SYNERGY stent is the deliverability. So, I think the issue is more the deliverability than the coating. And we will launch early next year, Sierra, next generation of XIENCE, which will address that. So, that\u2019s what I think is our single -- most important focus right now. Do I think long-term that there is still improvements and performance improvements and so forth to make in stents, whether it\u2019s coating or material or deliverability et cetera? I do. I am not going to detail what that plan is from our standpoint, but our next focus in stents is primarily that deliverability with Sierra.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Hopkins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Robert Hopkins","I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question. So, just I\u2019ll start with the product question. I just want to be clear on MRI, the outlook for MRI safe for ICDs. What is the latest official guidance on when you expect that to come to market? And do you have a sense for whether you\u2019ll need a warning letter to be lifted to get that through?","Miles White","The warning letter doesn\u2019t have to be lifted. The FDA has the ability, if it chooses to, to license it if they\u2019re satisfied with remediation actions and so forth. They always have that ability. So, it\u2019s not dependent on particular formal lifting of warning letter. At the same time, the FDA always has the right to decide what it wants to do. And I would say with regard to expectations at this point, we\u2019ve said second half or a year-end and I think that\u2019s probably, for right now, at least as modeling and planning purposes go, probably fine assumption. I can\u2019t be more specific than that because I can\u2019t read their minds and don\u2019t want to forecast and put them in a tough spot. So, I would say, as far as modeling goes, model second half somewhere and year end, but I don\u2019t know that I can give anything more precise than that.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s 2017 obviously, right?","Miles White","Yes.","Robert Hopkins","And then one another, Miles, bigger picture question on the outlook for revenue growth for Abbott, because when you look through your results here this quarter, one thing you notice is that if you look at your different businesses, there is a very wide range of growth rates with some businesses like neuromod, just doing extremely well and other struggling a little bit. If we think about 2018, there is some strong incremental drivers of growth and there is something like neuromod that will probably slow a little bit. So, when net all that out, do you think as we kind of look forward into next year that you can again start to talk about Abbott again as something better than a mid single digit revenue growth company?","Miles White","Well, I think that depends on a whole lot of things including the businesses. I think it depends on what\u2019s happening with global markets et cetera. I mean that\u2019s always our goal. In our goal, we always start every year with the notion that we are going to grow profits double digits. And to do that, you\u2019ve got to have fundamental revenue growth, as you know.","And as we look at the mix of the business, I think the observation you make is correct. I mean, I\u2019d love it if everything grew like neuromod, but it doesn\u2019t. And there are some of these businesses that I would say are much more mature, like CRM and even the stent business, much more mature. The good news about those businesses is, they are extremely profitable and they generate high cash flows. So, in the mix of our portfolio, that\u2019s positive, that\u2019s a good thing.","On the other hand, if you\u2019re maintaining a growth profile, you\u2019ve got to have lean toward growth in the mix. And we\u2019ve got a pretty good lean toward growth, I would say of late. The one that\u2019s got my attention from a longer term perspective is nutrition, particularly internationally and what I\u2019ve seen there is a slowing. I think that business longer term or at least on a stable basis for now, looks like it\u2019s going to be a low to mid single digit business, call that 3 to 5, something like that, 3% to 5%. But that\u2019s a mix. There are some countries that are 1% or 2% or some countries and geographies that are double digits. The global volume growth in that business for infant formula for example, tends to be 3% to 3.5% and the biggest change in the growth has been price. Not that the price has come down, it just isn\u2019t going to go up much. And I think that that\u2019s perhaps indicative of some maturing in some of those markets. We\u2019re looking at that closely right now. So, as I forecast it, interestingly enough it\u2019s also very profitable and a high cash generator. And as I\u2019ve talked about nutrition in the past and the mix of Abbott Laboratories, it\u2019s been one of the biggest cash generators in the Company for a long time. I used to refer to it as the bank as it funded a lot of M&A. So it\u2019s a very healthy business that way.","I think our questions right now are assessing the shift of market tone. China for example is actually much more stable than the last 12 to 18 months. I like what I\u2019m seeing in China right now. We still have the government regulation continue and it\u2019s impacted competitors, there is a lot of reaction to the shrinkage of the number of SKUs in the market and so forth. And we\u2019ve talked about that. But as far as what we\u2019re seeing in 2017 here, we\u2019re performing according to our expectations. I think the comps obviously get better here in the second half; we will see. So, as I look forward, yes, it is our goal to be a healthy grower to be able to generate that double-digit bottom-line growth. I think that we\u2019ve got to continually look at the mix, as you suggest. How many growers we\u2019ve got, as you observe, the growth rate of something like neuromod will come down simply because it gets bigger in the base, but it\u2019s actual raw dollar growth I don\u2019t see changing for quite a while. So I think that\u2019s a plus. And I think we see improved growth in other areas.","So, I know there is a lot of ins and outs there but at the end of the day, we are always looking to build our Company, grow the Company, expand the Company, gain market share for the Company. And the acquisitions of St. Jude and Alere were part of building that core leadership base in the businesses that we are in to continue to drive that growth, and the goal hasn\u2019t changed.","Scott Leinenweber","We\u2019ll take one more question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Brian, just a couple of quick ones for you and then one strategic one for Miles. So, just a couple of incremental financial questions. The incremental change to gross margin in the guide of 50 basis points, what was driving that? And then, as you just thinking about the pacing of the back half of the year, obviously you\u2019re guiding to improvement in the third quarter. Is the right way to think about it that back half is going to be mid single digits and obviously better than the first half or do you think the business gets a little better in the fourth quarter from an organic growth perspective than the third? And just a quick one for Miles after that.","Brian Yoor","I think to your last question, you will see sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4. There is a lot of items that Miles talked about in the acceleration, including new products and just the momentum of our businesses. So, I think that\u2019s the fair assessment. With respect to question on gross margin, our operational improvements and gross margin underlying continue to be there that we\u2019ve talked about it before. You do get a little noise around the mix of FX and what that does, and that\u2019s a simply math there. Nothing has changed about our aspirations to continue to expand our gross margins on an underlying basis, probably 50 to 75 basis points on that, David.","David Lewis","Miles, just thinking about the strategic importance of the Bigfoot announcement and I don\u2019t want to make too much of a single investment. But just as a natural extension of building the brand and the reach of Libre and CGMS, or does it suggest an interest in pumping? And maybe said another way, I mean do you think to win in diabetes going forward, do you need to have an integrated pump and sensor under one roof?","Miles White","No, I would say, in the grand scheme of things with diabetes care, I don\u2019t think we need to have a pump. But, I think there is a strategic, what would I call it, change happening or there will happen over the next couple of years in the market, particularly for type 1 diabetics and for multiple daily injectors which could be type 2s that are insulin-dependent.","And what\u2019s interesting about Bigfoot is they are taking a different approach to the ease and the integration of what those multiple daily injectors have as solutions to manage their disease, separate from pumping. And it\u2019s a fairly clever service and approach that I think will create, not just an alternative that makes the management of the disease or management of someone\u2019s insulin easier but I think the value proposition of it is going to be pretty compelling. And I think that will change the competitive dynamics in that realm that is pumping. I mean the penetration of pumps or pumping relative to the market size of multiple daily injectors is really quite small. You would say wow! There is a lot of potential for further penetration. The question is the value proposition. A lot of times, the reason it hasn\u2019t penetrated further is, it might be too costly or viewed that way. And I think what Bigfoot\u2019s doing, if I could comment on it from a distance, because I\u2019ve never had a conversation with them myself, is they\u2019ve come up with a pretty unique value proposition that not only is good from the standpoint of the patient or even the payer, but also in general, in the cost of managing the disease for a diabetic. I think it\u2019s a pretty interesting use of technology to make it simpler, easier and affordable.","Now, I probably sound like a brochure from them. I think it\u2019s -- I just think that their approach is interesting. And in our case, the technology that is Libre is a component of that and a fairly compelling piece of it that expands the use of Libre beyond what Libre can even do today. And then beyond that, there is other expansions and improvements to Libre that aren\u2019t just in that segment. But I think that the sensor technology and the nature the way Libre works has a lot of applications beyond how it\u2019s used today. And the Bigfoot approach is just one of those. And I think it\u2019s a pretty unique, compelling idea that puts Libre as a part of the competition in that sort of pumping or multiple daily injector world. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us and I think it further enhances the management of the disease for patients.","Scott Leinenweber","Good.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks; and Brian will discuss performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Tom, Brian and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2016. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.

Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.41, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals.","As you know, we've been taking important strategic steps to expand our footprint in the world's fastest-growing geographies and have been investing in R&D that has resulted in numerous new product launches across our businesses. These actions and investments are driving our strong first quarter performance, which I'll briefly review by business.","I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 7% in the quarter driven by continued above market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new accounts with our customer-focused solutions, which we further enhance with an unprecedented series of new instrument launches over the next few years.","We continue to make great progress on the next-generation diagnostics systems and point-of-care, immunoassay testing, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening. These new systems are being designed with the customer in mind, incorporating the features that are deemed most important, including increased automation, higher throughput and enhanced user interface. We'll provide more details on our launch plans of these systems in the coming quarters.","In Nutrition, both pediatric and adult nutrition grew roughly 4.5% in the quarter, above market performance; and U.S. pediatric nutrition was led by strong performance of recently launched non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. Internationally, pediatric nutrition growth was led by continued share expansion of Eleva in the premium segment of the Chinese market, as well as continued strong growth in Russia and across several countries in Latin America.","In adult nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader, sales growth was led by Ensure in the retail and institutional segments of the U.S. market, as well as double-digit growth in several Latin American countries as we continued to expand the adult nutrition category globally.","In Medical Devices, sales growth was led by 5.5% growth in Medical Optics, where we continue to capture share and drive growth in our portfolio of recently launched premium cataract lens products. Earlier this month, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia that is capable of producing over 4 million lenses a year to meet the growing demand for our products.","In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of 11% was driven by continued consumer uptake of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre received European approval for use in children and teens who can now manage their diabetes without the need for routine finger sticks. We expect growth in our diabetes business to accelerate in the coming quarters as we meet increasing demand for Libre from consumers and healthcare professionals; and we also look forward to bringing Libre to new markets, including the U.S.","In Vascular, modest growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation and strong performance in our Endovascular business, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery.","And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, sales growth of 11% was led by continued double-digit growth in India, which comprises more than 20% of EPD sales, including strong growth in the therapeutic areas of women's health, gastroenterology and cardio-metabolics. We also achieved above market growth in China and several countries in Latin America as we continue to expand our presence and portfolios in these geographies.","Finally, given our performance in the first quarter, coupled with an improving exchange outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.14 to $2.24.","So in summary, we're off to a good start this year with each of our four businesses having met or exceeded growth expectations for the quarter and with good progress on our new product initiatives.","So I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thanks, Miles. First, I'll provide further details on the first quarter results. Sales for the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 5.3% on sales resulting in relatively flat reported sales in the quarter.","Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.8% of sales; adjusted R&D investment was nearly 7% of sales; and adjusted SG&A expense was nearly 34% of sales.","Turning to the details of our full year 2016 outlook. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits for the full year 2016.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across the business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. This would result in full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations.","For the second quarter, today, we are issuing ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange of around 3%, resulting in reported sales in the low-single digits.","I'll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter operational sales growth outlook by business.","In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast sales to increase mid to high-single digits. In Vascular, we forecast relatively flat sales growth. In Diabetes Care, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth. In Medical Optics, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth. And lastly, in Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth in the second quarter.","Turning back to the other aspects of the P&L, for the second quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 57%; adjusted R&D investment somewhat above 6.5% of sales; and adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. And finally, for the second quarter, we project specified items of $0.14.","And now with that, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question or comment is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, everybody. It's Brittany Henderson in for Kristen Stewart. I just wanted to kind of start on a high-level basis. The Medical Devices business kind of continues to be somewhat of a drag on the overall business. So we just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on just the outlook for Abbott Pharmaceuticals with Medical Devices and how that kind of fits along with the other segments of the business? How it fits in with Nutrition and Diagnostics in the Established Pharma business?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, this is Brian. I'll start off and open up to Miles. I think you've got to look within Medical Devices, and there are a lot of bright spots here in terms of what's growing. If you look at MitraClip, we had 40% growth in the quarter; and that's a space we're early to and it could be a large market here. If you look at our Supera product \u2013 again a newly added product in the not too distant past \u2013 it's grown double-digits for the quarter. And coupled with that, our vessel closure business has also led to real strong growth in the Endovascular.","Clearly, as you see, on the stent side, it is a flattish market. But even then, we're excited about our portfolio we have. It provides a great contribution to our business. And if you look at where we're at now, we've stabilized our share of where we're at and we're excited about bringing Absorb into the portfolio ultimately and to further compete in this aspect of the business. Miles, I don't know if you'd add anything to that?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The only thing I'd add to that is we got Absorb coming in the U.S. and Europe. We got a number of things happening here from a new product standpoint and expansion of the business that I think are all good for the business going forward here. So I think it's all good. Okay?","Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Miles, I wanted to start off with Alere and just sort of reflecting on investor commentary here in the first quarter. I think we talk to investors. I think they understand the ability to take out margins with Alere potentially. And given the success of the Diagnostics management team in Abbott, they seem to have a high degree of confidence in your ability to do that. Where they seem to be getting hung up is this, the growth opportunity for Alere, right? They see Abbott as large-cap growth company and they're buying a business that has below Abbott growth rates. How would you comment on sort of how you see Alere from a top line growth perspective over time both market and the particular company?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I look more at the Diagnostics business broadly in all phases, all segments, and I look at it globally and I look at it by testing categories, not just point of care, or core lab, or blood screening, or molecular testing and so forth. And I think our Diagnostics business has shown that there is good growth to be had and good growth if you're innovative and your systems and your products are responsive to customer needs.","I think all the segments of Diagnostics provide a growth opportunity. And I think that our own business in particular has shown that not only is there growth opportunity everywhere it competes, but it can manage margin, it can manage cost, it can manage product innovation; it can do all that. So I would comment on the overall Diagnostics growth opportunity as demonstrated by Abbott's Diagnostics business and not specific to any one company.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Brian, just a clarification. I'm trying to kind of reconcile organic growth in the quarter. So we're basically taking a 5% operational plus like two points of Venezuela and getting something around 7%. Is that kind of in the ballpark?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","That's in the ballpark. You're right there.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You may have noted that a lot of these businesses globally in different geographic segments were growing 10%, 11% on the top line in the quarter. So it was a pretty strong quarter across the board there, David.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, agreed. Thanks so much for the clarification.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Miles, just to clarify, on Alere, are you reaffirming your commitment to the transaction?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I am going to be careful how I answer any questions about Alere, Mike, because as you know they've had delays filing their 10-K. We don't know when they'll file their proxy. We don't know when they're going to have a shareholder vote. So right now I'd say it's not appropriate for me to comment on Alere.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And let me ask \u2013 I've got a bunch of questions already this morning just on the guidance raise relative to the FX delta from the 4Q call to today, depending on peoples math, anybody who has gotten anywhere from $0.06 to $0.12 of basically earnings delta from the impact of FX from when currency was on the fourth quarter call to where it is today. But you only raised guidance by $0.04 including the beat today. So could you just walk through your math, Brian, on FX and the headwind for 2016 today versus what it was three months ago?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Before I turn that over to Brian, Mike, let me tell you a couple of things as background. First of all, you know that the exchange impact for us lags on the bottom line relative to the top line because it's got to pass through inventory, et cetera. So we do have that lag. And that's always a little difficult for us to precisely call. And we get very close, but it's always a little difficult to precisely call depending on the currency of the world and depending on inventories and so forth, and sales, and sales mix in that given geography. And as you know, because we've got such a broad market basket of currencies, that's a little more difficult to call precisely; and it does lag, as you've already acknowledged.","So while I'd say, look, I like what I'm starting to see is the easing in exchange. But given the last few years, I'm a superstitious person and I think the minute I think this is starting to go well, for some reason we're going to get smacked down with some change in the market. For the last two years in the third quarter and fourth quarter we've seen some events, some economic events of some kind alter the world's view of economies and then a change in exchange. And more recently, last fall, it was $30 oil.","So if there's some caution in the raise and I'd say if things don't \u2013 if we get no curve balls, you're probably right. Call it the curve ball discount there, I'm just waiting to see another quarter. And right now, I'd say all indicators are looking favorable for improvement as the year goes on. I actually want to see some of that improvement sustained; meaning, economic conditions and exchange.","And, plus I'm mindful of the fact that we made adjustments to our estimates here in the fourth quarter call three months ago that clearly some of that has changed with exchange, but it can change in as little as a quarter. So with the current circumstances of the world and what everybody is talking about in terms of real negative interest rates and so forth, that actually favors weakness to the dollar for us right now. And I hope that continues for some time here, but I just want to see some of it before I go further.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Brian, did you want to add to that?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian, do you want to play in on that?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No. I think you perfectly articulated it. Q1 and Q2, as we talked before, Mike, is largely locked due to the dynamics Miles discussed on the timing of flow through. So really this is a second half phenomena.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, Mike, if you look at it this way, the sales strength on the top line is frankly my leading indicator here of we're above all of your estimates. Frankly, we're above our own and \u2013 for the first quarter. That's a good thing going into the year and it's across all businesses and most geographies. So that to me is a pretty strong indicator. And if exchange does improve arithmetically, as you described, of course that only gets better too. So whether we forecast it now or actually experience it later, we'll see.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. One follow-up, Miles, and I'll jump. Can you talk about pricing across your Nutritionals business? I'm asking because in the 10-K, annually you guys disclose the contribution from price to each of your different businesses. And in Nutritionals, if we went back a couple of years, price was a pretty significant contributor. And I think back in 2012 it was a 4.5% contributor to the top line growth of the business; 2013 was 3.2%; and 2014 it was basically 1%; and last year it was zero.","So the contribution from price has obviously eroded over time. And we hear in the Mead Johnson calls, we hear of the Danone calls talking about pricing pressure in China and other markets. So can you just talk about that business and that end market? And obviously we're talking about a bunch of different end markets, but can you talk about those end markets and what's happening with the price and your view on them?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it's different by geography. First of all, I think all your facts and all the stuff you just quoted, absolutely right. And actually there's a couple things there. One, you know that in the last, call it, two years, certain countries, China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, have taken unilateral government actions to pound down price of the multinationals in particular in those countries in reaction to price increases taken by multinational competitors in those countries over the prior few years. And our ability to be commercially successful around the world depends on healthy happy markets and happy governments in some cases. So I'd say to the extent that that influences the degree to which companies are able to take price, I think that has some influence.","I also think that there's the overall balance of consumer demand, consumer absorption, et cetera. And what I've been pushing with our team is let's compete on product and volume and share gain. The prices in the market, for now, they're healthy. And to be truly competitively healthy I think we have to be able to win share, win the shelf space, win the consumer, win the physician, win the recommendation, et cetera; and that's where we put a lot of our emphasis. So to the extent that we have not put further emphasis on price in the last couple of years, it's primarily to sharpen our own competitiveness and compete, I'd say, at a pretty effective level on all other dimensions.","I think from a business fundamentals standpoint that's important. I want real growth, not just masked growth because we took price. But I think at the same time the opportunity for us here is pretty good. I mean these are healthy products. This is a robust segment of business. In all these countries profit is not challenged. And I think we're just drawing, call it, a little different balance in terms of how we want to be competitive versus relying on price alone or too significantly in the mix. So I'd say have the dynamics intimidated price? I'd say dynamics have pushed price to a more appropriately balanced level. And in our case I want the emphasis on real share gain, and product growth, and market segment growth. And to the extent that at some point there is opportunity for price, we certainly know that. But I think price is easy, and sometimes too easy.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Miles. I appreciate it.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Two questions. First one, I wanted to ask on just capital allocation. Miles, is M&A still a top priority for you from a capital allocation perspective? And then within the different divisions, is it safe to say that Vascular remains a very high priority given the growth rate relative to your other divisions?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes to both. No change. Same top priority; same focus. The only thing I'm cautious about, Bob, that I'd say is different, while I think there are opportunities, as I've said before, in the pharmaceutical arena \u2013 and remember we're only in the branded generic pharmaceutical business in emerging markets, we're not in the U.S. or Europe in pharmaceuticals \u2013 but in those markets, I have noted from time to time a lot of opportunities to add to our platform.","We have, in that business, really strong positions in the markets we focused on and great depth and breadth. And I think we've chosen our countries well. I think we've chosen our breadth and depth well. So we've got an EPD that now, post-shaping of the Europe business and so forth, is a pretty good gem. And there are other properties out there that would expand that footprint and add to it. However, in the last couple of years in particular currency or exchange in those markets has been a pretty heavy headwind.","And the expectations of value by potential properties or assets in those markets has been 25 times to 30 times EBITDA which, to be honest, is way out there according to any kind of historic norm. So if you have to go pay that kind of a multiple and then translate back to dollars with a strong currency headwind, you really can't earn the return for your shareholders against that headwind that you need to if you're going to pay that kind of a multiple. So we have sidelined that to a degree.","I think we can be selective about given markets. But we've sidelined that while we put our emphasis and focus on other areas of Abbott's business in terms of what we're looking at or what we're interested in. It doesn't mean that we don't think there's wonderful properties in the pharma business, but we're much more selective about geography, what we think we can see as currency headwind, growth of market, et cetera, going forward here because I think we want to be prudent that we earn the return. To a high degree, we're always talking about the underlying growth of the business. Investors got to be able to spin (25:55) the underlying growth; and we got to be able to bring that underlying growth to the real bottom line.","So while we do navigate a market basket of currencies in a volatile world economically and we're diverse across all countries and we're in emerging markets for their growth, I think we have to be prudent about when we invest and how we invest in those markets, so that we can bring back the return that it cost us to invest in those markets. So we've kind of put that one, I'd say, partly on the back burner, but it depends on the country. And then, as you say, yeah, it's a high priority for us and we continue to look at opportunities in devices and in diagnostics; and those remain of interest to us. But I know it's a long-winded answer, but that's really how we're thinking about it.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, it's helpful. And then the second thing I wanted to ask you, Miles, is that can you give us a sense of what emerging market revenue growth was in the quarter? And then more importantly, can you just comment broadly on what you're seeing in terms of emerging market economies and the health of the consumer in emerging market relative to what you saw exiting 2015? I mean are things improving, stable? How would you characterize it?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd characterize it, first of all, as high-single digit overall, which I think is good. I think it kind of depends. The world wrings its hands about slowing growth rates in China; and China was 6.5%. And I think if any other country of the world was growing 6.5%, we'd all be doing cartwheels and investing heavily. We wring our hands when a country as large as China slows to 6.5%. Even if China were at 5%, I'd think it was pretty attractive. So I'd say I think the growth rates, relatively speaking, are strong.","I think you have to take into account here that, historically, if one area of the world was struggling, other areas of the world were pretty strong. It's actually not the case right now. Everything has slowed some, and for all the reasons we know. I think there's a lot of uncertainties around the world right now and I could run through them, but we'd just be in a bad mood afterwards. And I think everybody's kind of waiting to see how some things turn out; and whether exchange stays on a certain track, whether some countries kind of recover, I think people are waiting to see what happens with oil and they're going to wait a while to see that. They're going to wait to see what happens with the interest rates. There's a lot of hand wringing, as I said, over negative interest rates.","So there's going to be a lot of things that kind of hang on the world and you say, well, how does that directly affect your business. Well, in healthcare, a lot of healthcare is funded by governments and they are the insurer of their population and so forth and the health of their economies. And as you know, almost half our business is consumer direct in a fashion or consumer pay. So the health of those economies matters.","I still believe and continue to believe China, India, Russia, these are all strong markets, notwithstanding the currency speed bumps that we've had here in the last couple of years, but these are strong markets. I think there's solid growth there. Countries like Venezuela, Brazil and some others are obviously of great concern for their own economic circumstances and volatility. I think Venezuela, as we've talked about plenty here, has been a real outlier that way.","But I think the emerging markets represent real strong growth. I don't see that slowing. I think the kind of growth rate we see there drives pretty healthy expansion in investment by companies like us; and Europeans and others as well. I mean I think all those markets represent terrific growth, better than developed markets. But I also think if you're innovative and you have new products and you have products that bring value to the healthcare system, I think the U.S. and Europe are also worthy markets for us and remain a focus. These are some of our most important markets.","So because we're geographically diverse and we are a multinational, I think they're all pretty healthy. And I think that's reflected right now in our top line, which is pretty strong relative to all the concerns that get expressed about the world's economies and economic growth. I mean one of the best things about healthcare is even in poor economic times, people need healthcare at one level or another.","So I'm pretty bullish about the opportunities for us. I think we've all adjusted, industry-wide or even investor-wide, to lower growth rates. And today we talk about 5% like it's a pretty high growth rate; and I have to say it feels pretty good. And 11% feels really good on the top line, and those kinds of things. And I can remember when that didn't feel so good, because we're used to much higher growth rates. But, frankly, in this global economy right now those are pretty healthy returns; and we're conscious of the returns. So I'm still pretty positive about all this.","Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good morning everybody. I wanted to start on the operating margins side of the business. And this goes back a little bit to the disclosures that you provided in the 10-K and also some of the longer term margin targets you've put out by segment. If I look at where you're sitting right now in your Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses, both of those look to be pretty close to best-in-class margin. So can you maybe talk about the areas for operating margin improvement? How much of that on a go-forward basis comes from the individual segments versus how much would come from the G&A side or sort of internal restructuring efforts?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, David. This is Brian. So as you know, we've been going 100 operating basis points, 200 operating basis points per year on an underlying basis; and we continue to see that performance in 2016. Clearly, as you said, we've made great progress in Nutrition as well as Diagnostics as where they stand today, but that's not to say that there isn't additional opportunity. It may not come through at the same pace that you're accustomed to seeing it, but there still is, we believe, remaining opportunity in these businesses to continuously improve our margins.","Over the longer term, we have some businesses like Established Pharma. Clearly, there's opportunity there in the coming years. So we see that that could be a driver as part of our contribution. And don't forget, too, we are still working through the phases of what we're doing from a G&A, taking out the unproductive spend around the world when it comes to how we operate and support our businesses, and what's the right shape and what's the right size. So I think taking all these things into consideration, David, we're still targeting around the same range that you've been seeing on an underlying basis. Now FX, as you know, is muting that this year, but the underlying's still there.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe back on the earnings guidance increase, understandably you might not want to get ahead of yourself with respect to currency at this point, but could you maybe just talk about the charge related to Venezuela? It looks like you're taking up the GAAP adjustments from $0.55 to $0.78 this quarter. How much of that is Venezuela? How much of that is cash? And are you moving anything from ongoing to one-time?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No, David, this is just the adjustment we're making in Venezuela, similar you've seen in other countries to take the net monetary write-down at the end of the quarter; and it's somewhere north of $0.30 and we're done. Ongoing earnings, no impact. We'll do business forward at the rate of the new floating rate, which is around 260 (33:29), but any activity that's minimal really won't surface at those rates.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just lastly on the top line, you are talking about mid-single digit organic growth over the entire year, but I do think you started at a higher rate than where you had initially contemplated. So given things like FreeStyle Libre and the new platform launches in Diagnostics, is there the potential to see an acceleration from the 5% that you generated this quarter and what you're sort of guiding to in Q2?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the question is how much of that have we already got baked into our estimates for the year and how much of it will exceed that. And let's put it this way. The fact that we're above all of your estimates in the quarter and all businesses performed at or better than expected, I think that's a good sign. I'm just going to wait to see a little more sign.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Understood.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on EPD and one question on capital allocation and M&A. First, the last couple of quarters for EPD have been quite strong, about 11% constant currency growth, but you're guiding to mid-single digit growth for EPD in Q2, if I heard correctly. So just any color on why that business would slow down? And as I said, I have one follow-up.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","I think keep in mind, we talked about this earlier, what our growth would be but for; and this business has the one country we don't talk about. But if you look at India, it's growing double-digits, Larry. So it's doing well. Latin America and CFR, the performance is going well. The integration has gone extremely well. And I will say Russia. As Miles mentioned, that as a strong country. We're doing very well in our performance here in Established Pharma and are achieving what we expect from the Veropharm acquisition that was made. But EPD is not a straight line, Larry, as you know. There's a lot of markets. And so, from time to time there can be simply just some timing of tender. So there may be a little timing. I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves here.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's the best answer, because we have comparisons in quarter to quarter that depend on what happened last year and what country, and the countries don't tend to be the same. And because of the diversity of countries and currencies in this business, it doesn't tend to be that nice reliable ruler business where you can lay a ruler down on the line of growth. It's just bumpy.","Now, overall, it's all up and it's all good. We like that. But any given quarter, can have a curve ball in it or a comparison to last year. So I'd say the underlying fundamentals are all strong here. And we're going to have to lap Venezuela, because that was a pretty significant piece for EPD, given CFR there and so forth. And I'm trying to think where else.","I mean currency I guess is an issue in a number of countries, particularly Russia. And I'm just cycling through all the ups and downs. There are quarter-to-quarter variances depending on gee, the tender didn't happen in March, it happened in April, that kind of thing. So I think underlying this is pretty solid strong growth.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. And then, Miles, you've said in the past that you're not constrained on doing more deals even after the Alere acquisition. So how should we think about Abbott's ability to do another medium size transaction while the Alere deal is pending and there's some uncertainty? And second, is the sweet spot for Abbott still that $5 billion to $7 billion range that you've talked about in the past? Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'd tell you, again, I don't feel unreasonably constrained at all. I think that we're always conscious of capital allocation; we're always conscious of return; we're always conscious of where our debt is and what our debt rating is and so forth. We want to be all in the right balance here. But for the things that I think would be on my radar screen, I think we're in good shape here.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question or comment comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow up on the EPD, the 11% growth certainly exceeded our number and your expectation I think going into the quarter. What was different from your thoughts heading into the quarter? Was it a function of tenders? And then secondly, there were some headlines earlier in the quarter or I guess in February, around increased regulation of combo drugs in India and I'm just wondering does that have any impact on your business?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, in the last part, it hasn't yet, but it could; and we're prepared for that if it does. So that remains. It's still working its way through the Indian courts, but maybe Scott's got more detail on that right now than I do, but it hasn't yet.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And I would also add just on the quarter, there is some timing, to Miles' point. There is always some tender timing in various countries. If you take the first quarter and the second quarter, you're looking at a first half of the year that'll be a high-single digit operational growth for EPD; and that's strong growth.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. If I could just add a second one in there, just on Nutrition. Certainly the U.S. Nutrition business has seen some pretty good signs of momentum here, both in adult and pediatric. I realize you're anniversarying some tougher comps, but are you seeing some real momentum or at least some sustainable share gains here?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's kind of too early to tell. I think we kind of hope so, but to call it sustainable I'd like to see some more data and I'd like to see a little more time because generally speaking in the Nutrition business in United States, share might blip up and down a little bit, but over time remains relatively static. It's pretty difficult to move share sustainably and meaningfully over time in the U.S. And your ability to grow the adult nutrition business is to grow the market, for the most part; and as you know, we are the leader in that market.","And pediatric, share may move a couple of points here and there, but it always seems to snap back to wherever its median point was. So we're always pushing on share gain. And about the time you think you've gotten somewhere with it, something happens, competitive response or whatever, moves back the other way. So I think to call current momentum sustainable, I think I'd say let me see another quarter.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Miles D.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.","","Brian Yoor","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions.","Some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","In today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.","I will now turn the call over to Miles.","","Miles White","Okay, thanks Brian. Good morning. This morning, I will review our 2013 results as well as our outlook for 2014. For the full year 2013, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.01 representing double-digit growth over 2012. At the same time, we returned nearly $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and announced a substantial increase in our dividend beginning this year. Strong performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion enabled us to deliver on our 2013 expectations despite a few challenges.","Similar to other multinationals, we were impacted by a slowdown in several emerging economies as well as by foreign currency. Abbott was also impacted by a supplier recall in the International Nutrition. As I have discussed on our previous earnings calls, we were able to offset these impacts in 2013 in part through selective cost management. At the same time, we executed on our key priorities. We achieved high single-digit sales growth in Diagnostics, vision care and Nutrition, excluding the impact of the supplier recall as well as sequential improvements in our vascular business each quarter of last year.","We increased total company emerging market sales by 11%. This was driven by double-digit growth in our Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Nutrition businesses. We completed two acquisitions in medical devices that brought us important best in class technologies to expand our presence in our endovascular and Vision Care businesses. We launched numerous new products including our MitraClip Structural Heart device in the U.S. Muliple innovations in our cataract lens business. They are driving share gains and nearly 70 product launches in nutrition and we expanded our margin significantly in nutrition and diagnostics. As we move into 2014 we will continue to appropriately invest in our businesses to execute on our strategic priorities to drive long term growth. Our ongoing earnings per share of $2.16 to $2.26 calls for double digit growth at the mid-point.","However in the first half of the year we will see some carry over effects from foreign exchange and the nutrition supplier recall where we\u2019re making good progress to recover our share. The long term fundamentals of our business are strong and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders. In addition to our dividend increase we\u2019re projecting an increase in share repurchase activity. Overall we expect to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014 which Tom will discuss in a few minutes.","Moving on to our 2013 results and outlook for the business in 2014. In nutrition as expected fourth quarter sales growth increased low single digits affected by the supplier recall that was initiated in August. The additional marketing investments we made in the third and fourth quarters are supporting our recovery and we\u2019re on track with our expectations to recapture our share in the effected geographies. As we look to 2014 we remain optimistic about our growth prospects in nutrition and we\u2019re well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities. We will further expand global capacity with three new manufacturing facilities that will come online in the U.S., China and India this year. Demand is strong for both adult and pedantic nutrition. We will continue to see productivity from our R&D organization and expect to launch several important innovations in 2014 that will help us gain share and in adult nutrition continue to shape and grow that market.","With the combined launch of new products we expect to return to high single digit operational sales growth in nutrition this year as we lap the impact from the supplier recall in the second half of 2014. This will continue to be driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets which we expect to comprise nearly half of nutrition\u2019s total sales by the end of this year.","And finally margin improvement which remains a key priority for this business. We expanded operating margin in our nutrition business by nearly 300 basis points in 2013 ending the year at 18.7% of sales. We expect meaningful margin expansion again this year and the business is well on track to reach it's 2015 operating margin target of more than 20% of sales.","In established pharmaceuticals fully year sales increased modestly. As we have discussed macroeconomic and market pressures in certain emerging markets impacted EPD more significantly than we had anticipated at the start of last year. At the same time new commercial leadership is working to improve how we execute our branded generic strategy in both emerging markets and developed countries. As I\u2019ve said this will take time and we will be looking for improved momentum in this business heading into next year. Over the next several years we expect continued improvement in EPDs growth as sales in emerging markets become a larger component of this business. Growth rates in emerging markets have been and are expected to continue to be higher from the growth rates of the developed countries and the overall global economy and established pharmaceuticals remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long term growth for health care and emerging markets.","In our Medical Device business which includes our vascular, diabetes care and vision care businesses, sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter. In vascular in 2014 we expect continued improvement over full year 2013 driven by growth in emerging markets and the launch of multiple new products to expand our leading share positions. This includes the U.S. launch of MitraClip our first in class product for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation which is the most common heart valve condition in the world.","Combined with continued growth outside the U.S. we expect strong double digit growth of MitraClip sales in 2014. And we have the expected launch of the new peripheral stents in our endovascular portfolio and we will continue to expand share with our leading drug eluting product portfolio. We launched the XIENCE Xpedition in August in Japan and we will launch it in China this month. We will also continue to expand share of our bioresorbable vascular scaffold, ABSORB outside of the U.S. at the same time we move it through the development process in several key geographies including the U.S., Japan and China.","In Vision Care, sales increased 15% in the quarter driven by accelerating growth in our cataract lens business. This business now represents more than 65% of our vision care sales and has been growing well in excess of market growth rates. We expect double-digit sales growth for this business in 2014 with continued positive momentum from new products. And this includes our TECNIS Toric lens in the U.S., our TECNIS OptiBlue lens in Japan and our new Catalys laser cataract system as well as new product launches we expect early this year.","Diagnostics remains one of our most durable growth businesses consistently delivering mid to high single-digit operational sales growth for the past three years. Full year 2013 sales growth of 8% was balanced geographically with double-digit growth in emerging markets and mid-single-digit growth in developed markets. Margin expansion once again exceeded expectations for the full year increasing 300 basis points versus 2012. In 2014, we expect strong performance in Diagnostics as we continue to build momentum in core laboratory diagnostics, increased the penetration of our molecular and point-of-care businesses and expand our presence in emerging markets across all three diagnostics businesses.","In our R&D pipeline, we will continue to invest in the development of several new instrument platforms across the diagnostics portfolio that we expect to launch over the next several years. These new systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed, scalability, productivity and shorter turnaround time.","So in summary, as we look to 2014, we again expect double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth. We are on track with our recovery efforts in Nutrition. We are projecting an increase in share repurchases in 2014 following a 57% increase in our dividend announced last October. And as we move into the second half of this year, we expect stronger sales in earnings growth highlighted by a reacceleration in our Nutrition business, continued durable performance in Diagnostics, strong vision care growth and another year of double-digit sales growth in emerging markets.","I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2013 results and the 2014 outlook in more detail. Tom?","","Tom Freyman","Thanks Miles. Today, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $0.58 in line with our previous guidance range and up more than 20% over the prior year. Sales for the quarter increased 3.3% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable impact of nearly 3% from foreign exchange. As anticipated, fourth quarter sales growth was affected by the supplier recall in our International Nutrition business, which reduced operational sales growth by an estimated 1.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter.","Operational sales growth was driven by high single-digit growth in Diagnostics and double-digit growth in vision care. Sales in emerging markets were up at 9% in the quarter on an operational basis. Reported sales which include the impact of exchange were up slightly in the quarter. The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% in line with expectations and up 60 basis points versus the prior year despite a negative impact from exchange of 60 basis points. Ongoing SG&A expense was 28.5% of sales lower than expectations reflecting in part G&A expense reductions. Finally, our adjusted gross margin ratio improved by 160 basis points over the prior year in the quarter.","Overall as we look at 2013, we delivered strong ongoing earnings per share growth in line with our initial guidance and up double-digits despite some challenges. We also achieved a number of financial objectives we set out a year ago. Our Diagnostics business expanded its operating margin by 300 basis points and continued to deliver strong top line growth. Our Nutrition business expanded its operating margin by nearly 300 basis points. And overall, we expanded adjusted gross operating \u2013 adjusted operating margin by more than 100 basis points.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014, today, we issued full year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $2.16 to $2.26 reflecting double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range. Before I review our forecasts for sales and P&L line items, I would like to discuss certain factors that are impacting our forecast for 2014 and comparisons for 2013. We achieved our ongoing EPS expectation in 2013 in the face of a negative foreign exchange impacts on sales of approximately 2%. Additionally, the supplier recall in our International Nutrition business impacted EPS by an estimated $0.10 per share in the second half of the year. The effects of these two items on growth would carry into the first half of 2014. In terms of exchange, the yen began a steady decline in the first quarter of 2014 and a number of emerging market currencies similarly weakened beginning late in the second quarter. Both of these events are expected to affect reported results in the first half of 2014 but if current rates were to hold exchange impacts would normalize by the second of 2014.","Over the past 12 months we have been assessing how to better align our resources and infrastructure to meet the needs of our business owing to the separation from AbbVie. As I mentioned previously we took some selected G&A expenses out in 2013 and reduced our ongoing SG&A expense ratio from 31.3% of sales in 2012 to 30.6% in 2013.","In 2014 as part of our efforts to get our support structure to appropriately levels we will take further actions to reduce our expenses. We expect SG&A expense as a percentage of sales to decline by around 70 basis points in 2014. We continue to update you on these initiatives as appropriate.","We project share repurchases in 2014 to exceed $2 billion above the 2013 level. Combined with the 57% increase from the dividend announced last October we plan to again return substantial cash to shareholders in 2014. In 2014 we intend on a onetime basis to repatriate about $2 billion in 2014 earnings generated outside the United States.","We expect that the cash taxes due in the U.S. on this one time repatriation will be low as we plan to accelerate utilization of various long term deferred tax assets. This repatriation would result in specified charges to tax and be around $0.40 per share in 2014 of which $0.30 will be non-cash with $0.10 in cash taxes.","Turning to our 2014 outlook we\u2019re forecasting operational sales growth in the mid-single digits to the full year 2014. Based on current exchange rates we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales that the most significant impact in the first half of the year. This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits to the full year 2014.","Operational sales growth is expected to be driven by continued strong growth in diagnostics, nutrition and vision care along with an improvement in the growth rate in vascular.","We\u2019re also forecasting continued strong growth across our businesses in emerging markets. We expect a high single digit operational sales decline in our diabetes care business driven by reimbursement, reductions and competitive dynamics in the U.S. Brian will go into more detail on the 2014 outlook by business in a few minutes.","We forecast on adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% for the full year 2014 which reflect a negative impact of around 90 basis points and the combination of foreign exchange and the effect of the U.S. market conditions and our U.S. Diabetes Care business partially offset by underlying improvements in nutrition, diagnostics and Vision Care. We forecast ongoing R&D somewhat about 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A of approximately 30% of sales for the full year 2014.","Overall we expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2014. Forecast net interest expense of around $90 million, non-operating income around $10 million. Approximately $50 million of expense on the exchange gain\/loss line of the P&L and ongoing tax rate of 19% for the full year of 2014.","Finally I would like to review the quarterly outlook for 2014. For the first quarter we\u2019re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.36. As I discussed earlier certain amount of lease will effect sales and earnings comparisons in the first and second quarters of 2014 including the carry over effects of 2013 foreign exchange movements and the 2013 supplier recall on nutrition.","We forecast modest operational sales growth in the first quarter and a current exchange rate we would expect a negative impact from exchange of approximately 3% resulting in reported sales down low single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 54% which reflect impact in foreign exchange. The 2013 supplier recall in nutrition and competitive dynamics and diabetes care. We also forecast ongoing SG&A expense around 33.5% of sales and R&D expense approaching 7% of sales in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we are forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.51. We forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single-digits in the second quarter. And at current exchange rates, we would expect a negative impact on foreign exchange of approximately 1.5 percentage points. For the first and second quarter, we project specified items at $0.27 and $0.22 especially reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. As previously indicated, we expect the pace of both sales and ongoing EPS growth to accelerate in the second half as comparisons become more favorable with operational sales growth in the mid to upper single-digits and steady operating margin expansion.","So in summary, we delivered double-digit EPS growth in 2013 and our 2014 outlook reflects double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance range driven by improving sales growth in a number of our businesses and expanding operating margin.","And with that, I will turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights.","","Brian Yoor","Thanks Tom. This morning, I will provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter performance and our 2014 sales outlook. As mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.","I will first discuss our Nutrition business, where global sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter and were impacted as expected by the supplier recall in International Nutrition. The sales disruption is estimated to have reduced global nutritional operational sales growth by approximately $90 million or somewhat more than 5% in the quarter. Global Pediatric Nutrition sales were down 2% in the quarter, including a 3% decline in International Pediatric Nutrition. Excluding the impact of the sales disruption, International Pediatric Nutrition sales would have increased strong double-digits driven by market uptake of new product innovations.","While the U.S. Pediatric sales were relatively flat in the quarter, Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market and continues to drive uptake of recent innovation launches. Global Adult Nutrition sales increased 5% in the quarter with international adult sales increasing 14% driven by strong growth of our Ensure and Glucerna brands along with execution of several market development initiatives. U.S. Adult Nutrition sales were down 5% impacted by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin improvement initiative as well as higher sales in 2012 from the timing of a new product launch.","We continue to focus on innovation in our global nutrition business. In 2014, we anticipate several important programs to drive share gains in Pediatric Nutrition and category expansion in Adult Nutrition, where Abbott holds the global leadership position. This includes the recent launch of Similac\u2019s Triple [ph] Pack in the online market segment in China, which brings Abbott\u2019s best-in-class packaging solution to this large and rapidly growing segment of the infant formula market. At the same time, we continued to expand our manufacturing and R&D presence to be closer to our customers. As Miles mentioned, three new manufacturing facilities will come online this year, including plants in China and India. In addition, we are investing in local R&D and recently opened a R&D center in China and broke ground on a new pilot plant in Singapore. As a result of these efforts, we expect our R&D resources based in emerging markets to grow more than 30% over the next few years.","For the full year 2014, we are forecasting high single-digit sales growth on an operational basis for our Global Nutrition business. We are on track with our recovery efforts in the geographies affected by the supplier recall and forecast low double-digit operational sales growth in the International Nutrition. As Tom mentioned, we will see a first half carryover effect of the supplier recall. And for the first quarter, we are forecasting a low single-digit sales decline on an operational basis for our Global Nutrition business.","In our Diagnostics business, we achieved nearly 9% sales growth in the fourth quarter, including mid-teens growth in emerging markets. Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased more than 9% in the fourth quarter driven by continued above market performance in both developed and emerging markets. This business continues to execute on its commercial strategy to deliver total solutions that are efficient, flexible and cost effective to large healthcare customers.","In Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter with international sales up 10% led by strong growth in infectious disease platforms and geographic expansion in emerging markets. In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 14% driven by continued growth in the U.S. hospital and physician office lab segments as well as a double digit growth in emerging markets.","In 2014 we expect to again deliver above market performance in global diagnostics. In core laboratory diagnostics will continue to broaden our ARCHITECT assay menu and execute on our commercial strategies in both developed and emerging markets such as China, Brazil and Russia. We also expect continued double digit growth in our infectious disease business in molecular diagnostics and continue market penetration with our point of care platform with double digit growth in emerging markets across all three businesses.","At the same time we will continue development of several next generation platforms that are designed to positively impact point of [ph] care, improve service to customers, enhance laboratory productivity and reduce cost.","For the full year 2014 we expect our global diagnostics business to generate mid to high single digit operational sales growth. With mid-to-high single digit growth in Core Laboratory and molecular diagnostics and double digit growth in point of care diagnostics. For the first quarter we are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in our global diagnostics business. In our status pharmaceuticals business or EPD, sales increased in the quarter modestly.","Sales growth in our key emerging market segment increased 10% in the quarter led by strong growth in Russia, China and Brazil. We continue to focus on broadening our core therapeutic area product portfolios, strengthening our commercial capabilities and implementing tailored strategies to accelerate growth in emerging markets.","Sales growth in our developed and other market segment decreased 7% in the quarter and continues to be impacted by market conditions particularly in Western Europe.","As we look ahead to full year 2014 for EPD we expect low single digit operational sales growth as we build momentum over the course of the year. Given that 100% of EPD sales are outside of the U.S. this business is relatively more impacted by exchange movements. But we would expect sales to be relatively flat on a reported basis.","In the first quarter of 2014 we\u2019re forecasting sales to be relatively flat on an operational basis which includes the timing impact from a plant shutdown to expand capacity in order to meet increasing demand for one of our key products in the emerging markets. Including the impact of foreign exchange we expect first quarter reported sales to be down mid-single digits. And lastly Medical Devices, which includes our vascular diabetes care and Vision Care businesses.","Sales growth in Medical Devices increased 4% in the fourth quarter. Our vascular business achieved another quarter of sequential improvement in it's growth rates, the worldwide sales up nearly 4%. International sales increased more than 5% driven by continued momentum across key geographies of XIENCE Xpedition and ABSORB. Double digit sales growth of MitraClip and strong performance of our endovascular portfolio.","The U.S. sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter. In 2014 we expect continued sales growth improvement in endovascular business driven by a number of new product launches including MitraClip. The approval and launch of a new peripheral stent in our endovascular portfolio and a continued growth of ABSORB.","We continue to move ABSORB through the development process in several key geographies. Most recently we completed an enrollment in our ABSORB trial in Japan and we\u2019re on track to complete enrollment in China and the U.S. in the first half of this year. For the full year 2014 we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase in the low to mid-single digits on an operational basis with low to mid-single digit growth in the first quarter.","In Diabetes Care, global sales in the fourth quarter decreased 3.5% impacted by implementation of the competitive bidding program for Medicare patients. International sales which represent 60% of total diabetes care sales increased 4% in the quarter driven by strong performance in the emerging markets. For the full year 2014 we forecast a high single digit decline in global diabetes care on an operational basis. In our international diabetes care business we expect similar performance to 2013 driven by continued double digit growth in emerging markets. This will be offset by an expected decline in the U.S. impacted by reimbursement reductions and competitive dynamics resulting in a low double-digit operational sales decline for our global diabetes care business in the first half of 2014.","In vision care, we achieved nearly 15% sales growth in the fourth quarter with balanced double-digit growth in both emerging and developed markets. Sales of cataract products increased strong double-digits outpacing the global cataract markets driven by the continued uptake of recently launched products. These new intraocular lenses or IOLs provide Abbott with access to large and growing segments of the cataract market where we weren\u2019t previously competing. We expect continued strong growth in our vision care business this year as we continued to introduce new products. This includes the launch of new preloaded IOLs, which improved the ease-of-use for the cataract surgeons as well as the further penetration of our new Catalys laser cataract system, which is receiving very positive feedback.","For the full year 2014, we forecast double-digit operational sales growth in our global vision care business with mid to high single-digit growth in the first quarter. In summary, we achieved our expectations for 2013 including double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth, a more than 100 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin and numerous new product launches. In 2014, we are well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth with accelerated growth in the second half of the year.","We will now open the call for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.","","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","","Miles White","Yes.","","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Okay perfect. Okay. Let me start with the combination repatriation and buyback. Tom, it looks like you are, if I am reading the press release correctly, you are repatriating $2 billion, there is going to be with a cash and non-cash costs doing so? And then we are using that to buy back stock, which are passing out the impact of repatriating from your earnings and your guidance for 2014? Is that right?","","Tom Freyman","Just a few points, I don\u2019t think you can directly link the two items, but certainly what this is about Mike is monetizing assets as early as we possibly can and providing strategic flexibility from a financing perspective across the company. We are in a position here where we have these deferred tax assets that as you know typically get realized over a long period of time in future tax returns. And this is an opportunity to immediately use them to help monetize and bring back only 2014 earnings. This has nothing to do with anything in the past and provide that cash here in the U.S. for strategic flexibility and the various things we would want to use it for. So since it is one-time in nature it\u2019s going to be done only on 2014 earnings and this is a one-time opportunity to monetize these deferred assets. That\u2019s why we are handling it as a specified item in 2014.","","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","But you are repatriating $2 billion and you are using $2 billion to buy back stock, but you are backing out the \u2013 at least the cash impact you would think should go through the income statement?","","Tom Freyman","But again, it\u2019s one-time in nature, Mike. Our pattern in the past has been to reinvest our expectation as we go forward beyond 2014 is to reinvest these foreign earnings. And this is a one-time opportunity, where basically the focus is to monetize these assets as early as we possibly can and allow them to be redirected to whatever product of use whether its strategic initiatives, share buyback or whatever. And the other thing I had mentioned is in 2013, we bought back over $1.5 billion in shares though it\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to directly link this planned action with share repurchase. But I think it\u2019s a matter of just productively using these assets in the best way possible for shareholders overall and we think this is an opportunity we want to capitalize on in 2014.","","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Okay. It\u2019s probably we are spending a few minutes on the first quarter guidance, because obviously there is a disconnect between the guidance in the industry. I\u2019m kind of new industry [ph] this thing was aggressive but there is still even a wider disconnect than we were modeling. So maybe spend a minute on some of the different elements here. I think we\u2019re aware that if that was the headwind but you talked about couple of other items an issue where you are breaking [ph] a plant down. Maybe you can just walk through and maybe try and help us bridge (indiscernible) is that and where you\u2019re guys heading for the first part of the year?","","Tom Freyman","Really Mike there are two big things are effects [ph] but obviously the nutrition supplier recall was well I mean you saw the impact on the third and fourth quarters of our 2013 results. As you know we managed through that quite well and delivered on expectations overall but that factor is tearing into the first half. As Miles mentioned we\u2019re making good progress, recovering, we\u2019re right on the path, we projected. But as we said from the very beginning when this occurred this is going to cause a very top first half comparison in 2014 and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. You know there are at the business level other relatively smaller comparison issues but these really are the two big factors that are causing the first quarter to be tough. The last thing I would add is while you know exchange is a challenge for us in 2014 and the first half. The first quarter is particularly impacted in 2014 because as the exchange rates moved in 2013 some of those costs are an inventory as we close out 2013 and float through the P&L in the early part of the year in 2014.","So the exchange impact is particularly acute in the first quarter and I think those two factors really are the main reasons for the forecast being a little bit different than what people are expecting.","","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Just on the early first quarter top line growth. It sounded like you were guiding to a constant currency that would be low single digit since you were anticipating a low single digit decline in recorded revenues. Just help us with from the fourth quarter to the first quarter what gets a little bit more difficult and then I will drop. Thanks.","","Miles White","It really has to do with trends in the businesses. Certainly as we talked about the growth rate in International Nutrition is being impacted by Fonterra by the recall. There are phasing as you know our established pharmaceuticals business is a business that changes from quarter-to-quarter. In the first quarter there is a plan to expand capacity for one of our key products as a result of that we\u2019re, we have to shut down the plant in the quarter and that will draw down some of the sales until we can start the plant up again in the second quarter and get the growth rate going back up in that business. I would say those are the primary reasons. There is some timing effects in diagnostics as well but those were the main reasons why the first quarter is in the range that you described.","","Operator","And our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Tom you gave us some help on the first quarter gross margin number. I wonder if you could help us sort of into the second quarter on gross margins or just maybe more qualitatively first half versus second half, how GMs [ph] likely trend and what are the key headwinds and tailwinds there we should think about obviously FX being one of them.","","Tom Freyman","Yeah I would say there are two things going on in gross margin as we look at 2014 are pretty much what I mentioned in my remarks. We\u2019re just slightly down year-over-year and that\u2019s really currency again being challenging and the competitive dynamics we talked about in diabetes care. I think as you look out into the second quarter the pattern or the expectation for the full year could be extrapolated into our expected gross margin progress in the second quarter of the year. So those are really the two main factors, it was not what I mentioned in my remarks and I think it does mask lot of good things happening underneath in the businesses particularly in nutrition and diagnostics but also on Vision Care in terms of expanding the gross margin before some of these exchange in fact hits the businesses.","","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay maybe just two more quick ones. Just one for Tom and one maybe for Miles but in terms of the buyback you\u2019re very clear on how you\u2019re funding the buyback this year but Tom could you give us a sense of free cash in \u201914 and how we should think about funding dividends or buybacks you know either through using debt or patronization going forward.","","Tom Freyman","Yeah I mean as we look at free cash flow capital expenditures and dividends. And as you know, we are stepping up the dividend in 2014. I would say in the $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion range was something we would expect. And that leaves a lot of strategic flexibility for whatever might occur or opportunities that might pop up during the year. So as you know, we had some anomalies in our cash flow in 2013 relative to the carryover effect of separation, but we should be back into that pretty strong operating cash flow level and strong free cash flow to support the strategic objectives of the business.","","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then Miles, you made some commentary in your remarks about the going after costs and Tom talked about the leverage we are going to see in \u201814 I mean, the company since the spin as talked about on a per segment basis achieve very strong margins, obviously Nutritionals comes to light, but do you see further opportunities for going after corporate costs post the spin and is it likely that those type of initiatives are more ratable or is there a possibility for more decisive action? Thank you.","","Miles White","Well, I think the answer \u2013 the simple answer to your question is yes, it is a focus for us not just related to the spin, but in general, related to the shape of the business. A lot of our business is outside the U.S. and so there is an opportunity to structure ourselves from a support standpoint little differently. And we definitely were addressing that. We are putting a fair amount yet. As you know, we put a lot of attention on gross margin above the line there, but we are also putting a fair amount of attention on general and administrative costs across the corporation not only at the corporate level, but in the divisions in support and overhead costs. So I do think there is opportunity there. By its very nature some of it can be more immediate, but then some of it is more ratable, because in some cases you got to replace old processes with new processes or old systems with newer ones, etcetera. So I think it\u2019s a combination of both, David. Although I like to push hard for sooner rather than later, I think this is one of those areas where chronic dissatisfaction or inpatients is a good thing. And so we push on that. You are always trying to balance disruption to the organization or to the business versus the ongoing operation, but yes, there is an opportunity. We are on it. We are paying attention to it. And it is a combination of frankly both immediate and more ratable.","","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you very much.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Thank you and good morning. I wanted to touch a couple of business specific dynamics and then one strategic question. I guess maybe we can start with EPD and Miles I can certainly appreciate your comments that it may take time for a new management team to get in place and affect their impact on the business, but maybe you could go into a little bit more specifics about what the path is for that franchise. So I look at the non-key emerging market segment that has been a business that\u2019s been deteriorating, I think each of the past several quarters and it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s sort of I think a little bit unclear given how this business works what exactly turns this around. So maybe you could just provide a little bit more color on what steps the new management team is taking and then how we would see those flow through into reported numbers?","","Miles White","Well, I think we got two very different stories here. And as I have said in the past, you\u2019ve got very much an emerging market story and a developed market story and then within those, some segmentation. I would tell you that in the emerging markets, there are many that are very attractive, some that are less so, because they may be more commodity oriented than brand oriented. We tend to be focused on the ones where it\u2019s advantageous for us to be very brand-oriented and the markets are very attractive and profitable. As much as the growth rates may look modest or lacking, the profit profile of this business is quite attractive. Gross margins in this business are above 60%. It\u2019s a very well-run business. It\u2019s a very attractive profitable business. If it was an unprofitable business, it would be a whole different story, but this is actually a very attractive business. And the question is getting the segments right in terms of the attractive markets and those that are less attractive. So we put our focus on emerging markets that are sizable, where we have got critical mass and are attractive.","And our main focus there is two things. One, expanding the breadth of the therapeutic categories and the product lines that we are offering and frankly improving our branding and consumer skills as an adjunct to that business, because in any given country how we reach the consumer whether through the physician on hospital or direct to the consumer and so forth does make a difference. So in the emerging markets I think that\u2019s the focus and it\u2019s getting a lot of attention. It\u2019s a lot of blocking and tackling and smaller things but frankly it's working. We saw in the fourth quarter a returned double digit growth in emerging markets for EPD which is what I frankly expect. We know that some of those markets slowed last year as a function of the markets but the growth rates were still quite attractive to us relative to other geographies around the world. On the developed market side I think the single biggest difficulty that we and a lot of our competitors face is Europe and I think that\u2019s true across a lot of businesses. Our diagnostics business has weathered the economy and the actions in Europe as well but a lot of other businesses are struggling with Europe and I think that\u2019s true for us. I think it's true for our competitors. We have watched I can\u2019t say growth rates it's more like decline rates, price pressures and volume rates and so forth and I know that others have been you know hit harder than we have but nevertheless we\u2019re down in these developed markets about 10% and you know so we can be up 10% and emerging markets down in the developed markets and it's sort of cancels out. I like these emerging markets to keep growing and get to be a much bigger portion but we have got very close to a 50-50 split right now where what we\u2019re struggling within in developed markets with price and utilization cuts and other things is being offset by growth in emerging markets which we intend but the way we deal with those developed markets in quite different. There is fair amount of expense reduction, focus restructuring et cetera. And I know this has been one that you know we have been challenged on from time to time and previous question of Mike Weinstein you know (indiscernible) question I think on this one. I have to say it's a fair question. The emerging part of this is going quite well and the developed part it's uphill.","The legacy of the business is you know a combination of businesses we have acquired well Legacy Abbott and so forth. I think if we were starting with a clean sheet of paper we target those markets that have the most attractive attributes but the fact is we have got a lot of legacy markets here in developed economies that we have been in for a long time and they continue to experience economic pressure the most fundamental of those being Europe.","So we continue to look at that particular geography and that particular segment of business and deal with it differently than we deal with what we deal with is a fairly attractive growth opportunity in lot of the emerging markets.","","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And maybe switching to diagnostics in the U.S. specifically, can you comment on the molecular business? I mean you\u2019ve pretty strong trends in point of care as well as the Core Lab segment and I would have thought there will be some potential to sort of cross sell or leverage to different platforms but it was a pretty tough quarter in the U.S. in the molecular segment. Any further detail you can provide on market dynamics or company specific factors?","","Brian Yoor","David this is Brian I will kick it off and if Miles can add more color. In the U.S. you know first of all when we say our underlying franchise of infectious disease is growing very strongly. It's doing very well. We did have some comparable\u2019s with respect to how you realize kind of the companion diagnostics revenue. We had some revenue in 2012 in the quarter that did not repeat, this is kind of a little bit more choppy in that respect and also we just have a little bit of an impact from the timing of when we seize the distribution agreement but that doesn\u2019t impact the underlying business. The underlying business is poised to continue to do well with the focus on infectious disease. I think to look at the full year it's probably more reflective of how to think about molecular in the U.S. and we do expect a step-up from that as we move into 2014 with our continued success and focus on infectious disease. I think it's really important to note in this business you know there are two that 60% of the sales are outside the U.S. and you can see the double digit growth there, we\u2019re doing very well in the emerging markets, in our platforms, in infectious disease and so we like the growth rates that we see overall for molecular.","","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay and then maybe just last one strategic question. As I look at the evolution of the \u201cnew Abbott\u201d story over the past 12 months. I think we started a year ago with sort of a growth company of mid to high single digit top line growth obviously it's a well-documented challenges that emerge over the course of 2013. You had a pretty obviously significant increase in the dividend in the third quarter of this year and it seems like we\u2019re shifting from a growth company to a capital return company. How should we think about the strategic positioning of Abbott longer term and Miles where you\u2019re taking the business, growth first capital return, M&A versus shareholder buybacks and things like that from a capital deployment standpoint?","","Miles White","Well I think we think about the company much as we described. It's definitely a growth platform with an intention of growth. You know the things that I would say probably disappointed me or set us back last year largely foreign exchange, which was a big deal. I mean, that hit the top line and the bottom line. And we were able to offset that, but that was one thing. And I think the recall we had in the Nutrition business was couple of $100 million. That\u2019s a big hit. And that particular business is one of our big growth drivers. I would say strategically, I am pretty pleased with how the base core businesses are all performing, particularly relative to the nature of the geographies and economies and so forth out there. I think that\u2019s all trending pretty well.","The one business where it\u2019s got a lot of my attention and focus as we just talked about is the branded generic pharmaceutical business, where I would say strategically I would like this one to be improving faster. And what I call your attention to is after we acquired AMO, I\u2019d say analysts and some shareholders had a fair amount of skepticism about the performance of that business for some time. And admittedly, it took a few years to pick up momentum there, but today, that business is churning at a fairly steady double-digit growth rate. It\u2019s gaining share. It\u2019s doing quite well. My own impatience would have been that it do that much faster than it did and I am always pushing for faster progress or faster impact in the performance of the business, I guess, not just for your expectations but for my own. And yet, we got to where we wanted to be. We have seen \u2013 we saw with the vascular business, terrific performance. We have seen steady quarter-to-quarter sequential improvements. We have gained share in the vascular business across the board. Every geography, we are number one in the stent business around the world. The AMO business is doing exceptionally well that way.","Diagnostics has had a very steady sequential track record of improving growth. The frustration I had got is the pace of that improvement in EPD right now and it\u2019s got the focus of our management team and my focus. It\u2019s the only place I am really \u2013 I guess strategically a little frustrated, but a lot of that has to do with the nature of the developed economies. And I think you are going to hear that from a lot of our competitors and a lot of other businesses. So I would say, first of all, in no way do I think we are stepping away from an intention of growth or focus on growth or focus on share gain or a focus on geographies, where the dynamics are frankly around growth. I think that\u2019s all still very valid, very true. At the same time, we and other companies well run, we accumulate a fair amount of cash. And our investors are looking for a return. And I think if we are not able to deploy some of that cash to strategic opportunities or we disproportionately accumulate cash relative to strategic opportunities, we look at the shape of our balance sheet, we look at the shape of all of that. And I think if investors \u2013 we have got the attention between the long-term and of course the quarter.","And each quarter, when we got to report to our investors how we are doing, but I think also investors would like the constant feedback of a healthy return, particularly in uncertain economies in uncertain time. Our company has had a history for probably more than 30 years of very steady dividend growth and return to investors that\u2019s got a certain identity and a certain appeal to a lot of investors. And we have had a fairly steady track record of share repurchase. We have had a steady track record of pretty significant profitability and cash accumulation and cash generation. We have had a good track record with M&A and other things. And I think we try to keep all that in balance so that our investors are benefiting both from the growth profile over the long-term and a good healthy cash return when economies are more uncertain and on a steady reliable basis. So I would tell you I don\u2019t think it\u2019s black and white you are not one or the other, we happen to be both. That\u2019s been the hallmark of the company for decades that we have been a growth vehicle. And we have had a nice healthy cash return of dividends and share buyback. And I think if we are successful, profitable generating that kind of cash, that\u2019s what we ought to do is find that balance.","","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful perspective. Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities.","","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start on EPD, Miles, on the last call, you expressed your commitment to the business. I guess, I am wondering within EPD I mean you are obviously more excited about the emerging market opportunity. Do you need to have an EPD business in the developed market? That\u2019s my first question.","","Miles White","Need? No. It depends; I think it depends on the dynamics in any given market. I don\u2019t think any of us are pleased with the pressures or decline if you will of growth rates in say Europe but at the same time Larry it's extremely profitable business even with all the price pressure, utilization pressure and volume pressure. It's a very profitable business. So I think our challenge is it's always how long will these circumstances last. How long will these dynamics last? Is this a trend that doesn\u2019t change? Is there a bottom? Is there a turn? Is there, how long does this endure? And what\u2019s the best matter for us to drive best value for our owners, our investors, our shareholders in that time. You can get hung up on the optics of growth rate and say, Geez it's hurting, it's diluting my growth rate but at the same time I think the notion that it's making a fair amount of money and it's profitable and there is value in that. So I think our job is to figure out best way to optimally derive that value for our investor and that\u2019s a trade-off between what we can do here over some duration of time relative to how long we expect market conditions to exist or you know what\u2019s the best deployment of the asset value you know in the event we can drive the right value forward but when it's profitable as it is that\u2019s a tough trade-off.","","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities","It's helpful and then on adult nutrition, can you talk about the impact of the divestures and any quantification when that lapse in the adult nutrition business in the U.S.? Thanks.","","Brian Yoor","Larry this is Brian, you\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter on the adult segment in the U.S. around a 4 percentage point impact headwind and that also does spill into the first quarter as well. As we\u2019re talking about you know some of the things impacting first quarter that will be one item that spills into the first quarter of 2014 as well for the U.S. adult segment and nutrition.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Two questions first on the infant nutritional business, you mentioned on the call that the recovery in emerging markets China et cetera was on track. I was wondering if you could share with us some evidence that suggest that things are on track was December better than November, is there a script data that you\u2019re tracking? Any color that would be helpful to give us confidence that the business recovers other than just from easy comps and then as a follow-up\u2026","","Miles White","Go ahead Glenn I\u2019m chuckling a little bit because I\u2019m thinking no we just made this stuff up. Of course I will answer you in just a second, go ahead.","","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And then just second just on operating margin goals, it looks like you\u2019re going to get to the nutritional operating margin goals sooner than expected and it looks like diagnostics we\u2019re going to hit those goals quickly too. So, I\u2019m wondering as we look at nutritionals is 25% a realistic new goal and with respect to diagnostics are we in the late innings or is there another opportunity for more expansion there? Just you know qualitatively if you can help us think about the longer term goals there. Thanks.","","Miles White","All right let me go back to the beginning. First of all evidence of recovery. You know there is three major geographies that we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to in the recovery this recall that we experienced in nutrition. It's China, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia all of which are fairly important markets to us. We do get market share data; we get it from multiple sources in these countries. We get off take data meaning what leaves the shelf we get a fair amount of actually measured data. We get it from multiple sources and then we get a fair amount of anecdotal data as well. And we do track it, it is numerical, it is measurable. We\u2019re seeing sequential month to month, in fact we got a fairly I would say robust model that\u2019s been pretty accurate for us that\u2019s predictive, that takes into account holidays, buying patterns, consumer patterns all that stuff. Believe it or not in all these markets so we can do that. And there is a bit of a lag maybe a month or month and a half in some cases but and it varies by geography but we\u2019re able to measure our progress. We\u2019re ahead of our progress in China, our model; we\u2019re ahead of our expectation. We\u2019re ahead of our expectation. We are ahead of our expectation in Vietnam and we are a little behind in Saudi Arabia. And so we are able to measure that. We are able to see sequential evidence. We have got enough data points now that we can trust our forecasting, trust our model, trust our data, trust our feedback. Early, mid and late fall, we didn\u2019t have enough data points yet to be confident of the kind of trends we were seeing, because there is some, not cyclicality, but there is some up and down in the trends depending on holidays and other things. And we have seen enough of that now. We have had enough months of recovery that we can pretty reliably forecast for ourselves and for you how we will recover in the various countries. So I would say, yes, there is definite evidence, definite data. We definitely can see it and I am pleased by what I see. Frankly, I think our teams in those countries are doing an excellent job. It gives us not only data about us, but data about segments, data about competitors etcetera and what we \u2013 how we believe all of that\u2019s going. So I am pleased with what I see.","With regard to operating margin goals or even gross margin goals, I\u2019d say for diagnostics late innings, I think there is a point where even if we could do better, I am not sure I would want to. I would always look for improvements in gross margin, but then you have discretionary spending in R&D or sales and marketing expenses etcetera that then get down to operating margin. And I\u2019d say in the diagnostics business, I\u2019d say late innings because I\u2019d like to be putting more and more into R&D there. I think we have got a nice model from a sales and marketing standpoint, but as you know in the diagnostics businesses, we have got half a dozen systems, major systems in developments and these are expensive programs, all of which are tracking very well as we renew the system platforms that are in the markets. Over the next five, six years here, there is going to be a steady drumbeat of new product coming that\u2019s going to drive the growth of this business globally on top of the installed base we already have. And I think that those are very important initiatives. So I\u2019d like to be putting money into R&D and that\u2019s not to say or more money into R&D. That\u2019s not to say you should expect any kind of diminishment in bottom line, you should not. But I would like to be improving the gross margin in order to be able to invest more in what we would call discretionary spending in R&D and maybe even SG&A. So I would say that one. What we have managed profitability I think brilliantly and yes, they are ahead of schedule. I think it\u2019s delivered for the investor, the shareholder and the business. And strategically, it also needs to be reinvesting in itself as we go along which it\u2019s doing and I think it\u2019s found the nice balance.","On Nutritionals, I think there is still a lot of opportunity. And I would not go so far as to set a specific numerical target for you as ambitious as you might be, but I would probably say the same thing we are always looking to improve our gross margin and to the extent that drops through to the bottom line, that business is not as expense intensive in R&D. R&D doesn\u2019t cost as much as a percent of sales. And so it\u2019s a highly productive R&D organization in terms of new product development, new product innovation etcetera. And it\u2019s got a low percentage of sales spend on R&D. It\u2019s much more SG&A or marketing intensive. If I were going to spend more money promoting that business, I do it with sales and marketing lines. And I think that as the gross margin continues to improve there, which I expect it will substantially, I think there will be a sharing between dropping it to the bottom line for the investor and reinvesting further in sales and marketing and expansion, because there is so much opportunity, particularly internationally for this business.","So I think that\u2019s about how I would characterize that I do expect to continue to see margin expansion there. And I would say that these businesses in particular, all the businesses will put a fair amount of focus on margin expansion and they have gotten it. And you have seen that in the gross margin line in our reporting. You have also seen exchange, foreign exchange erode some of that or in some businesses like the vascular business while they have had great improvement also in gross margin and yields and productivity. We have also seen price pressures that they have had to absorb. And I think that the fact that under some of the pricing and utilization pressures we have seen in Europe and other geographies and some of our businesses over the last several years and particularly last year, the margin improvement initiatives that we have had, had not only mitigated that, but continued to improve margin anyway. So I think there is more to come.","","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Alright, great. Thanks for the color, Miles.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel.","","Rick Wise - Stifel","Good morning everybody. Tom, if I could ask you again on gross margin. So the 55% gross margin guidance you said included 90 basis points of negative FX, the diabetes and other offsets. Was that I assume that plant shut down is reflected in that as well. Can you break that portion out just more specifically?","","Tom Freyman","The plant shut down I referred to is just a timing issue that\u2019s effecting the gaining of sales that I want in particular business between the quarters. So that is really I mean certainly there is a little bit of startup and alike but it's not meaningful to the overall corporation but that really is not related. It's really the two big factors that we cited as lot of good things as Miles mentioned going on within the business is underlying and being a little bit offset, they are largely offset by those two factors.","","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay (indiscernible) it's part of the gross margin headwinds when I call temporary excess capacity from the three new nutritional facilities, is that a big factor?","","Tom Freyman","No there is a little bit of a startup there as well but again I don\u2019t think that\u2019s overall meaningful to the overall comparison year-over-year for the entire corporation. Certainly there is some cost in there but they have a lot of other good things going on in terms of their margin improvement programs that overall are driving an improvement in the nutrition gross margin in 2014.","","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","And one last quick one, the buyback, is that gets you to the middle of your guidance range or the high end? How do we think about that and maybe you can kind of whether you do an accelerated share repurchase. Thanks so much.","","Tom Freyman","The guidance is the guidance, it's the range and obviously our baseline expectation is to be within the range and if the year goes well it will be in the high end and it's the challenges we\u2019re going to work not to be the low, the middle. So that\u2019s the way we think about the guidance and what I would say is what is a definite part of the plan is to buy back shares roughly in the range we talked about today and certainly that\u2019s the baseline you can count on as you build your model for 2014 and there is no plan at this time to do an accelerated structure but that\u2019s something we would look at and we will think about.","","Operator","Thank you. My next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company. Josh your line is open please check your mute feature. And we\u2019re sorry we\u2019re getting no response we will move on to the next question.","Our next question today is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Just focusing on the vascular business. I know you had commented on strong growth in MitraClip I was wondering if you would be willing just to provide a baseline number of where it ended this year with European sales and then just thoughts around it as you\u2019re rolling this out in the U.S. just the strategy given the reimbursement environment.","","Brian Yoor","MitraClip had strong growth in Europe. I think it ended the year approximately around a $130 million. We expect some additional approvals in certain countries there to continue our growth in Europe so we expect another year of strong growth with MitraClip in Europe region in 2014. Now I will say with respect to the U.S. we were very pleased with the decision that was made by the panel last year to receive the approval that we have for the degenerative mitral regurgitation patient in the U.S. at high risk. It's a pretty I will say modest way to think about but we\u2019re going to take it the right way in terms of how we approach our centers and those large cardiac specialty centers that are capable and have the expertise to work with the MitraClip. Again another year of strong growth I think we can think about probably approaching close to 200 million as we move into 2014 but clearly between the Europe side and the U.S. side a nice contributor to our overall vascular growth.","We continue to work towards also the reimbursements and improving our reimbursements there I think we have discussed before that we ultimately foresee this coming more in line with the (indiscernible) line of reimbursement in the U.S. and again I know that (indiscernible) have submitted for the national coverage as well we also submitted for what you know what would also be a special add on technology indication but we will have more color to provide for you on both of those in the later part of 2014.","","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And then I got just more broadly just in structural heart, how do you just kind of see MitraClip fit again? Do you need to surround it with additional programs to really have that platform be competitive or do you think looking ahead just having a transcatheter mitral valve repair product alone will be successful within Abbott?","","Miles White","Kristen, this is Miles. I think it could standalone quite easily, but I think we are always looking for more innovation, the more opportunity to expand our position in a given treatment segment. So I would put up more in the desire rather than need. I think it\u2019s given the lack of therapies out there to treat patients, it clearly can standalone, but to the extent that other therapies evolve over time here, it\u2019s certainly to the benefit of the patient and the business to expand the offering.","","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Right. And then just on the stent business, I was wondering if you could offer any additional commentary just on the Absorb product, the one you are seeing in terms of market share positioning in the accounts in which you are in? And then just to remind on the timing to the U.S., I think you had mentioned that you expected to complete enrollment in the U.S. study this year. Just wanted to confirm that?","","Miles White","Let me address share and then I will hand it to Brian to talk about U.S. First of all, I am very pleased with how the overall shares of the stent business have evolved. We have grown share in all of our geographies. We hold the number one position in stents across Europe, the U.S., Japan etcetera. We have not only held share, but gained share. I think that\u2019s been gratifying for the breadth and the strength and the quality of the product line. I think it\u2019s been a challenging environment to some degree from a competitive or pricing standpoint. I think I expect that to mitigate some here going into this year and we are seeing that as we see sequential improvement in growth at least in our own business. And as regards to Absorb, I think the acceptance, the use of Absorb continues to improve, but share continues to improve and continues to grow in many accounts. And then I would have to note that while the trend has been a fair amount of price degradation in this segment, Absorb is selling at a premium to metal drug-eluting stents etcetera. So it continues to gain share. It continues to gain a share of procedures in accounts where it\u2019s being used. It continues to grow very nicely and do so at some premium to what are truly good quality stents out there in the metal drug-eluding stent category. So with that let me give you to Brian to talk about the U.S.","","Brian Yoor","Yes. So Kristen, obviously Absorb had a great contribution as Miles had mentioned to Europe and our share gains there year-over-year. In the U.S. as we are expecting to complete the enrollment in 2014 and that also goes for China as well. We just completed enrollment for Japan. I think the way to think about this too is we are only in half of the market, the worldwide market today if you think about it in terms of being in Europe, but we still have another half of the world to go here. And so by completing the enrollments, we set ourselves out there to be the only one in this kind of technology with the opportunity to continue to penetrate and achieve the workforce status we expected to. We have left time for one more question.","","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Jason Bedford from Raymond James.","","Jason Bedford - Raymond James","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to revisit an earlier question on EPD, still unclear as to the source of the sluggishness in developed markets, is it increased competition, is it a demand issue, is it price? And then just as a follow-up, can you kind of give us the estimated market growth rates in EPD and if it\u2019s easier you can split it between emerging markets and developed markets?","","Miles White","In the developed markets, it\u2019s a little bit of the items you discussed. I mean, price as we have talked about the couple of years, it\u2019s probably been running at a rate twice what it had been prior to maybe 2012 and it has been very low single-digits and has probably doubled for a period of time that seems to be mitigating a little bit as we go forward. And I would say, the balance is basically either austerity in some of the countries, where scripts are actually down or in some cases in our portfolio, a few of our products have, were at the end of lives in Europe. We did have a few of those. We had a few patented products and some of those went off patent. And each one is relatively minor, but that\u2019s been part of what\u2019s going on in the developed world. I would say in terms of market growth rates it depends on markets obviously you know India for us is a key market and while it's slowed probably into the mid-single digit range in 2013, IMS forecast it will be back into that double digit range in 2014 which is a positive for us. I would say overall in the key emerging markets you know we\u2019re seeing basic market growth probably in that mid-single range maybe even a little bit better in a country like Russia for example and I think most investors are familiar that Europe has been a pretty sluggish market overall from a volume perspective and that\u2019s carried over into our business as well.","","Jason Bedford - Raymond James","And then just lastly for me, getting back to the discussion on cash repatriation. Do you anticipate that you will be more active with M&A in \u201914 than you were in \u201913?","","Tom Freyman","I think it all depends on the opportunities out there. I don\u2019t feel cash constrained about any of that. I feel more constrained by what I view as a not terribly robust set of opportunities or valuations. I\u2019m always vigilant for opportunities for the company but they got to be good fits strategically and they got to be good valuations.","","Brian Yoor","Okay thanks Jason and thank you operator and thank you for all your questions.

Welcome to Abbott's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Scott Leinenweber","Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.","Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.","Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's medical optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017, as well as the current and prior year sales for Alere which was acquired on October 3, 2017.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay. Thanks Scott and good morning. Today we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.73 above our previous guidance range. We also raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.85 to $2.91, which now reflects 15% growth at the midpoint. All four of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter and contributed to 8% sales growth overall above our previous guidance range.","Over the past several years we have executed a very deliberate strategy of shaping our portfolio, both adding and pruning. At the same time we have also invested organically in growth areas that have resulted in game changing technologies such as Freestyle Libre and Alinity. These steps have created leadership positions in attractive areas of healthcare where innovation makes a big difference to the customers we serve and consequently for our performance.","The strong results we are achieving are a direct result of this strategy. Over the past four quarters, we have averaged more than 7% organic sales growth, a true differentiator for a company our size. And with synergies in recent acquisitions and our focus on margin expansion, we are able to fully fund our growth opportunities while at the same time growing earnings significantly faster than sales. We continue to forecast strong performance for the remainder of the year as evidenced by the fact that we are raising our full-year earnings guidance, despite the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Clearly, we would be raising guidance a bit higher if based solely on the underlying performance of our business.","I will now summarize our second quarter results before turning the call over to Brian. I will start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6.5% in the quarter, including 8% international growth in our core laboratory business. The pace of our Alinity launch in Europe continues to accelerate driven by strong competitive win rates and even stronger retention rates. This business, which is already a global leader and growing faster than its market, is well-positioned for sustainable growth for years to come as we capture share and rollout the full suite of Alinity systems across additional geographies including the U.S.","In rapid diagnostic, second quarter sales were driven by infectious disease and cardiometabolic testing. The management team has done an excellent job of integrating of stabilizing the business, identifying and realizing synergies and implementing strategies to drive long-term growth.","In established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where we have built leading positions in the fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world, sales grew more than 12% in the second quarter. EPD continues to execute its unique strategy and is growing faster than the market in several of its priority countries, including India and China. Our focus on enhancing the depth and breadth of our product portfolios and local capabilities continues to strengthen our position and long-term growth opportunities across these markets.","In nutrition, sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance across our international business. We have now achieved several consecutive quarters of improving performance for this business. In adult nutrition, growth was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands, most notably internationally, where we saw double-digit growth. In pediatric nutrition, strong performance was led by balanced growth across several countries in Asia, including Greater China and Latin America.","And lastly, I will cover medical devices, where sales grew more than 8% led by strong double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and diabetes care. In electrophysiology, growth of 22% was led by our advance cardiac mapping and ablation portfolio as well as Confirm, the world's first and only smartphone compatible insertable cardiac monitor. During the quarter, we further strengthened our product portfolio in the U.S. with the launch of our Advisor HD catheter, which includes a first of its current configuration to create highly detailed maps of the heart.","In structural heart, strong growth across several areas of our portfolio was led by MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally invasive repair of mitral heart valve. Earlier this month, we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation version of MitraClip, which includes design enhancements and an additional clip size to enable more patients to be treated.","In vascular, during the quarter we received FDA approval for XIENCE Sierra, the newest generation of our leading coronary stent system, which will enhance our competitiveness in the U.S. market. And we also received national reimbursement for XIENCE Sierra in Japan during the quarter.","Lastly, in diabetes care, sales grew over 30% for the third consecutive quarter driven by Freestyle Libre, our highly differentiated sensor-based glucose monitoring system. Libre offers a true mass-market opportunity with its unique combination of affordability, accessibility and ease of use and it's achieving a level of patient adoption that's unprecedented in the industry with more than 800,000 current users globally.","So in summary, this was another very good quarter as we execute on our strategic priorities. All four of our businesses exceeded expectations for quarter and contributed to strong growth overall. And lastly, we started the year with strong double-digit EPS guidance and despite recent currency shifts, today we are raising our outlook even higher based on the strength of our underlying performance.","I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 8% on an organic basis, above our previous guidance range. Sales in Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired late last year and is therefore not included an organic sales growth results, achieved sales of the $484 million. Exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1.7% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthened versus several currencies resulted in a less favorable impact on our sales this quarter compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018, based on our strong performance and momentum, we are increasing our organic sales growth forecast to 6.5% to 7.5%. At current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 50 basis points on full-year reported sales which would be around 170 basis points lower than expectations based on exchange rates in April. In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 59% of sales, which includes underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat below 30.5% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2018. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.73 to $0.75. We forecast organic sales growth of mid-to high single digits. And at current rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on reported sales. And in addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of approximately $500 million in the third quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales.","Before we open the call for questions, I will now provide an overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-to high single-digit sales growth, which takes into consideration our strong third quarter results last year when clearly sales patterns in India were impacted by the implementation of the new tax system in that country. In nutrition, we forecast mid-single digits growth for the third quarter and are increasing earlier forecast for 2018 to mid-single digits as well. In diagnostics, we forecast mid-to high single-digit sales growth. And in medical devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for the third quarter and are increasing earlier forecast for 2018 to high single digits as well, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Miles, you had two dynamics that really stand out to us this quarter in addition to obviously the stronger organic number, are just international nutrition recovery and obviously the Libre progression. So can you just give us some details on sort of the drivers in nutrition acceleration, the sustainability in the back half of the year? And the Libre, where it is relative to your plan and your comfort with $100 million number in U.S. Libre this year? And I had a quick follow-up.","Miles White","Okay. In the nutrition business, I would say, first of all we are pleased with the success and performance. It's across the board. It's not in any one place. We been through pretty detailed views and plans by geographic area and so forth. A lot of times, we are talking about nutrition in terms of either the U.S. or China. In this case, it's actually not concentrated that way. It's really across the board in all the countries we are in.","So I am pretty pleased to see uniform increase in performance and our plans taking hold and working in a lot of countries internationally. And like a lot of things, it's small things and a lot of them in coordination, blocking and tackling and just doing a better job with marketing, our positioning of products and so forth. So as far as sustainability goes, I feel like this business ought to be able to perform in a, call it, low to mid single-digit range on a fairly sustainable basis and if we can stay in the range we are in, that's pretty good.","I feel pretty good about that. And it's up and down, depending on promotions and given geographic areas from time to time, we will see a competitor put on a heavy promotion in something like adult nutrition in the U.S. and it goes way. The share doesn't change much in that case. But long-term sustainable growth here, we continue to maintain our position as the market and even advance it in a number of cases. So I feel like it's pretty solid and look forward to expand at, call it, a mid single-digit level.","With regard to Libre, we can't be anything but pleased. It's going extremely well. We are on track with where we want to be in terms of patient acquisition and growth, et cetera. We have nothing to compare us to. No real market dynamics compare ourselves to other than the acquisition of patients and we expect go out of the year with over a million patients, which is unprecedented and unseen. We think this is a mass-market sort of a product as opposed to very niche medical device type product because there are so many people that are either insulin-dependent or trying not to be insulin-dependent.","So I think the opportunity here remains enormous. I think the growth is quite sustainable. There is quite a lot more to do to keep enhancing, not only the product, the offering, the market so forth, we like the mix of patients we are getting. We like the geographic mix. We like this geographic advancements. The reimbursements has been very good. Just about everything about this is going better than planned. So I think this is one of the key big sustainable growth drivers of the company along with the system family Alinity in the diagnostic area.","We have got a number of growth drivers here, either bit innovative products like this or a collection of, call it, smaller innovative niches like we have got in and niche is probably, to describe it, too small but a lot of places where innovation makes a big difference in medical devices and then you have got market growth and in spite of the volatility of currencies that affect our pharmaceutical or nutrition business, the underlying market still had very strong growth. And so I think all of our growth drivers look very reliable for the long term.","David Lewis","All right. Thanks Miles. Very clear. And just another quick focus from me was the neuromod, a focus for the quarter. You are kind of anniversarying some fairly explosive growth in that business. But can you just discuss the relative change in neuromod growth this quarter, the drivers of it? What are you doing to address it? And do you believe this portfolio can get back to market growth? Thanks so much.","Miles White","Yes. Good question. You have got a couple of things going on here, one of which you observed. Explosive growth last year, which is actually interestingly a part of the problem. I think this was a bit of a self-inflicted wound. This is a business where the business is very dependent on the involvement of the representative, the sales representative, et cetera, not only with the physician but also with the patients. And we did not expand our sales force in concert with the rate of explosive growth we experienced. And when we finally did expand our sales force recently, it turned out to pretty disruptive to do that in the way we did it.","And I would say, the issue we created for ourselves was disruption in our own sales here with additions of new salespeople and new service people in the field and so forth. You re-cut territories. You have a lot of training and so forth. So I think we have added to our comp issue here. So do I think it gets back to market growth? Yes, absolutely. I think this is a temporary condition created by us. It will fixed by us. And we will figure out how to successively expand our sales force in concert with our growth in, let's just call it, a smoother fashion in the future. We did this to ourselves.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks so much, Miles.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats again on a good quarter. So it looks like, based on the guidance, you are forecasting similar growth in the second half, once adjusting for the Indian GST benefit that we saw in EPD in the first half. So I guess my question is, Miles, why do you feel confident you can sustain similar underlying growth in the second half, given that the comp is significantly tougher in the second half? And I had a follow-up.","Miles White","Well, first of all, the underlying dynamics of our markets underlying are pretty strong. Our single biggest, I guess, forecastable or not forecastable concern is currency. And I think you are going to hear that from a lot of companies. I think we are all seeing stronger dollar and in our case, we will speak for us, we have a significant portion of our business in high growth markets, most of which are unhedgeable currencies and are volatile currencies, emerging markets, et cetera. And we like the growth and we like the underlying trends and dynamics of those markets. And I think those have proven to be pretty robust and beneficial but they also come with the unpredictable volatility of currency from time to time.","So as I said in my opening remarks, we would probably raising guidance even further here, but for currency headwinds that we see for the remainder of the year and having been through this cycle a number of times, you are always cautious about the second half of the year until you get to now and see what currency is doing because the first half of the year, you think you know what it's going to do but you really can't predict that far out. It's clearly made a big change since the first quarter. So we have observed a fair bit of that negative currency headwind already. And we will probably end up observing more here in the second half but we think we have got a pretty good handle on what we face. But the underlying dynamics of the real business are all pretty good.","Now, that said, things never go exactly like you expect them to go. And you take a business like our pharmaceutical business, it's lumpy. If you have got a year with GST or other factors that creates oddball comparables from year later quarters and so forth, you are automatically going to be lumpy the following year again. So in a business that has a mix of emerging markets, it's almost always up-down, up-down, up-down. The good news is, even when it's down, the growth rate is still pretty high. So we go from a good growth rate to a great growth rate to a good growth rate, back and forth because it's a bit volatile.","Last quarter, it was some dynamics in Russia, this quarter it's comparables to GST. We will probably have the same thing, because you really that creates a sequential quarter comparable issue in the EPD business last year. So we are going to see ups and downs that way in some of these businesses and like you guys, our first question is, is there something fundamental about the performance of the business, the performance of the market or have we just got timing dynamics or volatility dynamics and so forth? The underlying growth rates in EPD remain very strong across our collection of emerging markets. So I think we tend to look at it that way. We address everything we see. I think we are going to see ups and downs here in a lot of these businesses. Look, we see neuromod at a slower growth rate this quarter as David just pointed out.","Do I think the underlying dynamics of that market are somehow unattractive? Absolutely not. That market remains attractive. And do I think we will do well in it? Yes, we will do really well in it. But next year, we will be referring back to this quarter from a comparable standpoint and so forth. So I am quite confident that what I see in the underlying trends of each of these businesses is pretty good. I am very pleased with nutrition. I am very pleased with the acceleration in Alinity, in diagnostics. I am pleased with the steady ramp which only gets better and better with Libre. And those are big, big growth drivers across the board. So while they may go up and down a couple of percentage points here and there, the underlying overall growth rate is pretty strong. And like I said earlier, we would have probably raised guidance further but for the concern about exchange.","Larry Biegelsen","That's helpful. And then for my follow-up to follow up on David's question. With your MedTech, there were some pockets of strength like diabetes and electrophysiology, but there were a couple soft spots like CRM. You have already addressed neuromodulation and heart failure. So any more color on CRM and heart failure? How we should be thinking about those segments in the second half of the year. Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles White","Yes. There's a couple of dynamics going on with CRM and that one gets a fair amount of my attention, I would tell you. First of all, we have got a little bit of a tough comparison to last year because we launched low voltage MRI compatible products and obviously had stocking dynamics in the second quarter and so forth. But beyond that, there is also sort of an underlying battery replacement timing thing going on here because when St. Jude, prior to us, in 2015, 2016 had it's battery issues, it pulled forward a lot of replacements to replace those batteries. So you see fewer replacements now because they were pulled forward, whereas in the de novo segment, we have got new patients, we are doing extremely well.","So when you kind of take it apart, you look at it and say, well, if we are right about our diagnosis and analysis here, we should see this pick up in the future with a bit of a tailwind once we get past this replacement phenomenon relative to 2016. So we have looked at that. I think for the rest of this year, we are probably flat in CRM but that's not a not satisfactory position for us. So my expectation is, we keep improving the growth rate here. We are not happy with what the growth rate looks like, but we think we understand why.","With regard to electrophysiology and others, these are doing great, as you point out. Heart failure, we need a destination therapy claim and I think we are going to be great shape. I think it's that simple.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two, one kind of big picture and one on divisional level. From a big picture perspective, you guys have been very clear on the topic of durable revenue growth. I have a question on durable earnings growth. And the reason I ask the question is that your earnings growth obviously been running well above your targets. As we go forward, if you are successful in driving the kind of revenue growth you think you can drive in this business, what does the durable earnings growth outlook look like for the company? Is it closer to 15% than 10%? Just any thoughts on that topic you can share.","Miles White","Many times in these call, somebody tries to get me to forecast future earnings growth. And I think we start every year with a goal, in fact even a long-term of double-digit earnings growth and that you might say, well that sort of backs into 10% or 9.999% or whatever. And we don't necessarily hit it every single year, but pretty darn close and some year it is lot more than that. So I would tell you that our overall strategy is, we want to grow at a double-digit rate otherwise difficult to call yourself a growth company. We have got a lot of pieces in this company.","We have tried to position it in growth markets, growth segments, growth products, innovative areas and so forth and we also have some extremely profitable cash generating legacy businesses that grow slower but they are still growth. And those businesses, we do look for incremental growth and the kind of delivery of profit that's above the sales growth rate. And overall that mix has to deliver that double-digit target for us, which is why we have shaped the company as we have over the last six years to add growth and prune away some things that may not fit us over the long-term.","We have tried to put ourselves in the right geographic markets, the right innovative spaces, the right growing healthcare areas and so forth. You know we have talked about it. And we always look for leverage on the bottom line by improvements in margin, gross margin, even our spending efficiency and so forth. So I don't know that I can predict, whether it's 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%. But I can tell you we start every year with the presumption, that's our identity, that's our hallmark, that's the mix of our businesses, that's the mix of our products. And we build our product strategies and business strategies to deliver that.","There is a lot of things that change, as you know, over the course of the year. And the year never goes quite like you expect it to go. And I am eliminating exchange for a minute here. Even it's just the dynamics of markets, trade, whatever it may be, new product approvals or ways, et cetera. So we have got a lot of moving parts and I think that as a mix of businesses we have got a really robust, strong, powerful mix of innovative profitable businesses. We are a really great new product cycles of launches. Every piece of this has a nice sustainable long-term ahead of it here and the businesses, you can see evidence of it growing.","So beyond that, I am not sure I can predict more accurately for you what it's going to be other than we have put a lot of growth drivers here. We are not organically getting a lot of growth out of the Alere business this year, as you know, because we are selling that in, but I am really pleased with its performance. It's above of our expectations and we haven't even begun to see how that's going to deliver for us in the coming years. So I would just look at the way we were managing the delivery of the various pieces of our business, we always got a lot of shots on goal here and a lot of products to expand. So I would tell you, our goal is always double digits and beyond that I am not ready to tell you how many double-digits for next year.","Bob Hopkins","Fair enough. But I appreciate the detailed answer. And the one other thing I want to touch on really quickly was just, if there is one businesses that seems like it's really done better than you thought at the beginning of the year, it's maybe nutritional. So I was wondering if you could just talk about what's driven the improvement and how sustainable that is? Thank you.","Miles White","Well, I think, you know, I go back to, there's no one thing. Our markets are all a little different. You would think that infant formula Ensure wouldn't be that complicated, but it actually is at some level and the dynamics of each market are a little different. In some ways, the same multinational competitors in most of our geographies, but even they don't have the same strategies or even same products in every market. And then there's always a lot of local or regional competitors.","And in a country like Vietnam, we have got a very strong state competitor there in Vinamilk, a fine company and they execute very well. They happen to be really strong in rural areas. We happen to be really strong in big cities. That's a dynamic that's unique to Vietnam. The dynamics we face in the Middle East or other markets in Asia are different. So it's no one thing, I am afraid.","We can try all those consultant four-box matrices to sort of say, all of these countries are like this and put them in the upper left-hand corner box and so on, but even doing that, that's artifice. Each country is a little different. I would say overall, we needed to improve several things. The focus of our products. You can have too many. You can have too few. But you have got to have certain ones. You have got to have certain innovations. You have got to have certain ingredients. And you have got to have marketing that appeals to the consumers and\/or physicians or hospitals that you are trying to appeal to. It's a little tailored to each market.","We literally went country by country, call it top 15 countries and went through detailed analysis and new strategies and so forth. You say, well, was there a lot of management change? Actually not. In a few places, yes, but not that many. It's really us and our execution and we took that bar up and it shows. It shows. We have got a pretty strong business there. I think we slipped off the rail a little bit for a while and I am pleased to see that the top management, some of which is new, has established pretty good direction for each of the major geographies now and beyond that, it gets to be a lot of little details that you have got to execute better.","We have seen a lot of channel change. We have seen a huge impact of online or digital marketing, digital shipment, et cetera. As channels, we have seen specialized channels evolve, baby stores and so forth. So I think we were slow to adjust and adapt to that. I think others did it faster than we did and we got left behind. We now understand what we missed. We understand what we needed to do about it and we have either done it or we are doing it and it clearly shows and makes a difference. So I think we had to be pretty honest with ourselves about mistakes we had made or things we had missed and now we are correcting that with a vengeance and running hard here. So I think the execution is a lot better.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Novarro","Hi. Good morning. Hi Miles, two questions on Libre. First, can you give us a little bit more color on the U.S. rollout and where you are with commercial coverage? And are you still comfortable with your Libre guidance for the year which in the U.S., I think, is $90 million to $100 million? And then, I had a follow-up.","Miles White","Yes. I have a real quick answer to that. Yes, we are absolutely comfortable with the guidance for the year. We are on track, Glenn. I would like to go even faster. As I have said before, we are even investing heavily in capacity expansion and so forth to anticipate even greater growth in the future and there's really nothing to compare it to. I think the whole space is getting increasing attention and we have, as you know, carved out a very economic position that's extremely profitable for us, but we are in a very, let's call it, economically accessible price point which has made the uptake and the reception by the patient or the consumer or even reimbursing bodies pretty attractive.","And I think we have found a real value proposition point here with the product. Our manufacturing is extremely automated. It gives us a big advantage in terms of cost. And everything is kind of working well here. I am pretty excited about this product. It's got so much potential because I think a lot of times, whether it's a pharmaceutical, a medical device, et cetera, they can be expensive in the healthcare system for recovery of costs and so forth because the numbers of patients may not be that great.","And yet, there's a lot of diabetics in the world, including me. And there's millions that are insulin-dependent and millions that don't want to be insulin-dependent, et cetera. This product hits the sweet spot and to be a mass-market product, it's got to be accessible, it's got to be affordable and it's got to be affordable in a way that it's not hard for people to commit to it, use it and find out what it can do for them and so forth.","So I would say that's all going super. We like the split we are seeing of Type 1s versus Type 2s. We are probably globally about two-thirds Type 1s and a third Type 2s. I think that's a pretty good mix. And it speaks to the clinical efficacy and the benefits of the products and the two different types of users that benefit from it. So at this point, it's all about how fast can we run? And I think the uptake by consumers, the retention, the repeat, all that, all of our data says this is going well.","And as I indicated to you, we will go out at the end of the year with more than a million patients worldwide, a significant number in the U.S. I think we will probably be, well, we are so far and away the global leader in this space now, it's almost, there's no way to kind of look at share. We have looked at, what you call, sensor days. If you take the sensors, numbers of patients, whatever and how many days of testing you get out of that, we are already well above 90% globally and there's nothing to compare to and it's a huge market. So I think that just the opportunity here, we are comparing to us and how fast we can run and that's really an exciting product, I will tell you. It's nice to see a product that has that kind of impact. And this one is just fun. It's just fun.","Glenn Novarro","And let me just have one quick follow-up. Can you discuss what's next in terms of features for Libre and timing? Thanks.","Miles White","I could, but I am probably not going to set any expectations around that because I don't want to create trigger points or talking points or whatever catalysts, I know, all the terms you guys like to use. There are a number of things that we have planned, in place, done the work, et cetera, for enhancements to the product, obvious ones, some of which are already available overseas. It's a little different challenge working through the FDA here in this country. So I don't want to get into the space or the discussion, but we have got plenty of enhancements and thoughts here for advancing the 1product still further, Glenn.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Thanks Miles.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Good morning Miles.","Miles White","Good morning Rick.","Rick Wise","Maybe starting off with a big picture question. In some of your earlier comments you lightly touched on this, but when we think about your priorities right now, should we imagine that you are focused, now that everything's humming along, should we expect you to be largely focused just on continued execution with the portfolio you have? Or do you think the portfolio is in good shape as it exists? Or are you thinking about not just M&A and of course, I am always interested in hearing about your interest in opportunistically adding technology or inorganic growth, but with your existing portfolio, are you now more aggressively looking at the pieces you have and thinking you might be more actively thinking about trading out, the net benefit of which would be enhanced growth and\/or margins? Both ways, in and out.","Miles White","You know, I get this question in one form or another on every call and every visit to investors and so forth and it's always a fun, speculative question. But the honest answer is, look I think, we did some very deliberate shaping of the company, let's say, since the AbbVie split over the last six years. And that's not been accidental or reactive or opportunistic. It's been with intent and a plan and so forth. At this point, I also think companies can get a little too transactionally oriented. Everything's a transaction as opposed to you have got to run it and run it well. So philosophically, here's how we operate:","Our first baseline is, we have got to operate and execute well organically as a company. I know it's a word we have used a lot today, but I want to make a distinction between what we do as part of the ongoing operating of the company versus transactions, one way or the other. And our whole goal has been to establish the company with its own internal growth drivers, productive R&D, productive innovation, productive positioning in the right markets, the right segments, the right growth things because our investors expect us to make them money and do well with their investment and grow the company. So we have positioned ourselves pretty deliberately and intentionally in those kinds of spaces across the board.","I don't know that you are ever done and I don't know that you ever feel totally comfortable, you shouldn't, but I think we are in a pretty good place that way. We have got a lot of, what I would say was our intentional repositioning done. That means for us that we have got to integrate it all. We have pretty much done that. The integrations of St. Jude and Alere are pretty well done. I mean, it's finished. Other than capturing synergies as we go and establishing R&D pipelines where they may not have existed and so forth, speaking primarily of Alere there and not St. Jude because St. Jude has got a robust pipeline, those kinds of things. It's all about the ongoing delivery of new technologies, new products, new innovations, improvements on the ones you have and so on.","So over these last six to eight years, those R&D pipelines and everything have been well established, not just within Abbot, but within St. Jude too. So, we like the hand we are holding and that means you have got to make sure that as a baseline can deliver your company's strategic goals and in our case, it does. So that means any transaction for us becomes opportunistic and does that opportunity fit us strategically? Is it something we are prepared to react or respond to? We would like to be in a position where it's a choice, not a necessity per se. And I think that's where we are. And right now, we have said for this period of time, because we took on a lot of debt to conclude the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, we want to pay down that debt.","Well, we are way ahead of schedule paying down our debt, as you know and shortly here we wanted to pay back $8 billion this year. We are just about there and we will be there well before year-end in terms of debt paydown because we have had really good cash management, really good cash flow, et cetera. We have been able to pay a dividend, we will raise our dividend at some point. We will have a steady march with our dividend like we always do. We have been able to fund the capital expenditures internally that drive our growth and our business. We have got some heavy capital investment right now in both Libre and Alinity and I anticipate that will continue to be the case, but it's not an affordability issue for us. So I think our priorities in terms of cash use and investment internally, we are easily making those goals.","So we can afford to be opportunistic if something attractive comes along, but I would tell you that I haven't seen anything that compels me or is sitting on the edge of our radar screen at this point. The single biggest opportunities we have got are all in our own pipelines and in our businesses now and in the markets we are in. The biggest opportunities we have got are right in front of you. The question is how big and how fast and those trends, what we think we see going forward looks awfully attractive. And, you would say, at some point, well, how far would you take debt down? How far would you pay down debt? What are you going to do when you hit the point where you think that's enough?","And I think there's a couple answers to that. A lot of people seem to get comfortable somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion. I remember when $15 billion worth of debt was still a hell of a lot of debt. And so I think and I also observe, as many of us have, I think you analysts as well, share buybacks right now aren't particularly economic. And they are not paying off all that well in the market. So you try to make your moves at prudent times. I think right now, prudence for us, we always have our periscope up looking at what's on the radar screen out there. I think there's places in medical devices and other things where we might opportunistically think there's something that would be a nice addition to our portfolio, but I don't think anybody should be holding their breath waiting for a great big move here.","I like the portfolio we have got. I am always questioned about the portfolio because everybody wants to help me tweak it, but it's a pretty strong portfolio. All the businesses are operating well and for the most part, they are at the early stages of growth cycles driven by new product innovations and technology innovations and so forth that are pretty healthy. Because we have got a higher index in emerging markets than a lot of companies, we are going to endure that bumpy road, but the underlying development of those economies and healthcare systems has been a big plus for us, both for pharma and nutrition and honestly, I think it is in devices and diagnostics too. There's some of those markets that don't economically work in those businesses, but some do. So I think our platter right now says we can afford to just be opportunistic.","I don't have big M&A on the radar screen or big transactions on the radar screen. I would say from a capital or cash allocation standpoint, I am going to keep paying down debt because I think that's a prudent path for now. I always like having maximum strategic flexibility for the company. I think our path here is clear. We have been prudent about when it's good to buy back share and when it isn't. I think our capital allocation has been pretty good. And the good news is we have got plenty of cash and capital to have choice and we can afford to be that discretionary about it. There's a constant stream of friendly investment bankers in and out, always telling us what's coming on the radar screen,. so I don't think we are missing anything. And right now, I like our portfolio a lot better than I like somebody else's.","Rick Wise","I appreciate that comprehensive answer. Just last for me. You had --","Miles White","That means I talk too much. Right, Rick?","Rick Wise","I would never say that, Miles. No, really, it was very helpful. You had a couple of notable new product approvals this quarter, the next-gen MitraClip and XIENCE Sierra. XIENCE Sierra is coming in the context of a vascular business that is slightly worse this quarter than the first quarter. Structural heart, obviously incredibly strong, accelerated. So maybe a little color on what we should think from MitraClip? Does the bigger reach open up more procedures? Does it accelerate growth? Does XIENCE Sierra get you back on track in vascular? I will stop there. Thanks again.","Miles White","Okay. Sure. Thanks for the question, Rick. Yes, I think MitraClip definitely opens up to more patients just because of the size changes and so forth that we have got more flexibility with that product. And any time you can do incremental improvements of products and enhance them further, you are extending their reach, extending their life, the competitiveness, et cetera. So I think all that's good for our structural heart business and then we have got more things in our pipeline coming.","The XIENCE Sierra, I will tell you, early returns in Europe is excellent and performance excellent. I think the same with Japan. We have just launched in the United States, so all I have got is anecdotal feedback. The U.S. and Japan and Europe, they are not the same, but they are close. So I expect Sierra to do well in the United States. And you say, well, will it get you back on the track? I think the track in the stent business is low single-digits at best. There's always a lot of competition in this business. We have talked about that. There's three or four pretty strong competitors here. I think the market has said, look, the magnitude or the biggest magnitude of innovation has been had. There's incremental improvements we can all make, but it's a very competitive space.","So I think being on track here is low single digits and that's, at least right now, what I expect out of this and I expect XIENCE Sierra to claim its share of the market, do well, be more than competitive and we will see that. We are seeing it in Europe. We are seeing it in Japan. So I expect to see it in the U.S. too. But I don't think this is a space where there's gigantic quantum leaps in offerings, but it's one of those very strong, very profitable important legacy cornerstones of the device business that it's important for us to maintain our leadership in and our competitive positioning and I think XIENCE Sierra definitely puts us back on that track.","Rick Wise","Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Can we spend a moment or two looking at the diagnostic business? Alinity has been launched in Europe for over a year. It's rolling out in the United States now. How should we think about that contributing and also whole business holistically now that Alere is part of it?","Miles White","Well, Joanne, Alere is part of the diagnostics business, but it's not integrated with the core lab business. So what we have got here is kind of a collection of businesses by major segment. So I think and let me just take that last part first. I think the space that Alere expands us in, point of care, near-patient testing, distributive testing, et cetera, which is also kind of a collection of spaces, I think we are in a very strong position. One of the things we would like to do, obviously, is renew or update or enhance a number of products and so forth. In other words, put a lot more into innovation and R&D there. But we have got a very strong portfolio. Right now, I would call it a stable portfolio that's at a low growth point, but that's not where we ultimately expect it to be.","And since the time we acquired Alere, we have said for a while here, that's not going to be a high grower, but we expect it to be and we do. And I would tell you that so far, everything that you would have to do to integrate a business, make it part of the company, put management in place that hasn't been there before and so that's all gone exceptionally well, way faster than we might have thought. So we are really pleased with that business. We are really pleased with it in the portfolio. We are super pleased with how the management team there is doing. All good. All good, all day and we look forward to its contribution to our growth and innovation over the future here because I think that's exactly what it's going to do.","Back to Alinity. There's a couple of things to understand about this space or spaces. We don't always determine when the customer wants to buy or when the customer has to make a decision. So first of all, because these are big mainframe systems, core laboratories, blood screening enterprises and so forth, they tend to be contracted or tenders that are five, seven or even ten years. They are usually longer-term contracts. They are big installations. The change from one competitor to another or old systems to new systems and so forth, it's not quick. It will take a couple of months and so forth. So these are big mainframe sorts of enterprise decisions and we are kind of on their schedule.","So we can do a lot to enhance that or even speed it up, which we are doing. The receptiveness to something new, if you are replacing old systems depends on the completeness of your menu so that you can do a full swap-out and not have to run two different systems at the same time, et cetera, even though a lot of labs do. So those are just dynamics we deal with in the market every day.","I would say our menu in Europe is full and robust. It's a big menu in the U.S. and other countries, not as big as Europe, but coming fast and we are talking anywhere from 150 to 200 different tests here that have to be on that box, each of which have to be individually approved and licensed, et cetera. So we are in a really strong position that way in Europe. That menu ramp up obviously takes a little bit of time. It takes a little bit of time in the U.S. and everywhere. So we are getting through that or past that now. We are tracking, like you would in any capital business, prospects which I think has more than, gosh, quintupled in the last several quarters here and we are tracking closed rates. If we are in a competitive situation where we are already in there, I think our win rate is about 97%.","We are keeping everything that we have already got and then expanding beyond that. In places where we are trying to replace competitive systems, our win rate is well above 50%.And that's really good from the standpoint of those accounts have to make a decision that they are actually going to swap out everything that they have had for a number of years and to have that kind of initial win rate here is pretty strong.","And so we like the win rates we are seeing, both in retention and new instruments and new placements and expansions and so forth. And a lot of times, you will get the first installation and then it expands from there. So, I would say all the metrics that we would track, including how fast it is to get up and running, test the record and so forth, they are all tracking exceptionally well. We are expanding our sales and service organizations in Europe as we speak. That hiring is going very well and very fast, a lot better than we did in neuromod, I can tell you that. We will take a lesson there.","And so the ramp up is moving faster and faster now. We have got a very specifically detailed plan about how many, how fast, on what pace, et cetera, gosh, for years ahead here and we have pretty well gotten every country mapped, every account mapped, et cetera. So now it's just a question of execution and how fast we can execute and that's doing really well. So I am pretty excited about the path ahead here in the diagnostics business on all fronts.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. And, my follow-up question is on your MitraClip franchise. We have the next-generation product, which was just FDA approved in a coop trial reading out in September. Can you just give us an update on where that business is? Thank you.","Miles White","Yes. I am going to ask Scott to help me with that, Joanne.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes. With respect to MitraClip, you can see the performance in the numbers there and structural heart is doing quite well. We will get a readout on the U.S. coop trial data later this year, very likely at the TCT conference in September. So that will be a big event for us. We are also doing quite a bit with respect to geographic expansion as well. We received national reimbursement in Japan here in the second quarter. That's a nice opportunity for us too. That market is quite sizable. So MitraClip is hitting on all cylinders with lot of growth in front of it.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you.","Miles White","So, Joanne, I would wrap-up. I liked the way Scott wrapped that up. It's hitting on all cylinders. Obviously, in a company of our size and diversity, everything doesn't hit on all cylinders all the time, but I will tell you right now, I think for the markets we have and let's call it the exchange and currency volatility we have all got out there and so on, I think the company is performing exceptionally well and I feel pretty good about all the underlying performance and the strength going forward here.","Scott Leinenweber","So operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And, our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","ChrisPasquale","Thanks. Miles, just a couple quick ones here for me. One on EPD business and the situation in Russia. I think you had previously said you still expected that to be a headwind in 2Q. Did that come back earlier than expected? And then just quickly on diagnostics, the legacy Abbott point of care business has slowed a little bit over the last few quarters. Is that a function of the integration work being done there? Or is there something else happening?","Miles White","Well, I will take the point of care first. You know, there's a couple things going on there and I would say a little bit of integration. We had a number of management changes because we were populating the new Rapid Diagnostics business. So we had a lot of new over new over new there and we may have lost touch with ourselves a little bit in the transition.","And yes, there's a couple customer dynamics, big accounts and so forth where we had some challenges that have since been addressed. So I expect that to improve. I don't think that's a long-term condition. But yes, we have had a couple of, let's just call it, slip-ups here that slowed our growth rate and I think we will be seeing that come back to much healthier growth rate.","With regard to Russia and EPD, I am going to get a little bit of help here from Scott and Brian but generally I would say, it's as predicted. I think we are seeing the cycle pass through here in the second quarter. I don't know that it's completely done but everything we kind of thought would play out is or has. And so we are seeing that come back to, let's call it, a better position.","Scott Leinenweber","I would just add, our end customer demand remains in line with our expectations. We are tracking that. And I would say this quarter, we actually returned to growth in Russia, which is a good sign based on the stabilization we are seeing and how the destocking has progressed as we had planned thus far.","Brian Yoor","I am actually kind of surprised we got it that close. Usually you try to predict these things and you are never right and it's actually turned out to be more right than we thought.","ChrisPasquale","Thanks. That's helpful and congrats on the strong results.","Miles White","Thank you.","Scott Leinenweber","Thank you. Well, thank you, operator and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of the call will be available after 11:00 A.M. Central time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Scott, and good morning. Today we announced results for the first quarter, and we\u2019re off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects mid-teens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. ","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter we\u2019re right on track with those expectations. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results.","I\u2019ll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I\u2019ll start with diagnostics where sales were led by core laboratory growth of 10%. Alinity, our family of next-generation diagnostics systems is driving strong growth internationally and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity H, our hematology system, and obtained a CE Mark for Alinity M, our highly automated molecular diagnostic system, along with several infectious disease tests, and we\u2019re expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come.","In nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth and we\u2019re achieving above market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced cross our pediatric and adult nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, Pediasure, and Ensure all contributing to strong growth overall.","In established pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter to quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by 7.5% growth in our key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. ","Lastly, I\u2019ll cover medical devices where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in heart failure, structural heart, electro-physiology, and diabetes care. In heart failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported this approval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we\u2019re achieving. ","In structural heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve. During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip which significantly expands the number of people that can be treated. The formal process seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new TriClip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for TriClip in the coming months. ","I\u2019ll wrap up with diabetes care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80%. In a relatively short amount of time, Libre has achieved global leadership among CGM systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we\u2019re seeing for Libre, we\u2019re adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity which will come online starting in the second half of this year. ","In summary, we\u2019re right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, and we\u2019re well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis which is consistent with our previous guidance. ","Turning to our results, sales for the first quarter increased 7.1% and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. ","Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these rations were in line with previous guidance.","Turning to our outlook for the full year, we continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. ","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81 which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7% and at current rates we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter.","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single digit growth which is comprised of mid to high single digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales which reflects the recent continuation of a non-core low margin supply agreement. In nutrition, we forecast mid single digit sales growth. In diagnostics, we forecast Abbott\u2019s legacy diagnostics business, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point of care, to grow mid to high single digits. In rapid diagnostics, we forecast low to mid single digit sales growth. In medical devices, we forecast high single digit sales growth which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Taylor","Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It was encouraging to see a lot of the big growth drivers here stay on track and really drive healthy double-digit growth. I was wondering if you could spend some time on each of those and specifically address Libre - I think a lot of investors are anticipating Libre 2 and other enhancements that you could make there in addition to all the capacity you\u2019re adding. Can you talk about the pathway for Libre and some of the other big growth drivers?","Miles White","Sure Matt, thank you. I think I would say a couple things first before I focus just on Libre. We\u2019re seeing strength across the board in a lot of device and diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there or a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with, but I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot of pre-earnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to tell you from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we\u2019ve got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of it here, and the markets are all pretty attractive for us.","So first of all, I think we\u2019re in a much healthier environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There\u2019s a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy.","Then specifically to us, we\u2019ve got in our case, I think, great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we\u2019re in. To focus on diabetes care as a start, that\u2019s been a particular bright spot where clearly new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both Type 1 and Type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all counts and all points. We\u2019ve been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time, we\u2019ve achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both Type 1 and Type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously to not have to finger stick, the information, the continuous nature of it. The way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life changing, and that\u2019s been reflected. I think very importantly, it\u2019s been affordable to a degree that it\u2019s become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It\u2019s got a unique ease of use and it\u2019s got appeal for any kind of patient, so I think that\u2019s pretty important and it\u2019s reflected in the reimbursement worldwide. Eighty percent of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries, well over half of U.S. lives commercially--commercial lives are covered, so we\u2019re seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways.","We\u2019ve mentioned a number of times that we\u2019ve invested heavily in capacity expansion - that is correct. We\u2019ve put significant investment into that, and as we\u2019ve noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year, and then there\u2019s a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won\u2019t be any constraints to the growth that is possible there. I think it\u2019s going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Because there are so many millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not an niche product, not for Type 1s or Type 2s. There\u2019s not a niche here, there is a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them, so it calls for quite a lot of capacity. In the second half of this year, that will be initiated.","We have a number of things we\u2019re expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2 - that is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an ICGM. We\u2019re not going to forecast FDA review timelines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. ","I\u2019m trying to think of what else to tell you about that. It\u2019s already on the market in Europe.","Matt Taylor","That was very comprehensive, and I\u2019ll give you a second to think there. I think the one follow-up I had was just on Libre 2. You mentioned ICGMs. Can you talk about your confidence in your ability to get that? I also wanted to ask about the payor dynamics. Before last call, you talked about some preferential co-pays. Can you talk about any developments that you\u2019re seeing on the payor side in terms of support for Libre?","Miles White","I\u2019ll tell you what - I\u2019ll let our Chief Operating Officer, who\u2019s come from that business, answer that question for you. Robert?","Robert Ford","Yes, so on Libre 2 specifically in the U.S., the filing of ICGM, I\u2019ll just say we know what the ICGM standards are, we know what needs to be achieved, and we filed in the U.S. as an ICGM knowing what the standards need to be achieved. So we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, we look at what we filed and we know that we meet those standards, so to Miles\u2019 point, we\u2019re not going to forecast as to when that approval will come through, but I think it\u2019s clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed.","Regarding payors specifically in the U.S, I think that what we\u2019ve always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. If you look at a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that\u2019s slowly moving from something that was with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order, to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market, where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients to go to pharmacy and pick that up. A lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability, so we\u2019re seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we\u2019re over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population, and you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total Rxs, you can see that shift, you can see that occurring with Libre, and that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn\u2019t been done before with CGM systems. We did that, and we\u2019re starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy.","Miles White","Matt, I know you guys like data that you can track publicly. You can track that every week, and we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so forth continues to be obviously strong - frankly, right in line with our growth rates around the world as you\u2019d expect, because we\u2019re not trying to drive price here, we\u2019re trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. Obviously that\u2019s going pretty strongly.","There\u2019s nothing but happiness about this product, I can tell you. We\u2019re pretty happy with it. It\u2019s doing really well. I actually think we\u2019re kind of in its early stages, and at this point there\u2019s over a million Type 1 users of Libre around the world and those only make up two-thirds of our user base, so with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base, with the capacity expansion coming online we\u2019re obviously expecting this to be a continually big and bigger product for us.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thanks for all the color, and congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning, just a couple questions from me, one more broadly for Miles and then maybe a quick follow-up. Miles, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019d share with us how you see the pacing of the year from here. I think in the fourth quarter, the messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were suppressing growth and you expected that growth to improve in the first quarter, and sure enough that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s happened here, we\u2019re back in sort of the 7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you have these core growth drivers doing relatively well, a couple of businesses probably not performing where you\u2019d like them to perform, so how do we think about the pacing of the business from the first quarter on, given some of these very solid businesses and some of the businesses that are not performing as you\u2019d like?","Miles White","Well, a couple of sort of baseline comments there. Every year, we go into the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always look back-end loaded, toward the third and fourth quarters. I\u2019d say increasingly that\u2019s leveling a little bit in that it\u2019s still a climb as the year goes on, but in our case it\u2019s reflecting growth in penetration of new products. There\u2019s a couple of seasonalities in there, but they\u2019re not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We\u2019ve increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters, but to be honest, third and fourth is always strong but it\u2019s driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There is so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. ","I think it\u2019s always hard to gate to the penny - we try to get our estimates to a point like that, then we\u2019re always subject to a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess because it looks optically weird when it\u2019s bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you said, it\u2019s not only intact, it\u2019s strong, but there are a couple of places you could poke at and say, okay, you must not be satisfied with that, and I\u2019d say yeah, you\u2019re right about that. But while we\u2019ve got some places we\u2019re putting a lot more focus on and we\u2019ve obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I\u2019d say in general I\u2019m glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So you know, Alinity is performing strongly, we are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business and we\u2019re winning almost two-thirds of the accounts where we\u2019re head to head with an entrenched competitor. That\u2019s pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch out mainframe systems, it\u2019s a big commitment, it takes months, they\u2019re long term contracts. So to be winning almost two-thirds of those new business, new accounts, that\u2019s pretty significant. That\u2019s a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we\u2019re offering.","We\u2019re seeing an improvement in growth just about every place. I\u2019m really pleased with nutrition. I\u2019ve had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we\u2019re expecting to get a little better, but it\u2019s performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That\u2019s been nice story, and we\u2019ve estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward, we would look for in the 4% to 6% range, and obviously we\u2019re a little beyond that. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to constantly be beyond that, but that 4% to 6% range is all good so anywhere in there is pretty good for us. There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on holidays and seasons and so forth, but overall if we\u2019re not watching it week to week, that\u2019s a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management\u2019s done a great job worldwide.","So as far as quarters coming, I\u2019m hard pressed to find a lot of things to point as watch-outs, other than as you pointed out, we\u2019ve got a couple of places where we think we\u2019ve got work to do to improve the performance of the business. I\u2019m pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business, but as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there\u2019s a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed. ","David Lewis","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful as we think about the balance of the year. I guess my follow-up would just be the other major growth driver investors are focused on is MitraClip. By our math, it looks the U.S. business accelerated for MitraClip even before the NCD, and I wonder if you could just, a, talk about time of the NCD, what you\u2019re seeing the U.S. and then you had this other study, MitraFR in the European business, and our sense on diligence is that\u2019s maybe suppressing some performance ex-U.S., so maybe time of the NCD, U.S. trends, and what you\u2019re seeing ex-U.S. and outlook for the year. Thanks so much.","Miles White","Okay, I\u2019m going to have Robert take that.","Robert Ford","Okay, so yes, we had a very good quarter in structural heart and we showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously MitraClip was a big driver and we\u2019re right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead, but I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT patient enrollment criteria, so we\u2019re now obviously working on CMS. The process is underway. These usually take between six to nine months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. We know how to do this, we\u2019re currently in the process, and it will just be a little bit difficult to forecast here but we\u2019re very optimistic.","But I\u2019d say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It\u2019s definitely an important building block but it\u2019s not the only one to really think about this business as a multi-year, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. There are other building blocks here that are very important that we\u2019re currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. and I think over the next few years, we\u2019ll see that number get to about 550. There\u2019s a lot of training that\u2019s involved here also - sales force training, center training, implanter training, and if you look at a sales rep, it will usually take them between six to nine months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip, and then there\u2019s obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those get funneled into our implant centers.","So those are some of the key blocks, but I\u2019d say we know how to do this. We\u2019ve been doing it in the U.S. for the last four years and we\u2019re not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We\u2019re already hiring more reps, we\u2019re expanding our sales force, we\u2019re expanding our clinical specialists so that we\u2019re going to be ready to go, so we\u2019re definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. ","I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, an unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott, and quite frankly we\u2019ve been--you know, this position didn\u2019t happen just because of COAPT. We\u2019ve been building this position for over a decade, so whether it\u2019s mitral repair or mitral replacement, we\u2019re in a pretty unique position. I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. ","Your question on MitraFR - yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. That was a French study, so it did have a little bit of an impact on some of the implanting rates in some key European markets, but I think that\u2019s more of a transition thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fundamental change in the market in Europe, and we have expanded internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us, so that is also going to help drive the growth. I think the MitraFR study will take another quarter or so to play out, but we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth.","David Lewis","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you and good morning. Just have two pretty direct questions here, one more to focus on the growth drivers. On Alinity, a question on the U.S. launch. When do you think we\u2019ll see the full impact of that launch in the U.S.? When does that really show up in results in a meaningful way? Thank you.","Miles White","You know, Bob, I\u2019d say show up, we expect to get the almost full menu by the end of this year. Now, that\u2019s kind of a running thing, and we don\u2019t want to put a whole lot of effort out until we\u2019ve got significant menu. We do have significant menu now, but we\u2019d like to get more of it approved and then go, so I think you\u2019ll start to see the U.S. show up in the numbers really in 2020, because even if we were launching now, I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to see it relative to the size of the business worldwide. We\u2019re growing at 9% right now in the U.S. without much emphasis on Alinity, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re probably going to see a measurable impact from it in 2020. But frankly, right now in the U.S., growth rate is pretty high even while we expand that menu.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. The other question I just wanted to ask, obviously you\u2019ve got a lot of growth drivers that are driving really strong results in devices overall. One thing that\u2019s been a little weak is on the neural mod side the last couple quarters. I guess my question on neural mod is do you think the weakness in the U.S. is related to a slower market at all or are these Abbott-specific issues, and when do you think we could expect a turn? ","Miles White","A good question. I kind of anticipated this one. This is the one where I\u2019m going to fall on my own sword for how fast I forecasted a turn here for us. There\u2019s clearly an Abbott issue here, our own management, which I\u2019ve said before, and I think I in particular have miscalled the pace at which we would turn our own performance, and where we underestimated that was we\u2019re expanding our sales force by 40% to 50% and that\u2019s been a little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I\u2019m confident in the business, I\u2019m confident in the management, I\u2019m confident in the direction we\u2019re headed. I clearly wasn\u2019t right about the timing. So I\u2019m not worrying about it from the standpoint of boy, this business is really broken or hurt - it\u2019s not, so I have a lot of confidence about that.","As far as growth goes, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a high double digit grower, but it\u2019s a double digit grower, and I think in med devices and in some of these markets as they become established, to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think is pretty healthy. So we\u2019re not losing any confidence in these segments or the potential in the segment or the growth in the segment. I\u2019d put the growth sort of in that double digit range - that\u2019s what we would expect, and it\u2019s not 50% but it\u2019s not 5% either. Our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be, so I\u2019d say if you want to know if the market\u2019s slowing, it\u2019s not 50, but slow is a relative thing. I\u2019d take any double digit market, and I think this is a healthy market.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you, and congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Miles, a couple product related questions, starting with rhythm management and heart failure. U.S. rhythm management was a little soft. Was that market related or Abbott specific? I understand you made some management changes there. How quickly can you turn that around?","Secondly on heart failure, that was obviously very strong. Could you talk about the sustainability of that? Thank you, and I have one follow-up. ","Miles White","Thank you. I could talk about that, but I\u2019m going to hand it to Robert to talk about.","Robert Ford","Yes, so in our electro-physiology business, Larry, we definitely had a lower growth rate in the U.S. of about 6%, when international grew 20%. That\u2019s not a market thing; it\u2019s more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch. We\u2019re launching our new ablation catheter, TactiCath SC in the U.S., which we\u2019ve already launched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product in getting ready for the new product, so we expect that to get back to the double digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side.","On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously focus for us. We\u2019ve shown some recovery in the international market, and I think the team there has done a good job at execution but we\u2019re not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It\u2019s an important business for us and we\u2019ve got to do better. What we\u2019ve seen internationally is where we\u2019ve deployed a dedicated EP and CRM team, the business does better. It does better in CRM and, quite frankly, it does better in EP. As you saw, we recently made some organizational changes her to sharpen our focus and create a more, I\u2019d say, standalone vertical business unit in CRM. We think that\u2019s going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S., and we\u2019ve got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely, our next-gen ICD and our two leadless programs, and this structure will ensure they get the focus that they need. ","In heart failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26% and that was the impact of, I\u2019d say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I\u2019d say a pretty strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. We expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, let\u2019s say, traditional Abbott accounts but even in our competitor accounts, that\u2019s doing very nicely also. We think heart failure has got strong potential also through the year with cardio manage, which is a little bit smaller product here, but it also continues to do very well.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s very helpful. Just lastly for me, Miles, as you pay down more debt, we\u2019re starting to get more questions on capital allocation. Can you please provide us with your latest thoughts, especially as it relates to M&A, when can we expect to see a pick-up in M&A? Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles White","You\u2019re welcome. Well, a couple things. First of all, I think the company has done a great job of paying down debt, cash management, cash generation, etc. It\u2019s been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. When we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We\u2019ve paid down more than 10 of that, so--and almost 8.5 of it just last year, another half a billion in the first quarter of this year. ","Our debt--you know, everybody watches net debt to EBITDA ratios. We\u2019re down to about 2x right now from what was, I think about 4.3 when we completed the second of the two acquisitions. That\u2019s a pretty rapid pay down. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end, so I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously we want to keep paying down the debt. We\u2019ve got nice strong cash flow, we\u2019ve got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%, and we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS, and I think right now we\u2019re at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so we\u2019ll probably be adjusting that at some point.","But there is good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know, and our share repurchases, we haven\u2019t done a lot of share repurchasing. We\u2019ve done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with Libre capacity expansion, and again while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow.","So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility, we have strong cash flow, we have choice. I think the question is whether or not at any point there\u2019s something out there that fits us or we\u2019re particularly interested in or that we\u2019re focused on, etc., and as you know, I\u2019ve told you in the past even if I had that, I wouldn\u2019t tell you - that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that\u2019s getting 95% of our attention. We\u2019re not not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities, but I have to tell you right now, I don\u2019t see a very robust target-rich environment out there. It\u2019s not target-rich, I don\u2019t think it is anyway, and I don\u2019t see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we\u2019re trying to do. ","Obviously as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we\u2019re going to have a lot of it, and I think we\u2019re going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years, I think we\u2019re going to generate a lot of profit, and we obviously either want to invest that or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. If it means there\u2019s opportunities in M&A, as you know, historically we\u2019ve always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn\u2019t forecast it when or what, but we are out of the range where we\u2019re constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained, and I think that\u2019s a positive. We\u2019ve gotten there pretty quickly, and that means that we can consider whatever. ","We don\u2019t happen to be focused on M&A right now, but M&A isn\u2019t a steady every year thing. It\u2019s opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned. If something like that comes along, I\u2019d say we\u2019re well positioned, we\u2019d be ready to do something, but to be honest, we haven\u2019t seen something that attractive.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for the comprehensive answer. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, congrats on a nice start to the year, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe I\u2019ll start one on the guidance, and I have a follow-up. On the guidance, Miles, MitraClip approval came in earlier. I know on the last call, you said you\u2019re not expecting any inflection in MitraClip, but it looks like there might be some contribution in the back half, and I think FX assumptions changed modestly - it\u2019s slightly better. We had a 1Q beat, nutrition coming in better. I\u2019m just curious on the guidance not being tweaked or changed. I know it\u2019s not your style, but I\u2019m just curious on [indiscernible] for the year.","Miles White","Vijay, thanks for the question. You kind of answered it at the end of your question there, when you said it\u2019s not my style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter because I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn\u2019t I put it in the original plan three months ago or six months ago. I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the midyear because at various points in time--well, there\u2019s been a number of times, we\u2019ve all been burned by exchange around April-May-June or something for the remainder of the year. I don\u2019t actually expect that this year. ","I\u2019m no forecaster of exchange and we\u2019re not currency traders, as you know, but just based on what we all see--you know, all industries, all companies, all multinationals and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. You know, oil is almost $70 and I don\u2019t think Brexit is weighing on a lot of minds. It\u2019s weighing on a lot of European minds, it\u2019s weighing on a lot of U.K. minds, and it depends on how much business you\u2019ve got tied up in the U.K.; but companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them.","So I\u2019d say the reason that we didn\u2019t look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don\u2019t raise in the first quarter. We\u2019re obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any--gosh, I feel like I should knock on wood, I\u2019m not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business, and while some analysts have speculated that med tech or med devices is somehow slowing, I tell you, I don\u2019t see that. I don\u2019t think a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either; in fact if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines, and I think that\u2019s healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There\u2019s a lot of things that haven\u2019t changed, but we\u2019ve been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company. ","Could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I\u2019m a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until midyear to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever had such healthy pipelines so broadly across the line in the company, so I don\u2019t have any negatives. I\u2019m just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That\u2019s about as much as I can tell you. That\u2019s an honest answer.","Vijay Kumar","That\u2019s fair enough, Miles. Whatever it is, it\u2019s the macro, it\u2019s not the fundamentals. Related to that, I guess, the question we\u2019re getting a lot, and not maybe just specific to Abbott but the sector, is the sector--the fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing, is this sustainable? I think specific to Abbott, Libre, can Libre be a north of $5 billion product for you guys longer term? The reason I ask is sustainability, I think you guys gave some numbers on MitraClip in terms of TAM. Libre, I think you\u2019ve kind of left it open-ended, saying it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar product, and I\u2019m just curious whether the Libre 2 that was submitted to the FDA, is that the same product as the Libre 2 in Europe or was the algorithm changed for the U.S. submission? Thank you.","Robert Ford","Vijay, this is Robert. It\u2019s a similar product, it\u2019s just got a different label. ","Vijay Kumar","And on the TAM for Libre, can this be north of $5 billion for you guys longer term?","Robert Ford","Listen - we\u2019ve always thought of this as a--if you look at the amount of diabetic patients in the world where this technology tends to have a greater impact, it tends to have a greater impact with insulin users, right, whether you\u2019re a Type 1 or a Type 2 on a conventional injection therapy, and there are 40 million of them around the world, 20 million of them in emerging markets and the other half in developed markets. We think this is, as we said, a multi-billion dollar opportunity, whether it\u2019s two, three, four, five. You can look at these patient segments and patient numbers and it\u2019s very big. ","Miles White","Vijay, I\u2019d add a couple of things to that. We\u2019ve investing in capacity expansion accordingly, but there\u2019s sort of more to this story. As you know, there is a Libre 2 in Europe, there\u2019s a Libre 2 under review in the United States. There\u2019s a Libre 3 in development and has been in development for some time, and there is a lot of potential for expansion of this product to other analytes besides glucose or additional analytes to glucose for the diabetic. There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform, it is not just a glucose test kit, and so there is what I\u2019d call an R&D, development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway. Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We\u2019ve already got almost a million and a half users of Libre, and to be honest, we haven\u2019t exactly let the floodgates go, so I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already--.","Look, it\u2019s probably a billion and a half or more in sales, and it\u2019s growing at 80%, so it doesn\u2019t take very long to figure out the math of what you just asked. ","Vijay Kumar","Thank you, guys.","Scott Leinenweber","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks, appreciate you fitting me in. Miles, one follow-up on Bob\u2019s neural question. We\u2019ve seen new product launches drive momentum for a number of companies in that market over the past couple of years. You guys really haven\u2019t talked much about your pipeline there. Are there new products coming that could help turn that segment around, or is it really just a matter of letting the dust settle on this sales force expansion?","Miles White","Well I\u2019d tell you, it\u2019s kind of like--you know, when you\u2019ve got some issues with your own commercial execution and your sales force and you know you\u2019ve got to go fix them, it\u2019s kind of like ducking the question to go talk about your pipeline. My own thought has been, let\u2019s just address the sales force answer and not to try to dodge and weave here about our own execution, which we admit we can do better and we\u2019re going to do better.","Now having said that, is there a pipeline in development - Robert?","Robert Ford","Yes, so to that point, we also know that--our first and foremost priority is the field execution. We also know that innovation and evidence also have an impact on our ability to grow, so we\u2019ve doubled our R&D investment in this business since taking it over about two years ago, and I do expect to see two new systems in the pain area come to market towards the end of this year, beginning of next year, and I think that will have a positive impact, obviously ensuring that our sales force is getting up to speed and doing what it needs to do. ","Evidence is also another important driver here, so we do have trials that we\u2019re investing and working on for differentiated claims, whether it\u2019s pelvic pain or pre-back surgery kind of claims. So your point of yes, we are investing, we have to make sure we address the field force but we do have a pipeline here that we know we\u2019re going to need to be able to have a sustainable double-digit growth business.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. My last one, just structural heart, already a bright spot for the company today and feels like it has the potential to get even better. As the pipeline there matures, can you just go through your latest thinking on tendine [ph] in Europe, which we should be getting relatively close to here, and then also Portico in the U.S.? Thanks.","Robert Ford","Yes, so I think that\u2019s one bright area in the device portfolio. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments here. We talked a bit about TriClip, that we should see towards the end of this year. Tendine, to your point, we filed it last year for CE Mark, so we\u2019re also right now on target to see that come to market at the end of this year. We\u2019ve got a fourth generation MitraClip product that will be coming more towards the second half of this year also, so we\u2019re excited about that; and TAVER, we expect to see that in the U.S., Portico in the U.S. in the first half of next year.","Scott Leinenweber","Okay, well good.

Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President - Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks, and Brian and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2015. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.","Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly, any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that the second quarter financial results and guidance provided today on the call for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.52, above our guidance range and reflecting another quarter of double-digit underlying growth. Sales increased double digits operationally for the second consecutive quarter. Excluding the impact of the 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 6.5%, which, as expected, reflects an acceleration of our performance from the first quarter. We also exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter.","As you know, macroeconomic events continue to be a major theme in 2015. Looking back to the beginning of the year, most companies, including Abbott, were dealing with the challenge of setting 2015 guidance in the context of the strengthening U.S. dollar against almost every currency that occurred late in 2014. We set our growth target high with a forecast for double-digit EPS growth, excluding exchange, and 9% absolute growth.","Halfway through the year, foreign exchange is impacting results for Abbott at a somewhat higher level than we projected in January. At the same time, the fundamentals of the end markets in which we compete remain strong, and we've remained disciplined in managing our business in this environment. Strong performance has and will continue to help offset currency headwinds as we're well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year. With that context in mind, our full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged, which again reflects double-digit underlying growth.","I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning the call over to Brian and Scott. And let me start with Diagnostics, where we achieved very strong sales growth of 9% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Lab and Point of Care Diagnostics. We continue to capture share and win new Core Laboratory accounts with our customer-focused solutions, including the immunoassay business of the two largest commercial labs in China during the first half of the year.","In Point of Care Diagnostics, we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth. We continue to enhance our product offering and expand our presence in targeted international geographies, including Europe, where we recently launched our wireless i-STAT handheld device; and in the Middle East, Japan and Latin America, where we achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. In the U.S., sales performance was driven by continued adoption of our i-STAT system in large hospitals and remote care settings.","In Nutrition, sales increased 4%, slightly below our expectations. In China, we achieved double-digit growth and share expansion with the new Pediatric products we launched last year. At the same time, recent market softness in Hong Kong and Vietnam impacted our overall international Pediatric growth rate in the quarter. The international Adult Nutrition business delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, including double-digit growth in Latin America, as we continue to build and shape the Adult Nutrition category globally.","In Medical Devices, our Diabetes Care business delivered 5% growth in the quarter, somewhat ahead of expectations, including international growth of 10%. Consumer response to our new FreeStyle Libre device continues to be very positive in Europe, and we're expanding capacity to meet this demand. We also made progress during the quarter to bring the Libre sensor-based technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, our professional use device.","Our Vascular business performed in line with expectations. Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth of our structural heart therapy, MitraClip, the first and only device available for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation. In Medical Optics, sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. We expect improved sales growth over the remainder of the year, driven by market uptake of several recent product launches that enhance our portfolio.","And in Established Pharmaceuticals, sales increased double digits, excluding the impact from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange. Improved operational execution and portfolio expansion are driving above-market sales growth in several geographies, including India, China and Colombia. We're seeing the benefit from the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals with a broader product portfolio in key therapeutic areas and expanded sales force driving double-digit underlying sales growth in Latin America.","So in summary, we achieved another quarter of double-digit sales growth, including a sequential improvement in our organic growth rate, as expected. We're particularly pleased with our performance in the branded generics business and another quarter of above-market growth in Diagnostics. We continue to make progress on margin expansion and reported second quarter earnings per share results ahead of our expectations. And despite a challenging currency environment, which you'll hear a lot of, I'm sure, during earnings season, we're well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015, reflecting the strong outlook we forecasted for EPS growth at the beginning of the year.","So I'll now turn the call over to Brian and Scott to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, and then be back for questions. Brian?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Miles. As Miles indicated, today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.52, above our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 10.8% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of around 8.5% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the latter part of the quarter. Reported sales increased somewhat above 2% in the quarter.","Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in our Diagnostics and branded generics businesses. Sales in emerging markets increased 21% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of 2014 acquisitions and foreign exchange, total company sales in the emerging markets increased 11%. Given recent investor interest in the Chinese economic situation, I'd note that our sales in China, which represents around 8% of our overall sales, increased strong double-digits in the quarter. The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.8% of sales, slightly ahead of our previous guidance due to continued underlying improvements in Diagnostics and Nutrition, and up 250 basis points over 2014. In the quarter, adjusted R&D investment was around 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was around 32% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015. As Miles indicated, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from continuing operations remains unchanged and continues to reflect strong double-digit underlying growth. Regarding our full-year 2015 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 7.5% on our full-year reported sales, more than our original full-year projection in January of around 6%. As previously indicated, the increase reflects strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus several currencies late in second quarter. This would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015. Scott will provide more detail on the 2015 outlook by businesses in a few minutes.","We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 58% for the full year, reflecting gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales, and now forecast adjusted SG&A expense approaching 32% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $80 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments.","Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2015, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.54, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange headwinds on operating results. We forecast operational sales growth in the low double digits in the third quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd expect a negative impact from exchange somewhat above 9% in the quarter, third quarter, resulting in reported sales growth in the low single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense approximately 31% of sales in the third quarter.","Finally, we project specified items of $0.21 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items, as we identified for the full year in our earnings release, with the exception of the gain on the sale of a portion of our Mylan shares, which occurred in the second quarter.","In summary, we achieved another quarter of strong performance and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year despite a challenging currency environment. With that, I will turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Scott?","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President - Investor Relations","Thanks, Brian. Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter sales performance and outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.","I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales increased 8.7% in the quarter, including above market growth in both developed and emerging markets. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, both U.S. and international sales increased 8.5%, including another quarter of double-digit growth in emerging markets, led by strong performance in China and Russia.","In Molecular Diagnostics, sales also increased 8.5%, driven by double-digit growth in our Core Business segment of infectious disease testing. Growth this quarter was somewhat above our expectations, primarily due to slower than planned scale down of our genetics business and timing of tender orders in emerging markets.","In Point of Care Diagnostics, sales increased 11.5% driven by continued adoption of our market-leading i-STAT platform. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our product offering, including the U.S. FDA approval of our Total \u03b2-hCG test, which detects pregnancy in early stages during critical emergency situations. For the third quarter, we expect global diagnostic sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis.","In Nutrition, worldwide sales increased 4% for both pediatric and adult nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, we continued to expand our product portfolio with the recent launch of the first certified organic infant formula offered by a large multinational company in China. In the U.S., we launched Similac Advance non-GMO, the first and only non-GMO labeled formula from a leading infant formula manufacturer.","In Adult Nutrition, sales growth was led by international performance. As expected, U.S. Adult Nutrition sales were impacted by competitive and market dynamics, primarily in the Institutional segment. We now expect global Nutrition sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis for the third quarter and full-year 2015.","In Medical Devices, sales in our Vascular business increased 3%, led by strong double-digit growth in MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation. During the quarter, we completed regulatory submissions for approval of Absorb in both the U.S. and Japan, and expect to submit in China in the coming months. Collectively, these markets represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market.","We also enhanced our Absorb product offering in Europe with the approval of Absorb GT1, a new advancement of the Absorb stent system that improves ease of use. For the third quarter, we expect global Vascular sales to increase low single digits on an operational basis.","In Diabetes Care, sales increased 5%, somewhat ahead of expectations, led by strong international performance. In the U.S., we launched FreeStyle Precision Neo during the second quarter. This easy-to-use meter provides consumers with an affordable, well-known brand in the over-the-counter segment of the market. For the third quarter, we forecast low single-digit operational sales growth in our global Diabetes Care business.","In Medical Optics, sales were up 1%, somewhat below our expectations due to market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. Earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval and launch of our iDesign System, which creates a 3-D map of the eye that is 25 times more precise than traditional systems, and offers the potential for more people to qualify for our LASIK procedure. We now expect global Medical Optics business to grow low single digits for both the third quarter and full year 2015.","And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased double digits in quarter with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. EPD continues to make meaningful progress in becoming a more consumer-facing business with an increased focus on branding initiatives, marketing to the pharmacy channel and building the Abbott brand in key countries. For the third quarter, we expect similar double-digit growth in EPD.","In summary, we achieved another quarter of strong growth, achieved several new product launches across our businesses, and are well-positioned to deliver high single digit operational sales growth for the full-year 2015. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Actually, I have a bunch of questions, I'll try and be brief, though. So, Miles...","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let's do it as one great big run-on question, Mike.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. That's usually the way it works. Miles, I think everybody would love to hear your thoughts on China. Obviously, there was some concern about how your China performance would look coming into the quarter, given Mead Johnson's report, comments from other multinationals about China overall, so we'd love to get your comments there.","And then maybe a second item, you guys disclosed that you'd filed Absorb in the U.S., the initial PMA. Can you disclose at this point whether ABSORB III hit its primary endpoint, and anything else you can share on it? Thanks.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, let me comment on China first. A lot of times, you don't know how you're really doing until you see reports of your own competitors to give you context about what others are experiencing in a market. I'd say, overall, we're pretty pleased with China. We're gaining share.","The launch of our new products is moving us along quite nicely. I think several of us have experienced this cross-border issue in Hong Kong, some more than others apparently, and that certainly impacted us a little bit as well, but we feel pretty good about China. I mean, it's only about 10% of our total Nutrition sales and about 8% of the total company. So if there's a hiccup in China, it doesn't tend to have a big impact on Abbott as a whole.","That said, it's an important market. This is an important business there for us. I'd say the fundamentals of our business in China are great. We're growing double digit, a strong double digit, I should say. And new product launches, going fine. We're gaining share. I'm probably less pleased with the development pace of the adult business in China, which is a new category, but I'm usually dissatisfied with pace no matter what it is. So I'd say we feel pretty good about China.","I was surprised at the pre-announcement that we saw from one of our competitors, but actually gave me a little better feel that the issues cross-border from Hong Kong to Mainland China were impacting others as well, so we weren't the only people seeing some of that impact. So I guess that context helped.","On Absorb, I really don't have much to report. We have a series of improvements or incremental changes to our product over time here. This is one of the first. So beyond that, I don't think I can comment on your question. Maybe Brian or somebody else can but...","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","At this point, we don't have any further information to report on the details of the trial, Mike. We file and then ultimately, timing will dictate whether this goes to Japan or not ultimately as we move through 2016.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would tell you, Mike, as long as you asked about Absorb, I was pleased to see that the Vascular business sequentially here, while it's not booming double digits, is still improving quarter-to-quarter. And even though these are low single digit numbers for Vascular, that's an improvement over what we've seen, say, the last year and a half, 18 months or whatever. So I'm pretty happy about that. I like the direction we're headed here and frankly, I like the direction we're headed with the breadth of the business, the next-generation products in the business across the board, and not just in the stent business, but other aspects of the whole Vascular franchise.","Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Miles, just one follow-up. Can you just share with us your updated thoughts on M&A and use of your balance sheet? Any changes since our call a month ago?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, I tried to be studiously evasive then and I probably will try to be that now. So in some respects, no change other than increasingly, as time is passing here, our focus is sharpening on where our interests lie. And I'm pretty pleased with, well, the portfolio of opportunity. But as I explained before, it depends on alignment with other companies and so forth and their interests.","So I think that while I've said in the past, sometimes there's not much out there that one can justify from a valuation standpoint or a fit, I'd have to say today, while valuations are high, I think there's a fairly robust set of opportunities that fit several of our businesses quite nicely and our strategies and intentions quite nicely. So I'm not sitting here on a pile of cash thinking there's nothing out there of interests that fits us. Quite the contrary. I think there's quite a lot out there that fits us well.","So I don't really want to directionally comment more than that, because I generally don't like to telegraph where our interests lie for obvious reasons. But I'd say I like what I see, I particularly \u2013 I have to say, you're probably dying to ask me this as a follow-on as well \u2013 I really like that Mylan investment right now as a place to park our cash while we're looking at the opportunities we're interested in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess with respect to that Mylan investment right now, since you talked about it, I guess what are the terms that you have to vote along with management or abstain from the vote just in terms of monetizing that and maximizing the value? You said that was more of a short-term investment, that you didn't have intentions on being a long-term owner in Mylan. So I guess how should we think about the still being a holder in Mylan stock or someone else's stock?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say that nothing's changed. I mean we don't have an intention long term of being shareholders in Mylan. On the other hand, I suppose you could say, well, what's long term? And until we actually have to monetize that investment, I'd put it this way. Cash on most people's balance sheets today earns pretty close to zero. And that said, I think this is a pretty good place to have our cash parked, because I think that Mylan, as a company, is pursuing a strategy that I would endorse. I have a little bit of insight, given our continued dealings with our partners at Mylan. And I like the strategy that Mylan's pursuing and I support it and endorse it as a shareholder.","So from that perspective, I think that this is right now, as long as we are a shareholder, we're going to vote in our interest and Mylan's interest, because as shareholders, it certainly directly impacts Abbott. And I think what they're pursuing with their Perrigo acquisition is something we clearly endorse. We've said so. We have the right to vote our shares on that particular issue as we like. And that's an independent decision by us. It's not one that the Mylan board or management controls. That's our decision. And we made that clear several weeks ago that we support what they're doing there.","Obviously, Teva has other desires for Mylan, but my own assessment of that is a shareholder of Mylan is that's not likely to happen. And I think as Mylan's shareholders or Teva's or others' review in more detail the Mylan situation in the Netherlands in particular, and the rules around foreign acquisitions, whether in the Netherlands or in Ireland or other places, I think that their investors are gradually figuring out what the degrees of freedom are that anybody particularly has. And in our case, we know that pretty well as the largest shareholder of Mylan, we know it pretty well.","So I'd say, we put our interest where our best interests lie and that's to support Mylan's current strategy and current pursuit of Perrigo. And we get to vote that ourselves, so \u2013 independently, and I think it's important for, not only our shareholders, but the other Mylan shareholders to know that since we're the largest one, and we get to make that decision.","With regard to certain votes, Mylan would control the vote if they were pursued. So if a company like Teva pursues Mylan, Mylan controls the vote of those shares as long we have more than 5% of Mylan. But frankly, we're pretty aligned on that. I mean we haven't disagreed with Mylan on this at all at any point in time.","So I think we're not just a passive ride-along here. There's our interests here, there's Mylan's interests here and we're voting our interests and our own shareholders' interest, and I think it's a good place for the proceeds from that transaction to be for now. And as I said, we don't intend to be long term, but in the interim here, while we don't need access to those resources, we certainly want those resources invested the best possible way for us and our investors. And I like what I see there and I endorse what they're doing.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the strength of the results that we've seen for the first half, I guess why not tighten the range, from a guidance perspective, for the second half of the year? For the full year?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, we could have. I suppose we could have tightened the range. The \u2013 I think there's enough volatility in the currency markets that I'd say, it would \u2013 my concern was, it would imply a degree of forecast-ability and precision that I'm not sure anybody really has. And there's a pretty strong possibility that we will beat this original guidance. But I'm a superstitious guy and I think the minute we try to be more precise than where we already are, Murphy is going to reach up and strike us.","And I think that there's always some unpredictable event that happens. I can't predict what those events are. We're having another strong year in spite of a very strong headwind of exchange. I think the impact on us from currency this quarter is probably as great as anything I've seen. It's everything that everybody wrung their hands about back in December and January, as companies struggled to give guidance, and we wrung our hands too.","But the fact is we set a double digit target every year and a real double digit target, and we did again this year. And so we set a high bar at the beginning of the year and we're exceeding that high bar thus far. But I have to say that given the volatility of certain geographies of the world and\/or currencies, I thought I'd just go one more quarter. And by the time we actually change this guidance, you're going to say, we told you so, and you'll already know that we're likely to exceed for the year. I probably could have tweaked the lower end, which would have said, gee, I'm confident. You know I am confident. I wouldn't forecast to you anything that I know of today as a downside to this business, other than what we all see as ongoing currency translation.","You watch CNBC or other things and people say, do you only invest in American stocks and don't invest in companies overseas? All you got to do is look at our underlying growth rates and you can see that investing where we are, in emerging markets and other places, is paying off. And it's very strong growth for us. It's very profitable growth for us. And I've said before, if you want to be where the growth is, you got to be able to navigate the volatility, and that's what we're doing. We're navigating the volatility. We're delivering steady, reliable, double digit earnings, net of exchange, in spite of how strong the exchange is. And I think that's what we're supposed to do.","And I have to say, wouldn't have expected it to be tested quite so severely by this kind of currency challenge, but we're meeting and beating that. And given that we set a high bar early, I guess my judgment was I'm not ready to move that exchange yet or the guidance yet because I think it is pretty unusual that the currency is as volatile as it is. So that's one great way of wringing my hands in front of you and saying, you're probably right, but you get to be right at the end of the third quarter.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No problem. Thanks. Good quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wanted just to follow up on the capital deployment side and ask one financial question. Miles, maybe you could just talk a little bit about your use of cash strategy more broadly. I mean, if I look over the past, call it, four quarters to eight quarters, you've had a big increase in the dividend that occurred in late 2013. You've been buying back stock fairly consistently and you've now announced some M&A, but nothing significant. Can you maybe just sort of help us understand your broader capital allocation strategy and how we should think about the mix of use of cash?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, yeah, and I think it's been pretty clear. I mean, it's a great problem to have. Gee, we have a lot of cash and a lot of cash flow and I think (31:49) the businesses are strong and they generate great cash flow. We're able to fund our plant and equipment needs. We've built a number of plants around the world in the last couple of years. We're expanding capacity. We're doing all the things you'd do to support the ongoing growth of the business from an internal standpoint and yet, we generate a lot of cash.","And in some regards, you'd say there's a lot of different things you could do with that cash. We know that part of the identity of the company is a dividend, and so we are attentive to an appropriate dividend payout in a range of a percentage of EPS somewhere between 40% or 45% of EPS. And we tend to maintain that steady range because there's a lot of investors out there who rely on us for steady passive income that way in their portfolio. So that's one use of cash and frankly, we don't have any difficulty funding that. So I think that's an important aspect of the identity that's Abbott.","M&A activity is opportunistic to a degree, as you know, and it can be funded by your cash flow or it can be funded by debt as well. We watch our debt ratio carefully. We watch our debt rating. We watch all those things. But I have a say, right now, while we've got what I think is a fairly attractive menu of opportunities for us from an M&A standpoint, you just haven't seen us act on it.","Now, I would also tell you, over the last 10 years, you've seen us act on a lot of things, and we don't tend to forecast it until it's already happened. And so I'd say you probably should not assume that we're just sitting on our hands accumulating. I think investors expect us to deploy cash, and we do, and we will. I mean, that's one of the things \u2013 I'd have to say, leaving our cash in Mylan right now is good place for it to be if we haven't got something else to do with it. I'm not a big fan of borrowing to buy back shares. I think that's artificial and short term. Although I know there are many activists who might advocate such, I think we can deploy our capital to earn a healthy return, but it doesn't mean you can do it on a rolling quarterly basis. It depends on when the M&A activity is available or when the opportunity arises.","So we're all about building and growing the company, and investing the capital in things that earn at an attractive rate for our investors. And if we have capital beyond that, which we always seem to do, we do buy back shares. I think we should \u2013 we do have a philosophy of returning cash to our investors at least at some level to keep our stock and share count from being diluted, et cetera. I chuckle a little bit because some investors or analysts out there condemn the practice of buying back shares, while other investors want you to return cash to them or capital to them as part of the return, and it's interesting to listen to these two diametrically opposed points of view. It's almost like everybody wants to be chronically unhappy.","I think it's a great problem to have great cash flow and a lot of cash. We can fund the dividend. We can fund the share buyback. The question is how big in any given point in time. And frankly, we're able to fund a fair amount of M&A. And M&A that is strategically a good fit with the company and a good return above and beyond certainly what we can earn with cash, but what we can earn in a lot of things. So we tend to look at it in all those ways.","Right now, I'd say it's in our interest to obviously support our dividend, maintain a certain level of share buyback, which we do each year on a steady basis and husband our resources for what we believe are some great opportunities in M&A. We try to keep that balance in the right balance. We do pay attention to the returns we're earning for our shareholders. And frankly, we track what our shareholders think about that capital deployment or redeployment so that frankly, we're reflecting what they're looking for as an investment.","So I don't know if that specifically answered your question, but I'd say right now, the level of share buyback that we've typically done is not threatened in any way. I would not go out and do some big leveraged share buyback. Frankly, if I was going to go seek leverage, it would be to acquire additions to the company, which I think would make a lot of sense.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Yes. That is very helpful, actually. And then on the financial side, if I look at your guidance for the full year, it looks like your targeting about a 19.5% operating margin. But as I kind of look at the comp set of the individual businesses in which you compete, that would suggest that there are several hundred basis points still of margin expansion left in the business. I guess, A, would you agree with that assessment? And, B, if so, is there a reasonable case to be made for consistent, call it, 100 basis points or so a year of operating margin expansion?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think in the foreseeable future, I'd say that's the case. It's an interesting thing, we've done very well in the margin expansion, particularly in Nutrition and Diagnostics. And in fact, in Diagnostics I think there's more opportunity. But I wouldn't drop all of it through to the bottom line. I'd like to be investing even more in R&D and Diagnostics and some in SG&A. I think all of our businesses would take more sales and marketing investments in a heartbeat.","Every business always thinks it's tight and it always thinks it has more things to spend money on. But the reason they call it discretionary spending is because it's discretionary. And I think to the extent that we keep improving the margins, part of that is good for the shareholder and part of it is good for discretionary spending, depending on the worth of the investment, whether it's R&D or sales and marketing expansion.","So I agree with you. I think there's more opportunity. I think the Nutrition business has shown a tremendous capabilities to improve its gross margins. Now to be fair, we've had the benefit of low commodity prices, and at some point, that's going to end, and we'll see it change. But we have the benefit of low commodity prices. That's clearly reflected in our margins in the Nutrition business. I think the Diagnostics business has just made great strides in what it's done from a gross margin standpoint.","There are days when I look at the margins in these business and say but for exchange, or but for price pressure in given markets, there's not a lot of robust price upside out there in a lot of these businesses, and yet, even in the face of exchange and\/or pricing, depending on where you are in the world, the margins keep improving, which I think is a great credit to the management team in these businesses. So long way around, I agree with you. I think there's still consistent opportunity to keep improving margins. And like every other CEO of a multinational, I'm waiting for the day that the U.S. dollar weakens.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Miles, just one question, one quick follow-up on some prior questions. Just coming back to China, you have less exposure to many of the factors that your competitor obviously described for their China weakness, and you're actually seeing strength in China. But Nutritional growth did come down modestly for the remainder of the year. So where specifically is that pressure coming from if it's not a lot of China?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've got some challenges in Vietnam and some other places as well. The market in Vietnam has slowed, I'd say, kind of suddenly and a lot. And I don't think we're losing any share in Vietnam, but we've certainly seen it slow. And from time to time, we see the impact of government price pressures and so forth. But do I expect that to be a sustained situation in Vietnam? No, I don't. I can't always explain why any given market will suddenly take a breather, but they seem to. And in this particular case, Vietnam and Hong Kong both are impacting these numbers to a degree.","Last year, Saudi Arabia impacted our numbers to a degree. And in a lot of cases, I think we get so used to watching China that we discount the impact that other countries may have on our performance. And the truth is we're pretty large in Vietnam. We're the biggest nutrition company in Vietnam by far, it's a big market for us. Same with Saudi Arabia. There are some of these markets that, because China gets so much attention, we tend to think are rounding error and they're not rounding error, they're important. And they're big markets for us.","So when we see some impact in the marketplaces in some of these other countries, it does affect the collective numbers overall. Because as I mentioned earlier, China's only about 8% of the whole company, and that's all businesses, including Pharma and Devices, Diagnostics, et cetera. Our second biggest business in China is Diagnostics. And so China's important to the company across the board, but it's only 8% of all our sales and in the Nutrition business, it's only 10%.","Our competitors sometimes are much more highly indexed in China relative to other countries. And I say that and the Danones, and the Meads and the Nestl\u00e9s, they're in all the same countries we are, but the degree to which they are dependent on China versus other countries varies. And in our case, while China's a very big business in Nutrition relative to the total of all the business in Nutrition and in Abbott, it's not as big. So some of these \u2013 the long story short, some of these lesser, smaller markets or countries also impact the look of sales. So what you're seeing here I think is more Vietnam and Hong Kong than fundamental Mainland China.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And then, Miles, you talked to extensively today about (41:48) the Mylan-Perrigo situation. Just a small nuance, was there a benefit to Abbott shareholders in expressing earlier support for Mylan-Perrigo than perhaps you needed to or are people just making too much at that particular point?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think a lot of people are making a little too much of it. But I think that first of all, the rules in the Netherlands are a lot more complex than what a lot of investors understood, and certainly, about Mylan's domicile there. And therefore, what \u2013 there's been a fair amount of press more lately around the so-called structure of ownership in the Netherlands, the Stichting, and all these other things. And I think if one assesses the clear path to completion of Mylan's interest in Perrigo versus Teva's interest in Mylan, there's a pretty clear difference. And I don't think investors completely appreciate that because I don't think they know the underlying hurdles or rules, et cetera.","And so I think that, I think, a lot of investors could have misunderstood or misperceived a choice that doesn't actually exist, my view, one investor. And so I wanted to make it clear where the largest investor in Mylan stood because I think that will influence other investors to take a closer look at the facts of what is the clear path to completion here in terms of the \u2013 what are thought to be alternatives that I don't think are. And to the extent that, that influence other investors to take a closer look, I think that's in Abbott's best interest as Mylan's largest shareholder rather than continuing to debate back-and-forth, an alternative that I don't think truly is. End of comment.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Very clear, very important commentary. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Miles, I'm a little surprised just here, in the middle of the year, we haven't seen a lot \u2013 or any M&A from you. And I'm not sure if you're paying attention to Congress, but there's a chance that attached to the highway bill, there may be a tax holiday toward the backend of this year. So given the fact that a lot of your cash sits outside the United States, I'm just wondering, is that what's holding back any M&A? Are you potentially waiting for this potential tax holiday? And if there is one, would that accelerate the pace of M&A? Thank you.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Yeah. The image that comes to mind is Charlie Brown holding a football for Lucy. Do I think Congress is actually going to do anything with tax policy before the end of the year? I give you a resounding no. So I would tell you, not for one minute would I hold back our M&A interest based on thinking that Congress is actually going to do something in some comprehensive and constructive fashion here about tax policy in the United States. I hate to be that definitive about it. You can probably tell what I think, but no, I \u2013 that has no impact whatsoever. And I'd say the things that have impacted us here up to now has mostly been us completing all the things that we needed to complete, which we've done. We think we're in good shape on all our transitional things.","And it's more just our own pursuits and decision-making that is driving our M&A portfolio. I mean, we've got a lot of opportunities, I think, to support our branded generic pharma business, and we've got a lot of opportunities in the device space. And that's where a lot of our interest is right now. We'll make a lot of progress there. It will become more apparent by the end of the third quarter, I feel confident. Apparent doesn't mean there's some great blockbuster coming here. Those things tend to take time, and I don't know that I can predict time right now. But I'd say, look, we're \u2013 I already said \u2013 normally, I've been on this call and said there's not that much out there. Frankly, there's a lot. And \u2013 but it's all very highly valued and nothing's easy in the deal world, and I think you know that, even though there's a lot of activity these days, in fact, a lot more activity than we've seen in a long time over the last 18 months. So I'm not sitting here holding back for anything. I think we're moving along as best we can.","I think the one thing that holds anybody back is the fear of overpaying or paying too much, and \u2013 or making a poor deal. And I think we've always tried to be disciplined about our deals. I always find that we're criticized for paying too much until a couple of years later, when everybody says, hey, great buy. We try to make intelligent deals. I don't think you can ever expect not to pay full value for something, but we're always careful about what we think we can do with a given business and whether we can add value to it and so forth. And trying to find that sweet spot where everybody's happy is sometimes a little slower than we might like.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. I'm not going to ask you about your view on the med tech tax. So I'll just ask quickly, in the past, you've said that the fact that your cash sits outside the U.S., or most of it's outside the U.S., it would not hold you back from doing M&A in the United States. Does that still hold true?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That still holds true.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first is there's certainly been a lot of conversation of you getting bigger, and I understand that, but are you also contemplating further pruning of the business, meaning product lines that may not fit as well, or visibility and the returns may not be there? Is that part of the strategy going forward?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is not.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just a specific question, and following up on an earlier one on the Nutrition softness outside of China, I think you mentioned price in Vietnam, and I'm guessing Hong Kong as well. Is this is a dynamic that you'll be facing for the next three quarters until it laps? Or are there other factors there that would allow you to turn this geography around a little earlier?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I don't actually expect a long, sustained downturn we've got to lap here, et cetera. Brian is dying to say something. Let me let him comment.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No, I just wanted to add...","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Brian was just there, by the way. So he really wants to tell you about it.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So in Vietnam, we are gaining share. Remember, we are recovering. So all things are pointing the right way there. This is truly a market issue. So I think this is within our destiny to control. The good news, too, I think with Nutrition is when you look even beyond that area, we're growing double digits in key Latin American markets as well. So a little bit different dynamics and circumstances than maybe what we heard from others last week. So I feel good about where we're at.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's hard to generalize because it \u2013 and we just had my staff meeting earlier this week, and we look at every geography. We look at our share position. We look at our competitors. And I have to tell you, every one of these countries has got a different mix of competitors. And different companies are strong in different countries. So it's hard to just generalize with one brush across them all. Vietnam, as I said before, it's been an important market for us. It is an important market for us, it will be. I don't anticipate some long-term difficulty here. But it clearly impacted this quarter.","Jayson T. Bedford - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President - Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Hey, let me start, one product; question one, strategic question. So international diabetes growth accelerated nicely this quarter, I think you had 10% operational growth outside the U.S. Libre, the feedback is all, frankly, phenomenal that we've heard, but you're capacity constrained, I believe? So \u2013 and you filed Libre Pro in the U.S. So, Miles, can you just kind of give us an update on Libre? How big do you think that product can be for you in 2015, 2016? When do you think you'll be \u2013 won't be supply constrained? And when are we going to see the key European and U.S. studies that you have ongoing? And I have one follow-up after that. Thanks.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll tell you, we think we've got a real winner of a product here, but we are capacity constrained, and that's our own problem. We obviously didn't build enough capacity for what we anticipated. We expect that to start easing in the mid to late fall. We'll have considerably more capacity online at that point, and we continue to invest in capacity because I \u2013 we believe in the impact of this product and the response from diabetics and consumers is, frankly, terrific. We intentionally slowed down our marketing because there's no point in creating greater difficulty in terms of demand for a while until we can fix that capacity issue, and we're getting close to that point now where we can go back to a more aggressive marketing of the product. But in the meantime, we're just waiting for that capacity to come online. Brian, did you catch the rest of those questions?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, it was with respect to Libre Pro, with respect to the launch that we had in the U.S. \u2013 or pending launch after the (51:52) approval, submission.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The submission, yeah.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","So yeah, Larry, recall, we just got this approved in India. I mean, this is a great opportunity for us to go after the doctors and the patients in a different way. We did file and submit in the U.S., and typical timeline I'd say here is approximately a year. But again, this is probably a modest segment, but it's still an important one for the professional segment that we're targeting. But I'd say, overall, between this strategy, as well as what we have internationally with Libre, and even our approach to the market here in the U.S. with some of our offerings, is really balanced and really helping us, as you see here, return to growth for the Diabetes Care business. I mean, to be performing in the mid-single digits is where we expected to be, and so I think everything's on track.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think I could forecast for you how big it's going to be. I don't know. I just don't know. What I do know is anything I'd tell you would be wrong. So I think it'll be a significant product. I think after, say, 6 months to 12 months of unfettered availability, we'll know pretty well, but I'd like to hit that capacity or the capacity release point where we've got plenty of manufacturing capacity and we're unconstrained, and then we'll get a better sense of that.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. And then on a strategic note, when one looks at the \u2013 at Abbott's Vascular business, it doesn't have the breadth right now as its two main competitors. And cardiovascular device is one of the therapeutic areas where we have seen contracting across product categories, so what are the strategic implications of those factors for Abbott's Vascular business? At some point, does that business, Miles, need more breadth within the cardiovascular device space? Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and I think, I \u2013 yeah, I do think it needs more breadth, but I also think it needs pretty solid performance in the pieces it has. I think we can do better on the stent front than we're doing, and I think we can do better in the endovascular space than we're doing. Structural heart, for us, really, right now, is a product, but we think there's a lot more breadth there that we should be participating in. And then I think beyond that in the device space, whether it's Vascular or not, there's a lot more breadth. We created a different structure in our organization where we'll incubate ventures. Ventures can take on a lot of different sizes, and there's a lot of activity there right now. We have a clear focus on expanding and broadening the whole device business. It's actually going really well. We're just not in a position to tell you much about it yet, and it ranges from equity investments to outright ownership or assembly of businesses there. And we announced early in this quarter, the second quarter, that we were making a change there to not just be a venture funder, but actually builder of business. And it's surprising to me how much opportunity kind of exploded in that space for us. So yeah, we're going to broaden it, well underway, a lot of opportunities, agree with your point, and we're on it.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President - Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions, and that concludes Abbott's conference call.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brian Yoor","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2013. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are disclosed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. Ongoing earnings per share were $0.42, which is at the high end of our guidance range, and sales increased 3.5% operationally led by a strong performance in our nutrition and diagnostics businesses. We are confirming our full year 2013 ongoing earnings per share outlook which is for double-digit growth at the mid-point of the range.","We are delivering on our current growth expectations despite a mixed global economy, developed markets globally continue to be challenged by 2012 austerity measures and weak economic conditions and that impacted our results this quarter as we saw sales decline low single digits before exchange in these markets. We planned for that and expect to see some improvement in the second half of the year. And while most developed market currencies were relatively stable, the Yen weakened significantly representative of the efforts by some governments to stimulate weak economies.","At the same time emerging markets continue to be a significant opportunity for us, one where the demand for healthcare and nutrition is going rapidly and where Abbott is well positioned to benefit from the favorable trends that are taking place in these markets. This quarter more than 40% of our total sales were in emerging markets, in the first quarter we saw particularly strong growth in China, India, Russia and Vietnam, with sales in 8 key emerging markets up 18% before exchange.","As we accelerate growth across these countries, we expect to expand our emerging market sales more than 50% of Abbott's total sales over the next several years. Before Tom and Brian discuss our results in detail, I will briefly comment on our strategic priority as they relate to first quarter performance.","As I just discussed, driving above market growth across emerging markets is a key priority. Our sales across all of the emerging markets were $2.2 billion in the first quarter, increasing 15% with strong results across our major businesses including, nutrition, core diagnostics and vascular devices. In nutrition, emerging market sales represent 45% of total nutrition sales and increased more than 20%. We have broad global reach today with our pediatric and adult brands and we prioritize the group of key markets to deliver on our future growth targets. This includes multiple countries where we are expanding our current leadership positions such as the Vietnam, where we are shaping new markets such as India, and where we are aggressively expanding our geographic reach such as China.","By 2015 we expect to more than double our presence in China, which is the largest and fastest growing nutritional market in the world. We are executing well against that goal through the first quarter of this year. We are also making progress with the expansion of global capacity to support the continued strong global demand for pediatric and adult nutrition. Our three new facilities in China, India and the U.S. are expected to come online later this year or early next year.","In established pharmaceuticals, we have prioritized 14 emerging markets where the demand for healthcare is rapidly expanding and where we are building our presence to drive above market growth. Sales at these key emerging markets represent approximately 50% of EPD's sales, and this quarter increased nearly 9% led by growth in Russia, India and China. We anticipate our key emerging markets to deliver double-digit growth for the full year as we continue to build out our local product portfolios and expand in-country in these markets.","In medical devices, vascular devices delivered 20% emerging market growth while medical optics and diabetes care delivered mid-teens growth. Medical devices growth was driven by continued strong performance of our TECNIS brand of cataract intraocular lenses and our market leading vascular leading technology. In our diabetes care business, our emerging markets strength was driven by share gains in several key market including China. In diagnostics, more than 70% of our sales occur outside the United States with a growing portion in emerging markets. In core laboratory diagnostics, these markets represent nearly 40% of sales and we continue to outpace market growth in our priority markets, again China, Brazil and Russia.","We have seen continued strong demand in the core laboratory for our industry-leading systems including ARCHITECT. In China this business again grew nearly 40%. Our second priority is to continue to drive share gains and market expansion through new product launches and brand enhancements. In nutrition this quarter we completed 19 new product launches globally, on track for approximately 70 by year-end. This includes the first international market launches of our new Similac next generation formula and a continued global roll-out of our infant formula tolerance line. These innovations contributed to our 21% growth rate in international pediatric nutrition.","In the U.S. we have launched a new line of ZonePerfect bars as well as innovations across our Similac brand, to maintain our leading infant formula share position in the hospital and retail segments. In established pharmaceuticals we completed more than 45 new product launches across 16 geographies. This included new formulations in core brands that broaden our key therapeutic portfolios in gastroenterology and neurology. In medical devices, we continued the roll out of absorb in international markets and in January initiated our absorb U.S. pivotal trial.","Also in January in the U.S. we launched our new drug-eluting stent system, XIENCE Xpedition, and are on track for a mid-year approval in Japan. MitraClip, our structural heart device for mitral regurgitation increased double-digits internationally. In medical optics, we launched the new cataract intraocular lens in Japan which now give us access to 70% of the market where we were not previously competing. We also expect to launch our TECNIS Toric IOL in the U.S. shortly.","In diabetes care we are on track to initiate our pivotal trial by year-end for our next generation sensor that we expect to first bring to the European market by the end of 2014. And in diagnostics we continue to broaden our ARCHITECT menu with several new tests. We also launched our next generation automation solution that improves efficiency and work flow and increased testing volumes. Development work continued on six new system platforms across core laboratory point of care and molecular that are expected to launch over the next several years. These new systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed, scalability and shorter turnaround time.","The third priority I\u2019ll highlight is margin expansion. Our operating margin in the first quarter was in line with our expectation and we remain on track to deliver approximately 100 basis points of expansion for the full year. While we\u2019re focused on margin improvement across our businesses, nutrition and diagnostics are driving much of the improvement this year.","Nutrition operating margin increased significantly over the first quarter 2012 on track to improve at least 300 basis points for the full year. We\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver on our target of 20% of sales by 2015 as we implemented a number of planned actions last year and expect to continue our progress in 2013.","In diagnostics operating margin also improved over the prior year as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives in manufacturing supply chain. We\u2019re on track to reach our 2015 operating margin target in this business as well which is to exceed 20% of sales.","So in summary, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and as we continue to execute on our key business priorities we expect to deliver on our double digit ongoing EPS growth target for the full year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom to review our first quarter results and the 2013 outlook in more detail. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Thanks Miles. Before we review our financial performance, I\u2019d like to mention that yesterday we furnished an 8-K detailing the 2012 quarterly income statement for New Abbott on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations. With that in mind our review of results for the first quarter of 2013 and our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2013 will reflect comparisons with 2012 ongoing baseline in the 8-K.","So for the first quarter of 2013, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $0.42 at the upper end of our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter were in line with previous guidance, with operational growth of 3.5% and 1.8% growth on a reported basis, which includes an unfavorable impact of 1.7% from foreign exchange. Sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of products and businesses, most notably nutrition and diagnostics, along with strong growth across all of our business in emerging markets which grew 15% on an operational basis in the quarter.","First quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.8%, somewhat above our forecast due in part to the timing of exchange effect on this ratio. In the quarter, ongoing R&D investments was around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense was around 32.5% of sales, both in line with expectations.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2013, today we\u2019re confirming our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04 which reflects double digit growth over 2012 at the midpoint of the range. Regarding sales, for the full year 2013 we continue to forecast operational growth, that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange in the mid to high single digits with a somewhat higher forecast for nutrition offset by somewhat lower expectations for vascular. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1% on our full year reported sales. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.","We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55% consistent with guidance previously provided. We also continue to forecast ongoing R&D of 6% to 7% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year of 2013. Overall we continue to project expansion of our full year adjusted operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013, consistent with previous guidance. We continue to forecast net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013, non-operating income of approximately $20 million and around $50 million of expense in the exchange gain loss line of P&L. Finally, we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of around 21% for the full year 2013 consistent with guidance previously provided.","Turning to the outlook for the second quarter of 2013. We\u2019re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.43 to $0.45. Our operational sales growth in the second quarter is expected to be in the mid-single digits. At current exchange rates we would expect roughly 1% negative impact from exchange and sales in the second quarter. So that at these exchange rates we forecast reported sales growth approaching mid-single digits. We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio at around 54.5% of sales in the second quarter, which includes a negative impact from exchange of nearly 1%. We also forecast ongoing R&D at around 6.5% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of somewhat under 32% of sales for the second quarter.","So in summary, we are off to a good start in 2013 delivering at the upper end of our ongoing EPS expectations and confirming our 2013 ongoing earnings per share guidance. This outlook again reflects strong performance as we continue to build Abbott to deliver reliable top tier performance in the years ahead. With that let's turn to Brian for the operating highlights by business.","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Tom. This morning I will provide an overview of the first quarter 2013 performance for each of our business and we will also review our second quarter 2013 sales outlook by business. My comments will focus primarily on operational sales growth which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Let's start with our nutrition business, where global sales increased 9% in the first quarter on an operational basis driven by 15% growth internationally. International pediatric sales grew 21% operationally, driven by uptake of new innovations in Similac formula, continued strong double-digit growth of PediaSure, and above market growth in the emerging markets as we continue our geographic expansion.","Adult nutrition sales increased 6% led by continued strong growth of Ensure and Glucerna. As the global leader in adult nutrition, we continue to shape this market as the world's population ages. In the U.S., first quarter nutrition sales increased 2.1% in line with our expectations. U.S. pediatric sales were driven by continued strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand, partially offset by a slight decline of infant formula sales. While we continue to have a leading share position in the U.S., we experienced some unfavorable year-over-year impact due to lower (inaudible) volume.","First quarter U.S. adult sales were driven by share and category growth of our market leading Ensure brand, somewhat offset by lower than expected retail category growth. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect our global nutrition business to growth high single digits on an operational basis. Again, led by strong international sales growth as we continue with our portfolio of innovations and geographic expansion to drive share gains in emerging markets.","Moving on to diagnostics. In core laboratory diagnostics, operational sales increased nearly 6% in the first quarter. About 80% of our core laboratory diagnostics sales are generated outside the U.S. where we saw nearly 9% operational growth in the quarter. As Miles mentioned, we also saw a strong emerging market sales growth led by China and Russia which grew 40% and 35% respectively. We delivered on several new product approvals in the quarter, expanding our ARCHITECT platform menu by launching six new tests and launching our next generation automation solution designed to help laboratories improve efficiencies and workflow.","We will continue to broaden our menu throughout this year and continue to invest in the development of our next generation platforms. In molecular diagnostics, worldwide sales increased nearly 2% on an operational basis in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. Led by strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by market conditions in Europe. In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased more than 17% on an operational basis as we continue to expand our leadership positions in the United States.","For the second quarter we are forecasting our global diagnostics business segment to generate mid to high single-digit operational sales growth with continued strong growth from core lab and point of care diagnostics and accelerated growth in molecular diagnostics. I will now review our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD. Sales in the quarter increased just over 1% on an operational basis, consistent with our previous guidance. In EPD, we are focused on 14 key emerging markets which include, India, Russia, China, Brazil, and ten additional key markets. These markets comprise nearly 50% of EPDs sales and grew approximately 9% in the quarter. As previously discussed, we expect the emerging markets to comprise an even larger portion of EPDs sales over time.","As expected, growth in other markets, which includes developed markets such as Western Europe and Japan and other emerging markets was negatively impacted by European austerity measures and the Japan NHI pricing actions taken in 2012. We expect to accelerate operational sales growth in EPD over the course of the year as the impact of austerity and pricing actions subside and as we execute on a number of product and geographic expansion initiatives. With respect to the second quarter, we expect low single digit operational sales growth from our established pharmaceuticals business.","And finally, Medical Devices, which includes our vascular, diabetes care and vision care businesses. In our vascular business, worldwide sales decreased 6% on an operational basis, including the expected non-commercial revenue decline related to the Promus agreement, as well as the negative impact of Japan 2012 NHI pricing actions. Excluding Promus, sales declined 2.5% on an operational basis.","International sales, which comprise more than 60% of total vascular sales increased 4% operationally. Sales in the emerging markets represent 25% of vascular sales and grew 20% in the quarter. Recent international launches of our XIENCE Xpedition drug eluting stent and bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB, coupled with contributions from MitraClip and strong growth in the emerging markets are the key drivers of our international performance. Last month at the American College of Cardiology meeting, we announced positive long-term results from the ABSORB trial indicating that our bioresorbable vascular scaffold provided unique benefits not possible with metallic stents. These benefits include increases in vessel over time, reduction in plaque and improved vessel function.","U.S vascular sales in the quarter declined 19% driven by the expected decline of certain royalty revenues and soft market conditions, including price. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2013, we expect our global vascular business to be relatively flat on an operational basis. We expect to improve our performance over the course of this year with the continued uptake of XIENCE Xpedition in the U.S, the expected launch of XIENCE Xpedition in Japan, continued emerging markets execution and continued penetration of our new products MitraClip and ABSORB.","In diabetes care, global sales in the first quarter were relatively flat on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Outside the U.S, growth of 3% was driven by share gains in key emerging markets which grew double digits in the quarter, as well as the continuing uptake of our freestyle InsuLinx meter. In the U.S, we saw continued share gains in the hospital and retail segments, offset by marketing pricing pressures and lower Medicare mail order purchases.","Moving to the second quarter in our diabetes care business, we project sales to be relatively flat on an operational basis. As we have previously discussed, while we are forecasting strong growth in key emerging markets, the 2013 implementation of CMS or the competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact our U.S sales this year.","In vision care, global operational sales increased approximately 2% in the first quarter. Cataract sales, which represent about 60% of our global vision care sales, continued to outpace the market in the quarter, led by above market growth of our TECNIS brand of intraocular lenses. We expect continued strong growth in our cataract business, with several important launches this year. This include our recent launch of TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan which provides Abbott access to the largest segment of the Japan market and the expected upcoming U.S launch of our TECNIS Toric IOL. We also saw continued strong performance of cataract business in emerging markets, with more than 30% growth in the quarter. For the second quarter in our global vision care business, we expect low single digit operational sales growth.","So in summary, our results were in line with our expectations and we remain on track to meet our full year forecast. We delivered strong performance in both nutrition and diagnostics this quarter, while also executing on a number of new product launches and geographic expansion. And we expect accelerated growth as the year progresses.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co","Good morning. Can you hear me okay? If I think about the company, I thought by the way you guys, I thought did an excellent job in laying it out in the press release, which is -- you had a lot different details than you have had before. You have got 40% of the company in emerging markets, it's growing 15% this quarter. You (inaudible) in developed markets that was down like 3% this quarter. If we think about the acceleration in this whole company over the balance of this year, is the developed market piece gets better, if you think about it in aggregate, or is it the emerging market piece? I think I know the answer but I just want you to flush that out a little bit.","Miles White","Well, it's a little bit of both. I would tell you that a little bit of improvement in developed market goes a long way but the emerging markets for us are showing pretty strong growth, and I would say even a bad day in an emerging market looks a lot better than a developed market right now. So when we look at some of these emerging markets and even at the very strong growth rates we see there, they are a little slower than what we may have historically seen in last couple of years. So I think it kind of depends. Unfortunately, they are not all binary and separated, they are linked. They are somewhat interdependent. And I would say we are seeing the roll through, right now in the developed markets of the actions, austerity actions that have been taken obviously in the last year to 15 months. And I think that\u2019s going to be with us for a while.","I know the senior management at Johnson & Johnson commented a little bit on that yesterday, and I though their comments were quite eloquent about that and quite correct, that it's going to take a while for this to roll through and for businesses or companies to lap the actions we have seen in the developed markets. But a little bit of improvement there as I said goes a long way. At the same time, the emerging markets are still very robust and strong comparatively speaking and frankly even in the absolute. So you know I think all of us, we look at our various businesses, it's really as you point out a two-part story. Developed markets, emerging markets, and they are pretty different. And so the tactics or the things that we put in place in any of those markets are different. We are expanding as rapidly as we can where the growth is. And we are finding better ways to be efficient and compete more effectively and frankly compete for share in the developed markets.","So at the end of the day, while we have given guidance that we expect to be mid to high-single digits depending on how long sort of the economic conditions persist, will be towards the mid. And if it begins to improve, we will start to move the other way.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co","Okay. Let's take EPD because I think that\u2019s the probably the business where there is probably the biggest range of these on the growth profile of that business. And if you would look at it this quarter and then what you are expecting over the balance of the year, you have got your emerging markets piece, which is posting good growth. Not double-digits, but pretty close. And then you have got your rest of Europe which has been declining, it has been a drag. So if EPD gets better over the balance of the year, is that because you are sure to lap some of those cuts that occurred in Europe last year, or is it because the emerging markets accelerate?","Miles White","Again, it's a little bit of both. We definitely get better as we lap some of last year. The developed market part of EPD in some ways has been more strongly hit than any other businesses, or that business in developed markets more strongly impacted because of just the direct impact of price cuts in Japan or Europe. And then of course you have got the Yen on top of it and we have got a pretty significant business in Japan there. So we have got a disproportionate index on the developed markets in EPD. So I think as we lap that it gets better. But at the same time, as you pointed out, the growth rate of the EPD in the emerging markets is about 9% and frankly I expect that to improve in the latter half of the year.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co","Okay. And then one last follow up for Tom. The gross margin commentary for the second quarter, you are expecting a step down from 1Q to 2Q despite having probably $200 million in incremental revenues. Is that just because of the first quarter was just higher than it normally would be because of FX hedges?","Tom Freyman","Yeah, we just had the timing of the flow-through of the exchange really just kind of -- it helped the first quarter a little bit and it will be a little bit of an offset in the second or the last three quarters of the year. I think the big -- the key message on gross margin is, as we look at the full year we are right on track with what we thought we would have as we talked about back in January. So it\u2019s really just a timing thing, Mike.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS Research","Just wondering if you\u2019d comment a little bit about maybe what\u2019s going on beneath the surface of SG&A. there\u2019s a lot of probably activity in emerging markets and maybe talk about some of the investments you\u2019re making there versus what you\u2019re doing in the developed markets to just facilitate the longer term growth verse.","Miles White","Rajeev, this is Miles. I think that\u2019s a pretty good summary right there. We\u2019re definitely expanding in growth markets around the world both in headcount and promotional spending and so forth to support that growth and we\u2019re doing that at a prudent rate. We\u2019re also tightly managing the sales and marketing expenses in markets where we\u2019re not going to get the return or aren\u2019t getting the return. I would also say a little bit of what\u2019s going on there and you\u2019ll probably see this play out over the remaining quarters of the year. We\u2019re putting an awful lot of emphasis on our G&A. it\u2019s not that we want spend less or invest less in our sales and marketing support of our businesses or investment businesses, but I do want to run the company at a very efficient level from a G&A standpoint.","And so we\u2019ve put a lot of emphasis on how we are performing in all of our call it overhead or support functions around the world. It doesn\u2019t matter what country you\u2019re in for that one or what business and we\u2019re looking at any duplication between our businesses and corporate and so on. Now that we\u2019ve got a little different configuration of the company without the proprietary pharma business, it gives us an opportunity to look pretty closely at a lot of our support spending in G&A. that\u2019s not something we can do in just a quarter, but over the coming quarters we\u2019ll definitely be putting some emphasis on that. And is it enough that you could see that play out in the SG&A? Yes. The question is driven more towards gee, are you too tight on SG&A? I\u2019d say no, we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re starving SG&A. I think not at all actually.","If we have the opportunity to invest more where we know we can get the return and grow, we\u2019re definitely doing that. There\u2019s a certain pace at which you can do that and a certain quality at which you can do that and we\u2019re mindful of that, but we want to make sure we put that investment into the growth of the businesses. And I say the same with R&D. you look at the profile of R&D this quarter and it looks like it might be slightly down. That\u2019s really a timing issue. We don\u2019t like to shift or reduce any kind of R&D spending at all provided it\u2019s productive.","So we like the notion of investing more in R&D and we like investing it well and we don\u2019t want to make our bottom line based on what we do with discretionary spending in SG&A or R&D. that bottom line needs to be driven by core performance at the gross margin level and that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting so much emphasis on the gross margin improvement in the businesses which is going quite well. That not only is good for the investor at the bottom line, but affords us more investment capability in R&D and SG&A. that\u2019s a long winded answer, but there you go.","Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS Research","That was very helpful. And I guess one quick follow up on the product side. Just wondering if you could talk about the ABSORB product in Europe and what your -- maybe a little bit more granular on what you\u2019re seeing there in terms of uptake and how you expect that to broaden out over the coming quarters. Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I\u2019d say the uptake is taking a little longer to ramp than we might like, but it is coming along pretty nicely. We\u2019re confident that this is going to be a workhorse stent for us over time and I think the initial trial and positioning of the stent has people trying it and you might even say in its initial launch it looks like it\u2019s going to a very high niche. On the other hand, that\u2019s the starting point, to get some experience with physicians and doctors. It\u2019s our intent to drive it into what I would call very common workhorse use. And the pace of that is steady. I think we\u2019re always going to be impatient and wanting to drive it faster. For a little while it was about having the range of sizes. We solved that in a number of our markets. So I expect that to continue to perform pretty well.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Miles, I\u2019d thought I\u2019d come back to one of the bigger growth drivers in nutrition and two specific points and maybe a follow up. There\u2019s been a lot of talk intra quarter about the Hong Kong ban. It\u2019s pressured some of the peers in the space. What is Abbott\u2019s positioning on the impact the Hong Kong ban would have, if any, on the business. And I guess the second follow would be, Ensure, I think a business that people are not focusing as much on, obviously, a launch in late last year. How you are thinking about ensuring the opportunity in China?","Miles White","Okay. You know what, I am going to let Brian or Tom answer your Hong Kong question because I think, frankly, the answer is, we are not having an impact. But we will give you more granularity on the impact we are not having.","Brian Yoor","Yeah, David, I think -- this is Brian. We had a great quarter as you could see in nutrition that was driven by strong growth in China. That dynamic is not our dynamic and I know you and I discussed this a little bit. We are not as over-indexed in Hong Kong as our competition. If you look across Hong Kong and China, our shares are relatively the same. So we don\u2019t see this dynamic impacting us but clearly there is an impact on the industry if they make restrictions of products that can cross the border there.","Miles White","I would say our growth rate in China is pretty robust and we are not seeing that impact. Frankly our growth rate in Hong Kong is pretty good too. And your second question was?","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","On Ensure, Miles. Is it too early to start thinking about how big the Ensure opportunity could be in China?","Miles White","Well, we are thinking about how big it might be. I am not sure I can quantify it for you but we think it's a fairly significant opportunity and we are investing to, frankly, drive and create that market. And I think there is -- how would I put it -- I think it should be a terrific opportunity for us. It's a market that I think demographically and from a culture and a usage standpoint is perfect for Ensure. We are currently, as you know, investing in capacity for our liquids in the United States. We will probably -- we will enter that market first with our powder versions of Ensure and then we will transition to liquid then we will add on to our plants or one of our plants in Asia to give us the capacity to manufacture in or near market for Ensure.","That\u2019s one where we are very confident of the opportunity. I think almost any projection we put together will be wrong but I know it will all be good. So that\u2019s when we look forward to running out as fast as we can, I would tell you. I think it's a big opportunity.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, it's very clear. Just really a quick follow up for Tom. Tom, if you think about the road map you laid out on the road show for nutrition margin expansion. Now that we are sort of three-four months post that, where do we sit now in terms of where we stand? Are we on plan, slightly ahead of plan, potentially behind? And then what are kind of the key guide posts in terms of either manufacturing capacity or cost reduction issues over the next several quarters we should be focused on?","Tom Freyman","Well, we are ahead of plan. When you look at the first quarter, when you see the Q come out, we got to see a really good operating margin for this business. I think you have to be a little careful with that and we really need to look at this on a full year basis because in the last three quarters we are planning some investments in the business and we are starting up the plants that Miles talked about. And so I wouldn\u2019t straight line the margin you see in the first quarter out for the full year, but as Miles indicated in his remarks, year-over-year for the full year we expect 300 basis points of improvement in the operating margin in this year alone. Which gets us very well on the track towards the target he talked about. So we are ahead of plan and that business is really clicking on all cylinders when it comes to the margin expansion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Just a follow-up I guess on MitraClip. Given that you guys have had the panel, what are your expectations just in terms of whether you are optimistic that the FDA will ultimately approve the product or whether we should just expect to see perhaps some of the other studies before granting full approval. And then if you could also update just on the performance and sales level in Europe too, that would be great?","Miles White","Okay. I guess, Kristen, the first thing I would say is, we are pleased we got a favorable indication from the panel that we recently held with the FDA. But I have found over time it's never good to speculate about what the FDA may or may not do or may or may not think. You know we are hopeful and we are working as constructively as we can with the agency regarding U.S. But I don\u2019t find it useful at all for us to speculate of put the FDA in a spot or whatever. You know we want them to work constructively with us and I think the best I can say is, we can't predict it and we are not in a position to really comment much further than that.","And then I guess with regard to Europe and the 30 countries that it\u2019s available in today, we\u2019re pretty pleased with the performance. It\u2019s been planted in 8,000 patients and we\u2019ve had good performance with it. It\u2019s growing quite nicely in the markets where we\u2019re marketing it and growing at a very nice healthy double digit rate. We\u2019d certainly like to bring it to the U.S for patients who are in the high risk and have no other option and we\u2019ll just see how that plays out.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","And then any high-level thoughts just on capital allocation, M&A strategy here, now that the spinoff is complete?","Miles White","Tom loves it when you ask about capital allocations. I\u2019ll let him take that.","Tom Freyman","Kristen, as we entered the year it\u2019s similar really to the way we view this even prior to separation. It\u2019s a balanced approach. We pay a healthy dividend. We believe in a growing dividend. We execute on share repurchase each year and we did some of that in the first quarter and plan to do that this year. There is some degree of cash buildup and some potential of moderating on the debt level. So it\u2019s a balanced approach and the cash flow of the company is good. We\u2019ve projected $4 billion this year. That gives us a lot of options and it\u2019s more the same as we progress through 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Let me start with the US. The international performance was very strong, but some of the US businesses came in a little weaker than we expected. Maybe if you could talk about whether there were fewer selling days in the quarter that might have had an impact. And the three businesses that would be helpful to get some color from you on are Vascular, Adult Nutritionals and Core Labs. And then I just had one follow-up. Thanks.","Brian Yoor","Larry, this is Brian. There were some impacts on the selling days. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve not stressed in the past calls, but it definitely impacted our nutritional business to where those sales would have been a little bit higher as well as the vascular side even to a little bit to an extent. You saw clearly the U.S I\u2019d probably start with where the pressures are on the vascular side that you\u2019re seeing. With there, we have seen some market pressures. We\u2019ve seen like nearly a 10% decline in this market primarily pricing related and we are down a little bit on a share year over year basis. However, we are gaining share sequentially if you look through the fourth quarter to the first quarter where our share has picked up about a couple of points. And again, Xpedition I would say is early in its launch in the U.S. and so as we discussed before, we expect some continued share gain in the U.S and for that business to pick up as we move throughout the year on vascular.","Miles White","Larry, I would add to that for you, I think if you compare just on share in that business versus a year ago, I think we\u2019re down about 2 points best as we can tell. On the other hand we\u2019re on an uptick because we launched Xpedition just after the first of the year. So I would expect that to pick up. Pressure in vascular, very heavily a market pressure and part of it is competitive and pricing in the market and part of it is just utilization. I would say one of the benefits we have here looking across all these businesses, because we have the diverse portfolio we do and we\u2019re in so many countries, we get the benefit of comparing the performances of different businesses across those different geographies. And I would tell you that as we look at the U.S, Japan, the European Union, Canada, et cetera, the developed markets and look across the various businesses, whether it\u2019s vascular or diagnostics or any of these businesses, it\u2019s pretty uniform, the growth rates and the market growth rates and frankly the business growth rates and pressures that we see.","You can see the pressure or the economic conditions in the retail markets for our nutrition business. You can see it in the hospital market. You can see it in frankly any segment of market, the pharma markets and so forth. They\u2019re all pretty similar and what we take from that, obviously we know how we\u2019re doing and we know how some of our competitors are doing and so forth. What we take from that there is an underlying call it economic malaise or weakens that\u2019s pretty consistent across the developed markets and it\u2019s not unique to the U.S. It\u2019s not unique to Europe. It manifests itself in some different ways depending on how the products are paid for or by whom. Whether it's patient payer or government payer or third party insurer payer or so forth. But overall, they are pretty similar. And the conditions are such that you have got that headwind in literally all of the developed markets. And one way or another we are seeing it in each of these businesses. Conversely, in the emerging markets, it's just the opposite. And they are almost uniformly all pretty robust. They are a little more volatile, little less predictable, you have got some currency swings here and there and so forth, which is why it's great to be in a pretty broad portfolio of emerging markets and not over-indexed in any one.","But the fact is, consistently across the board there are pretty healthy growth rates in those markets. And I would say that the unique distinctions among them pretty much blend out across them, whereas there is a lot more consistency across the weakness of the developed markets. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Just to answer your question on core lab, Larry. We outlined this in the earnings release but there was kind of a comp issue in the blood banking business and we had a really strong unusual order last year that was really non-recurring. So I would not trend out that first quarter and you should see better performance in the U.S. on core lab.","Miles White","Did we answer everything you asked there, Larry?","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","You did. Thank you. Let me just ask one follow-up of Tom. Thanks for providing the 2012 quarterly numbers. It's the first time to get to hear your perspective on those numbers. And just two things stood out to me. One is the gross margin came in at about 55%, that\u2019s what you are guiding to this year. And the tax rate was about 25% last year and you are guiding to 21% this year. So just curious on the gross margin. Why no improvement in 2013? And second, just wanted to understand, the tax rate, obviously a great improvement from 25% to 21%, but just a little bit of color on how you could then achieve 400 basis point improvement and maybe where it can go from here. Thanks.","Tom Freyman","Sure. Thanks, Larry. The gross margin is actually on an underlying basis improving across this business. We have about a 1% exchange headwind because of lag effect and hedges and the like, comparing '12 versus '13. And we said, we talked about this on the fourth quarter call that we would be flattish in gross margin but underlying is improving and it's just kind of tough year from an exchange comp perspective. So I think that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we have said before. Regarding the tax rate, there are a couple of things. When you look at the tax rate in this base line, clearly it's a carve-out or residual of a carve-out. You know we ran the whole company the way we ran it and we repatriated for the whole company and this is what shook out relative to the Abbott that we are now running.","So it's just -- that\u2019s one thing to keep in mind. And really the two things that are causing the improvement over that carve-out if you will, is the tax law changes that were enacted and as you know at the beginning of the year, for the whole of 2012 we were unable to recognize any benefits associated with that. And there were certain provisions of that that went beyond the R&D tax credit that were helpful to the company. And we are seeing a shift of income to a better, lower tax jurisdiction, shall we say. Which is kind of a mix effect on income which is helping us to run at the 21% rate this year.","So those are the reasons. And I guess, the other thing I would just note is, when you compare year-over-year progress in our growth, you know tax is helping it for sure but if you just call that aside and look at operating growth, we are still growing at that double-digit level, which is again the way we have built and what we hope to sustain the growth profile of this business. So that\u2019s the explanation on the tax rate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","I was hoping you could spend a little bit more time on the U.S. medical devices. Certainly we can appreciate some of the challenges in the coronary stent market as it relates to pricing and overall utilization. But I was hoping you could just expand upon it. Where do you think we are with respect to volumes? The PCI volumes have been down now for several years. I think was some perception that that was sort of cyclical, it's turning out to seem a little bit more secular. But how should we think about your vascular business going forward?","Brian Yoor","Yeah, David, this is Brian. I will start it off here and perhaps turn it over to Miles or Tom for more perspective. But we have seen on a year-over-year basis the PCIs, to your point, volume being down approximately 5%. And we are still continuing to see pricing pressures on a year-over-year basis almost as much as 7%. You write these things out with the other dynamics of the market. That was the 10% that I was talking about being down year over year. I\u2019d say sequentially we still are seeing some modest decline even sequentially in this price and PCI as well. If you look at some of the news that was out there and Miles mentioned it, there\u2019s a lot out there in terms of the healthcare space with some of the health management associations then reporting that there\u2019s certain utilizations that have just flattened off and we still continue to see that pressure. So for us in the U.S it really is going to be about the share momentum and gaining back as Miles mentioned with respect to the Xpedition launch.","Tom Freyman","But obviously it\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve been talking about throughout this call. It\u2019s really a tale of two markets. Developed world we\u2019re more challenged, but the emerging markets grew 20% in the quarter in this and we\u2019re seeing double digit PCI in a number of the Asian markets. So between this, MitraClip, ABSORB progress Xpedition launch and the like, there\u2019s a portfolio of growth drivers that we believe are going to help level off this business and start it back on the growth path globally.","Miles White","David, I think the other thing I\u2019d point out and I think Brian sort of covered it, first of all there are two dynamics going on here. One is BTI volume and one is the price. The quarter compares to a quarter a year ago. We also look at the most immediate past quarter, the fourth quarter in this case of 2012. So if you look at the current strength and current sequential trend, the difference you see versus a year ago has slowed considerably. So it\u2019s PCI growth down 5%. Now on a sequential basis quarter to quarter barely a percent down. So the rate at which it\u2019s declined would appear to be slowing, moderating, whatever, but it isn\u2019t recovering. That part is true.","It\u2019s not recovering and the same I could say for price. Price hasn\u2019t taken a lot of pressure over the last three, four, five months, but it certainly did versus a year ago. So we look at it both ways. What\u2019s the case versus year going and how they\u2019re trending right now. And I\u2019d say both of those factors at least its impact has flattened modestly, slightly down maybe, but pretty much flattened, but it isn\u2019t recovering. So it\u2019s a pretty, as you said, it wasn\u2019t temporary. It seems to be hanging in there.","I think for a lot of the hospital segments frankly and I think hospitals today are even more aware of fixed budgets if not declining budgets and they\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on utilization and or price procedures et cetera as they try to deal with hey, we\u2019ve only got so much to spend and we\u2019re trying to allocate it as best we can.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. And then maybe on the emerging markets piece, obviously another very strong quarter and you called out some of the highlights in key segments. What I was hoping you could just spend a couple seconds on is how you view the competitive dynamics stacking up across your biggest businesses and where -- is most of your growth coming from building new categories that didn't really previously exist in markets? Are you taking share? How do locals stack up? I know in China, for example, there are a decent cadre of local stent manufacturers, but your numbers continue to show quite a bit of strength. Maybe just help us frame out the competitive impact versus the new market development impact in those regions.","Miles White","I think first of all, it\u2019s very heavily new market, new growth and that\u2019s why those markets are growing. As their healthcare system expand, as the medical practices expand, as incomes expand and so forth, you actually see the evolution of two or three, sometimes four pricing tiers and segments. There\u2019s often a call it a high end niche. There\u2019s a midmarket. There\u2019s a lower tier and sometimes a very low tier. All of them are growing and you see a migration of that mid-tier to the upper tiers in some cases. In a lot of case the multinationals and or exporters that are not local manufacturers in those markets are in those upper tiers and trying to move down and the local manufacturers in the lower to mid-tier is trying to move up. We see that in almost every business we\u2019re in. but I would tell you in spite of the fact there\u2019s multiple competitors, whether local or multinational and pretty healthy competition amongst us all, we\u2019re all being driven by a heavy tailwind of growth in expansion and utilization in those markets as their healthcare system expands. So you can track in a lot of cases, and we were careful to look at this internally not to get too excited about our growth if we are not taking share. You know we want to be paying attention to whether or not we are winning in these markets and in the competition. It's wonderful to have the growth but at the same time we are mindful that your competitiveness is measured in your share as well.","So I would tell you that the emerging markets are very very much a tailwind of growth but at the same time we are all mindful of the competition.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then maybe lastly on EPD. I think one of the things that you had communicated on the fourth quarter conference call was some expectation for moderation of pressure in Europe throughout the course of the year, given some of the austerity measures that were in place last year perhaps sort of stabilizing. Any visibility on that at this point or is that something that we'd sort of have to wait and see how that plays out over the course of the year?","Miles White","Yeah, I am afraid it falls into the wait and see category. No, I am not seeing it yet. It's something we expect in the second half of the year. But no, we are not seeing it yet. I think what we are seeing right now is the flow-through of the measures in the past, as I said 12 months or 2012, there were a lot of pricing actions taken by governments and we are seeing that flow through the business now in the comps. And I would expect to see us lap some of that and see it moderate in the second half of the year but we haven\u2019t seen it yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Weiss from Stifel.","Rick Weiss - Stifel Nicolaus","I will start off on the diabetes side. You are clearly doing well in emerging markets, you have softer outlook I assume in part due to the new U.S. reimbursement, lower reimbursement, CMS reimbursement for diabetes test strips. Just if you could give us your perspective on some of the next drivers in diabetes. Is this sharp reduction in test strip reimbursement reflected in the numbers and maybe remind us of the Medicare and non-Medicare mix in the business in the U.S. business?","Miles White","Well, in the U.S., first of all, I would say it's one of those rare circumstances where you are glad your share is not real high in a particular segment. I really don\u2019t know if it sounds like some rationalization but we are not -- we don\u2019t have a real high Medicare share. And we have one of the lowest shares in mail order. So the CMS competitive bidding that has been put in place in the United States is going to have an impact on all manufacturers. But it's frankly, relatively speaking, less on us because we are not highly indexed there.","The business itself has segmented and focused on the high testing or frequenting testing insulin dependent user for quite some time. And that\u2019s a more robust segment where we have been steadily incrementally gaining some share, we have targeted our R&D efforts on next generation sensors and testing on those users that are looking for more than just a test strip and a test. So looking for a lot more information management, lot more user testing and so forth. So I would tell you that the product lines that we have in development in that business today which I think are very innovative and will have tremendous value for those patients, are steadily moving along.","I was just recently out in California meeting with the group for a day, and I am very pleased with what I see there. I think that we have targeted a segment of the market that is a lot less, say cost sensitive and much more performance sensitive around what they are testing and information gives them. And I am thinking that the business is certainly positioned in the right place going forward here over the coming years today, and it's a very tough competitive commodity like market for the type 2s and the less frequent testers and in the U.S. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Rick, I would just say that when we went through our planning process last fall, I mean it was very clear what was coming in competitive bidding in the business and our plan totally factored in pretty much what had played out in the bidding process. So we are well covered in our guidance for the evolution of the U.S. market here.","Rick Weiss - Stifel Nicolaus","Good. And on the EPD side. You have talked about launching new and different formulations of existing drugs and (inaudible) drugs in the portfolio in new additional geographies. Can you update us there and your progress there? What we should be looking for on those front?","Miles White","Yeah, as I mentioned in my remarks, there were 45 of them that came through in the first quarter. There have been hundreds of submissions made to the various regulatory bodies around the world and one of the things we\u2019re finding is that those regulatory bodies are capacity constrained in their ability to process registrations in a number of countries. So it\u2019s slower going than we might hope, but we\u2019re making progress and it\u2019s something that each of our local regulatory people is working through with the various regulatory bodies in each country. But we\u2019re making progress with it and as we do it\u2019s gradually expanding the product lines. One of the things we\u2019re trying to do is prioritize into those registrations that are higher volume, higher likely usage and so forth ahead of those that are less so to fill out our product launch. Trying to get the priority straight. That\u2019s not always easy to do with the regulatory body because their interests aren\u2019t necessarily the same as our interests. But we\u2019re making progress there.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","And just last, Miles, I hate to always ask you about acquisition plans. It's hard to resist, since I'm asked -- it's almost the first question I get asked every time I speak about Abbott. And just I guess your latest thoughts on strategy and focus. I get asked about your priorities, U.S or OUS, one business or another. And maybe talk about the pressure you feel or don't feel to move forward on that front. Thanks.","Miles White","I guess I\u2019d answer it a couple of different ways. I don\u2019t feel any particular pressure because I think there\u2019s a balance between the things you might like to do strategically or look at versus the pricing or the values in the market or whatever the case may be. We like to think, I\u2019m sure every business and competitor out there likes to think that we are prudent stewards of shareholder values and that we make prudent deals and so forth when we do. Our track record has been pretty good that way. But we\u2019re mindful of that and I think it depends. There have been some areas of the business that we\u2019ve wanted to expand obviously and I think I\u2019ve commented in the past. We\u2019re looking at quite a wide variety of potential things in the device businesses to expand our device footprint and platforms and so on. But it depends where and when they\u2019re ready and or we like what we see at the value we see, et cetera.","So I\u2019d say we\u2019re always active there. We were not so active last year because first of all I think a lot of things weren\u2019t ready and secondly we were pretty focused on all of the activity with regard to the separation. But having the separation activity behind us, we\u2019re able to turn our attention now to what some of those things may be, but it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re out on a buying spree either. I think we tend to be pretty selective. We always balance it versus the value of the business and what we can do with the business and the capacity of our businesses to absorb additional new things to do because whether it\u2019s big or small it takes a lot of effort to put it into your portfolio and drive it appropriately.","So I\u2019d say we\u2019re actively looking there. We\u2019re not trying to -- I\u2019d say in the device businesses and so forth, we\u2019re not U.S versus not U.S or overseas or whatever. I think as everyone in this market can tell, it\u2019s often faster to be in the markets in Europe than it is in the U.S these days and I think that\u2019s fairly apparent. But that doesn\u2019t mean you only buy ex-U.S businesses or look at licensing products ex-U.S. the U.S is still a very important market to us and it\u2019s one in which we have ambitions to keep growing in our device businesses. So there\u2019s no distinction geographically there at all. In our EPD business, that business is not in the U.S and it has no intention to be.","So any interest we have in properties there that might expand our geographic footprints would all be ex-U.S. and again, we follow that pretty regularly, but I have to say the valuations and things that we\u2019ve seen in a lot of cases haven\u2019t made sense to us. So we\u2019re careful about that. And then in nutrition I\u2019d say our nutrition business has some interest in some things. I would characterize them as relatively small and given the growth rate of the business, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need there. It would have to be a particular opportunity we thought had robust potential because with the way the business is performing you don\u2019t want to over distract it with an acquisition or integration when it\u2019s hitting on all cylinders like it is. So I\u2019m sure that kind of describes the waterfront there. I am intentionally not going to be specific with you about what we may be looking at. When we were doing our road shows last fall, I did get a lot of questions on it from investors and analysts. And I always get specific questions about specific businesses or specific segments, that I realize our investors have other investments in and they are trying to triangulate on interest. But there is nothing I have been asked about that we haven\u2019t been following or looking at closely or studying, or looking at in some fashion.","I think one of the things that makes any company successful in the M&A or licensing area is that you have done your homework and you have been doing it overtime, so that when you finally decide to make a move with something, you know you have had a lot of diligence and you know why you want to do it and so forth and you are ready. And I would tell you that that\u2019s always been our practice to kind of be on top of whatever portfolio of opportunities there might be for us.","Miles White","Okay. Elan, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","I just had a follow up on the use of cash. Tom, you highlighted the dividend as well as some debt pay down. But what about share buyback? Is that something of focus and how should we think about shares outstanding? And then I had one more follow-up on the use of cash.","Tom Freyman","Well, I did mention them when I gave my recap there. Share buyback has always been part of our mix of use of cash. We have bought a fair amount of shares in the first quarter and it's something we continue to look at as we progress through the year. So absolutely it's an important part of the mix for us, it's a good way to return cash to shareholders and obviously with the view we have about the long term of this company, it's a good investment for our shareholders. So, absolutely, it's part of the mix and we did execute on a fair amount of that in the first quarter.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Is there a target for shares outstanding by the end of the year?","Tom Freyman","I wouldn\u2019t say that. I mean sometimes that fluctuates with the stock price fluctuations and the impact on diluted shares. But what we have is the target for deploying cash into share buyback and we executed on a fair amount of that in the first part of the year here.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just as a follow up. I would assume that most of your cash is now sitting outside the U.S. So if that\u2019s correct, how does that impact, this is specifically for Miles, how does this impact your M&A thoughts. I would think more target would therefore be outside the U.S.","Miles White","Well, I don\u2019t necessarily target the businesses by -- or the interest strategically by where the cash is. You know we first look at the strategic fit of any given business of interest to us, with the businesses we are in or what we can do with it. And obviously we look at returns and all the obvious and important metrics that we ought to look at. And then depending on our access to cash or where that business maybe, we have that as a consideration. But I would tell you, we don\u2019t start with that as a constraint, we don\u2019t start with it as necessarily the determining factor of where we ought to be hunting or looking. And our interest outside the U.S. is because, frankly, that\u2019s where the growth is and it's an awful lot of growth and we want to feed that growth.","So to the extent that we can invest in that growth, we do. And therefore in some ways it's very convenient to have significant portions of cash outside the U.S. to support that growth. Now having said that, there are things that we also are interested in that are in the U.S. and device businesses in particular tend to be U.S. centric, at least as a point of resonance. And we don\u2019t feel like we are particularly constrained or unable to react to ones that we are interested in to acquire. We have found it possible to manage our cash and our returns appropriately. So while I would say it would be nice if the U.S. government continued its efforts with tax reform at some point which would find a path to allow companies economic repatriation that would certainly be in everybody's interest. But right now it's not determining where we focus our M&A activity.","Brian Yoor","Well, thank you, Elan and thanks to everyone for your questions. And that concludes Abbott's conference call.

Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions. ","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. ","Note that any sales or earnings per share guidance provided today on the call will continue to include the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business in our forecasts. Tom will discuss in more detail how we expect to report the results of this big business beginning with the third quarter.","In today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings new release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Brian. Good morning. This morning we reported second quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.54, above our guidance range and representing growth of 17%. As expected, sales increased 3% on an operational basis. This was a sequential improvement from the first quarter and we are on track to accelerate sales growth in the second half of the year. We are ahead of our expectations through the first half of this year and we are raising our full-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance to $2.19 to $2.29 from $2.16 to $2.26.","At the same time, we\u2019re actively shaping Abbott for durable, long-term growth. Part of our growth strategy is to build critical mass and leadership positions in key emerging geographies across our diverse portfolio. In diagnostics, we were early to establish our presence in the geographies of China, Russia and Brazil. In devices, we have significant opportunity in the cataract lens and diabetes markets given demographic trends, as well as in our vascular business with innovative devices such as Absorb. In established pharmaceuticals and nutrition where we already have large and growing businesses in emerging geographies, we\u2019ve taken a series of steps over the last few months to further shape these businesses for the long term.","As I discussed on our conference call on Monday in our branded generics pharmaceuticals business, the recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia, as well as the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan, accelerate our strategic intent to drive balanced and sustainable growth in emerging geographies. The net proceeds from the sales of Mylan\u2019s shares over time provide us with a number of choices and possibilities to pursue opportunities that continue to build Abbott for higher growth.","Following the close of these transactions, our established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics are driven by favorable demographics, including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out of pocket for high quality, trusted brands. Abbott will hold leading positions in many of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America. ","In nutrition, we\u2019re similarly building this business for sustainable growth by continuing to invest in our global infrastructure, including our supply chain. Last week, we announced a strategic alliance with Fonterra to develop a diary farm hub in China to invest locally in China\u2019s milk supply. Fonterra is the world\u2019s largest dairy cooperative and has been a supplier to Abbott for many years. This strategic alliance leverages Fonterra\u2019s expertise in dairy nutrition and farming and Abbott\u2019s continued commitment to business development in China to ultimately help meet the growing demand for high quality dairy ingredients in China. ","This strategic alliance is the latest in a series of investments we\u2019ve made to build our local presence and capabilities in China over the last decade, which includes our R&D center in Shanghai and the opening last month of our nutrition manufacturing plant in Jiaxing. A stronger footprint in country will allow us to be closer to our customers and work faster to create and customize new products for their needs. Our new plant is one of the most technologically advanced nutrition plants in the world and will manufacture high quality nutrition products for Chinese consumers, including a new infant formula brand that we\u2019re launching now, called Similac Chintea (ph). This new product launch is one of several in both our adult and pediatric nutrition businesses across numerous geographies this year. ","The transactions we\u2019ve announced over the last several weeks proactively build and shape Abbott in emerging geographies. At the same time, we\u2019re executing on the substantial organic growth opportunities across our company. I\u2019ll briefly review our second quarter results, and I\u2019ll start with nutrition where we anticipate returning to double-digit sales growth in the second half of this year as this business anniversaries or laps the sales disruption in international nutrition and launches new products. Our innovations bring advanced nutrition to meet the needs of our customers, drive share expansion, and grow the market. We\u2019ll open three new manufacturing facilities in total this year to support the strong global near and long-term demand for adult and pediatric nutrition. Two weeks following the launch of our China plant, we opened our new state-of-the-art aseptic liquid plant in Ohio and we expect to open our manufacturing operations in India in the second half of this year. ","In diagnostics, sales growth was driven by continued above-market performance in core laboratory diagnostics, including double-digit growth in the U.S. We\u2019re funding investments in growth and advancing multiple new system platforms across core laboratory, molecular, and point of care that will launch over the next few years.","In medical devices, we continued to launch differentiated new products to capture share. In vascular, we\u2019re continuing to see market adoption of our breakthrough structural heart technology, MitraClip, as well as our new peripheral stent, Supera. Both our structural heart and endovascular businesses increased double digits globally this quarter, and in our drug eluting portfolio we\u2019re driving increased penetration of Absorb in Europe and several key emerging geographies as we work to bring it to the U.S., Japan and China, which represent more than 50% of the world\u2019s coronary stent market. ","In diabetes care, performance was in line with our expectations and we\u2019re on track to receive CE Mark in the second half of this year for our next generation sensing technology, called Freestyle Libre. In vision care, above market growth of our cataract lens business drove another quarter of double-digit sales growth. We expect double-digit sales growth for the full year with continued positive momentum from new products.","In established pharma, as we anticipated, second quarter operational sales growth improved sequentially versus the first quarter. In key emerging markets, sales increased nearly 10% driven by double-digit growth in India, Brazil and China as a result of improved commercial execution and continued expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus. We expect continued momentum in EPD in the second half of this year with improved market growth in India and the benefit of additional plant capacity to meet sales demand for key products. ","So in summary, we\u2019re ahead of our expectations through the first half and we\u2019re raising our full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance. We delivered a sequential improvement in sales growth this quarter and continue to expect accelerating sales growth in the second half of this year, and we\u2019re actively shaping the company with the shareholder in mind as we build Abbott for long-term growth and healthy cash returns.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Freyman","Thanks Miles. Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.54, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 3% on an operational basis; that is, excluding an unfavorable impact of around 1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter. ","Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in diagnostics and vision care and improved growth in nutrition and established pharmaceuticals. Sales growth in emerging markets approached 8% on an operational basis in the quarter. Excluding the estimated impact from the previously reported sales disruption in our nutrition business last year, sales in emerging markets increased closer to 10% in the quarter. ","The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.3% of sales, ahead of our previous guidance due to continued underlying improvement in diagnostics and better vascular gross margin as a result of the resolution of an intellectual property matter that lowered product costs this quarter and will continue to benefit this business going forward. In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense was 30.5% of sales, in line with previous expectations. ","Before I review our financial outlook, I\u2019d like to explain how we expect to report the results of our developed markets branded generics business going forward. As you know, we announced on Monday an agreement to sell this business to Mylan; therefore, beginning in the third quarter of this year, the sales and earnings from this business are expected to be reported as discontinued operations in our income statement. However, guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2014 that we provide today will continue to include this business in our forecasts. For the third quarter call, we will reconcile the combined results on both a GAAP and adjusted basis to the guidance we\u2019re providing today.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014, today we\u2019re raising our ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.29, which reflects double-digit growth over 2013 at the midpoint of the range. We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our full year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.","We continue to forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% for the full year. We forecast ongoing R&D somewhat above 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales, supported by our continuing efforts to manage G&A expenses. Overall, we now project our full-year adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by approximately 100 basis points in 2014, above our previous guidance of 60 basis points of expansion.","Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2014 we\u2019re providing for the first time, we\u2019re forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61. We forecast both operational and reported sales growth in the mid-single digits, reflecting a neutral impact of foreign exchange on sales in the third quarter based on current exchange rates. We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% of sales in the third quarter. We also forecast ongoing R&D around 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of approximately 29% of sales in the third quarter.","I\u2019d note that in 2013, we experienced a below trend tax rate in the third quarter, while in 2014 we expect the ongoing tax rate to again be around 19%. We project specified items of $0.27 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. This forecast excludes specified items to be provided at a future date related to recently announced transactions.","So in summary, second quarter sales growth improved sequentially over the first quarter of 2014. We\u2019re on track with our expectations for accelerated growth in the second half of the year, and we\u2019re raising our full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thank you, Tom. This morning, I will review our second quarter 2014 performance and third quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I\u2019ll first discuss our nutrition business, where global sales increased 3% in the second quarter, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter and on track for second half acceleration as we anniversary the August 2013 sales disruption in our international pediatric nutrition business.","In our international pediatric nutrition business, we\u2019re on track to return to double-digit sales growth in the second half of this year as we continue to recapture share in the affected markets and launch new products across several new segments and geographies. This includes Similac Chintea, a new infant formula we are currently launching into China. It\u2019s the first product to be manufactured in our new China facility and is available in our innovative reclosable packaging. In addition, to further enhance our competitiveness and capture share in the Chinese infant formula market, Abbott launched a new infant formula, Elova (ph) in the second quarter and Similar Simple Pack late last year in the online segment of the market. ","Sales of international pediatric nutrition increased modestly in the second quarter, impacted by the unfavorable year-over-year comparison created by the previously reported 2013 sales disruption. The impact of this event continues to decline as we recapture share, and is estimated to have reduced international pediatric sales in the quarter by approximately $40 million or 7 percentage points. We also experienced some recent government-initiated pricing changes in Vietnam and Saudi Arabia, which we\u2019re managing. ","International adult sales increased 10% in the quarter driven by strong growth of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in the emerging markets. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of high single to double-digit sales growth in this business. Abbott continues to shape and grow its priority adult nutrition market as it launches several new products this year, including the recent launch of a new adult brand, Enevo, in Japan, our largest adult nutrition market outside the U.S. Enevo is a next generation follow-on product to our market leading Ensure brand. In the U.S., nutrition sales increased low single digits in the quarter driven by pediatric nutrition as Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market. ","As we move into the second half of the year, we expect global nutrition sales to return to double-digit growth on an operational basis as this business laps the international pediatric sales disruption and executes on its strategic priorities, including launching new products, opening a new manufacturing facility in India, and expanding its full-year operating margin.","In our diagnostics business, sales increased 5.5% in the quarter, including double-digit growth in emerging markets. Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased 7% as this business continues to deliver above-market performance in both developed and emerging markets. U.S. sales increased 11% as we continued to build momentum with our enterprise account commercial model to capture significant contract wins as customers select Abbott to increase their operational efficiencies. We\u2019re also broadening and differentiating our Architect Assay menu and launched a new diabetes test in the U.S. in April to address the growing prevalence of diabetes. International sales increased 6% in the quarter driven by continued growth in emerging markets. ","In molecular diagnostics, worldwide sales were impacted by the timing of tenders in our infectious disease business in several emerging markets. We expect improved growth in our molecular business going forward with a favorable impact from the timing of expected tender wins in the second half of this year.","In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 4%, representing a sequential improvement from the first quarter as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted European and emerging markets, and as the U.S. market continues to stabilize. For the third quarter in global diagnostics, we are forecasting mid to high single digit operational sales growth.","In medical devices, vascular sales increased low single digits in the quarter, in line with our expectations. International vascular sales increased 3.5% driven by double-digit sales growth of MitraClip and endovascular products, which includes our new peripheral stent, Supera, for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery, or SFA. In the second half of this year, we expect new products to continue to drive share expansion and sales growth, including Supera, MitraClip, and Absorb. ","At the same time, we continue to make good progress to bring Absorb to the U.S., China, and Japan markets over the next few years. Data presented at international medical meetings continues to reinforce strong clinical results for Absorb in a broad range of patients. In the second half of this year, we expect to present one-year results from our Absorb 2 clinical trial, which is the first randomized trial to compare Absorb to standard of care. ","As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales in our global vascular business to be relatively flat. While we expect to continue to show sequential improvement in our base business, we\u2019ll also experience a difficult comparison versus the prior year third quarter when we realize the final sales true-up related to a third party agreement.","In diabetes care, global sales in the second quarter decreased 10%, in line with our expectations. Outside of the United States, diabetes care is focused on driving continued growth and expects to receive European CE Mark for its new Freestyle Libre next generation sensing technology in the second half of this year. U.S. sales continue to be impacted by the carryover effect from implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients in July of last year. For the third year in our global diabetes business, we forecast some moderation in the sales decline and expect a mid to high single-digit decline on an operational basis. ","In vision care, we achieved 12% sales growth in the second quarter, which represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sales of our cataract products represent nearly 70% of our vision care business and increased strong double-digits, outpacing the growth of the global cataract market driven by market share gains of our recently launched products. These products include the Tecnis OptiBlu and the Tecnis OptiBlu preloaded lenses in Japan, and the Tecnis Toric lenses in the U.S. and Japan. In addition, the adoption of our new Catalys laser cataract system is exceeding our expectations due to strong customer interest in our technology.","During the second quarter, we received European CE Mark for Tecnis Symfony extended range vision intraocular lens. Tecnis Symfony is a premium lens that provides patients with continuous range of vision, including far, intermediate and near distances, but with reduced incidence of halo and glare. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect our global vision care business to continue to grow double digits on an operational basis.","Lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business, or EPB, where sales increased more than 2% in the quarter and also demonstrated a sequential improvement versus the first quarter. Sales in our key emerging markets segment increased nearly 10% driven by double-digit sales growth in India, Brazil and China. Improved market dynamics coupled with commercial execution in India, expansion of product portfolios in Brazil, and stronger growth in China, including the replenishment of a key women\u2019s health product, contributed to strong sales growth in the quarter. Sales in our developed and other market segments decreased 5% in the quarter, in line with our expectations.","In the second half of the year, we expect further improvement in the sales growth rates of EPB driven by improved market growth coupled with commercial execution in India, as well as the benefit from the recent plant capacity expansion to meet demand for certain key products, including those belonging to our women\u2019s health portfolio. For the third quarter of 2014, we continue to forecast sales growth in our established pharmaceuticals business in the low single digits on an operational basis.","So in summary, we\u2019ve had a pretty active second quarter, executing on several transactions to further shape Abbott for the long term, and we\u2019re ahead of expectations through the first half of the year, resulting in our raise today of our full-year ongoing EPS guidance. ","We will now open the call for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question today is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital.","Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Miles, I wanted to start with a question on nutritionals. It\u2019s good to see nutritionals getting back to positive growth. We tend to focus so much on pediatrics, but what caught me by surprise was the strength is adult, particularly outside the U.S., up 10%. So I\u2019m wondering if you can spend some time talking about adults \u2013 is that 10% growth sustainable, and how should we be thinking about that growth beyond this quarter, and what could be the key drivers? Thanks.","Miles White","Sure. You know, the direct answer to your question is yes, I think it is sustainable. I mean, it might go up a point, down a point \u2013 who knows? \u2013 from time to time, but the general direction at that magnitude I think is sustainable. You know, as you know, Glenn, we are the world leaders in that category in almost every country, and there\u2019s still enormous amounts of opportunity out there, given the demographics of the world not just in developed countries but also in emerging countries. There\u2019s a big opportunity for us, I think, in China in particular, and part of our expansion in China will address that over time. We\u2019ve got a big opportunity to enter that market, build that market, create it and do in China what we\u2019ve done in a lot of other countries around the world.","So I think there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity. There\u2019s always room for innovation, whether it be in the form\u2014you know, we have a product now, Clear, in the United States that\u2019s not a milk-based product that I think will be popular with consumers, and I think that given different flavors, different forms, different packages and so forth, I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to expand the market and grow the market where we\u2019ve already got pretty strong share. That\u2019s an important part of our business. And you\u2019re right \u2013 the pediatric segment tends to get a lot of the attention, but I think a lot of the growth and opportunity here remains in the adult segment.","Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital","And just as a follow-up, if I\u2019m looking at the operating margins for the nutritional business, about 20%, yet some of your peers are closer to 25%. Now that you\u2019re at 20%, is 25% the next goal?","Miles White","You know something? My management in that business will say if we reach 25, are we done? And I\u2019ll of course say no \u2013 30 would be the next goal, and if we reach 30, would 35 be the next goal. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ever going to be satisfied, but I\u2019d say this \u2013 we\u2019re not done, and we\u2019re not stopping. There\u2019s a lot of things that go into determining what the margin is in the business and in terms of our cost to deliver. A lot of the moves that we\u2019ve made in the last year with our supply chain globally, including some of the things that we\u2019ve done with Fonterra with other suppliers, are aimed at lowering our cost to deliver. Some of the products that we\u2019ve had manufactured by third parties, we\u2019ll bring in house and do ourselves. Part of our plant strategy here with not only our liquid plant in Ohio but our plant expansion in China and India is to do that. There is obviously large freight savings when you manufacture in key markets as opposed to ship from the U.S. or Europe or other locations.","So there\u2019s a number of things that go into the overall cost structure, and I\u2019d say there\u2019s still plenty of room to improve our margins in this business, and the team has been very focused on that. Some of them take a little longer than others to realize because of structural or infrastructure changes in our whole supply chain system, but I\u2019d say there is more room there.","Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Tom, I want to spend a minute just on the operating line. If I look at the first half of the year, most of the incremental growth is coming from your work on controlling operating spending. Even if I adjust for\u2014add back (indiscernible) down low single digits, and it looks like for the year the boost in the guidance is a function primarily of your operating spend coming in. So could you spend some time talking about where those reductions are coming from and how we should think about the trend, not just this year but going forward?","Thomas Freyman","We\u2019ve talked about this off and on over the last few quarters, Mike, and when we exited the separation, it was clear to the entire organization that our G&A levels in particular were higher than they should have been, and we\u2019ve been working very hard to address that through process improvements in the back office, basic efficiencies, only providing the appropriate services to the businesses. It\u2019s been kind of a steady progress we\u2019ve made on that \u2013 you know, every quarter we\u2019re able to change the trend of the run rate and just been steadily chipping away at that.","I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re done \u2013 we still have a few things we want to do. We\u2019re getting more efficient in the IT areas and some of the finance and accounting areas, and even\u2014especially in the purchasing area where we\u2019ve invested a lot of time and we think can drive savings as well. So it\u2019s a very broad-based approach, I\u2019d say a very steady approach; and to your point, it\u2019s really contributed to the flattening of the SG&A.","What we have not been doing is tuning back on productive SG&A \u2013 you know, things that really drive sales and growth. We\u2019ve tried very hard to sustain and even increase investment in those areas while we\u2019re tuning back in the other areas.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Okay. Can I just ask about one of the businesses that has struggled, and that\u2019s the diabetes business and the impact of competitive bidding. Can you spend a little bit more time on the strategy of that business? I think everybody is aware that you\u2019re working on coming out with this novel product in Europe later this year, but more broadly than that, what\u2019s the plan for the U.S. business going forward? It is to largely run that business as a meter business and run it for cash and try and just maximize profitability?","Miles White","Mike, this is Miles. I\u2019d say for a transition period, that\u2019s probably an accurate comment. I think that business has done a great job of managing its costs and its expenses and so forth. We still have a very healthy gross margin in the business, and so it\u2019s sort of tale of two businesses, and particularly in the U.S. I\u2019d say that because it remains profitable and cash generating, et cetera, you\u2019ve got this older legacy circumstance of strategy market channels, products, et cetera that clearly is under pressure from competitive bidding and what CMS has done. ","Then you\u2019ve got very new innovative products that, frankly, really matter and make a significant difference for patients, like Libre which is coming first in Europe. That, we believe, will be a significant growth driver for this business here over time, and it will come to the U.S. and it will be a global product, just like our core base business. So you\u2019ve got a transition here of the core base business as we grow the more innovative future product and future forms of that product, because while it\u2019s launching as a single product, there\u2019s actually a product line coming here. So I think that will continue to drive the business and have a very different proposition for the patient.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So first, Miles, I just wanted to ask about the nutritionals business. You made some commentary in your prepared remarks about the strategic alliance with Fonterra and also opening up the new manufacturing plant in China as well. I just wanted to see if you could provide just a little bit more color on how important these two initiatives are in returning pediatric nutritionals to a sustainable higher growth trajectory, and can you also talk a little bit more about the ongoing broader strategy in China? One of the questions was on the adult opportunity there too, but just hoping to get a little bit more color.","Miles White","Okay. First of all, I\u2019d say Fonterra has been a partner and a supplier of ours for a very long time, and it\u2019s no secret that a year ago they had a recall that impacted us, impacted other competitors as well, and nobody tried to have a recall, nobody tried to have a problem, but it set us back for a period in China, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, some other countries. Out of our discussions came a number of ideas for the companies going forward. You can spend your time arguing about something nobody wanted to happen, or you can look ahead and say, where are our opportunities? The fact is China is an opportunity for us, as is the global supply chain in general because as we look at the growth prospects of both the pediatric and adult business worldwide, as I said, China is not the only growth opportunity. There\u2019s a lot of countries out there where there is still a lot of opportunity for both companies. So we very constructively looked at what the companies could do together, and out of that came the notion of this dairy hub idea in China, which I think and they think will be very important for serving China. ","China is a big market and it\u2019s big for pediatric nutrition, and it\u2019s big for adult nutrition, I think. I mean, I think it will be \u2013 it\u2019s not well established at this point, but I believe it will be. One of the key points of this business is you\u2019re a lot more economically able to serve if you are in market or close to market and responding to the desires and the needs of local consumers. We have R&D in Singapore, we have R&D in Shanghai, we have manufacturing there. We are now going to vertically integrate and supply from there in addition to the supplies we take into China and other countries from New Zealand and other milk suppliers in Europe and other places. ","So overall, we\u2019re looking at this as a comprehensive global network of access to very high quality milk and where we process it and then how we tailor the product to given local markets. So I think while somebody won\u2019t pay a lot of attention to some of these steps with Fonterra or the plants that we\u2019ve put in place today, within a few years we\u2019ll look back and say, boy, that was really key to do that because now we\u2019re in a very strong position to immediately serve in those markets.","Now further, I would tell you \u2013 and this is speaking more globally, not just specific to China \u2013 having our manufacturing in countries helps us in effect self-hedge exchange as currency fluctuates in countries around the world. It\u2019s clearly a strong commitment to the country, which helps us from a regulatory standpoint, it helps us from a cost to serve and freight standpoint. There are a number of things that\u2014you know, countries expect today that companies or businesses that are doing business in their country make rooted commitments in those economies, and that\u2019s what in effect we\u2019re doing. I think it will put a very, very strong foundation under this nutritional business in a lot of countries around the world. China obviously is one of the largest right there with the United States in terms of size and potential, and therefore a very important one for us to commit to and make the kind of investments we\u2019re making.","Josh Jennings \u2013 Cowen & Co.","Great, thanks for that. And just to follow up, the ability of large corporations with breadth and scale, a product portfolio being better positioned to partner with hospitals and win contracts and gain share has received a lot of attention \u2013 we see this in the medical device industry. I know you spoke to this on the call on Monday to a degree. I just wanted to return to your strategic outlook for the medical device division \u2013 you know, with vascular, diabetes and ophtho units. Is the strategy for the divisions to build breadth and scale there, or is that enough to bolster the growth profile of the entire unit, or do you need new divisions in medical devices to compete more effectively as the healthcare delivery systems in both developed and emerged markets evolve, and just where are your priorities there strategically? Thanks a lot.","Miles White","Well, the first part of your question, I\u2019d say the answer is both \u2013 not only do we want breadth and scale, but I\u2019m open to expansions that are in new areas, provided we believe that we can add value or do better than with them than they might stand alone. So there\u2019s a delicate balance. There are times\u2014you know, when we acquired AMO in the ophthalmology business several years ago, a lot of people kind of raised their eyebrows and said, gee, what do you guys know about ophthalmology? You might say, well, that was an expansion into a different area \u2013 it was one that we had very carefully studied for some years. It was very intentional and it\u2019s one where we believe the demographics, the economics, the future of the business is frankly very favorable for us and for that particular segment. So we made that step to expand, and I think that was a good addition for Abbott. The first couple of years of performance with that business were a little less than anybody really wanted, and right now it\u2019s probably the fastest growing division in the company.","So I think that there are times when adding to the company that way will make sense, and I think there\u2019s times when clearly if we can broaden our footprint, expand our position in a business, whether it\u2019s diagnostics or pharmaceuticals or whatever, I think that\u2019s to our advantage \u2013 I think that\u2019s good. So we look both ways, I guess is the point.","And what was the second half of your question? Did I get that?","Josh Jennings \u2013 Cowen & Co.","You did. Thank you very much.","Miles White","Okay, good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify \u2013 I know you had talked about how you\u2019re going to be reporting going forward for the third quarter with respect to the, I guess now discontinued operations, so you\u2019re going to report both, I guess? And then thinking ahead to 2014, will you have to do anything in terms of the ownership that you\u2019ll have with respect to the Mylan business since it\u2019s going to be a\u2014","Thomas Freyman","Well again, today the guidance we\u2019ve provided is on a consistent basis with the way we started the year and continued through the first quarter, and it\u2019s the combination of both the continuing operations starting in third quarter as well as the discontinued operations of the EPB established developed markets business. We\u2019ll just very simply show those two pieces and reconcile it back to the guidance provided today, and I just think this is cleanest way to bridge to the new reporting. Obviously for 2015, since we will also be reporting that business as discontinued until it\u2019s actually\u2014the deal closes early in the year, we\u2019ll more likely be giving guidance obviously on that basis. ","And what was the second part of your question, Kristen?","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I was just wondering if since there will be a 21% ownership interest, I guess, if I understand it correctly\u2014","Thomas Freyman","Yes, I mean, we\u2019ll be basically carrying this investment at cost, and when it\u2019s sold hopefully at gains, those gains will be reflected as specified items throughout the period during which we sell it.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, perfect. Then any color just on the performance of the MitraClip program?","Miles White","MitraClip continues to progress nicely. We had a very good progression in the second quarter. We still are on track for this product to approach $200 million in sales, which would be up 50% over the prior year, and we\u2019re getting better coverage in Europe, more reimbursement in Europe, and we\u2019re making very good progress through the U.S. reimbursement process and we hope to have some good news on that in the second half of the year.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then more broadly, I guess, just on transcatheter valves, can you comment on whether you feel like you need a whole portfolio to be more\u2014to more effectively compete within that space?","Miles White","Okay, that\u2019s one I probably wouldn\u2019t answer directly for you, even if the answer was no. You know, I\u2019ll put this in the context, Kristen, of yesterday I saw an article in the media where many buy side and sell side analysts speculated on what the next steps would be that we\u2019d be interested in, of course which was very interesting. It was interesting to know the thoughts of a lot of people, but what I almost never do is try to telegraph where we might be interested, because a lot of times that\u2019s going to affect other companies and stuff, too. So if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m just going to avoid that question.","Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s totally fair. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Bedford from Raymond James.","Jason Bedford \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just on EPD, you witnessed a pretty strong acceleration in growth from your key emerging markets, and I just wanted to get a little more detail on some of the factors that drove the acceleration in the second quarter, meaning how much was just better execution, contribution from new products, or just stronger end markets?","Brian Yoor","This is Brian. How are you doing, Jason? I think I\u2019d start\u2014you know, first of all recall with India, which is our largest market, last year I think we all experienced a little bit of a slowdown in that market when they implemented what was called the Drug Price Control Order, so the whole industry, which is good news for us \u2013 I mean, this is our largest presence, the market has come back up into what I\u2019d say is more high single digits. It had actually reached low single digits through some of the disruption around the implementation of this control order last year. But that also with execution is serving very well for us in India, driving double digits growth. We\u2019re set up very nicely for the second half of the year as well, both from our execution as well as nice comparison in terms of that market\u2019s rebound. ","As I move to Brazil, that was one that was more about portfolio expansion. We had expanded out our products along the therapeutic area that we refer to as our women\u2019s health, so that\u2019s going very well. As I mentioned in China, again, execution but also coupled with\u2014recall in the first quarter, we talked about a plant shutdown to build out capacity for one of our most successful products in the women\u2019s health arena. That\u2019s starting to come back. It doesn\u2019t come back all at once, but I talked about seeing some benefits in the second quarter and third quarter now that that plant is online.","So we expect the key emerging markets to continue to do well for the rest of the year, and when you look at this thing globally with the developed markets business, it\u2019s still that nice, steady sequential improvement that we were talking about from the beginning of the year.","Jason Bedford \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I guess just sticking with EPD, and it may be a little premature, but lingering question from Monday \u2013 from a management perspective, you\u2019re bringing on a couple new businesses, shedding another one. So my question is who is going to lead the new and refreshed EPD business? And I realize the end markets are growing a little faster here in emerging markets, but is the business going to be run any differently than it is today? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, it already is being run differently, and the management that\u2019s going to run it is already there. There were a number of changes that had been made in the last year and a half or so and some new folks brought into the company, some others moved. I\u2019d say no change anticipated in the management team, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be glad to hear that; but that\u2019s already in place. We\u2019re executing against the plans we have, expanding our product lines and our depth in various therapeutic areas. We\u2019re rolling out our branding strategies in a number of these countries, and I think while it\u2019s difficult when you have a whole portfolio of a lot of countries to see the specific needle move in general, we track them all pretty individually and by detail, and we\u2019re seeing progress on the initiatives that we have in place.","So I think the management and I both expect to see continued improvement in those countries, and I think even this year in the third and fourth quarter, so I think you\u2019ll see that play out in the second half of the year here.","Jason Bedford \u2013 Raymond James","Great, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Great. Two questions for us. I guess first, can you talk about where the adult and infant nutritional businesses will sort of settle out over the next several quarters as we annualize the one-time and, you know, a bit easier comps here with all the manufacturing capacity increases, and what that does for gross margins over that window?","Brian Yoor","Once we get through the second half of the year, where again you\u2019re going to see strong double-digit growth for the nutrition business, we believe that when you weight the two businesses, which as you now we\u2019re 55% pediatric, 45% adult, this should be an upper single-digit growing business. Interestingly in all the forecasts we look at, the adult is growing at roughly the equivalent rate as the pediatrics. So as Miles indicated earlier, it\u2019s an extremely important business to us strategically.","So once we\u2019re through\u2014as you know, with this kind of being a first half, second half story this year with the recovery, I think that upper single digit range is one that we view as sustainable for a business that has great demographics on both the pediatric and adult sides, and obviously we\u2019re well invested in a broad range of more rapidly growing markets around the world with our emerging markets strategy.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Okay, and then on the diabetes side, you talked about Libre being a family of products. Can you give us some more insights into what that looks like beyond the initial flash version, and what sort of time frame we might think about as well as what the regulatory requirements may be for those products, given some of the claims you\u2019ve been talking about.","Miles White","I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s little premature for us to forecast that. I would only say it\u2019s not a one-off product. There will be other manifestations of it, other versions of it over time. I think our first priority is to get this first one launched. I think it will be very well received and very innovative, and then it will be followed by others, other versions for various segments of the market. I think it\u2019s just premature for us to comment on what that might be.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Okay. Maybe I can sneak in another one on the diagnostics side. You all have talked about kind of a handful of instrument systems coming. Obviously core labs has been great, but within molecular it\u2019s just been a bit weaker. We haven\u2019t seen those new platforms launched. Can you give us a bit of an update on any of those and when we might see those? Thank you.","Miles White","There\u2019s kind of an unprecedented number of systems in development in our diagnostics business broadly defined. There\u2019s a new family of hematology analyzers, new family for blood screening, new family for core lab immunoassay and chemistry. We also have a program underway in our molecular space. There is our Ibis system in addition to that in molecular, a second system there; and then next generation for our point of care business, so across the board literally, new systems and updated systems in development for all of these businesses. They obviously can\u2019t all launch at exactly the same time, so I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of a, call it a three to five-year frame here where they will all sequentially roll out, God willing and everything staying on time. ","I think as I said, it\u2019s unprecedented for that much to be done in a similar period of time, but when and as complete, I\u2019d say our diagnostics business will have the most up-to-date delivery platforms in their various spaces across the board in the industry and we\u2019ll be very, very well positioned.","Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ve got three questions, the first on gross margins. So you\u2019re flagging that you\u2019re going to have a drive on purchasing going forwards, and obviously you\u2019ve been putting out some new manufacturing facilities, so it sounds like you\u2019ve got quite some opportunity to increase gross margins going forwards, unless there\u2019s something in the mix that\u2019s going to pressure that against some of that. So maybe you can talk about opportunity for gross margin expansion maybe over a two, three-year period.","Then second, just wondering if you can help\u2014","Miles White","Would you mind holding the second and third question until we answer the first? I\u2019m finding I don\u2019t remember the third by the time I get done with the second.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Sure.","Miles White","Let\u2019s answer that one first, and then we\u2019ll go right back into the second question. You\u2019re right \u2013 you characterized it well. I think that our manufacturing and supply chain and distribution initiatives and so forth will in fact improve our margins across the board. That\u2019s been the case for the last three years as well in nutrition, and I think that\u2019s primarily what we\u2019re talking about here. All of the business is focused on margin improvement, and as I said, there are a number of things that will improve margins; but that has been the case. Some of that, as we\u2019ve seen, has dropped into gross margin improvement in the overall company P&L. In some cases, that gross margin improvement has offset either currency fluctuation in the wrong direction, or in some cases price pressures in markets or other things from time to time. I think we call it out pretty well when it occurs where the gross margin improvement has occurred and so forth, and as you know price is part of that, and price is generally not going up in our businesses around the world. It\u2019s usually under some pressure somewhere.","So that improvement in gross margin also preserves margins where we do have price pressures, and every now and then there\u2019s some country that determines it\u2019s going to have a pricing action of some kind \u2013 you know, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, others from time to time do that, and our gross margin improvements have either offset that or further added to the bottom line, and I think as we said earlier, there\u2019s opportunity here going forward and there continues to be margin expansion opportunity with it.","Second question?","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","So the second one is really if you can help us a bit more about the base cost of developed EPD from the perspective of just thinking how much net cash will drop through for share repurchases as you dispose of the Mylan shares.","Miles White","Well first of all, there\u2019s an assumption there that I would use it all for share repurchase, which I\u2019m not. So I would just call out the fact that it gives me a lot of optionality in terms of cash disposition, but I\u2019m probably not going to tell you today what that\u2019s going to be.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. The third question \u2013 and just to be clear, this is related to a wire that\u2019s come up this morning saying you may have talked with Sanofi about their mature products business. Just a little bit more general question off the back of that, do you think there is significant opportunity for you to add significant more product breadth to EPD, because in the past you\u2019ve talked just about geographic bolt-ons and infilling, but obviously a transaction like that \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that you are doing it, obviously \u2013 would add significant product breadth. Would that be something that was important for the business?","Miles White","Well, I\u2019d answer that two ways. First of all, I saw the report on Sanofi, and my understanding is that\u2019s a reference to their European-based business, and we just are in the process of selling ours, so I think these are two completely different questions here. Would I be interested in broadening our emerging market portfolio? Sure. Yeah, we\u2019re always interested in broadening or deepening our portfolio in our EPD business, but for us going forward, that\u2019s going to be an emerging market business and so consequently businesses that are similar products but in Europe or the U.S. would not be of interest to us.","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","That\u2019s great, thank you.","Brian Yoor","Okay, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Our final question today is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Miles, just a quick kind of maybe trip down memory lane for you here. As nutritionals approaches normalcy, I wonder if you can provide us some perspective 18 months post-spin. If you go back to the time of the spin, you talked about the Abbott growth story. I think you discussed upper single digit growth. As we sit here sort of 18 months later, I wonder are you getting the growth contribution from the areas you expected, and do you still think you have the access to get back to upper single digit growth here?","Miles White","I do. I think if I look at the single biggest event that was a setback for that business, it was the recall in Asia approximately a year ago in that nutrition business, which clearly impacted us in China and other countries, as I mentioned earlier. When that happens, it\u2019s a year to recover because the consumer is an incredibly quality conscious consumer that once that consumer has shifted to another brand, it\u2019s very difficult to regain them. That wasn\u2019t something anybody anticipated, it wasn\u2019t something anybody wanted to happen, including Fonterra; but when that happens, it does set you back a bit. I think we\u2019ve recovered about as well as we could have within that year time frame. I like the progress that our team is making in China and other countries. ","The world is volatile. The great thing about emerging markets is they represent, I think, terrific growth. The unfortunate thing about them for businesses that measure their success every 90 days is that they can be pretty volatile, and in our case we are in a number of emerging markets, like a portfolio, which one hopes over time dampens the overall absorption of volatility, and I think it does. I think you have to kind of learn how to shape your portfolio and shape your approach to minimize volatility of markets, whether it\u2019s currency driven, politically driven, whatever the case may be, and deliver that growth on a more consistent, durable basis for investors. And of course, that\u2019s our intent and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","So if I look at our businesses across the board, I always think we can do better. I think we\u2019re getting back to the track we want to be on with nutrition. I think we\u2019re getting back to the track we want to be on with our pharmaceutical business. The pharmaceutical business, as I\u2019ve said in the past, is two very different businesses \u2013 there\u2019s the developed market business which is low growth but still attractive and profitable, and then much higher growth emerging market business. And since we\u2019ve defined the company around durable growth, our emphasis and focus by strategic intent is on those emerging markets, and we think that given the scale necessary for the consolidation that\u2019s happening in those developed markets, that at least in our case, Mylan was a better home for our business than we were; otherwise, we were faced with the possibility of having to expand and consolidate still further in those markets. For us, that wasn\u2019t the same in terms of strategic intent and growth as what we\u2019re trying to do in emerging markets.","So I think that as two of the large businesses in the portfolio, I think they are getting back into the shape and direction and top line growth that we intend. I think as we\u2019ve said, everything we\u2019re doing is directed toward that. I see that evolving in emerging here. Our first quarter with EPD, as you\u2019ll recall, we had a plant shut down because we were expanding the plant, so there\u2019s a number of factors at work here that I think we\u2019ll see play out in the third and fourth quarter here that will give our investors much more confidence in the ongoing trajectory of our pharma business. I think the nutrition business will evolve that way over time, too \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s already a very strong business. It\u2019s doing well, and the infrastructure and so forth that we\u2019ve put in place and the recovery that we\u2019ve seen in China and other countries shows, and frankly we will have lapped it in the second half, the issue we had last year, and you\u2019ll see that those growth rates are back where you\u2019d like to see them.","David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Great. Maybe just a quick follow up for Tom. Tom, your guidance for gross margin remains unchanged but it still implies that back half recovery. I guess where you sit now, what are some of the factors that give you the confidence that you can get back to that gross margin improvement in the back half of the year? In general, I feel like investors are very focused on the Abbott SG&A story and a little bit less focused on the GM story. What are some of the opportunities for Abbott, both in the back half of the year but more specifically over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Thomas Freyman","Well you know, the guidance I provided on gross margin was pretty steady really from the second quarter through the fourth quarter. You know, it\u2019s a situation \u2013 and we talked about this at the very beginning of the year, it was a particularly acute exchange year on the gross margin ratio, and that\u2019s playing through\u2014you know, it played through in the second quarter, it was a bit of a headwind, and it\u2019s playing through a little more in the third quarter. So I think on the gross margin level, pretty much all the guidance is steady the rest of the year. Certainly we\u2019re going to work hard to do as well as we can in that area, but I think once we\u2019ve lapped through this year of exchange challenges, we\u2019ll be back on the fundamentals and it is something that we\u2019d like to see some steady improvement over time, even taking into account some of the challenge Miles outlined in his earlier remarks.","So I think the second half is really more of a sales acceleration story and continuing to drive down these G&A costs to ultimately deliver on the forecast.","Brian Yoor","Okay, well thank you, Operator, and thank you for all your questions.

Today I\u2019ll discuss our 2018 results as well as our outlook for 2019. For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year.","Strong performance across our businesses along with underlying margin expansion from \u2013 and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year, despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progress through the year.","With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we built and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All four of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year.","At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced the 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.","We also increased our investments and capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in two important areas that will drive significant long-term growth, FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems.","And lastly, following two major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than a $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward. Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution, and for 2019, we\u2019re forecasting another year of strong financial performance.","As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25 reflecting double-digit growth. I\u2019ll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business.","I\u2019ll start with Nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our pediatric and adult Nutrition businesses.","Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year.","And in the U.S. growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above market growth of Similac, our market leading infant formula brand and Pedialyte, our market leading rehydration brand.","Overall, the fundamental demographic and social economic trends in the global nutrition market remain favorable and our position in the market remains very competitive. In Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China.","Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple, to build significant presence, scale and leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets, where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care.","We built our business over-time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally, but driven locally. A global scale sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation.","And our local decision making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country. Healthcare spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there\u2019s lots of room for future growth and our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.","Moving to Diagnostics, where we\u2019ve consistently achieved above market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets.","Customer feedback has been outstanding was quite frankly, isn\u2019t a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors, while continuing to provide quality results.","In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year.","2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care, as well as molecular rapid test for infectious diseases.","These new products along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward.","And lastly, I\u2019ll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas including electrophysiology, structural heart and diabetes care, as well as stabilization in our rhythm management and vascular businesses.","In electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart.","And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly under penetrated market.","In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth and perhaps more importantly announced clinical trial results from MitraClip, our market leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve was demonstrated improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease.","We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly under penetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multi-billion dollar cardiac device market over time.","And lastly in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018, growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than a $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately two-thirds are type 1 diabetics and one-third are type 2.","In U.S. we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and pharmacy insurance coverage continue to increase including an emerging trend of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition.","In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that one patients of glucose levels fall out of range. Due to our unique product design and highly automated manufacturing process, we\u2019re able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price.","This affordable and simple to use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease and given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come.","So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we\u2019re forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis, which is consistent of our previous guidance.","Turning to our results, sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in-line with our guidance of mid-to-high-single digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017, and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results achieved sales of $548 million.","Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations, had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October.","Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.2% of sales.","Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15%, and exceed our cash flow and debt repayment objectives.","Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full-year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales.","We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and non-operating income of around $200 million. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplate the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season.","At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of a non-core low margin third-party supply agreement.","For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid to high single-digits. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott\u2019s Legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and Point of Care to grow mid to high single-digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.","Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019 is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier.","For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low to mid single-digits. And at Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Wanted to ask about FreeStyle Libre to start off. You had another good quarter of patient adds and it seems like you\u2019re expanding more into type 2 with the new disclosure. Could you talk about the trends there, what\u2019s the 2.0 adds and some of your longer-term vision for Libre?","Miles White","Yes, sure, Matt. Well, a few things about Libre or actually several things about Libre. First of all, it\u2019s going extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That\u2019s almost equivalent to the entire user base of the number two competitor in the space. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. Two-thirds of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide.","So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we\u2019re doing very well in type 1 segment \u2013 the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity expands, we\u2019ll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. There\u2019s a constant, I would say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We\u2019ve recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion.","And at the rate we\u2019re adding patients, obviously, that\u2019s something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I\u2019d say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we\u2019re having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we\u2019re going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push.","So \u2013 and then we\u2019ve got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth.","So we\u2019ve got a very low cost position. We\u2019ve got a good value access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company. I don\u2019t have any other way to say it. This is a hell of a good topic.","Matt Taylor","Yes, it\u2019s been phenomenal growth. I was just curious, as you look forward in segmenting the market, you now have Libre 2 with alarms. You have partnership with a pump company. Can you talk about how you might bifurcate your strategy to go after different segments, whether you need low-cost offering and a higher feature offering as you kind of expand through the Libre portfolio?","Miles White","Well, I think \u2013 I\u2019m going to be careful how much I say publicly on the phone. I think you can assume that we\u2019re obviously developing every aspect of this product that you can imagine. And that\u2019s all going very well. I wouldn\u2019t communicate what I would forecast as time lines. I think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we\u2019re adding speak for themselves.","We\u2019re pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we\u2019re constrained yet, but right now, we\u2019re adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically, and that\u2019s worldwide.","And then of course, there\u2019s an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that\u2019s targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably number one cost position, number one volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than everybody else.","So I\u2019d just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have been for some time.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thanks for the detailed answer. I\u2019ll let some others jump in.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Robbie Marcus","Great, thanks for taking the question. Miles, maybe I can ask a guidance question. So Abbott\u2019s guidance for 2019 is 6.5% to 7.5%, basically in line with 2018 and a bit better than The Street was expecting to start the year. So maybe you could give us a little background what your confidence is at the starting point? And maybe specifically, touch on some of the key growth drivers for 2019 that people are focused on. MitraClip, you talked about Libre, and maybe hit on an Alinity.","Miles White","Yes. Well, I think you\u2019ve touched base there on several of them already. What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding 2018 and we just gave you guidance that\u2019s even better than 2018. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It\u2019s all organic growth. It\u2019s not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It\u2019s not driven by lapping an acquisition. It\u2019s not dependent on acquiring something. And all the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline and launching globally.","So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that\u2019s a pretty big and high growth driver. That\u2019s a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven\u2019t really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I\u2019ll call critical mass, that will tip up as well.","And so far, everything we\u2019ve seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I\u2019d say, extremely competitive but it\u2019s better than that. And so that\u2019s going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies. And frankly, there\u2019s a couple of aspects to that program that haven\u2019t really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera.","So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best \u2013 at best, flat business. And that\u2019s been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We\u2019re going to be looking for now improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior four, five years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let\u2019s call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that\u2019s a plus, that\u2019s an upside.","The pipeline in devices is strong. It\u2019s good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there\u2019s a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we\u2019ve got now.","Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we\u2019re not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I\u2019ve talked about that on previous calls.","We believe we\u2019re in control of our destiny there. And if we \u2013 if anything, I had probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there wrong. It\u2019s taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that\u2019s going to get sequentially better, and I think that\u2019s a plus. The Point of Care business that\u2019s part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but \u2013 our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we\u2019ve done that. And so I\u2019m quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That\u2019ll improve.","So if I had a concern at all, it\u2019s the things I can\u2019t control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we\u2019re all going to live with currency if we\u2019re a multinational company, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re any different.","And to be honest, we\u2019re not that differently indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let\u2019s call it, individual spotty circumstances in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economies, the health care systems, is solid.","So I look at all aspects of the company. Whenever we\u2019re not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business which had such a great year last year or actually have a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable basis going forward.","So as I look forward into 2019, I note that there\u2019s a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products. On the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we\u2019ve got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&D and a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come.","So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we\u2019ve demonstrated through 2018 and will demonstrate into 2019 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect.","Robbie Marcus","Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And maybe one for Brian. On the bottom line, EPS guidance implies growth of 9% to 13% on a reported basis, closer to mid-teens on a constant currency basis. This is higher than what we\u2019ve seen in the past from Abbott but also off the higher starting top line. So as we go through the year, if there\u2019s incremental upside, how should investors think about the willingness to allow that to fall to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the business at these growth rates?","Brian Yoor","I\u2019ll defer to Miles on that question because I know he makes the choices ultimately between the balance of growth and sustainable growth versus what we give back to shareholders. But I think we\u2019ve shown a good propensity to be balanced in that. We showed that demonstration even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we\u2019re looking for.","Your math is right. I said back on the October call that exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It\u2019s just a little touch above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It\u2019s a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that we\u2019re portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty rangebound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points.","And there\u2019s a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There\u2019s a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you\u2019re seeing the margin expansion come through in our op margin line in our guidance.","Miles White","Yes, I\u2019d reiterate a couple of things. So this is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now is factored into our guidance, and we\u2019re still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we\u2019re, I don\u2019t know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year, meaning 2018, that we\u2019ve got to lap. And so it\u2019s that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the midpoint would be 11%. So we\u2019re still at healthy double digits, and it\u2019s in effect caused by lapping last year\u2019s guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there\u2019s no way to kind of predict what\u2019s going to happen with the year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fate strike us down.","But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I\u2019d say the company has always been fortunate that it\u2019s had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that\u2019s our aspiration every single year. And gosh, more often than not, that\u2019s where we start with our guidance.","Now having said that, out of the last 11 years \u2013 and why do I not go back further than 11 years? I don\u2019t have the data, but I could get it. But in out of the last 44 quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investors\u2019 expectations, beat 39 of them and met on five. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street\u2019s expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there\u2019s no reason to see a change to that.","We\u2019ve got strong cash flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares it\u2019s the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&A. We\u2019ve obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want.","So we had very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision \u2013 and that\u2019s a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors are benefited.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Miles, just a couple for you. In thinking about or listening to your commentary on 2019, the one comment that comes to mind was balance, your commentary that most businesses get better or a lot better. That being said, a lot of investors are still very focused on Libre and MitraClip. So as you think about the guidance and how it was formulated, how dependent is 2019 guidance on a significant inflection for MitraClip or a Libre 2 product launch?","Miles White","Zero.","David Lewis","Okay. That\u2019s pretty clear. I guess we can leave it at that. The second point\u2026","Miles White","No, it is. I mean, you know what? I think I need to be honest, I\u2019m not trying to be coy with you. It\u2019s very hard to predict what the regulatory timing will be, for example, on MitraClip. So \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason for us to come play with the number and play with something that we\u2019re not sure we can predict. So what we do know is when it comes, which is very compelling \u2013 there\u2019s a number of things that have to happen. FDA has to approve it. We obviously would want CMS to reimburse it and so on. And I think it\u2019ll have that kind of compelling story with the regulatory bodies. It\u2019s obviously \u2013 the COAPT study was very powerful, and I think the regulatory bodies will give that all the right consideration.","But trying to pin that down and trying to pin down timing and so forth is not something that\u2019s easy to do. And I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d be doing our investors any good service by trying to predict that. What I do know is it\u2019s compelling. When it comes, it\u2019ll come and it\u2019ll have impact. And rather than put it in our estimates, we haven\u2019t.","David Lewis","Okay, very clear. And then just following up on another point you made in this morning. Thinking about the balance sheet, I mean, you went from two years ago an overlevered company to now, frankly, relative to peers an underlevered company. I think debt paydown and free cash generation were sort of unsung heroes of last year. So many of other companies have picked up the relative pace of M&A. You\u2019re still growing at a pretty robust 7-plus percent rate without significant M&A in the last couple of years. So where do you stand now as you think about reinvestment for growth? How active are you likely to be in 2019 relative to 2018 on the M&A front?","Miles White","Well, I\u2019d say a couple of things. First of all, you earn your highest return on organic growth and not your highest return on M&A. And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We\u2019ve had, let\u2019s say, an excellent track record going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth, we\u2019ve had a really good track record with the M&A we\u2019ve done over time. And we\u2019ve managed those companies and their products well over time.","So I\u2019d say, first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we\u2019re getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it\u2019s coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don\u2019t see gaps right now that we have to fill with M&A. So we\u2019re able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rate across the business. We\u2019ve also been careful over time, there\u2019s times to be in the M&A markets and there\u2019s times not to be. And when multiples are really high, bad time to buy.","And \u2013 but to be honest, I don\u2019t see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that\u2019s necessarily good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don\u2019t need it. And there\u2019s not something that\u2019s so attractive. All of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It\u2019s just they wouldn\u2019t meet our criteria. I don\u2019t see something compelling. I don\u2019t see something that we need. And right now, we\u2019re in a fortunate position where we\u2019ve got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses.","I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can\u2019t buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it\u2019s just not necessary for us to put our money into M&A right now because I don\u2019t think we\u2019d turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We\u2019re going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends.","And at some point here, we\u2019ll have a choice. We\u2019re going to keep paying down debt because I think it\u2019s a good idea. Our debt \u2013 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That wasn\u2019t that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we\u2019re doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we\u2019re in that position. So I just don\u2019t see M&A right now as a high priority.","David Lewis","Okay. Very clear. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thanks, Miles.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking the question. I\u2019m going to take the flip side of David\u2019s question. Instead of thinking about M&A and adding things, how do you feel about having all four legs of the stool remain in the Abbott house? I think there was some lay press discussion regarding a possible sale of a nutritionals business.","Miles White","Well, I guess that\u2019s speculation. Geez, if I don\u2019t get it every quarter \u2013 it\u2019s almost every quarter. So thanks for asking the question, Joanne. We like our mix right now. There\u2019s a role to everything in our portfolio. And the one I\u2019m asked more frequently about than anything is Nutrition. And you can transact, you can try to make money for your shareholders with transactions, but I would say this; as you know, Joanne, I\u2019ve been in this job a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for Nutrition in our portfolio. And I got the same question then.","And one of the roles was it\u2019s got a global presence, global infrastructure. It\u2019s highly profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&A activities and other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that\u2019s not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It\u2019s clearly a different business as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera.","But today, I\u2019d say, look, it makes sense as part of our company. I don\u2019t think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We\u2019re well valued. We\u2019re performing well. I don\u2019t honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I\u2019ve looked at it. I don\u2019t think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that\u2019s a plus. I think that in general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it\u2019s also performing well. I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there.","So it\u2019s just not on my radar screen. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to improve Abbott. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to create value by considering it. And I think we\u2019ll distract ourselves with that at a time we don\u2019t even need to be distracted. So it\u2019s just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don\u2019t think it will. And I think it\u2019s being well valued as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it\u2019s just not on my radar screen and nor do I think it\u2019s necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that\u2019s the simplest thing to say.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay, appreciate that. As a follow-up, two businesses I just want to talk about the pipeline. Neuromod, what does it take to reaccelerate that growth rate? And then you talked about an Alere pipeline, which I don\u2019t think The Street is really focused on. If you could just give us some highlights there. Thank you.","Miles White","Yes. So first of all, the single biggest thing that immediately will change how we\u2019re doing in neuromod is actually our sales force expansion in the U.S. and our training and execution there. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Then longer term, we put a lot of emphasis in our R&D pipeline. We have a number of new people, new management, broader pipeline under development. I\u2019m not going to give you any kind of insights to and so forth because I don\u2019t really want to get the world focused on it.","But it\u2019s an area where we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in the types of products we have. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ve sort of fully gotten the benefit of the two main products we have now. And so I\u2019d say it\u2019s got our attention. We doubled our investment in R&D there. And I think in the coming years, we\u2019ll see that roll out. What was the second part of that for neuromod?","Joanne Wuensch","Pipeline in Alere.","Miles White","We\u2019ve reorganized the Rapid Diagnostics business into four segments. Each of them has their emphasis, their target. Each has an R&D plan. Each has a new product plan. We are increasing our investment in R&D also there. I can give you a couple of high points and examples. Infectious decease product, i.e. now, which we think its got a lot of potential that we\u2019re rolling out. The Afinion 2 cardiometabolic platform, another opportunity that we\u2019re putting emphasis behind. But I think there\u2019s \u2013 generally speaking, there\u2019s a lot more possibility for us in incrementally updating and renewing a number of these platforms, and then there\u2019s newer stuff than that.","And so when we took over the company, which we\u2019ve now had in our possession a little over a year, one of our targets was to get our hands around the R&D of each of these segments and make sure we had an R&D plan in place, so there was a steady cadence of improvements and new products in each of these businesses. That does take a little time. In our first year, a lot of our focus was stabilizing the organization, its structure, the management, people, execution of what we\u2019ve got, synergies, et cetera, which we\u2019ve talked about. Now our attention turns to this, and it has been. I mean, we\u2019ve been increasing our spending and increasing our focus on this. And that\u2019s what the management team is focused on now, is that new product cadence. So beyond that, I don\u2019t want to be more specific. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be tracking it all here.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","Well. Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to follow up, if I might, the commentary earlier on MitraClip given its visibility. Can you just give us a sense as to what the growth rate of MitraClip was in the fourth quarter? And then to be clear, relative to your earlier comments, do you really not assume U.S. approval and reimbursement for MitraClip in FMR at all in 2019? Is that not assumed at all?","Miles White","No, that\u2019s not what I said, and that\u2019s not what the question was. I\u2019m not assuming that. But the question was whether or not that was pivotal to making our earnings guidance for the year or our sales guidance. And the answer was, it has no bearing on our sales and earnings guidance for the year. But you\u2019re asking me a different question now, do I expect approval? And I\u2019d say, well, we\u2019ll see. I mean, we\u2019re certainly hopeful that we\u2019ll get that kind of consideration. And is it possible? I suppose it\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t know. We just don\u2019t know. Scott?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes. With respect to the MitraClip growth rate, MitraClip grew about 30% in the fourth quarter.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. So it accelerated a little bit. Okay, I hear you on MitraClip. And then the other sort of product-oriented question that I wanted to ask is that you mentioned in your remarks that Libre is getting some preferred copay status. And I was just \u2013 I found that intriguing. I was just wondering if you could expand on what that means specifically, how broad the program is, is that just because Libre is a little lower cost? Or are payers trying to incentivize patients to use Libre? So maybe just a little color on the copay status.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes. I mean, as you think about copay status and the way payers use it, that is essentially what we\u2019re trying to do, is we\u2019re trying to incent a preferred offering with respect to the value proposition that, that offering brings. So as we progress in the second half of the year in our payer dialogue, we saw that certain payers were starting to put Libre in a higher Tier 2, which would result for the end patient in a lower copay, quite frankly. And again, I think as they look at the overall value proposition, the outcomes data and whatnot, they see a compelling argument to do it, and we\u2019re starting to see that trend.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Navarro","Hi, good morning, guys. Two device questions. First, on Rhythm Management in the quarter, down 2% to 3%. Is that market softness? Or are you guys just losing share to Boston Scientific because of their HeartLogic feature or losing share to Medtronic because they\u2019ve got Micra, the leadless pacer? So that\u2019s the first question. And then the Vascular business, down 5% in the U.S. That would \u2013 that\u2019s surprising to me given you\u2019re launching XIENCE Sierra. So similar question, is this just the market is weaker in drug-eluting stents for the U.S.? Is it more pricing pressure? Or is the product simply not gaining traction?","Scott Leinenweber","Hi, Glenn. Yes. I\u2019ll start with Rhythm Management here. And as you know, when we acquired that business, it was declining at a fairly heavy clip. We\u2019ve been able to stabilize it. The overall market, to your point, is down modestly, and our performance is generally in line with that. When it comes to Vascular, same thing. Again, the market is down modestly. XIENCE Sierra is doing well. It\u2019s capturing share. In fact, we gained about five share points since the launch of XIENCE Sierra. Pricing in the space remains a challenge for all of the market, but XIENCE Sierra is definitely performing there. And quite frankly, our performance overall is a little bit above the market.","Miles White","Glenn, what you\u2019re also seeing there is a reduction in third-party royalty revenue, not share. The stent and the system, XIENCE Sierra, are capturing share, but what you\u2019re seeing is the roll-through of loss of a third-party revenue.","Glenn Navarro","Okay. And one follow-up. Can you give us an update on both your TAVR and mitral program? TAVR, specifically Portico, when do we see a U.S. filing and approval? And then mitral, update on Tendyne enrollment and then maybe comment on the latest acquisition. Thanks.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes. On TAVR, we would expect to file that here in the second half of this year. We\u2019re wrapping up that trial as we speak. With respect to Tendyne and Cephea, obviously, we\u2019re expanding them. We\u2019ve had a long-term vision here in the mitral space to really build a toolbox. Tendyne, we filed actually for CE Mark before the end of last year. So we could possibly see approval here this year. The U.S. is still several years away. And the Cephea program looks like a really great program, but again, still several years away.","Glenn Navarro","Okay. Great. Thanks, Scott.","Scott Leinenweber","Thanks, operator. We will take one more question.","Operator","And our final question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Hi, good morning, Miles. Maybe just one big picture and one product question. Brian has done and the team has done a fabulous job paying down debt. You highlighted some thoughts about the \u2013 your comfort in not doing M&A in today\u2019s portfolio. Obviously, that suggests share buyback and dividend. You\u2019ve touched on it a little bit. But just wondering, are you feeling strongly about taking your excess cash and dividing it equally depending on stock price? I mean, do you have a priority? Is there some \u2013 how are you thinking about it?","Miles White","No, I don\u2019t think about it as dividing it equally. There\u2019s \u2013 for any particular capital use, there\u2019s a timing, and there\u2019s \u2013 or there\u2019s a need. If we got to invest in capacity internally and manufacturing and so forth, obviously, that\u2019s a good thing. And as I\u2019ve said, we can afford all of that and more. We\u2019re keeping our dividend healthy. We target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout ratio, a nice healthy range. And a number of our peer group don\u2019t do that at all. So I think we\u2019ve got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us because we have a large segment of investors that care about that.","With regard to M&A, M&A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product, the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of things. And right now, I don\u2019t see any of that lining up to say, wow, there\u2019s something we\u2019re dying to go look at. And then with regard to share buybacks, Rick, it sort of depends on valuations in the market. There\u2019s times when share buybacks aren\u2019t that economical and other times when they\u2019re high return. And on our case, right now, we\u2019ve got the flexibility. If we want to do any kind of share buyback just to offset dilution and so forth, we can do that. And \u2013 but I think you kind of \u2013 you got to look at it and say, is that my best use of cash? I still want to pay down debt. I don\u2019t want to assume we\u2019re just going to carry this forward.","We paid down a lot of debt fast. It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it down. I think we\u2019re well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have choice. We do \u2013 we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think \u2013 I guess the best thing about it is we don\u2019t think about it in any mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best \u2013 where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position and a lower debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically.","When \u2013 before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We\u2019re not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs. And that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we\u2019d certainly consider that.","But right now, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s our highest priority either. It\u2019s still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we\u2019d probably be glad we did, and we\u2019ll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time.","Rick Wise","Yes, that\u2019s a great answer. And just lastly quickly, and I know you would love to talk about what could push you to the upper end of your 6.5% to 7% guidance for 2019. But there were some wild cards that helped out. You exceeded your initial 2018 organic growth guidance in 2018. Maybe just touch on quickly, if you would, what could push you to the upper end or above for your 2019 range?","Miles White","Thank you. Oh, I think there\u2019s \u2013 Rick, I think there\u2019s a number of product things that could do that. We\u2019ve already mentioned MitraClip\u2019s possibility. And it wouldn\u2019t take a whole lot, a couple of ticks in any of these businesses of improvement. Last year, our Nutrition business actually did better than we expected. We thought it would do better than prior years, but it did better than that and better than we expected. And some of those tick-ups make a big difference.","And so I think if we turn the corner as we expect to and plan to, things like neuromod and other places where we know the fundamental underlying business is strong, it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot to sort of correct the underperformance of some businesses, whether it\u2019s our Point of Care business or neuromod or some of individual countries in the pharmaceutical business. And the upside here is fairly strong.","Rick Wise","Much appreciated. Thank you.","Scott Leinenweber","Very good. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 A.M. Central Time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com.

Everyone, have a wonderful day."],"356":["Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) Q4 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call January 29, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Brian Yoor - VP, IR","Miles White - Chairman and CEO","Tom Freyman - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Operator","Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brian Yoor","Okay, good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments as except required by law.","Note that financial results from the developed markets branded, generics, pharmaceuticals and animal health businesses are reported as discontinued operations due to the pending sale of these businesses.","As a result, the line items of our consolidated statement of earnings are reported as continuing operations or excluding the results of these two businesses. To help facilitate year-over-year comparisons we filed an 8-K on Tuesday of this week that provides historical results from Abbott's continuing operations for the first three quarters of 2014. In addition, our 2015 guidance provided today for sales, P&L line items and earnings per share is for continuing operations only.","In today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Brian, good morning. Today I'll discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2014, but in particular our outlook for 2015.","We made good progress against our objectives last year and we see good positive underlying momentum in our businesses going into 2015. However, as you know, recent macroeconomic events have dominated the discussion on company outlooks for 2015 in particular the significant strengthening of the dollar against almost every currency during the fourth quarter of 2014 and in the 2015, as well as the impact of the draconian price of oil on the global economic outlook.","These factors will affect the 2015 forecast for most multinational companies, including Abbott, but while many are focused on the negative aspects of these events, I'd note that they will impact countries and companies in different ways.","Abbott will clearly face some headwinds, while emerging markets currencies have devalued, however underlying fundamental growth remained strong. In fact countries such as India and China where Abbott has a strong presence will benefit economically from the lower price of oil and while the weakening of the euro impacts our European based revenue the fluctuations of this particular currency will not impact our bottom line as a result of our European cost base and this should provide some durability to our result.","So while I'll discuss currency in more detail when I review our 2015 outlook, the bulk of my remarks here will address what we control our commercial and operational execution, our new product introductions and our efforts to reduce costs and expand margins.","So for the full year 2014 we delivered operational sales growth of 5.5% including acquisitions. Sales growth rates improved sequentially each quarter last year as we expected and sales in emerging markets increased nearly 13%.","We expended both growth and operating margins and achieved adjusted earnings per share of $2.28 including results related to the established pharmaceutical developed markets business. This exceeded our guidance range and represents year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of more than 13%.","During the year, we continued to build Abbott's investment identity as a durable and reliable growth company following a number of actions we took last year, were broader and deeper in emerging markets and were more consumer facing. In short, we are more present were the growth in healthcare is taking place now and will be over the long term.","In established pharmaceuticals we further positioned a division for faster growth. We added CFR Pharmaceuticals which provides the scale manufacturing, R&D and product portfolio to establish Abbott as a top-10 pharma company in Latin America.","We acquired Veropharm positioning Abbott as a top five branded generic company in Russia. Both CFR and Veropharm provide Abbott with in-country manufacturing to bring us closer to our customers as well as better match our cost with our sales and currency in those regions.","And we're on track to close on the sale of the EPD developed markets business in the first quarter, our business that performed above expectations in 2014 and is well positioned to move forward with Mylan.","Last year in our nutrition business we increased our local presence by investing in our global infrastructures. We opened three new manufacturing plants in China, India, and the U.S. and we partnered with world's largest dairy co-operative Fonterra to invest locally in China's milk supply. These investments are a reflection of the strong underlying demand for our high quality adult and pediatric products.","In Medical Devices we positioned our portfolio for stronger growth over the long term. We entered a $3 billion fast growing electrophysiology market through the acquisition of Topera. In vascular we achieved improved reimbursement and coverage from MitraClip in the U.S. which should further expand adoption and we presented the first of multiple randomized clinical trials underway for ABSORB.","In medical optics, we broke ground on a new facility in Malaysia to expand manufacturing capacity for our cataract lenses driven by strong global demand for cataract surgeries. And in diabetes care we established a new market with our Flash glucose monitoring device FreeStyle Libre launched directly to consumers in Europe last fall. It eliminates the need for routine fingersticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.","In diagnostics we delivered another year of mid-to-high single-digit growth well balanced across both the developed world and emerging markets. And in Europe we introduced our IRIDICA testing system what we believe will be a breakthrough in the infectious disease area.","We're entering 2015 with good momentum. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the growing trends across our markets remain positive. The innovations we're launching are driving share gains and we're investing in our businesses to drive above market growth over the long term.","We expect to step up in our 2015 sales growth rate the high single-digit operational growth, including acquisitions with emerging markets expected to contribute another year of double-digits performance.","From a currency perspective we expect around 6% negative impact to sales from foreign exchange. This is roughly double the impact we had expected just three months ago and is in line with what a number of other companies and analysts have forecasted as part of their outlooks for 2015.","Currency is a headwind that's impacting all multinationals and our assumption for this impact has been incorporated into our 2015 adjusted earnings-per-share guidance from continued operations of $2.10 to $2.20 a share reflecting top tier growth at the midpoint of the range.","Strong business performance and growth in operating margin expansion have and will continue to help offset even these more pronounced currency impacts in 2015. At the same time, we need to continue to invest in our businesses to drive sustainable long-term growth. And in 2015 I'm optimistic about our prospects.","In nutrition, our R&D organization has been the most productive it has ever been launching multiple products over the last several years. In 2014 in China this included two new infant formula products, Eleva and Similac QINTI in new market segments. We expect continued momentum in 2015 including our new Ensure product in China which is the first product introduced in the newly established Adult Nutrition category in this country.","We're also building our brand in India. Local R&D manufacturing and supply chains are fully established. We recently rolled out our first line of simple products produced in our new state-of-the-art facility.","Margin improvement remains a key priority for our nutrition business and we expanded its operating margin by several hundred basis points each of the last two years. Our original target was to reach 20% of sales by 2015 and we exceed that goal in 2014. Going forward we expect further margin expansion in this business.","In Established Pharmaceuticals we're continuing to improve our commercial execution by strengthening our capabilities in key geographies and channel, expanding our product portfolios through innovation that's both fast and locally driven and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers who are taking even greater role and making decisions about their healthcare.","We're also strengthening our local scale and infrastructure through the integration of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm. Both of these acquisitions enhance our local market insights, knowhow and our commercial capabilities as well as help build out our portfolios in our core therapeutic areas.","And finally as I mentioned, we anticipate closing on the sale of our developed markets business to Mylan in the first quarter. We will receive 110 million shares of Mylan stock which provides us with significant optionality given our strong balance sheet and ability to redeploy the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of Mylan shares.","In medical devices, we're investing in a number of new products across diabetes care, vascular and medical optics. The medical optics and our cataract business a steady stream of new products over the last two years has resulted in several points of share gains. In 2015 we expect continued strong growth of our cataract business driven by more than 20 new product launches across multiple geographies as well as continued expansion of our laser cataract system CATALYS.","In vascular, we're continuing to drive uptake of our new products, MitraClip, Supera and Absorb as well as our newest drug-eluting stent XIENCE Alpine launched in the U.S. and recently approved in Japan.","In diabetes care we'll expand FreeStyle Libre into multiple new markets over time targeting more than $8 billion global blood glucose monitoring markets. Strong patient awareness has exceeded our initial expectations based on our direct-to-patient sales model. We are already executing on our capacity expansion and we're looking to secure broader reimbursement for Libre.","And finally, diagnostics, which remains one of our most durable and reliable growth businesses, consistently delivering mid-to-high single-digit operational sales growth the past four years.","We will continue to execute on our commercial strategy and core laboratory diagnostics in both developed and developing markets. We are also investing simultaneously in the development of next-generation system platforms in blood screening, immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, molecular diagnostics and point-of-care.","Margin improvement in diagnostics once again exceeded our expectations increasing nearly 100 basis points versus 2013. Our gross margin improvement initiatives are continuing to yield results and we expect continued steady margin expansion in this business.","So to summarize, as we enter 2015 we expect a step up in full year 2015 operational sales growth into the high single-digit with double-digit growth in emerging markets and we expect continued growth in operating margin expansion as we execute on our division improvement programs and back office support initiatives.","While we anticipate currency to be a more significant headwind this year, than in 2014, the long term fundamentals of our business are healthy and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders.","In addition to our dividend and share repurchase activity our strong balance sheet and additional flexibility from the Mylan transaction provide us with a significant opportunity to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long term durable growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2014 results in more detail and our 2015 outlook. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Thanks Miles. Before I review our financial performance and outlook I'd like to remind you that my remarks today regarding 2014 earnings per share will include the contributions from the developed markets, branded, generics business that we agreed to sell to Mylan and the animal health business that we've agreed to sell to Zoetis.","Both of these transactions are expect to close in the first quarter of 2015. This basis of comparison is consistent with the adjusted EPS guidance we've provided in our folder. All of my comments for sales and other P&L line items this quarter and also our 2015 forecast will be for continuing operations only and that is excluding the businesses being sold.","Today, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.71 above our previous guidance range due to the full year effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December including the R&D tax credit for 2014. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 29% in the fourth quarter.","We saw strong operational sales growth and increasing sales momentum in the fourth quarter. Sales from continuing operations increased 10.2% on an operational basis in the quarter which include the impact on our recent CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm acquisitions. Operational sales excluding these acquisitions increased 6.5% in the quarter.","The product sales increased 5.6% in the quarter including an impact of 4.6% from foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange on sales is almost twice as high as the estimates we provided in October reflecting strengthening in the U.S. dollar versus almost every currency during the quarter.","Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in nutrition diagnostics and established pharmaceuticals. Own company sales in emerging markets increased strong double-digitss on an operational basis in the quarter. fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ration was 56.9% of sales ahead of our previous guidance reflecting underlying gross margin improvements across the businesses as well as the impact of the weaker euro on our manufacturing cost base. Adjusted SG&A expenses 29.5% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 6.4% of sales.","The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was below our previous forecast due entirely for the inclusion of the full year impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December as I mentioned earlier.","Overall as we look at 2014 we delivered a strong EPS growth above our initial guidance range and up more than 13% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations grew 21%. We continue to make significant progress in our margin improvement initiatives spanning our full year adjusted operation margins in continuing operations by 200 basis points. And importantly we exited the year with strong underlying momentum as we head into 2015.","As I turn to our outlook for 2015 I'd note that as detailed in our earnings release, in 2014 we achieved adjusted EPS from continuing operations $1.98. This was the new baseline against which we will be measuring EPS growth in 2015. As Miles indicated the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting our 2015 growth as it is from our multinational companies.","Based on current exchange rates, the impact of foreign exchange on our sales will be even more pronounced in 2015 than it was last year with a negative impact on 2015 sales growth of around 6% compared to 2.5% for the full year 2014.","Although the impact of currency will be significant in 2015, it is important to note that as I mentioned earlier we exited last year with strong underlying performance momentum. Our top line operational growth accelerated significantly in the second half of the year as expected and we continue to make substantial progress on our margin expansion initiatives.","Importantly the underlying trends across the key geographies and healthcare segments in which we compete remain positive and attractive over the long term driven by improving access in healthcare and demographic trends that aligns our business. So despite recent currency dynamics we are well positioned to deliver strong EPS growth in 2015.","So turning to the specifics of our outlook for the full year 2015 today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations of $2.10 to $2.20 which reflects the growth of around 8.5% over 2014. At current exchange rates currency would negatively impact 2015 EPS growth reflected in this guidance by around 10%.","We forecast operational sales growth continuing operations in the high single-digit for the full year 2015. As noted, at current exchange rates we would expect negative impact of around 6% on our full year reported sales which will result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2015. Brian will provide more detail on the 2015 outlook by business in a few minutes.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57% of sales for the full year 2015 reflecting more than 150 basis points of expansion driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.","I'll note that at current exchange rates the impact of foreign exchange on our gross margin ratio is expected to be relatively neutral in 2015 as the impact of exchange on sales will be largely offset by the benefit we will realize from the weaker euro on our European based manufacturing costs.","We forecast adjusted R&D investment as a percent of sales consistent with 2014 level at around 6.5% of sales. And we forecast adjusted SG&A expense around 31% of sales for the full year as we end up some of savings from our efficiency programs and new products across our businesses to drive top line growth.","Overall we expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015 reflecting another year of significant margin expansion.","We forecast interest expense of around $150 million up over 2014 due to a planned refinancing of a portion of our short term debt and expectation of higher U.S. short term interest rates impacting short term debt in the second half of the year and somewhat lower interest income as a result of the funding 2014 acquisitions.","We forecast adjusted tax rate of 19% for the full year 2015 which is in line with the normalized 2014 rate excluding the effect of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in December. Our forecast does not assume reenactment of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2015.","Finally I'd like to review our outlook for the first quarter of 2015. For the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.41 to $0.43 which reflects growth of over 23% the midpoint of the range over adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2014 up $0.34.","This strong growth even in the line of currency headwinds is driven by strong underlying performance as well as favorable year-over-year comparisons due to certain items of reduced sales and earnings in the first quarter of last year, including the carry over effects of the 2013 supplier recall nutrition, the planning of a plant swept out in EPD to expand capacity and reimbursement changes affecting our U.S. diabetes business.","For the second, third and fourth quarters, while we forecast strong underlying adjusted EPS growth this performance will be partially offset by the significant impact of foreign exchange on EPS growth in each quarter of the year.","This will result in adjusted EPS growth in the mid or mid upper single-digits depending on the quarter over the last three quarter in 2015 as we work through the exchange headwinds that began in late 2014.","Returning to our first quarter forecast, we project operational sales growth in the high single-digit in the current exchange rates we would expect a negative impact in exchange approaching 7% resulting in reported sales growth in the low single-digits.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat about 57% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense somewhat about 34% of sales, consistent with a relatively higher ratio we typically experience in the first quarter and reflecting investments and growth initiatives.","We forecast adjusted R&D investments of around 6.5% of sales, net interest expense of around $30 million and around $20 million of income in exchange gain of non-operating income line in the P&L.","In summary, we delivered another year of strong adjusted EPS growth in 2014 exceeding our initial guidance range and exited the year with strong momentum including sequential improvements and operational sales growth each quarter of the year and significant operating margin expansion. This strong underlying performance and momentum positions us well to deliver durable growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment.","Our 2015 outlook reflects top tier ongoing growth driven by high single-digit operational sales growth and continued operating margin expansion.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.","Brian Yoor","All right. Thank you Tom. This morning I will review our fourth quarter 2014 performance and 2015 sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.","I will start with our nutrition business where global sales increased 9% in the fourth quarter. in our international pediatric nutrition business sales increased 14%. We continue to capture market share with new infant formula products including Similac QINTI and Eleva and which we launched in China during 2014 to further enhance competitive position in our role of end market segments.","International adult nutrition sales increased 13% in the quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business. As we continue to expand the adult nutrition category internationally. Earlier this month we launched our Ensure brand in China.","Although we expect modest sales initially, the adult nutrition market in china represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Abbott. The aging population is expected to growth to four times the size of the U.S. baby boomer population.","In the United States pediatric nutrition sales were relatively flat in the quarter and in line with our expectations. As share gains in the non segment of the infant formula market will offset by lower sales in the weak segment. Adult nutrition sales in the U.S. were impacted by volume and rice dynamics in the institutional segment and by stockists in our pharmacy nutrition business.","For the full year 2015 we will continue to focus on capturing market share with recently launched infant nutrition products and expanding the adult nutrition category internationally including developing a shape in the adult nutrition market in China.","We are forecasting high single-digits growth on an operational basis in our global nutrition business with double-digits operational sales growth in international nutrition. For the first quarter we expect global nutrition business to deliver mid to high single-digit sales growth on an operational basis.","In our diagnostics business sales increased 8.6% in the fourth quarter with sales in emerging markets growing double-digitss. Core laboratory diagnostic sales also increased 8.6%, with high single-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally as we continue to build momentum with our commercial models. We are also expanding our testing menu in order to provide greater value to clinical laboratories and ultimately patients.","In the first quarter, we received U.S. FDA clearance for the first fully automated Galectin-3 for use with our Architect platform. This test assist doctors in assessing the prognosis of people diagnosed with chronic heart failure.","Additionally a study on our high sensitive troponin test previously launched on Architect generated new data that was recently published in the British Medical Journal. The study found that average test can precisely measure very low levels of troponin which may help doctors accurately diagnose twice as many heart attacks in women compared to standard troponin tests.","In molecular diagnostics, sales increased 4.4% in the quarter. Our infectious disease business, which is our core focus and represents more than half of our molecular diagnostic sales, increased double-digitss in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by decline in the oncology and genetics businesses in the U.S. resulting from pricing and market channel dynamics.","As Miles mentioned, in December we received European approval for IRIDICA infectious disease testing platform. IRIDICA is a first of its kind platform that more rapidly diagnosed serious infections, such as sepsis and pneumonia in clinically old patients and has the potential to lower associated healthcare costs by up to 30%.","In point-of-care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 14% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets.","The point-of-care business had a considerably strong fourth quarter in the U.S. due in part to customers ordering Abbott's i-STAT analyzers as part of their ebola preparedness activities. In addition, a major hospital network in the U.S. standardized its point-of-care testing around Abbott's market leading i-STAT platform which also contributed to strong growth in the fourth quarter.","We expect another year of durable performance in our diagnostics business in 2015. But we continue to execute on our commercial model and core laboratory diagnostics, drive uptake of our new IRIDICA infectious disease platform and molecular diagnostics in Europe and increase market penetration with our point-of-care platforms.","At the same time, we continue development of our next generation platforms across all three businesses. These systems are being designed to positively impact patient care, improved service to customers, enhanced laboratory productivity and reduced costs.","For the full year 2015 we expect our global diagnostics business to generate operational growth that is similar to our performance in 2014. For the first quarter global diagnostics we're forecasting low to mid single-digit operational sales growth.","In medical devices, we completed the acquisition of Topera in the fourth quarter. Topera provides Abbott with a foundational entry in the $3 billion fast growing electrophysiology markets. Its breakthrough technology can transform how physicians treat people with complex heart rhythm disorders.","Our vascular business increased 1.7% in the quarter representing a sequential improvement versus the third quarter of 2014 and somewhat above our previous guidance. In our structural heart business we continue to see strong double-digits sales growth of MitraClip, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation.","Our endovascular business also generated double-digits growth in the quarter driven by our Supera peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA. In November, we presented long term Supera data that demonstrate a very strong freedom from target lesion revascularization rate of 94% at three years.","In the first quarter we launched our new drug-eluting stent system XIENCE Alpine, in the US. XIENCE Alpine is the only drug-eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions. We've recently received XIENCE Alpine regulatory approval in Japan and expect to launch in the next few months following reimbursement approval.","We are also making regulatory progress with our bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB, which we expect to submit for approval in the U.S., China and Japan by the end of this year. These three geographies represent more than 50% of the world's coronary stent market.","For the full year and first quarter 2015 we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase modestly on an operational basis.","In diabetes care, global sales in the fourth quarter were down mid single-digits in line with our expectations as the rate of decline in the U.S. is moderate following the U.S. reimbursement changes that were enacted in the middle of 2013.","Outside the United States, we launched our revolutionary new glucose testing technology, FreeStyle Libre, direct to consumers. With the launch of FreeStyle Libre, we expect our global diabetes business to return to low single-digit growth on an operational basis in 2015.","For the first quarter we're also forecasting low single-digits operational sales growth in our diabetes care business. In medical optics sales increased 3.6% in the fourth quarter and 8.5% for the full year. Sales of our cataract products which represent approximately 70% of our medical optics business increased high single-digits globally in the quarter. This growth is partially offset by market declines in the refracted and corneal segments of the medical optics business.","In 2015 we look forward to multiple new product launches across a number of key geographies as well as continued penetration of our CATALYS laser cataract system. The first of these new products, our TECNIS multifocal Low Add premium intraocular lens, which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons will soon launch in the U.S.","For the full year 2015 we expect our global medical optics business to grow mid to high single-digits on an operational basis with more to mid single-digit growth in the first quarter.","And lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, where sales from continuing operations excluding the developed market branded generics pharmaceuticals business, increased strong double-digitss in the quarter.","As Miles mentioned, we completed the acquisitions of CFR and Veropharm last year, but at the same time generated strong underlying performance from our EPD emerging market business. Excluding the sales contributions from acquisitions, organic sales increased nearly 9.5% in the quarter. This performance was driven by double-digitss sales growth across several emerging geographies including India, Russia and China.","For the full year 2015 we expect continued strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of acquisitions as this business continues to expand product portfolios in key therapeutic areas, implements new branding initiatives across the portfolio, and increases its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channels.","Excluding the contributions from our acquisitions made in 2014 we expect high single-digit operational sales growth in EPD for the full year 2015. For the first quarter we're also forecasting strong double-digits growth in EPD on an operational basis including the impact of acquisitions.","So in summary, we achieved our expectations in 2014. Sales growth improved sequentially every quarter this year. We exceeded our earnings per share expectations. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points and we completed several actions to continue to position Abbott for durable growth. As we look ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to deliver sequential improvement in operational sales growth and another year of top gear earning per share growth.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions guys. Let me touch maybe on two topics. So the first and Tom could you talk a little bit more about FX, the impact on 2015 and how should we think about your ability to manage through additional dollar strengthening going forward?","Tom Freyman","I pretty much covered that in my remarks. You know, we talked about 6% based on current rates on the top line and there's about 10% headwind on our earnings growth year-over-year.","Historically as I have told you that follow us know within any one year we've done a pretty good job of managing through what I call normal fluctuations in currency and really it has not affected our performance against our expectations and going forward from this point, something in the major moves have happened. We would expect something similar in 2015. I think what everyone has seen in this season is that there are limits that there are major, major moves, but I'd say anything within the normal levels of fluctuations, we continue to do what we've done in the past.","Miles White","Mike, I would add to that. We may have an unusual mix of currencies relative to what multinationals, for us for example, the euro is not an impact because we just happen to have enough cost, manufacturing, and other things in Europe that it pretty much self hedges. So, as we look forward at the year, we're not more uncertain currencies might be to euro that won't affect us.","We're pretty protected on that. And a rather back handed I guess bit a good fortune I don\u2019t really accept the Rubel to impact us very much because it already did and it already impacted us pretty significantly in 2014.","So when we look forward at the particular currencies that are most likely you know to be volatile or might have risk and I have no corner on crystal ball here to know what\u2019s going to happen certainly no one would have projected any of things that happened this last year.","I think that we are likely or possibly going to see volatility in FX we are in a pretty good position. And so we don\u2019t anticipate it impacting us like a good thumb and we have already had the impact for PN and others and observe that and we are going to the year with a little bit of cushion and contingencies just in case.","So I think we are probably in good places we have ever been in spite of how heavy headwind is of FX in general for all countries.","Michael Weinstein","The strategic question you exit 2014 with the underlying businesses in really good shape obviously not all pieces are doing as well as you would like, but not aggregate and it looks very strong, obviously a lot stronger than it did 12, 18 months ago.","So what are the strategic priorities and in particularly in the context of your balance sheet and what is your balance sheet could like so that you monetize your mile to take over the next several months?","Miles White","Well I assume that course would come up at some point. My first priority is to get the deal closed and you may know that there are several concludes today, but we've had some really good news here in the last week in terms of your approval for the deal and so forth. So I expect to get that closed pretty quickly here.","You know I don\u2019t want to forecast where or what we might be looking at our considering. I do want to add that to business. I do want to add to the company in places where we either want to expand our footprint or can certainly expand the strength of our footprint you know that telegraphing where that might be, I mean as you know I don\u2019t if telegraphs post things ahead a time and yet we have been pretty consistent at the kinds of things we are interested in.","I think we got a lot of capacity and you know presuming that everything concludes properly here with our mile and transaction we have got a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity and I think I want to make good strategic deals that are prudent.","I think that a little more difficulty these days. It's not difficult to be prudent. It's difficult to find a lot of good opportunities and if it fit a lot of price tags up there have very ambitious expectation and I don\u2019t think it has rich robust and emanating environment as we see in other years.","But having said that I would like to still see plenty of opportunities for us to expand and add to the business and just question of right timing, right receptivity on the other side, great values, and finance some overlap.","The good news is I think you want to really add to a sound foundation. And you know, sometimes if you do MNA to patch you know something that\u2019s not working in the core of the company then they will always work that well and we have a lot of disintegration to get through here separating from ABT pretty much concluded get in close.","We have got the same thing where we can work through on the EPD develop market business. You know your organization ready for the integration of whatever you have made do have a bigger or small it may be and I think we are in a good place were the underlying performance where all the businesses is really good.","You are right there is places that I would rather see better commercial performance, but overall very stable and some organization have the other task and distractions pretty much concluded so we could not be more ready and position better with good strong balance sheet. Having said that I know it does not give you any sort of indication of where, what, and when etc, but we are obviously looking something.","Michael Weinstein","And Mile a comment about targets ideally with the cash you are going to have outside the U.S. in the balance sheet as an ideal target would be outside the U.S. and other low shortage of target for you outside the US do you see opportunities there?","Miles White","I see a lot of targets outside the US. A lot of them have a very high valuation and expectations that are you know I think a little unrealistic in some cases, but you know on the grand scheme of things that is just negotiation.","I think there is a lot of I think the external next to the U.S. is in a fashion not quite target rich, but there is a lot of that can be done to expand our business and our presence in a number of key countries.","I don\u2019t rule out the U.S. I think that there is still opportunity in U.S. it's just a lot more selective and obviously financially speaking it\u2019s a lot easier to build cash that\u2019s outside the U.S., where there is a going to be a lot of and that\u2019s a lot easier.","You know under today\u2019s tax regimen so it's more -- probably a more attractive environment and a lot of our monitoring and you know hunting if you will is outside the U.S. The good news is we have been in these countries outside the U.S. a long time.","And we know them reasonably well. You know a lot of cases the kinds of businesses that we are interested in outside the US or family owner or family sponsored a little different environment in the U.S. or European markets, but we are comfortable there. We are comfortable navigating there. We have had a fair amount of experience there and that is a plus, plus.","I think during the last couple of years we have been accomplish some pretty unique and unusual acquisitions I think it was pretty unusual particularly given that we were well into it when the Ukraine issues happened and made it more difficult and I would say, I would path CFO for us to go and back here for having the presence of mind to do this deal in Rubles.","So we were not exposed to exchange on that particular deal. I think it\u2019s a fabulous deal for us long term in Russia and that\u2019s an important market for us and we anticipated that we did not wish for and the evaluation of Rubles we were prepared for it.","So I think there is a number of places where there is opportunities for outside the U.S., but there aren\u2019t necessarily that\u2019s is visible to U.S. investors or U.S. analysts I know you know that, but there is a lot out there that enhances what we are trying to do with the business and what we believe the growth opportunities are where we can leverage the already existing infrastructure we have.","Michael Weinstein","Perfect. Thank you. Mile. I will let some others jump in.","Operator","Thank you our next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If we could just focus on the margins and the underlying performance, what stands out the most to me is just the guidance in terms of the EPS being up 8.5% at the midpoint despite a 10% FX head wind.","Can you maybe just walk through the confidence in the underlying margin expansion, and then also just touch on the fourth-quarter gross margin because that came in much better than we were anticipating.","Miles White","I\u2019ll make a couple of comments about it Kristen. I\u2019ll hand it over to Tom for little more color here. First of all I think we got, we had a head start here, because with the separation of FB as we have said in past calls we took a very comprehensive look at our G&A costs and our underlying costs in manufacturing and other things across the company and we have initiatives in all of our divisions pointed at that for some time and we have had some very good success with improvement of costs and improvement of expenses in the company in a variety of ways.","And I highlighted nutrition and diagnostics as to that standout where we have tremendous improvement in underlying cost structure. The unfortunate thing is that given the exchange rates that multinational have experienced from on and so forth some of that has been chewed up or at least that improvement in our costs and expense structure has protected us from erosion from exchange and it continues to.","Ideally we want to keep improving those costs overtime, which we believe we can, but the biggest costs we have had, has been exchanged and I don\u2019t think that you do see in the top line.","The good news is in a lot of cases we have cost structure and our expense structure distributed among the countries where we have the high sales and profit and so it does offset to some degree the impact of exchange on the sales line. And what we will see is when it hurts the sales line it improves the gross margin.","It is just offsetting so part of the improvement that you have seen in our gross margin is being in the right places when exchange so that we can mitigate the impact on our profits and we got a big head start on that two years ago when we splint.","So we have been well prepared to sort of observe what's happening and it would have been our intent to have much higher earnings but in fact it has observed the impact and kept as a performance level that\u2019s really good, but we could have hoped for more had it not been for that. Tom do you want to give some more color on that.","Tom Freyman","I\u2019ll just add a couple of things recall when we announced the ETD develop market transaction, we said that the underlying growth have rate of ABT was about 2% better on a continuing operations basis and once before so certainly that is giving a little more rooms to our growth than what you might have expected. I think the other thing and it\u2019s a really all about the manufacturing margin, there are gross margin that Miles alluded to.","The last two years we have had relatively flat gross margin and what we have been saying is that has been in spite of the really strong costs improvement programs Miles talked about because the currency was hurting our gross margin, but that was because the year was strong and that was keeping our costs for that particular large manufacturing cost base up pretty high.","But now the year was moving with the other currencies and the real benefit of the real actions in our manufacturing plants and our operations people are really starting to show through the gross margin now that the Euro is matching where the other currencies are going in direction line.","So I think those are a couple of differences that really are the bases for our relatively stronger EPS growth rate in '15 than you might be seeing from other companies.","Miles White","Make no mistake. If weren\u2019t all of us facing some of the currency headwinds earnings would be even stronger.","Kristen Stewart","And I guess just in light of all the portfolio moves how do you look at longer-term growth? Do you feel very well positioned in the mid to high single digit and it certainly sounds like double-digit EPS growth forecast?","Miles White","Well its always our intent to be in that range and do better and I feel pretty good about that, I say this would caution because I would not have predicted the things that happened in the latter half of the year in 2014 and I don\u2019t think there is many people that would have predicted what happened in 2014 toward the end of the year either in what happened with the price of oil, what happened with interest rates, what happened with exchange rates, etcetera. so that\u2019s it all things be equal.","Tom Freyman","Yes I expect that we can maintain healthy high single digit sales growth rate and double digit bottom line growth rate that\u2019s our intense, that\u2019s are goal, we think that\u2019s kind of identity and expectations of a company and so every year at every LRP, every long range plan is sort of built around the expectation of maintenance of that and we have always got sort of long term view of where we believe those growth and share opportunities are.","And I say so far so good I don\u2019t see any reason to accept less.","Kristen Stewart","And just to clarify you said high single digit sales or mid to high.","Miles White","Mid to high. To be clear. I am always pushing for more in reality today mid is pretty good and I can remember when mid was a disaster and today mid looks pretty good and I guess if the market, the world, all of us are doing well then everything looks good, but I think we target that range. If we steadily or in that mid to high range we are going to be targeting high. And if we are steadily in the high range we are going to be targeting double.","It's going to be always wanting to do a little better than may be a lot better than what the market gives you.","Kristen Stewart","Prefect. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you. Good morning everybody. I wanted to start on the U.S. as obviously markets outside the United States were very strong for you in the quarter. But maybe you could just talk a little bit broadly about your U.S. franchises, particularly in the context of what looks to have been a better operating environment domestically, whether it's what we are seeing out of the hospitals or some of the other volume-related companies.","How do you think about the evolution of your US franchise in 2015 and beyond?","Miles White","I think the U.S. first of all very important market, it's such a big market. It's our largest market and three of our major business are large and important here. And one the established pharmaceutical business is not here at all in U.S. I would say it's interesting to me, most shareholders and analyst that I listen to today or hear from will tell me the US is better relative to what.","I don\u2019t think that the health care environment or health care products companies in the U.S. are that much better to be honest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a robust market. I think it\u2019s a reaction to the kind of sudden volatility that lot of companies have experienced outside the U.S. and we tend to like predictability in this country and we tend to like our predictability in quarterly doses.","But I look at the market for long term and I think what the U.S. is a health market, it\u2019s important for products, but I don\u2019t consider it in our businesses a particularly robust growth market and that means as we look at the U.S. our expectations to be in good single digit range and remain profitable and health here, but the real growth even this volatile market a worldwide is outside the U.S.","For I think for health care products, for pharmaceuticals, for devices, for the products that were in I think the growth rates are much better outside the US, we just have to navigate the volatility of that means.","And in that case there is probably 15 countries around the world may be 20 depending on what company you are that are important in varying degrees as growth opportunities market development opportunities etc and if those economies are developing or recovering as the case may be, I think the underlying fundamentals of growth of those market succeed the U.S.","That doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. is best. I think the U.S. is better than it has been, but it has not been particularly good, so better is easy, it's a little hurdle and while we say the U.S. is more solid today, I think the U.S. today is in certainly a growth market it\u2019s just a lot more stable and predictable than a lot of markets around the world. Do you guys want to add to that?","Tom Freyman","No I\u2019ll just say, even as we look at 2015, where in currency side again we are looking growth rates you know 2 to 3 4X what the US is and it underscores minus points that\u2019s where the growth is, but we do see improvements in some of our U.S. businesses in 2015.","Diagnostics is continued to be a pretty good performance relative to the lower growth market and you ADC is now moving better into better territory and we do ask them to new product activity in vascular which can help you grow-up from slow growth market and things like MitraClip and Supera, and XIENCE Alpine are going to help us do a little better in that business in 2015.","But the relative growth rate I just tackle with what Mile said there is no comparison and that\u2019s why we have pursued and invested more in these higher growth markets.","Miles White","I\u2019ll say what is coming in the US and its frankly is a good for any company around the world in any country, but here in the U.S. you are not going to get a lot of tailwind growth.","So you better be prepared to innovate and slug it up for share. And you got to look it at that way that you got win, you got to be the competitor, you cannot just take a tailwind. We got keep improving our products and got to keep putting up better products and gain our share that way.","The thing I am heartened by is when I look across all of our business in the vision in their R&D pipeline and the products that are bringing whether are incremental innovation or may be substantial innovation like Libre in our diabetes care business they are really good products and they really will make a difference and they really will drive share gain and growth.","That actually I look forward to as a real positive here for the next two to five years as we keep bringing out more and more new products. It keeps us and makes us more competitive in markets like the US. Frankly the reverse side of that is in markets where you got a tailwind of growth.","You tend be a sharp in terms of competitiveness because you are getting that tailwind growth and it\u2019s actually a health for us to be both ways and we will get the benefit of our new products and new innovations in all markets.","David Roman","Okay, that's a helpful perspective. Maybe just a follow-up on some of the questions around M&A and strategic vision here. I think the language that you have used in the past couple calls is looking at Reshape Abbott in 2014 was obviously a busy year in that regard.","Can you maybe give us some more perspective on Reshape Abbott into what? What is the long-term vision here given all the moving parts? Are we looking at this as a four-legged stool for a sustainable period of time? Is the mix of business one that makes sense? Ultimately when you are done with that reshaping, what do you want Abbott to look like?","Miles White","I want the foundation we have got. I like the four legged that we have that we want to describe on this four legs. We talked off and on from time to time about whether something is truly a fifth leg or whether a leg four current structure for example.","A lot of people would not necessarily see the brand and generic pharmaceutical business than they are efficient business as related, but truthfully oversees they go through all the same channel, they go through the same wholesales, they go through the same retail outlet, they go through the same pharmaceutical or pharmacies and so forth.","And so they are spreading they are very consumer facing in the markets and targets we focused on and so there is a lot of call it brand synergy and customer synergy and consumer synergy among them. So those are plusses for us.","And we are not in - although than non nutrition business and in a way our brand of generic business we are not fully in the OTC business. But I will use it as a wide example, because, if someone brings me in a opportunity here that say, look, it\u2019s got this - by the way, it\u2019s got OTC, which is rejected with the OTC.","Well you know I wouldn\u2019t in some countries. Does that mean I'm looking for that in order to try to compete with P&G in the U.S., no, I'm not, but if in a country like India, where the overlap of OTX, OTC branded generic Pharma and nutrition is such, that that was a extension opportunity, it would strategically fit really well with our infrastructure in India.","So I would say kind of the pen, and I think we\u2019re much stronger when we can add to businesses we already know and already understand the operating models and know how we can leverage both the business, the brands infrastructure et cetera, much like we are -- we see it far in Latin America.","I want to be cautious not to roll out opportunities that I think are long term expansions for us. I look at medical optics. When we made that acquisition number of years ago, well there was some criticism that -- gee, that's far afield for you.","It isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not a nice strong growth drive for us what I would add to it, I would. If I see the right opportunities, and the right circumstances, so I think the related businesses here, they all have a couple of things in common. They are all in growing markets. They are all innovation driven. They are all durable. They are durable in terms of growth rates and I compare that to the funnel business that we used to be.","Pharma it\u2019s a fabulous business. If you get all the way to the finish line and launch the product, and it\u2019s a risky business, it\u2019s a science so risky with pharmaceuticals. And so it\u2019s a different business model.","Without the pharmaceutical business that particular pharmaceutical business which has been tremendously successful separate from Abbott, we are more of a durable growth company. A lot of people would interpret durable a number of different ways. I think at least mid to high single digit growth I think it\u2019s not particularly volatile in terms of patterns exploration and so forth although it might benefit from IPU like our wise business doing.","But it\u2019s got a certain stability to it but also growth and innovation driven. And I think that the long term identity of Abbott has been to be growth, to be relatively reliable to be real growth and to return cash et cetera to shareholders as it grows.","And that\u2019s been the identity of the company for a long time. I think the mix of countries and products that were in delivers that identity without a lot of harsh volatility. And I think an example would be the environment we\u2019re in right now. If we can weather 2014 and 2015 with what\u2019s happening in the world economies and in the world markets and so forth, and deliver the results we\u2019re delivering, I think we are absolutely living up to the identity of a very reliable durable profitable growth company.","And that\u2019s what this mix of business is, a mix of geographies does. And I think it\u2019s a bit of unique that way. But I think that\u2019s the intent of what we are trying to do whether there is room for a fifth or sixth leg in there, I think it depends. And I think we take our opportunities as they come, we know what we\u2019re good at, we know what we\u2019re not good at or don\u2019t know about.","If we\u2019re looking at some acquisition, or business to add to the company, my first question is, can we add to it? And so we do better because it\u2019s in our hand and I think that\u2019s a critical threshold for us to hold ourselves to as we invest shareholder money.","David Roman","Thank you. I appreciate all the perspective and congrats on a good quarter and first start to 2015.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. I just want to come back to guidance for a quick second. I think the numbers were largely in line with many expectations. But the revenue outlook has been, I think, more bullish this morning. And I think the stock is reacting to that.","Either for Miles or Tom or Brian, thinking about this year, if you can get acceleration, you have more difficult comps versus 2014 as the business improved in the back half of 2014. We talked a lot about emerging market currency but there may be emerging market weakness investors are concerned about.","So, the first question is just what provides the confidence that you can get that incremental acceleration and be very confident in that revenue number? Is it products, is it specific segments? And where does that momentum reside that even in the face of EM and the face of strengthening comps you feel pretty confident that you can deliver this top-line number. And then I have a quick follow up.","Miles Whit","Let me give a couple of comments and I'll hand it back to Brian and Tom to add. There is a number of moving parts here. The first thing that I would say is, we look at the underlying growth of the businesses, some of them are very strong, stronger than you might see, some countries have stabilized and turned more positive - India as an example when it has last year.","So there is some underlying strengths here that comes from a variety of sources, number one. Number two, and there is still somewhat I like to see do better. Number two, there is the lapping of various events or uneven miss in the quarterly reporting. So for example, you recall last year in the first half of the year we were lapping a recall from the prior year which surpassed the first and second quarter of 2014, which enhances the comparison for 2015.","So we\u2019ve got some of that up and down in here as well. We have the launch of some new products. We have two acquisitions in here that weren\u2019t there before that particularly effect the last half of the year CFR and Veropharm.","There will be two subtractions from the company which will also effect that quarter-over-quarter comparison established from developed market business will be out of the mix.","So when you change the mix of the pieces and the growth rates of the various pieces, when it all comes together, it actually looks like what we forecasted and makes sense. It\u2019s just there is a lot of moving parts and I think it probably is not that easy for investors to tease those apart, put them back together and so what it all will -- and I'm very confident in it.","Brian Yoor","David, this is Brian. And I would say, just as like foreign exchange, I think what\u2019s going on in the companies, definitely in different ways. You take for example what\u2019s going in with respect to the price of oil. There were actually countries who benefit from this and you see that pass all the way down through their GDP and also way to the consumer.","And as Miles talked about being a more consumer base company, clearly this has planned out very nicely in the countries for example of China and India who are net importers of oil, we are seeing very good performance by our nutrition business particularly with the launch of the products Similac QINTI that I referenced, as well as Eleva.","Recall, we just turned on promotion there towards the end of 2014 and I would add that China as well, we\u2019ve not only recovered to baseline, we\u2019ve gone beyond share. So for all signs pointing positive there.","Miles Whit","David let me add one more thing to it. Clearly under the circumstances in the last four weeks when so many companies have identified the currency risk that everybody is feeling and the currency hit that everybody feeling and the oil sand that many are feeling and the impact of that on tertiary markets and so forth.","A lot of people are necessarily to report that\u2019s it going to impact their business. And with all that different business, in that environment I would have to say it\u2019s tempting to reset the bar lower. We look at that and said no, we are not going to reset our bar lower, it\u2019s not because it\u2019s hard for us to stretch to do it, if you want to be transparently reliable growth company as we are and we are already dealing with, always adjusting educating our investors about the variety of emerging markets when and so forth.","I think it is important for us to be true of what we are going to do and this is what we think we\u2019re going to do. I mean there was a temptation that, buy a little conservatism here, and estimate lower and beat.","We may bit anyway but I didn\u2019t want to take that opportunities to set lower so I'm confident in these numbers, I'm confident in the earnings projection, I think our mix is different than others, I think as I pointed out earlier, we are just not vulnerable to the euro and a lot of companies are.","And based on the forecast there, I don\u2019t have the same issues. So our earnings turn out where they are.","David Lewis","Okay. Just one quick question. I am loathe to ask another balance sheet M&A question but I am just going to ask it and hate myself the rest of the week. Miles, one of the hallmarks of how you approached M&A was to basically fix exposure. You have obviously had this nutritional asset, which is great exposure.","You've increased your exposure to the part of the pharmaceutical business that you want and decreased your exposure to the part you didn't want. I wonder if you can talk about the consumer more broadly. Is getting access or getting exposure to the consumer, or steam, or something we could expect out of the company in coming quarters and years?","Miles White","Yes, but for reasons different than just exposure to the consumer, I would say we've intentionally wanted to change the mix of the company to outsource sales and profit etcetera that wasn\u2019t necessarily as reliant on government reimbursement.","We wanted a greater mix of patient pay or consumer pay and I would rather ride with the consumer markets than ride with the volatility of say Europe where it's heavily, heavily reimbursement driven and given the economic issues that most European countries in the EU faces, you are at the whim of the next stroke of the pen to cut prices.","So wanted a different mix and we wanted a different geographic mix, we wanted a different balance in how much we're reliant on payers, how much we're reliant on government and how much we're reliant on the consumer or the patient themselves.","So that drove some of the choice around geography and\/or business areas that we believe make up a durable growth company.","We also find that the predictable growth in profitability of countries that are -- or businesses that are more patient pay is frankly more reliable than those that at least for us are susceptible to reimbursement cuts etcetera.","So it doesn\u2019t mean we don't want to in countries that are reimbursement driven, we do. It's a matter of balance. It's a matter of mix. It's a matter of timing have it but not too much.","Brian Yoor","Okay. We'll have time for one more question operator please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a couple quick clarification questions for Tom, and then one product-related question from Miles. On EPS, I just wanted to confirm, the FX hit, the 10 percentage point hit. So, at the midpoint constant currency would be about 235, Tom?","Tom Freyman","Yes 10% of our $0.20, so that's part right Larry.","Larry Biegelsen","And then the contribution from acquisitions implied in the high single-digit constant currency growth for 2015, we have about 4%.","Tom Freyman","Closer to 3.5% Larry.","Larry Biegelsen","3.5%. Okay. And that includes, that's net of divestitures, Tom?","Larry Biegelsen","Divestitures are already out of the numbers because of our continuing operation. So that should be comparable between the years.","Larry Biegelsen","Got it. Then just lastly for me, Miles, on Libre, if you could talk about your excitement for that product, how big you think it can be, and your long-term strategy in atrial fibrillation, a new market for you. I am sure people would be interested to hear your long-term strategy there. Thanks.","Miles White","Okay. First of all on Libre, I am excited about the product. I think it's a great innovation a great product. I think we've had really good customer response and I guess our challenge right now is capacity expansion.","And I would say that's the limiting factor for us quicker, faster, sooner than we expected and so the organizations kept the blow torch going to expand capacity because I think that product particularly as word of mouth spreads among patients is going to be very strong.","I am frustrated with the pace of regulatory approval in the U.S., but nevertheless right now we know the capacity anyways. So it's open to a really good reception in Europe and I expect it's going to be a real positive product for us in that sector.","On the electrophysiology front I don't want to create higher expectations there because everybody is going to tell me we're entering land of the giants and so forth. I think it's a great segment. I think there is a lot of opportunity for advancement of technology there to make a real and improved impact on the treatment of the patient.","People see it as a $3 billion market today. I think it's going to be a bigger market a much bigger market over time and I think there is a lot of room for technology innovation there.","We've invested in not only to play but a number of other companies from an equity standpoint to bring along and we have a long term view of how we want to play in that market which I don't want to detail here.","But we're going to take a run at it and see what can be accomplished there.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Thank you, operator and thank you all for your questions and that concludes Abbott's conference call.

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs.","John B. Thomas","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Today, we'll discuss our third quarter ongoing earnings results, as well as provide new information regarding the separation of Abbott's proprietary Pharmaceutical business into a new independent company called AbbVie.","Joining me on today's call is Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Abbott; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Abbott; Rick Gonzalez, who will become Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of AbbVie; Bill Chase, who will become Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of AbbVie; and Laura Schumacher, who will be Executive Vice President and General Counsel of AbbVie and head of a number of corporate functions, including Licensing and Acquisitions, External Affairs and Investor Relations. Also joining on today's call is Brian Yoor, who will become the new Head of Investor Relations of Abbott post separation. Brian has been with Abbott in numerous financial roles for 15 years, most recently as Controller of our diagnostics division. Larry Peepo, who is also on today's call, will remain Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations at Abbott. I will be moving over to AbbVie to head Investor Relations and Public Affairs.","Today, Miles will begin with an update on the separation, as well as our outlook for the new Abbott. Tom will provide a brief overview of our third quarter performance and then provide some additional context for how we're planning to launch 2 new independent companies in January of next year, including their respective capital structures, as well as annual dividends. They'll also provide some additional detail on our 2013 for the new Abbott.","Following Miles, Tom and Rick, we'll provide an overview of AbbVie and its future outlook, and Bill will cover AbbVie's third quarter results and provide some further context on 2013. Following our comments, as we normally do, we'll take any questions that you might have.","Before we get started, some statements may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the planned separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation.","Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and there's no assurance as to the timing of the planned separation or whether it will be completed. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and the interim reports filed on form 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments.","In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Miles. Miles?","Miles D. White","Okay. Thanks, John. Good morning. One year ago this week, we announced the most significant transformational event in Abbott's 125-year history, our decision to separate into 2 leading public health care companies with completely new and unique investment identities. So today, in addition to reviewing our third quarter earnings, we're going to give you some additional insight into what these 2 companies will look like going forward beginning in 2013.","With regard to our third quarter results, Abbott delivered another quarter of strong performance, with ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 10%. In addition to generating strong operating results, we are continuing to prepare for separation. We've completed a significant amount of work since last October, and both companies are ready to operate independently beginning January 1. Over the past year, we've taken a number of steps to prepare AbbVie to become a new company. We've named the leadership team, designating several senior leaders who will move from Abbott to AbbVie, which will complement the strong commercial and operational leaders who are currently part of our proprietary pharmaceutical business.","As we announced last year, Rick Gonzalez will become AbbVie's Chairman and CEO. Rick has more than 30 years of Abbott experience and has been Executive Vice President of our global pharmaceuticals business for the last 2 years. Laura Schumacher, Abbott's current Executive Vice President and General Counsel and a more than 20-year Abbott veteran, will lead that function at AbbVie as well as a number of corporate functions, including Licensing and Acquisitions, External Affairs and Investor Relations. And Bill Chase, who is currently Vice President of Licensing and Acquisitions at Abbott, will become AbbVie's CFO. Bill has been at Abbott for more than 20 years also serving as Corporate Treasurer and the Controller of the International Pharmaceutical Division.","We've also continued to strengthen AbbVie's mid- and late-stage pipeline since our separation announcement last year, and we've seen impressive progress from later-stage development programs, such as Hepatitis C, which you heard a little bit about earlier this week.","In addition to an advancing pipeline, we understand that investors do seek a positive return while that pipeline continues to progress. As you know, AbbVie generates robust cash flow and is committed to returning cash to shareholders. AbbVie is expected to pay a strong attractive dividend, which Tom and Bill will discuss in more detail later in the call.","So the separation we announced 1 year ago is nearing completion, and our shareholders will soon benefit from 2 fundamentally different investment opportunities with distinct strategic profiles and business priorities. The AbbVie Form 10 has provided some perspective on the pre-separation financial profile of AbbVie and a Form 10 amendment filed last month outlined the AbbVie capital structure and pro forma interest expense.","We recognize that investors and analysts need more information to help them model both companies separately. So as the next step of this process, today we'll provide some additional information on separation-related aspects of the AbbVie P&L, including the tax rate, interest expense and costs for AbbVie to run as an independent company. We'll also provide some other aspects of the P&L profile for both companies. Although it's too soon for a specific 2013 EPS guidance, our intent is to help you establish a baseline for both companies, each of which will have a different profile after the separation. Tom and Bill will cover the profiles for the 2 companies in their remarks.","We've structured both companies for future success and have taken the actions necessary to support the unique attributes of each company. AbbVie will be a large cap biopharmaceutical company with a number of differentiated growth brands, including a sustainable biologic, HUMIRA, and a compelling pipeline. It generates significant cash flow and will have the appropriate capital structure to support strong returns for shareholders, including a strong dividend.","As you know, I will continue to serve as Chairman and CEO of Abbott, so let me take a few minutes now to provide some brief comments on what the new Abbott will look like in the future. As of the 1st of next year, Abbott will be one of the largest diversified health care products companies in the industry. It will be comprised of 4 roughly equal-sized businesses: nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals, medical devices and diagnostics, all competing in large markets and aligned with favorable long-term health care trends.","Our pipeline includes transformational medical technologies, next generation diagnostic systems, new formulations, new packaging, new flavors and other brand enhancements. Our geographic mix is very well balanced, with one of the largest emerging market revenue bases of any large cap health company.","With leadership positions across this portfolio, expanding margins and strong cash flow, Abbott will be well positioned among its peers to deliver top-tier growth. We've made a number of important strides in 2012 to continue to position Abbott for long-term growth, launching our bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB in Europe, parts of Asia and Latin America; breaking ground on manufacturing plants in India and China; completing 60 launches year-to-date across our nutrition business around the world; consistently driving above-market growth in core diagnostics; and implementing a number of geographic and product expansion initiatives in the established pharmaceuticals division, just to name a few.","At the same time, it's well recognized that all of us are managing through a difficult business environment. Like other multinationals that have a significant global presence, we've been impacted by a slowing global economy, both in the developed world as well as in emerging markets. In particular, we saw pricing and market pressures in Europe impact our businesses more significantly this quarter. Foreign currency has also been a headwind on sales throughout the year. This resulted in somewhat lower Abbott sales growth than originally anticipated, yet we continue to deliver on our financial commitments.","While we face the same market environmental challenges as our health care peers, we've structured Abbott to have the right portfolio of businesses and geographic diversity to take advantage of favorable trends ahead of us in health care. So as we look to 2013 and beyond, let me walk you through our long-term growth strategies to provide additional insights on how the new Abbott will generate growth over the next several years.","I'll begin with nutrition, which produces tremendous cash flow and a high return on invested capital. We're a leader in global nutrition, participating in a compelling growth market that's approximately $35 billion today, expected to exceed $50 billion by 2016. It's driven by favorable demographics, such as an aging population and the underpenetration of nutritional products, given the increasing rate of chronic diseases, as well as the rise of the emerging market middle class. Our long-term strategy in nutrition is to drive strong top line growth by building our product portfolio with a steady rhythm of innovative, differentiated new product launches, expanding aggressively in key high-growth emerging markets and leveraging our #1 global position in adult nutrition to grow and further penetrate the market.","At the same time, we plan to significantly improve our gross and operating margins. We've made good progress in the U.S. year-to-date. We've continued to drive double-digit growth of our key pediatric and adult nutritionals by refreshing and improving our brands with products like PediaSure Clear, Similac with Lutein, Ensure Clear and Glucerna Hunger Smart.","Outside of the U.S., we're investing in the product pipeline and the infrastructure, including state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in China and India, to drive share gains in key markets. China is the world's largest pediatric nutritional market at more than $7 billion and it's expected to grow rapidly over the next 5 years. We have ample opportunity to improve our share position in this market and others.","And finally, the global adult nutrition market is expanding as the world's population ages, life expectancy increases and the unfortunate incidence of age-related diseases rises. Our global leadership position in adult nutrition is a clear competitive advantage as we further develop and shape this market.","In addition to driving sales growth, we're improving how we do business in nutrition so that it's more profitable. We expect to improve our operating margin from the low teens in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015. This is something that we've successfully achieved in diagnostics, and we're showing good progress now in nutrition.","We're reducing raw material and packaging costs, improving manufacturing processes and building more efficient plants closer to our customers, simplifying our distribution and ensuring the products, customers and markets that we invest in are profitable.","In 2012, we expect to deliver approximately 200 basis points of expansion in our nutrition operating margin. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our longer-term objective, as we've implemented a number of our planned actions in 2012, and we expect to continue our progress in 2013.","In our established pharmaceuticals division, home to our branded generics business, we're generating international sales from a large and growing portfolio of hundreds of products that have broad use throughout the world. EPD is more like our nutrition business than it is Proprietary Pharmaceuticals. It has a development organization that moves fast to refresh and improve key brands and it markets products to customers in the developing world who typically pay out of product -- out of pocket for their health care.","In many of these markets, despite the expiration of patents, product growth is sustained by brand equity, which is established by customer trust in products that are reliably supplied, of high-quality, affordable and tailored to the needs of each market.","EPD is a relatively new organization within Abbott, in place for less than 2 years now, where we have a number of early-stage geographic and product expansion initiatives now under way. Our long-term growth strategy is to increase the breadth of our product offerings by launching new and improved formulations and registering products across multiple geographies, reinforce our position in the developed markets through portfolio expansion and accelerate and capture new sources of growth by targeting faster growing emerging markets, where we have strong positions. In fact, operational sales growth in key BRIC markets, which comprise more than 1\/3 of EPD sales, increased nearly 20% year-to-date. While austerity measures have negatively impacted EPD sales in Europe, as faster growing emerging markets become a larger percentage of EPD's sales base, we expect to see improving growth for EPD to achieve our long-term target of mid- to high single-digit sales growth.","Next, I'll cover medical devices, which includes our Diabetes Care, Vision Care and Vascular businesses. In Diabetes Care, we're advancing our new product pipeline with products such as FreeStyle InsuLinx, with the goal of simplifying the glucose testing process, and we've improved operating margin with a shift to more profitable channels and customers, streamlining of our manufacturing, better sales force execution and more efficient SG&A spending.","In Vision Care, we are leaders in the refractive segment and #2 in cataract. Our cataract business is the largest, most profitable and fastest-growing of our Vision Care businesses. We are launching new products to continue to grow our share in this segment as well as capture growth in countries such as India and China, where we're introducing new products tailored to these specific markets.","And in Vascular, our growth franchise -- our growth strategy is focused on expanding our leadership positions across our 3 business segments: Coronary, Structural Heart and Endovascular. This includes targeting emerging markets, where interventional procedures are growing double digits, driven by an aging population with a high incidence of cardiovascular disease. Penetration rates in emerging markets are also much lower than the developed world and have the potential to significantly expand with increased awareness and improved treatment of heart disease.","Emerging markets comprise more than 20% of Vascular sales, and on an operational basis, have increased 20% year-to-date. In our Coronary segment, we're focus on expanding our global drug-eluting stent leadership position. This year, we've launched XIENCE PRIME in Japan and XIENCE Xpedition in Europe. Xpedition combines the impressive safety and efficacy of XIENCE PRIME and sets a new standard for deliverability. We are on track to launch Xpedition in the U.S. early next year.","In September, we launched in Europe and other international markets ABSORB, our BBS technology or bioabsorbable technology that acts like a drug-eluting stent but, unlike a metallic stent, has the added benefit of slowly absorbing over time, much like sutures do after a wound heals. The result is a vessel that can naturally flex and pull similar to an untreated one. ABSORB puts Abbott in a unique position to offer the only technology of this kind.","In our Structural Heart business, MitraClip is an example of how Abbott is pushing the transcatheter valve market forward with a first of a kind technology. MitraClip can have a dramatic impact for many of the hundreds of thousands of patients who experience a diminished quality of life from significant mitral regurgitation, which is the leaking of the heart's mitral valve. It's on the market in Europe and we're working to bring it to other markets around the world, including the U.S. It has significant long-term potential, given the number of patients who go untreated today.","And finally, our Endovascular segment represents a significant opportunity for growth. We're applying our expertise in developing best-in-class coronary devices to the faster growing endovascular market. Today, Abbott's underpenetrated in this market that's growing at a high single-digit rate. We expect growth in this segment to improve with numerous new product launches and new indications over the next several years. We're also evaluating our bioabsorbable technology for use in the periphery.","The last of our 4 major segments is diagnostics, where year-to-date, operational sales growth is in excess of 7% and operating margin continues to improve. Our relevant global in vitro diagnostics market is very large at nearly $30 billion. While diagnostics comprised less than 5% of hospital costs, their findings influence the majority of health care decision making. Abbott is well positioned with global leadership in the largest segment, immunoassay diagnostics. We've successfully improved cash flow generation and profitability in our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business and have now refocused our long-term growth strategy on the top line as well.","We're leveraging our global leadership position to capture growth in emerging markets. One of the largest opportunity is China, a nearly $2 billion market that's growing roughly 20%. We've been consistently growing near double the market pace as we expand our share. We're delivering customized solutions that deliver results more efficiently and we're launching next generation platforms over the next few years. We haven't seen market-changing innovation in diagnostics in more than a decade and we expect to lead this effort as we expand our product portfolio significantly.","Molecular and Point of Care Diagnostics round out our diverse portfolio of diagnostics offerings. These businesses allow us to develop solutions for newly identified disease targets, predict patient outcomes and perform bedside testing to accelerate treatment decisions. We're growing both businesses as we increase penetration of systems and tests and expand in emerging markets.","Margin improvement has been and continues to be a key focus in diagnostics. From 2007 to 2011, we improved our operating margin from 8% of sales to more than 18% of sales, more than doubling the operating margin in dollar terms.","Our long-term goal had been to exceed 20% of sales by 2015. We're ahead of schedule in our progress toward this goal as we continue to expand the gross and operating margin profile of our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business.","Year-to-date, diagnostics' operating margin is more than 19% of sales, and we now expect to well exceed our long-term target over the next several years.","So in summary, over the last 12 months, we've prepared both Abbott and AbbVie to be successful independent companies come January 1. AbbVie will be well positioned within its pharmaceutical peer group with a strong dividend and an advancing late-stage pipeline that's getting increased visibility and that's certainly evidenced by the very strong HCV data released earlier this week.","The new Abbott will be one of the largest diversified health care investment opportunities and over the long term, one of the fastest growing. But like all multinationals, we're managing through a more difficult economic environment now. And this year, we're making a number of business transitions that put Abbott in a better position going forward. This includes working through the decline in Promus revenues, initiating a number of geographic and product expansion initiatives in EPD and simplifying our nutritional supply chain. We're making good progress on all fronts.","As we look to the future, we see tremendous opportunity ahead. Our business, the majority of them in leadership positions, are aligned with favorable demographics that will be driving growth in health care. We are well balanced geographically, including a broad base of customers, many in emerging markets where income levels are rising and socioeconomic conditions are vastly improving. And we'll maintain Abbott's financial heritage with robust cash flow generation, upwards of $4 billion and significant opportunity for further operating margin expansion. All told, the new Abbott will be well positioned among its peers to deliver top-tier growth.","So now let me turn the call over to Tom, who will provide a brief overview of Abbott's third quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year. He'll also cover key financial aspects of the separation, including capital structure and dividend for both companies and 2013 financial profile information for new Abbott. Tom?","Thomas C. Freyman","Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.30, an increase of 10.2% over the prior year and above our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.1% on an operational basis, which was more than offset by an unfavorable 4.5% impact from exchange rates. As we saw last quarter, there continues to be a significant impact from exchange on top line results.","Emerging markets remained a significant growth contributor, with sales in the quarter of $2.6 billion, an increase of more than 10% on an operational basis. Regarding sales for what will become the new Abbott businesses, there have been 2 factors that are transitional in nature that have impacted growth trends. The first is the decline in the Promus-related revenue and our Vascular businesses as we no longer provide products under the previous distribution agreement. And the second is the shift to direct distribution in certain international nutrition markets as part of our gross margin improvement initiative.","Excluding these transitional factors, a new Abbott operational sales growth is in the mid-single digits year-to-date. We saw a continued improvement in the adjusted gross margin to 63.8% in the quarter, up 340 basis points from the prior year. Half of this improvement was due to exchange, while the other half resulted from the various margin improvement initiatives we're implementing across our businesses.","Year-to-date, we've seen our adjusted gross margin ratio increase 310 basis points over the prior year, with nearly half of this improvement driven by the effect of the changes in foreign exchange rates on the ratio. Again, the remainder of this improvement resulted from our margin improvement initiatives.","Those of you who have followed our results over the years know that the extreme volatility in exchange rates has both positively and negatively impacted the adjusted gross margin ratio, depending on the year, by as much as a full percentage point or more. You may recall that 2010 was favorably impacted, 2011 negatively impacted, and we are again seeing a favorable effect this year through 3 quarters.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect this trend to reverse, with exchange negatively impacting the ratio by as much as a full percentage point. As we see things today, we'd expect this trend to continue into next year, with exchange negatively impacting the gross margin ratio for both Abbott and AbbVie.","Turning to our full year 2012 outlook. We're narrowing our ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $5.06-$5.08, reflecting growth of 8.8% at the midpoint. This 2012 guidance continues to reflect a full year outlook for the company in total, as the separation is expected to be effective January 1.","We're pleased with our overall performance this year, delivering ongoing earnings per share growth ahead of our original guidance provided back in January, despite the challenging global economy and currency headwinds affecting sales.","Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect reported sales growth in the low- to mid-single digits, which includes an estimated negative 1% impact in foreign exchange. Both our fourth quarter sales forecast and EPS expectations for the year assume that a generic TriCor enters the market in the fourth quarter. We expect a gross margin ratio of around 63%, including the exchange effect discussed earlier.","As we are now further along in our separation process, as Miles indicated, today we're in a position to give you some more information regarding  certain aspects of the financial profiles of new Abbott and AbbVie once separated. While we're providing this additional information today, I'd again note that it's too early in the process for either company to provide EPS guidance for 2013.","Between now and January, we'll continue our usual planning process. While the profile information we'll provide for each company today could change somewhat over the coming months, each company will be ready by its fourth quarter earnings conference call to provide more specific details of its 2013 outlook, including EPS guidance. Those forecasts will reflect the latest assumptions on business and economic factors, including foreign exchange.","As we previously indicated, the primary rationale for the separation is the fact that these 2 businesses have evolved differently and as a result, they have different investment identities. These differences are broad and deep, and they affect how each company plans to structure and run its business going forward. So let me start with dividend policy.","The dividend has always been an important component of Abbott's investment identity. We had previously indicated that we expected the combined dividend of the 2 companies to be at least equal to Abbott's pre-separation annual dividend. And we expect AbbVie to be even more focused on shareholder returns in the form of dividends, paying a larger portion of the dividend.","With this in mind, today we're announcing that we expect AbbVie to pay an annual dividend of $1.60 per share, starting with the quarterly dividend to be paid in February. This, like all dividends, will be subject to approval by the future AbbVie board in January 2013. We're also announcing that we expect the new Abbott dividend to be $0.56 per share, in line with its peer group and growth prospects, again, starting with the dividend to be paid in February and again, subject to approval by the Abbott board.","In the end, this combined annual dividend rate of $2.16 for the 2 companies exceeds the current annual dividend rate of $2.04. And this increase is expected to be implemented 1 quarter earlier than in past years.","Regarding debt and related interest expense, as Miles indicated, last month we provided the pro forma capital structure for AbbVie and an amendment to the Form 10. Consistent with our previous commentary, the pre-separation debt has been apportioned roughly in line with each company's share of the pre-separation cash flows after dividend and capital expenditures.","As a reminder, this rebalancing of the debt will be accomplished by the following actions. First, AbbVie is expected to raise just under $16 billion in total debt. Second, AbbVie will provide a net cash distribution to Abbott of around $8.5 billion. And finally, Abbott will use the proceeds of that distribution to execute a tender for a portion of its debt outstanding and to pay down a portion of its commercial paper outstanding. As a result, the new Abbott expects to carry approximately $7.5 billion in debt as of the separation date, consisting of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. Abbott expects to have around $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet post separation.","As detailed in our earnings news release today and as discussed last quarter, as a result of the low interest rate environment, we expect one-time charges to be incurred in the fourth quarter related to the debt extinguishment cost, driven by higher interest rates on the existing bonds compared to the rates currently prevailing.","The resulting capital structure of each company will determine ongoing interest expense for each going forward. For new Abbott, net interest will be driven by its remaining debt outstanding, including the impact of existing interest rate swaps partially offset by interest earned on cash balances. As you know, interest earned today on cash is very low. As a result, we're forecasting net interest expense of a little more than $100 million in 2013 for new Abbott. Bill will discuss the outlook for AbbVie's net interest expense in a few minutes.","Regarding taxes, we believe that the tax rate for new Abbott will be approximately 21.5% in 2013. We will need to see what, if any, congressional actions may occur at the end of the year or the early part of 2013 to determine our final estimate for the tax rate.","Regarding AbbVie, as an independent company focused on returns to shareholders, management plans to establish an appropriate balance across its global cash flows to provide maximum flexibility. As a result, we expect an ongoing tax rate of around 22% for AbbVie. While this rate is above the historical average for this business, it's reflective of a shift in emphasis from investing in successful x-U.S. growth opportunities in the past to a stronger emphasis on shareholder returns going forward. This rate will support AbbVie's strong dividend policy.","We're also in a position at this time to clarify the profile of some other line items of the new Abbott P&L. Bill will discuss AbbVie's profile in a few minutes. As we see our 2013 sales outlook today for the new Abbott, we expect reported sales of roughly $23 billion based on today's exchange rate. This would reflect growth in the mid to high single digits over where we expect to end 2012.","Regarding the gross margin for new Abbott, for modeling purposes today, we're forecasting a ratio of roughly 55%, excluding noncash amortization, reflecting underlying business trends and the expected impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio I mentioned earlier. I'll discuss how we expect to report noncash amortization expense going forward in a moment.","We expect R&D investment for new Abbott that's in line with the investment needs of our various businesses, which averages out between 6% and 7% of sales. We expect the SG&A ratio to be around 30% of sales for new Abbott, again, in line with the competitive profiles of our various businesses, with ongoing efficiency efforts to generate SG&A leverage over time.","Our outlook for SG&A includes an estimated impact from the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013. Finally, we would expect minimal nonoperating income and roughly $30 million of loss in the exchange gain\/loss line of the P&L in a typical year.","Before I turn it over to Rick and Bill for their thoughts on AbbVie, let me discuss a change in our reporting for next year regarding noncash amortization that will affect both companies.","As you know, Abbott has historically recorded noncash amortization expense as part of cost of goods sold and included it in our non-GAAP ongoing earnings per share metric. This expense has well exceeded $1 billion annually in recent years as we've completed several strategic acquisitions that have reshaped Abbott. The majority of this noncash amortization, approximately $850 million or $0.42 a share in 2013, relates to new Abbott. Going forward, cash EPS, that is, ongoing EPS excluding the impact of noncash amortization, is a more meaningful metric, meaningful non-GAAP metric for assessing new Abbott's earnings power and growth. This is particularly true as amortization expense begins to decline in the coming years.","So beginning with the guidance to be provided for 2013, by January of next year, new Abbott is expected to provide ongoing earnings per share guidance on a cash basis. As a result, we will remove amortization from cost of goods sold starting in 2013 in order to calculate the adjusted gross margin ratio. We will, of course, also continue to reconcile this guidance to EPS on a GAAP basis, which would include amortization expense and specified items.","AbbVie plans to use a similar cash EPS approach as it begins to report independently next year, which Bill will cover in more detail in a few minutes.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Rick for an overview of the prospects of AbbVie, followed by Bill, who will review the third quarter results for Proprietary Pharmaceuticals, as well as the financial profile for AbbVie. Rick?","Richard A. Gonzalez","Thanks, Tom. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity this morning to discuss our strategic vision and outlook for AbbVie. As Miles mentioned, since the separation announcement 1 year ago, we have been focused on delivering strong performance in 2012, as well as preparing to operate as an independent company.","I'm pleased to say we're succeeding on both fronts. Our research-based pharmaceutical business is delivering another strong year, with year-to-date operational sales growth of 8%.","We're ready to begin as a new company on January 1. January 2 will be our first official day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ABBV. Between now and then, we will continue to actively reach out together with Abbott to the investment community at large, through our roadshows, our meetings and our other communications. Our goal is to help investors better understand our distinct investment identity.","Today, we have an opportunity to begin that dialogue. First, it's important to understand that AbbVie is not a traditional pharmaceutical company. AbbVie will blend the stability, global scale, resources and commercial capabilities of a pharmaceutical company with the focus, culture and agility of a biotech, creating a unique biopharmaceutical company.","At launch, AbbVie will have a number of strengths and attributes that will position us well for continued success when we begin trading as an independent company. These characteristics include a track record of outstanding operating performance; a specialty-focused commercial portfolio, with numerous market-leading differentiated therapies; foremost among them is HUMIRA, which will continue to be a significant driver of growth for AbbVie; a strong financial foundation, with annual operating cash flow of approximately $6 billion; a commitment to return cash to shareholders, including an attractive $1.60 annualized dividend, which will be recommended for approval by the AbbVie board, and a commitment to grow that dividend; a compelling late-stage pipeline with several assets that have billion-dollar-plus peak revenue opportunities, including HCV; and an advancing mid-stage pipeline that includes key assets with compelling proof-of-concept human clinical data.","Finally, we have a strong, experienced and highly committed leadership team to drive AbbVie's continued success. Before Bill discusses some financial considerations for 2013, I'd like to provide a high-level perspective on our unique product portfolio and our advancing late-stage pipeline.","I'll start with our current product portfolio, which includes a balance of differentiated growth brands, as well as sustainable performers. We compete in markets that offer significant growth potential and we hold strong category leadership positions in our therapeutic segments.","Certainly, HUMIRA remains the cornerstone of our portfolio and is a strong driver for AbbVie, and will remain so. Not many brands are able to achieve and sustain the level of performance we've demonstrated with HUMIRA.","Clearly, HUMIRA has a strong clinical profile. But our commercial, our development and our regulatory execution on HUMIRA have been outstanding. HUMIRA's performance continues to be exceptional, as evidenced by the strong double-digit growth this year.","Several factors are driving that performance. First, strong patient demand has led to global market share gains in both dermatology and gastroenterology. Second, the addition of 2 new indications for patients: UC here in the U.S. and Europe, as well as axial SpA in Europe. HUMIRA now treats a total of 8 approved indications and 4 more are in late-stage development.","Finally, the global biologic market growth remains strong, and HUMIRA continues to outpace that growth. We expect HUMIRA demand to continue to grow, given the relative modest biologic penetration rates across all market segments, but in particular, the dermatology segment, where biological penetration rates are still mid-single digits.","And while much has been said about the potential changes in the competitive landscape in the coming years, we plan for these factors. We continue to have a high level of confidence in HUMIRA, given its extensive clinical track record, strong product profile and proven clinical performance.","HUMIRA is clearly important to the AbbVie story, and we will focus on growing and protecting this market-leading brand. But our portfolio includes a mix of differentiated growth plans, sustainable performers and a handful of maturing products that we will transition through over the next few years.","Within this mix, we continue to hold market leadership positions across numerous therapeutic categories. For example, Lupron is the leading hormonal therapy for palliative treatment for prostate cancer. Synthroid is the #1 branded synthetic hormone therapy for thyroid disease, and one of the most widely prescribed products in the U.S. AndroGel has strong leadership position in the growing testosterone replacement market. CREON is the leading pancreatic enzyme therapy for conditions associated with cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis. And Kaletra and Norvir remain leading antiviral medicines for the treatment of HIV.","AbbVie is focused on maximizing the performance of each and every product in our commercial portfolio. We've structured our specialty sales force for efficiency and agility, and we will leverage our competitive advantage and capitalize on the market dynamics. This includes continued geographic expansion, where we expect to add approximately $1 billion in incremental sales over the next 5 years from emerging markets.","In addition to sustaining our position within the industry as a proven commercial leader with a strong track record of execution, our goal will be to further shape AbbVie into an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company. To that end, we will continue to invest in R&D at a rate of approximately 14% of sales next year.","As I discussed last October, we're extremely encouraged with the progress of our new product pipeline. We will launch with numerous medicines in mid- and late-stage development that have truly breakthrough potential. All told, across our emerging pipeline, we have 30 compounds in human clinical trials; 15 biologic compounds across several therapeutic areas; 6 ongoing Phase III programs, including several that represent billion-dollar-plus potential; 4 new HUMIRA indications currently in Phase III development, which collectively add significant new growth opportunity for HUMIRA; and 10 compounds or new indications in mid-stage development, including several that will advance to Phase III within the next 18 months. We're focused on delivering truly innovation -- innovative medicines to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need.","Although we don't have time today to detail the entire pipeline for you, I'll briefly discuss some of the interesting mid-stage and late-stage compounds we have in development.","Let me start with our mid-stage pipeline. There are 10 active programs, several with strong proof-of-concept data. I'll highlight 3 promising assets poised to move into Phase III over the next 18 months. ABT-199, our next generation Bcl inhibitor, which has shown strong activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We will present additional data in upcoming medical meeting and we expect to initiate Phase III in 2013.","ABT-719, our novel investigational compound for the prevention of acute kidney injury. It's currently in Phase IIb development and is expected to enter Phase III next year.","ABT-126, our alpha 7 agonist, currently in Phase IIb trials for Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. We expect to present Phase II data next year and start Phase III mid-2014.","Now let me turn to our late-stage pipeline, which also includes 10 compounds or indications in Phase III development.","As I mentioned earlier, we have 4 new HUMIRA indications currently in Phase III trial. Several of these will be unique to the HUMIRA label and will help us further differentiate HUMIRA from competitive products. Daclizumab is our next-generation biologic in development with Biogen for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Results from 1 of the 2 pivotal trials demonstrated strong efficacy and disability performance. Results from the Phase III study, which recently completed enrollment, are expected in 2014.","Bardoxolone is a compound in development with our partner Reata for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, a growing market with few treatment options. The Phase III study, which is an outcomes trial, is now fully enrolled.","Elagolix is a compound in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. It has a unique profile with the potential to provide symptom reduction, while avoiding significant bone loss or other adverse effects that sometimes can be associated with this therapy.","And Duopa is a therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed our Phase III registrational program, and we're on track to complete our U.S. registrational submission by year end.","Finally, turning to our HCV program, where we are making significant clinical progress. We continue to have a high level of confidence that AbbVie has the potential to achieve a strong leadership position in this space. As I stated previously, our goal is to bring to market a potent, well-tolerated, easy-to-administer treatment that delivers very high cure rates without interferon. Data to date confirm that we're on target.","Earlier this week, we released top line Phase IIb data from our Aviator trial, the most comprehensive set of interferon-free combination data in genotype 1 patients available to date. Results in patients who have reached post-treatment week 12 show that our 12-week regiment, which includes all 3 assets in our HCV portfolio, plus ribavirin, produce 99% SVR12 or cure rate in na\u00efve patients and 93% SVR12 in previous null responding patients.","Additionally, SVR12 rates for the other 8- and 12-week programs in the study range from 89% to 92%. Importantly, all combinations were very well tolerated, with an overall rate of drug-related discontinuations of less than 2%.","By way of comparison, current oral antivirals, paired with ribavirin and interferon, for either 24 or 48 weeks, produced SVR12s in approximately 75% of treatment na\u00efve patients and just over 30% of previous null responding patients.","So our results suggest a very compelling improvement over standard of care, achieved without the use of interferon and with just 12 weeks of therapy.","While we're somewhat limited in how much we can discuss prior to the data presentation next month, I will say that we're very impressed by the Aviator results. The data demonstrates that our approach of validated and larger confirmatory Phase III trials represents a significant advance in patient care.","Today, we're pleased to announce that we recently initiated our comprehensive genotype 1 registrational program, with the start of our first Phase III study. We're on track to begin the remaining Phase III studies in the coming weeks.","This global registrational program includes the study of na\u00efve and experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, as well as certain special populations.","We will evaluate 3 direct-acting antivirals with and without ribavirin for 4 weeks -- or 12 weeks in genotype 1 patients. As a reminder, genotype 1 represents the most prevalent patient type in developed markets, including approximately 70% of patients here in the U.S.","Our Phase III triple DAA cocktail will include a co-formulated 2-tablet therapy containing our protease inhibitor, ABT-450; and our NS5 inhibitor, ABT-267, administered once a day; plus our polymerase inhibitor, ABT-333, which is one tablet administered twice a day. We will evaluate it both with and without ribavirin.","We're also conducting additional exploratory clinical trials to determine if a once-daily ribavirin-free co-formulated treatment of ABT-450 and 267 can provide high cure rates in specific HCV populations, providing an avenue for further simplification.","The timing of our registrational study supports commercialization in early 2015, putting us in a strong competitive position. It is our goal to be the first to market on an interferon-free therapy for genotype 1 patients.","So in summary, we have an excellent foundation for AbbVie. We have a strong base of sustainable leadership positions across our specialty-focused commercial portfolio, including HUMIRA, which will continue to drive significant growth; a compelling late-stage pipeline, including several programs with billion-dollar-plus potential; a strong and experienced management team; a solid financial foundation, including strong profitability and robust cash flow; and a commitment to return cash to shareholders, including a strong dividend.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill Chase, who will be AbbVie's Chief Financial Officer, for additional information on our expected financial profile in 2013. Bill?","William J. Chase","Thanks, Rick. It's a pleasure to be here this morning and to have the opportunity to be part of the AbbVie team. To Rick's remarks, you should now have a good understanding of how we're viewing the broader identity of AbbVie. I'd like to take a few moments to expand on this from my financial standpoint. I'll also provide some color on our third quarter results, and then discuss certain aspects of the AbbVie financial profile, which will become evident when we begin operations in 2013.","As we build AbbVie, we're keeping a close eye on what we feel is the most important for the investor. First, a sustainable top line supported by products that are leaders within their categories; second, robust cash flow that will support an attractive and dependable dividend; third, a continued commitment to driving efficient operations; and finally, a financial policy that balances both the short and long term. We recognize the importance of growing the dividend, and we're implementing plans to deliver this, while also ensuring that our new product pipeline is appropriately funded.","I'd like to now take you through how we're tracking against these objectives. In the third quarter, worldwide sales for what will be considered AbbVie increased approximately 7% on an operational basis, excluding a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 4 percentage points. Global HUMIRA sales increased nearly 16% on an operational basis and 10% on a reported basis.","HUMIRA performance in the U.S. was driven by continued strength across therapeutic categories, with particularly robust growth in the germ and gastro segments, where HUMIRA continues to outpace the market's double-digit growth. International HUMIRA growth was 7.5% on an operational basis. This growth would have been higher when normalized for the timing of tender shipments.","Year-to-date, global sales of HUMIRA are up 19.3% and international sales are up 14.5%, both on an operational basis.","So as you can see, we're well on track to achieve our 2012 global sale growth outlook for HUMIRA of low double-digit reported growth.","Moving on to some of our other major products, AndroGel achieved U.S. sales of nearly $280 million. AndroGel holds the leadership position within the testosterone replacement market.","Global sales of Lupron were nearly $190 million. Our 6-month formulation, approved last year in the U.S, continues to perform well, driving share gains and further expanding our category leadership.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were $132 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.","And finally, U.S. sales of CREON were $92 million. CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market, where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts.","We are confident that our portfolio of products provides a strong and sustainable base for AbbVie, generating significant cash flow as our late-stage pipeline continues to develop.","Turning to our outlook post separation, as Tom mentioned, we plan to set AbbVie's annual dividend at $1.60 per share subject to approval of the AbbVie board. This dividend level represents a strong payout and should support a healthy initial valuation for AbbVie, given current dividend yields in the 3.5% to 4% range for many of our pharma peers.","As Tom said, in the coming weeks, AbbVie expects to raise just under $16 billion of debt. After a net cash distribution to Abbott of approximately $8.5 billion, AbbVie will begin operations with around $7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. This cash includes the $2.5 billion of funding raised for future operating and financing needs, as noted in our recent Form 10 amendment.","I'm quite pleased with the strength of our financial position as we start operations. Our capital structure and a strong cash flow will ensure our ability to support both our dividend and the funding of our operations going forward.","Today, we're also providing our current estimates of our P&L profile as we know this will be important as you begin to model AbbVie in the coming months. We've mentioned previously that 2013 and '14 will be a time of transition for our product portfolio, as our lipid franchise experiences the entry of generics. We fully expect generic competition throughout 2013 for TriCor and for generic events to play out during the year for TRILIPIX and Niaspan, and we're planning for this appropriately.","And as Tom noted, our forecast for the fourth quarter assumes the launch of a generic TriCor, and we recommend that you model less than $200 million in U.S. TriCor\/TRILIPIX sales in the fourth quarter.","Given the expected timing of generic TriCor late in 2012, the year-over-year sales and gross margin ratio impacts will be more acutely felt by AbbVie in 2013. As a result, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, including TriCor\/TRILIPIX, Niaspan and SIMCOR, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion next year.","We plan to cover a significant portion of this decline through growth of key marketed products, including HUMIRA. So as we see it today, we'd expect AbbVie's total sales to be somewhat above $18 billion in 2013 at current exchange rates.","As Tom mentioned, AbbVie expects to report adjusted EPS on a cash basis, removing noncash amortization from cost of goods sold. For modeling purposes today, we're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5%, excluding noncash amortization, which reflects the impact of both lipids and some unfavorable foreign exchange.","We're very pleased with our pipeline and expect to appropriately fund R&D investment to drive long-term growth. As Rick mentioned, we expect R&D expense of around 14% of sales.","We expect SG&A to be around 26% of sales. This includes the incremental cost of becoming an independent company, as well as AbbVie's share of Abbott's corporate costs. While some analysts and investors have estimated these incremental expenses at 1% to 2% of AbbVie sales or up to $360 million, we have managed AbbVie's costs to be less than 1% of AbbVie's sales.","This reflects our initial efforts to minimize these costs, and it remains our goal over time to offset as much of the remaining cost as possible through efficiency efforts.","Given our debt outstanding and average interest rates, we expect net interest expense of approximately $400 million for AbbVie in 2013. The gross interest expense, that is, before interest income, was reflected in the pro forma adjustments in the September amendment to the Form 10.","","We're also forecasting minimal other income, as an existing agreement that was previously generating other income expires in 2013. And we expect a tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013, as Tom previously discussed.","As outlined in our Form 10, we expect roughly $435 million or $0.21 per share of noncash amortization in 2013. This is important to note, as we expect AbbVie to provide its 2013 ongoing EPS guidance on a cash basis, that is, excluding noncash amortization for comparability purposes to most of our peers. We will also reconcile this guidance to EPS on a GAAP basis, which would include amortization expense and specified items.","As I said earlier, I'm very pleased with how we're positioning AbbVie for future success, including our overall capital structure, the strength and durability of our cash flows, the sustainability of our on-market products and the emergence of a leading late-stage pipeline.","I look forward to meeting many of you in the next few months and in the coming year.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to John for some final comments.","John B. Thomas","Thanks, Bill. Before we open the call for questions, let me give you a brief overview of the next steps in the separation process. We continue to expect that Abbott and AbbVie will be independent companies on January 1, 2013. This is, of course, subject to the final approval of our Board of Directors, declaration that the Form 10 is effective and other customary conditions.","A few weeks prior to separation, we'll issue a news release describing the special dividend distribution of AbbVie stock, including the distribution ratio and the record date. We expect that when-issued trading of both company stocks to begin in mid-December, with regular rate trading of both companies to begin on January 2 on the New York Stock Exchange.","Abbott will continue to trade under the ticker symbol ABT, and as Rick mentioned, AbbVie will trade under the symbol ABBV. In addition, both Abbott and AbbVie will have separate investor roadshows beginning next month, and we look forward to seeing you then.","With that, Elan, we'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Miles, I thought maybe we'd start with a strategic question. As I think about the DMP strategy or the Abbott strategy going forward, I feel like investors see nutrition as a big source of leverage. They see Established Pharma, and as we've seen this year, as sort of a source of growth. But they have questions on the device franchise. So I guess, how do you see the development of the device franchise? Is this a growth asset? Is it a leverage asset? And what impact do you think M&A is going to play in the development of that device franchise over time?","Miles D. White","Okay. Thanks, David. Well, I'd characterize the device franchise in the following way. I think we are in a transition period. We've just launched a number of new products in our Vascular business, for example. We're lapping our Promus arrangement with Boston Scientific. So we got a number of things that are sort of in transition there. So I look for growth out of the Vascular business. I'd say our -- and on a continuing basis because, as you know, we've established a very strong franchise there with our entire XIENCE franchise. I think we've got growth potential -- tremendous growth potential really with ABSORB and with MitraClip and frankly with our Endovascular franchise. So I expect that to be a growth business, and we simply have to lap the circumstance of Promus and we've got to get our new products launched, which we're under way with. No, I think we've got opportunity there, a lot of opportunity, including in emerging markets. On the front of the Ophthalmology business, part of that is market and economy driven, and part of that is new product launches, which we have a number of coming. And then part of it is expansion into emerging markets. So it's a similar story. But I'd say we're in the \"let's get all the ducks lined up to achieve that and be ready to do that.\" That business has been somewhat disappointing over the last couple of years. But as you know, the LASIK part of it and others are very dependent on economic conditions, and that's really been a headwind for that business. So I look for that business also to be a growth contributor in the future. And then finally, Diabetes Care, I would characterize in 2 ways. One, it's clearly a tougher, more competitive market over time. There's been a lot of price pressure, reimbursement pressure and so forth, particularly from governments in Europe. On the other hand, we've got a particularly innovative pipeline and system of products coming that I think really change diabetes testing for the type 1 and type 2 tester going forward. The first product in that lineup, InsuLinx, is in the market now. And I'd say I've got a pretty exciting product line coming there. So I look for that business to also improve from a growth standpoint going forward. So I'm looking for growth out of all 3. All 3 happen to be in transitional phases right now, but they got a nice cadre of products coming. At the same time, we put a fair amount of emphasis on gross margin improvement in all of them, and we're seeing -- we've seen a lot of margin improvement over the last few years out of Vascular. We've seen it out of our Diabetes Care business. I think all the prospects look good there. But in terms of the evolution of the performance of businesses, I'd say, diagnostics, for example, is ahead of others on those tracks, also with a healthy pipeline of systems that's in development. As I mentioned, there hasn't been a lot new in the diagnostics or Core Laboratory Diagnostics arena in the last many years, actually, several years. And the pipeline of products under development there, I think are quite exciting for us and for the market. And I look at that across the board. I think the evidence from our nutrition and pharmaceutical business, EPD, the expansion in the emerging markets, the number of products that have entered those markets, they are all laying the foundation for growth in what are going to be growth markets anyway. So as I look forward, my expectations are optimistic. I'd say -- from time to time, a number of analysts, including yourself, have challenged us on our market assumptions, and I think that market has been tougher and slower to recover or slower to pick up than I had certainly hoped and any of us had hoped. But at the same time, you got to be prepared to grow through the markets. So I put a lot of attention on our organic or internal capability in innovation, R&D and new products. One of the things I'm quite pleased with as we split the company is that both companies have what I consider to be an appropriate critical mass of spending or level of spending in R&D. As you'll know, over the last 10 to 12 years, we've been steadily, I'd say, restoring or improving spending rates or investment rates in R&D. If you'll note in the AbbVie profile, on the split, they'll spend 14.5% in R&D. If you went back 10, 12 years ago, we would have struggled to spend at that level in R&D. So I'm pleased that with the performance of the company over the last 10 or 12 years and the growth, we've also improved the investment and spending rates in both R&D and SG&A to pretty healthy levels, so that the company is capable of sustaining organic innovation and sustainability going forward, which has been a focus. You asked me about M&A. I'd say M&A remains, from my point of view, only opportunistic. I'm putting an awful lot of our focus and emphasis right now internally. And I think that's important, particularly during the split when we'll have transition service agreements, and we've got to get through the separation and let the dust settle and so forth. I would -- I also never forecast M&A transactions, but I'm mindful that the foundation of the company has to be operating well and on an organic basis. Otherwise, I think we -- well, I think that's what we need to pay attention to. So I don't rule anything out. But I'm not looking for anything big and we're not particularly active. As you can see, over the last year, we haven't been. There are a few categories or areas where we're particularly mindful, whether or not there's opportunities to adjunctively add to the business or enhance the strategic strength of a business. We're always watching for that. We're always tracking that. But I'd say, right now, I don't have anything that I could forecast on the radar screen, and my focus is primarily organic. I know it's a long answer. It's more than you asked for. But I thought it would cover a number of things you'd be curious about.","Operator","Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sort of a similar question to both Bill and Rick. Appreciate the granularity that you provided today on AbbVie going forward. But I'm wondering if you could -- you gave us a good sense for operating margins in 2013. But since, again, this business is going through so much transition with base business not changing much, but facing competition in the lipid business and then new products likely to come to the market 2015 and beyond. Can you give us a sense for where we -- where you see opportunities for operating margin leverage? The gross margin level you said was 76.5%. Where can that go realistically, driven by continued growth of HUMIRA, plus new product contributions? And then how should we think about SG&A and R&D going forward? And then, lastly, just on HUMIRA, Dave, obviously, this franchise has done extremely well. When we think about HUMIRA 2013 and beyond, just wondering what you are thinking internally about tofacitinib. Are you assuming, as I think the market is, a restricted third line label. If it's a second line label, how would that affect your thoughts on HUMIRA going forward?","Richard A. Gonzalez","Okay, Jami, this is Rick. That was a long question.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, I didn't mean to be so verbose.","Richard A. Gonzalez","Hopefully, I wrote it all down right.","Miles D. White","She's getting all her follow-up questions in now.","Richard A. Gonzalez","I think, if you look at our business over the next 3 or 4 years, your perspective on it is correct. We're going to go through a transition period where we're going to have relatively flat to slightly down top line for the next couple of years driven by the loss of exclusivity primarily on our dyslipidemia franchise, and then the underlying emerging growth that we continue to see out of HUMIRA offsets the majority of that. Going forward, we anticipate that HUMIRA will continue to drive growth. Those markets are still areas where we can continue to drive penetration. As you know, the penetration rates, really, across all 3 segments are relatively low and we continue to see uptake of these kinds of products going forward as we expand into more and more patients and we expand geographically. Starting in roughly 2015, you'll start to see the emergence of our pipeline going forward and you'll see top line start to accelerate particularly in the second half of '15. From a margin standpoint, we still have opportunity to be able to improve margins between now and then, gross margins, and we continue to work on operational improvements. There'll be some mix improvement over time, although some of that will be offset by the loss of exclusivity of some products that also have relatively high margins so there'll be a little bit of a mixed bag there. But I think, generally speaking, we're focused on operational improvements in those areas. From an SG&A and an R&D standpoint, as I said in my comments, we have a strong late-stage pipeline. We have a number of assets that are in our mid-stage pipeline that we believe have compelling-enough data, that they will likely be able to advance into Phase III. This is an innovation-driven business. We're certainly going to drive everything that we have that we think could be successful, going forward. So we have a commitment to be able to support R&D at a level that's appropriate, based on those programs that advance. As I indicated, I think, for 2013, you should be assuming in the range of about 14%. On the SG&A front, I'd tell you that, in general, both R&D and SG&A, based on what we know about the industry, we're one of the most efficient operating models. And I think we operate very efficiently in the SG&A area. We're always careful about how we build infrastructure and make sure that we're as lean as possible but yet effective. And so that's an area that we always focus on, and it's sort of an Abbott tradition and we plan on continuing that as part of AbbVie. On the tofa front, I think our read in the U.S. is consistent with what you described, I think, based on the label, that we would anticipate -- on the data that we've seen publicly, we would expect it to be third line. We've anticipated both in our planning process. Essentially, I think, I believe that ultimately, if it comes out behind TNFs, based on the profile, we feel very, very comfortable with how HUMIRA will perform against it. Even if it came out with second line, I think we feel very comfortable with how HUMIRA will perform against tofa. And so we're obviously doing a lot of work in that area. We've done a tremendous amount of market research to understand the positioning of that product and how HUMIRA stacks up against it and we feel confident with how HUMIRA will perform going forward. I think that was everything.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, let me just ask: You were talking a little bit about some of the kind of short-term transient headwinds facing what I'll call new Abbott, post spin. The organic growth rate, by our math, this quarter for new Abbott was 2.4%. Can -- any way you could try and quantify? And if it's tough to do it right now, I understand. Could you try and quantify what the impact was, Promus this quarter and the distribution change in nutritional, so we can try and get a more apples-to-apples look at how new Abbott is performing?","Thomas C. Freyman","Mike, this is Tom. I -- as we did describe in our comments, those were the 2 kind of transitional factors that masked the real growth rate of new Abbott. I'd say, each of those, on average -- Promus is probably in the 1.5% range and the direct distribution is closer to -- approaching 1%. So I -- if you adjust for those, we did have growth more in that 4% range. And as I mentioned in my remarks, if you look at the...","Miles D. White","You're talking about vascular in the books...","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, new Abbott. And as I mentioned in my remarks, if you look at our year-to-date adjusted for those items, we're in the mid-single-digit range. So that gives you a feel. Clearly, we expect, particularly in the nutrition area with -- when these direct distribution plans are completed, that that's going to be a really nice acceleration in growth next year and will be a big part of our ability to move this growth rate up from what you're seeing this year in new Abbott.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And Tom, I want to ask you about the dividend and the tax rate. The -- what you laid out in the dividend is really consistent with what we had modeled out so there was really no surprises there in how you split it and what basically you're forecasting for '13 on the dividend. But you indicated on the call that AbbVie's tax rate is going to go up by about 10 points from where it has been and where the Street is modeling to where it's going to be in 2013, which obviously has a big impact on people's earnings models for AbbVie and combined Abbott, going forward. I think our math on it was that it's about 8.5% negative hit to combined Abbott's EPS, going forward, from that increase in the AbbVie tax rate. So is it that the -- you need to shift that much of your profits in order to support the AbbVie dividend going forward? Is that why the tax rate is going from 12% to 22%?","Thomas C. Freyman","Mike, I think the key thing here is, and it's really the point we've been making from the very first day we talked about this. These are very different businesses going forward, and they're operating independently. And AbbVie -- a lot of the cash flow historically has been efficient capital that we've been able to deploy to a lot of opportunities that have really helped the overall Abbott portfolio and performance. And going forward, as separate companies, AbbVie is much more focused on returns. And it's essential that a dividend gets set at an appropriate level, particularly given the focus on yields that investors have on these stocks these days. So making that a big priority for that company, it was important to rethink the balancing of the cash flows and what would be an appropriate, sustainable level going forward. Obviously, we're -- we continue to be hopeful that, over time, Washington will continue to focus on this area. It could provide additional opportunities for both companies if we move to a more competitive tax system. But the rate at which AbbVie will be starting its existence is a very good sustainable rate given that the profile of the business, the expectations of the investors and what the future holds, as opposed to what was appropriate in the past.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I mean -- so this is a surprise to the Street today and that's why I'm focusing on it because obviously we didn't model it this way, I know people  weren't modeling it. And that's in part because of the comments you guys had made last October on the tax rate. So...","Thomas C. Freyman","As Miles -- Mike, as Miles indicated, it's been a process since last October to provide additional information to investors as we get closer to the point at which investors are going to separately value these stocks, and today is a big step in that regard. Obviously, we're going to be talking to people about the companies as we get out and talk to investors over the next couple of months. And it's important that they have this information and understand the rationale and that it really sets AbbVie up to be very well positioned for its objectives.","Miles D. White","Mike, this is Miles. The one thing I'd say that's clear to us as we've gone through the separation: When you split 2 businesses that do look very different from a profile standpoint and a return standpoint or, frankly, the expectations of investors. One thing I've noted is some analysts and some investors are pretty good at projecting what they think each business will look like, but what we don't want is for an analyst to have to guess on a lot of the parameters that help them model the business because it's so much a part of how they'll value the businesses and so forth. So our intent, both with the amendments to the Form 10 and to the additional information we put out today, isn't to surprise but frankly to take out uncertainty where there's wide ranges of assumptions whether it be about interest rates or interest costs or, frankly, dis-synergies in transition costs or the costs of running a company separately and so forth. And if there's different -- if there's changes, like tax rate, in the structure of the P&L of the company, we want you to know what those things are so you can model. And there's a time when we know that, there's a time when we can finally give clarity to analysts and investors about those things. And when you put them all together, it's our intent to try to take out the -- or the difficulty of modeling each company separately for you and other analysts and investors. But other than that, I think it's just new information today that, frankly, so many of you have been asking for to give you more ability to know what they're going to look like.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I appreciate that. So Tom, what is the payout ratio that, that implies for AbbVie going forward?","Thomas C. Freyman","Roughly -- the dividend, you're talking about, Mike?","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, just given the higher tax rate.","Thomas C. Freyman","Roughly 50% payout on cash earnings for the dividend.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for Rick, first is on the HUMIRA franchise. If you look at the HUMIRA franchise just this quarter, OUS came in a little light. And you mentioned the timing of tenders. But I've got to believe that European austerity is having an impact as well. And if that's the case, is this going to be a headwind for the HUMIRA OUS franchise over the next couple of years? And are there any offsets? And then, as a follow-up on HUMIRA, the patents in both U.S. and Europe expire over the next 5 years, is there a strategy in place that can extend the patents? And then I'd like to ask a follow-up on hepatitis after you passed -- answered the HUMIRA questions.","Richard A. Gonzalez","Okay. So Glenn, on the growth rate in the third quarter, there were essentially 2 tenders that moved between quarters. One moved out into fourth quarter, one moved back into second quarter. If you essentially adjust for those changes, HUMIRA is continuing to run about mid-teens, so there isn't any material impact on HUMIRA. Having said that, clearly, the impact across everyone's business in Europe is being felt with some of the austerity measures that are being taken. I wouldn't say that we feel differently than we felt for the last couple of years. 2010, from a price standpoint, was probably the most difficult year, the most challenging year. If you look at this year, it's in that range but slightly below that from a price erosion standpoint. What we modeled for '13 is close to 2010, so we're planning in that range. But it hasn't had a material impact on the performance of HUMIRA going forward and we don't expect that, going forward. As far as biosimilar competition in 2017 or 2018, which is what you're talking about, obviously, we spend a lot of time working on that strategy. You have to remember that, beyond just the molecule patents, there are a number of process patents that will be important in the process and a number of other things that we continue to look at. And as you know, if you look at biosimilars, it's a very different ballgame from small molecules. We do not believe that it will be an interchangeable kind of or a substitutable kind of product. And they will have to sell based on their own data if and when they come to market. And we believe that HUMIRA's track record will stack up nicely against them. And so it certainly will have an impact, we recognize that, but we think it's a manageable impact and we believe we have a number of strategies to be able to protect HUMIRA going forward...","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So from a modeling point of view, we should assume some generics entering the market 2017, 2018, correct?","Richard A. Gonzalez","You should assume some biosimilar activity, based on some entering the market around 2017, 2018, correct.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up. I had a question on your hepatitis program. So we've seen very good, very strong data from the current regimen, but the current regimen also -- the protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir. And there's a lot of questions out there, whether or not this will limit the ability to take market share because of ritonavir's interaction with other drugs. What's your best guess is as to what a ritonavir booster will do in terms of limiting the market share for your platform? And then, as a follow-up, the data in the nulls was really, really strong and this could really establish you as a major player in that segment of the market. How big do you think the null market would be?","Richard A. Gonzalez","Let me start with ritonavir, and there's obviously been a lot of questions around ritonavir. I think it's important to recognize that the dose of ritonavir in the HCV cocktail, or in the PI [ph] specifically, is 1\/12 the dose -- the labeled dose in ritonavir. So we have not seen any of the side effect profile that people talk about, like GI side effects, lipid profile side effects, in any of the clinical trials. And we've now done a substantial number of patients, as you know. The tolerability in the trial had less than a 2% discontinuation rate and a very low rate of any kind of drug-to-drug interactions. So we don't -- everyone can talk about ritonavir, and obviously, our competitors are talking about it. The reality is the data speaks for itself, and you're going to get a chance to see the data. And a patient doesn't know or a physician doesn't really care whether it has ritonavir in it or not. What they care about is high cure rates, tolerability and ease of use of the protocol, right? And I think, in those fronts, based on the data that we've seen thus far, we're pretty confident about what we have. And I think the data will play out over time. We'll do our Phase III trials. It will be an even larger cohort of patients, and we'll have an opportunity to see that. But there's nothing in this data -- and I can tell you we have been through this data very, very carefully. There is nothing in this data that concerns me, from a tolerability standpoint, with ritonavir. Now I -- oh, the nulls. The null performance is very, very impressive. And as you know, it's -- we haven't seen anything from any other product that even comes close to this level of performance. The way we calculate nulls -- and we spent some time looking at this. It would suggest to us that nulls alone are somewhere around a $2.5 billion to $3 billion opportunity, so they're a pretty sizable opportunity. And obviously, the market will continue to grow as more and more therapies come out there. So we believe that could be a very significant differentiating factor for our therapy. We'll have to see how other data that comes out over the course of time, but certainly, 93% performance in null-responding patients is something that the industry has not seen before.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My question first was on new Abbott. And just not getting too much into guidance, but I was just hoping you could help us think about outlook a little bit in the sense that you've talked about margins impacting -- or FX impacting the margins next year. And obviously, margin expansion is one of the attractive points for that company. Maybe you could help us understand the way rates are currently sitting, how much is that going to dilute the margin expansion next year. Can we still expect some net margin expansion in that business?","Thomas C. Freyman","Sure. This is Tom. As you've seen from Abbott's performance over the years, certainly within a year, currency has been a little bit less impactful to us than maybe some other companies. And it really is a function kind of the way things flow through our business. As you know, sales, when currency moves, that's an immediate impact whereas the impact on cost to sales kind of -- tends to lag through the inventory process. And we've had quite a bit of that this year and some of that is going to carry into next year. And so I'd say, as we've been saying all along on the quarters with the favorability of exchange that we've been pointing out in the gross margin improvement, some of that was a bit transitional this year and it's going to flip back a little bit the other way next year. So I just think it's normalizing. And if you look at underlying, what's really going on in these businesses, it's very quite positive, as we've talked about, in terms of improving the gross margins fundamentally. And I think, once we get through this one-time adjustment, if you will, of getting the margin back to a more normalized level, you'll be able to see the growth of that margin, as we've been talking about.","Miles D. White","Rajeev, this is Miles. I would just add to that the following, by way of background explanation. One of the reasons that exchange doesn't translate from the top line to our bottom line as much as it may in other companies, and other companies frankly do the same thing, we try to put our cost base, our manufacturing, et cetera, also in the same markets where we may experience exchange fluctuation in sales and top line because there's a natural hedge there in cost, et cetera. So for example, over time, to the extent that costs and manufacturing and other things are in some of the growth markets where we are growing and we are putting our plants there, et cetera, for the products that we will sell there, there's a natural hedging there that helps mitigate the top line impact of exchange down to the bottom line. So some years, that's a plus for us on the margin line. For this -- for example, this year, while the -- while the top line is experiencing negative exchange, the gross margin line is experiencing positive exchange. Important to point out, though, that on that gross margin line, it's not all exchange. It -- there's a big chunk of that improvement in the gross margin line that is actually actions taken to improve our cost structures or mix and whatever the case may be. So if exchange improves on the top line next year, as Tom says, that'll have a dampening effect on the continued improvement of gross margin. But we expect to continue to improve, from our own actions, the gross margin line. It just won't benefit from an extra boost from exchange, so it's kind of a mitigated thing both ways. If -- at the end of the day, what we're looking to do in the way we structure our own approach to exchange is to mitigate its volatility on the bottom line.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, no, thanks for that. I think, clearly, what's important is what happens on an underlying basis, but it's just helpful to have expectation in the right place as far as the numbers go, I thought. I did have a follow-up on nutritionals. I guess the growth there was a little bit lighter than what we were looking for in pediatric. And I know you talked about some of the distributor issues, but those are obviously things that you've known for several quarters. Maybe just particularly on x U.S., if you could talk about if any of the underlying market dynamics have changed materially this quarter and if you're thinking about the markets there any differently than you have been in the past.","Miles D. White","Well, I'd say a couple of things, then I'm going to let Tom weigh in here too. There aren't really distributor issues. There's one circumstance, fairly significant, where we bought out the distributor and there's an adjustment we're going through while we let that inventory wind down and come -- and the sales wind down and come back into our own system. It -- when -- we're -- in effect, we're going direct in a lot of our markets and some of our significant ones overseas. So there's a transition there as you do that. It clearly is dampening. And it's not an issue per se, it's a deliberate action on our part to go more direct for a lot of favorable reasons. Tom?","Thomas C. Freyman","I guess I'd just say that, really, the items we noted on the distributor changes are the kind of the drag on what one might expect. And we do expect in the fourth quarter upper-single growth in this business. So you're going to see a better rate, we believe, in the fourth quarter, and we think it's even got better potential in 2013. So I think, once we get through this transition, you will feel confident that those types of growth rates are possible for this business and we plan to deliver on them.","Miles D. White","I mean, you asked if there's an underlying fundamental downshift in some way, not that we see, no. No, we're not looking at that or expecting that.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Emerging market growth this quarter, it was over 10%, so -- and it was 12% last quarter, so it seems like it's in that 10% to 12% range. Is that a realistic rate, going forward? And maybe if you can talk about AbbVie versus Abbott, if there's differences there. And then I just had one follow-up.","Thomas C. Freyman","Well, certainly, in the quarter, and then -- and we said this in the October meeting last year and throughout, emerging markets is much more a part of the story and a much more important part of the growth opportunity on the Abbott side. And in fact, in the quarter, even though overall company grew double digits, it was stronger on the Abbott side and a little bit below that on the AbbVie side. So it clearly is a more important part of the story now. That said, I think, AbbVie, and we've said this also, does see opportunities there. And I think somewhere in the range of $1 billion of growth in emerging markets over the 5-year period is still a part of their story. But clearly, the performance is much -- was better in the quarter on the Abbott side and really is a bigger part of the story. The other thing I would say is some of the tenders that Rick talked about when he was talking about HUMIRA also tended to dampen down AbbVie in the third quarter, and I think that is a bit transitional.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then that -- one for Miles. At the analyst meeting last October, you laid out some goals for the new Abbott to grow high single digits and EPS at a double-digit rate. Today, you're saying you can grow mid-single digits in 2013. Could you give us a little bit of an update on kind of the long-term goals for the new Abbott and why maybe next year is mid-single digits versus your original high-single-digit goal?","Thomas C. Freyman","That's mid to upper, Larry. I just wanted to clarify.","Miles D. White","Larry, I'd say this. There's no difference in our long-term goals at all, or even our long-term expectations. I think there's a number of things that are different now than last year but only relatively speaking. So for example, I'd say, right now, in 2013, I'm looking for mid- to high single digits. And I think, at that meeting last year, I distinctly remember at least one of you, if not a couple of you, were more cautious about economy, et cetera, going forward, and you proved to be right. I'd say, right now, the difference in my outlook is more about market conditions than anything else and how slow a recovery in a number of markets around the world will come. I think that the biggest change that I see is slower market growth rates in emerging markets. But I'm cautious about how I describe that because, when people in general look at China, and this is any company that's doing business in China today, not necessarily in health care and medical products, people say, \"Gee, the Chinese market's really slowed. It was at 9%, now it's at 7%.\" Well, slow is a relative term. 7% looks pretty attractive, as a matter of generality, compared to developed markets and a lot of developing markets. But I'd say that the underlying market growth rates in a number of the economies around the world are slower, particularly in emerging markets, than we might have originally expected, and I think all industries are experiencing that right now. And then, who knows whether these things will recover as fast as everybody would like or not. The whole world now is pretty interlocked so that, if the developed markets are slow, it does roll back into a number of the developing or emerging or growth markets. So single biggest difference, I think, in our outlook is the underlying market growth rates or expansion rates, which I think, in relative terms, is a more near-term thing than a long-term thing. I think all those markets overseas that we view as growth markets are growth markets for the long term, and my expectations are high-single-digit top line for the long term and mid to high in the nearer term. Our goals haven't changed, but we just -- we have to be realistic about the underlying market conditions. Our objective is to do better than market in any circumstance so that we're growing and gaining share, et cetera, in our targeted geographies and targeted segments of the business. So I'd say there's no change to my expectations. There's a change to my assumptions about the conditions in which we operate. That affects exchange too, although we all understand exchange. I mean, I think the biggest change or surprise to my own expectations for the year was the exchange impact from growth markets. Historically, with AbbVie as part of Abbott, Europe is a huge part of exchange for us. That's less true for new Abbott going forward. It's much more a market basket of a lot of currencies around the world, which is different, and a lot of those currencies have performed differently this year. So I think a lot of this is adjustment to conditions. And frankly, I think our underlying expectations, which are generally driven by our own performance, the new products we bring to market, the share we gain, the market opportunities we access, I have -- there's no change in my expectations about those.","Operator","Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions on Hep C. Rick, you commented, with respect to the very good data, the very good 12-week data in genotype 1, that you would be the first in the market in 2015 against genotype 1. And I'm curious if that statement was correct, as I wrote it down. And second, what is your -- AbbVie's expectations with respect to the competition being in the market at what time? And then the second question around Hep C is around nulls. You did provide some commentary around the market and that's very helpful. Although, I'm curious, and I seem to recall that the null data that has been presented is without cirrhotics. Is that correct? And then I have one financial follow-up.","Richard A. Gonzalez","Okay. As far as the nulls are concerned, it is without cirrhotics, that is correct. We're going to do a cirrhotic trial now. So it's nulls without cirrhotics. As far as the timing, you heard the comment correct. We do anticipate that if we hit the window of early 2015, based on how we've modeled out time lines for competitive products, it would suggest to us that, that could be the first product to enter the market for genotype 1. There may be products that enter the market for genotype 2 and 3 prior to that, in fact I think there could be in all likelihood, products that enter the market after that. Now, that's based on a set of assumptions that we're making that essentially are based on our competitive intelligence of how long we think trials would take to be able to start up. I can tell you, all of this recognized, that this will be a race to get to market. And we anticipate early in 2015 is the time frame that we should be able to hit. And based on what we know today, we're assuming that, that would be first to market. But we'll have to see how it plays out over time.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, sir, I understand the race all too well. The one financial question, that was around AbbVie's debt-to-EBITDA. Are you happy with that debt-to-EBITDA, at least in the short term? I.e., would you take excess cash beyond the dividend to pay that debt down? And if not, does the high tax rate really imply a fair level of repatriation of capital? And that is again for AbbVie.","William J. Chase","So Tony, what we've done is we've structured AbbVie with what we think is a very strong, responsible balance sheet at the onset. As cash is generated, yes -- I mean, I think one of the priorities we would have is we balance our cash. And we do look at it as an exercise in balancing between returning to shareholder, funding the business, but one of the other items is ultimately paying down debt as well. And we would look to do that when we have maturities through the next couple of years. In regards to the need to repatriate, I think, if you look at AbbVie, we've got a pretty strong balance sheet. We've got $7 billion of cash, starting out. The 22% tax rate will allow us to appropriately balance geographic cash flows between our needs and our uses. And so I don't think any additional repatriation would be necessary.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","One part of capital allocation you haven't discussed yet for either AbbVie or Abbott is share repurchases. Can you just outline any thoughts that you have there?","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, I mean, both companies do anticipate continuing their share repurchase programs. As you are aware, Abbott's been more active this year than we have been in the last couple. And the specific of that, each company is going to have to talk about it at future dates.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question. Our next question is from Danielle Antalffy.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just if I could focus in for the legacy of the Abbott device business. On the Vascular side, one of -- another cardiovascular company just this morning talked about pressure, cardiovascular procedure volumes in Europe. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what you guys are seeing over in Europe and how that could be impacting stent sales, going forward.","Miles D. White","Well, I think -- I don't know what the other company said this morning, Danielle, but we are seeing a definite pressure on PCI volumes, or procedure volumes and so forth and procedure rates. The -- what we see -- and I think it depends on what geographies you're in. For us, the pressures in Europe are somewhat offset by the growth in procedures in developing markets or growth markets, other markets. But I think, for some time, at least for the near term, we can expect to see some continued pressure on Europe, perhaps the U.S.","Danielle Antalffy - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then just again on the Vascular business. Evalve, I wasn't there, but talked to a few docs that attended the ESC meeting, and it sounds like there's more excitement being drummed up for the MitralClip. Just wondering what your status is on that filing here in the U.S. And should we view this business any differently after hearing some more positive data points coming out of the ESC meeting in August?","John B. Thomas","Yes, Danielle. So we're -- in the U.S., we're still hopeful for a panel probably in early part of next year in the first quarter. That's the latest thinking, okay?","All right, thank you.

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","And I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. ","Scott Leinenweber","Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.","Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.","Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott's medical optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017, as well as current and prior year sales for Alere which was acquired on October 3, 2017.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay. Thanks, Scott, and good morning. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.75 along with sales growth of approximately 8% on an organic basis, reflecting well balanced growth across all four of our businesses. I'm particularly pleased with the continued productivity of our new product pipeline and would like to highlight a couple areas where our products are creating and fundamentally shaping markets. ","I'll start with Structural Heart, where we're the world or the global leader in minimally invasive treatments for mitral regurgitation or a leaky heart valve. We've recently made several significant advancements in this area. ","In July, in U.S., we initiated a pivotal trial for Tendyne, our device that is designed to replace damaged mitral heart valves without the need for open heart surgery. We also received U.S. FDA approval for our third generation version of MitraClip, our market leading device for the repair of mitral heart valve. And in September, we announced results of our landmark COAPT trial, which demonstrated that MitraClip improves survival and clinical outcomes for patients with functional mitral regurgitation, the most prevalent form of this condition. We expect to submit this study data to the U.S. FDA in the coming weeks to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. These advancements will further enhance and strengthen our leadership position in this large and highly underpenetrated disease area and will bring new therapies to patients for effective treatment options that are currently limited. ","Diabetes Care is another area where our technologies are making a big impact, specifically FreeStyle Libre, a revolutionary glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine fingersticks. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for a 14-day sensor with a shorter one-hour warmup making Libre the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available. ","And in Europe, we obtained CE Mark for our FreeStyle Libre 2 system, our newest generation 14-day system, with optional real-time alarms. In a relatively short period of time, FreeStyle Libre now has more than 1 million users across the globe, a testament to the mass market appeal of this product, which is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease. ","I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning call over to Brian. I'll start with Diagnostics, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments is achieving accelerated growth and strong competitive win rates in Europe where more than 50% of our Alinity instrument placements thus far are coming from share capture. The global rollout of Alinity positions this business for a consistent above market growth for years to come as we capture share and bring the full suite of systems to additional geographies including the U.S. ","In Rapid Diagnostics, third quarter sales were driven by cardiometabolic testing. We just completed the first year anniversary of our acquiring this business and we're pleased with the progress we've made to position ourselves for growth and margin expansion going forward. ","In Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales were led by double-digit growth in several geographies including Russia and China. As expected, sales growth in the quarter was impacted by a difficult comparison versus the prior year when we saw channel restocking across the market in India following implementation of a new tax system in that country. Our unique branded generics business focused specifically on key emerging markets continues to execute its strategy and grow faster than the market in several of our priority countries including India and China. ","In Nutrition, sales increased 6% in the quarter, led by strong performance in our international business. In Pediatric Nutrition, global growth was well balanced across infant and Power of Nutrition as well as above market growth in US and double-digit growth broadly across our international markets. And in Adult Nutrition growth was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands, most notably internationally, where we achieved 7% growth overall in Adult Nutrition.","Lastly, I'll cover our results for Medical Devices, where sales grew 10% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. In Electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by double-digit growth across our heart mapping and ablation portfolio as well as Confirm, the world's first and only smartphone-compatible insertable cardiac monitor. ","In Structural Heart, we achieved strong growth across several areas of our portfolio including more than 20% growth of MitraClip and double-digit growth of AMPLATZER PFO, our minimally invasive device that plugs life threatening holes in the heart.","And in Diabetes Care, sales grew 40% in the quarter, led by FreeStyle Libre which achieved sales of over $300 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 100% versus the prior year. ","So in summary, this was another very good quarter, with all four businesses contributing to strong growth overall. Our pipeline continues to be highly productive, including significant recent advancements in Structural Heart and Diabetes Care that are creating and shaping markets. ","And lastly, we're forecasting EPS and organic sales growth at the upper end of the range as we said at the beginning of the year.","I will now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. ","Turning to our results, sales for the third quarter increased 7.8% on an organic basis. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired late last year and is therefore not included in our organic sales growth results, achieved sales of the $481 million. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.7% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies resulting in a larger unfavorable impact on our results this quarter compared to the expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in July. ","Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.7% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018, we forecast organic sales growth of approximately 7%, at the top end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. At current rates, we expect exchange will now have a slightly negative impact on full year reported sales. ","In addition, we continue to expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5% of sales, which includes underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales. ","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.80 to $0.82. We forecast organic sales growth of mid to high single-digits. And at current rates, would expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 3% on reported sales. ","In addition, we expect Rapid Diagnostics to contribute sales of around $500 million in the fourth quarter, which as I previously mentioned, is not included in our organic growth rate this year. ","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide an overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid single-digit sales growth, which reflects a difficult comparison in our non-core other business segment relative to the fourth quarter of last year when sales increased strong double-digits. ","In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid to high single-digit sales growth. And in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth, which reflects double-digit growth in several areas of this business. ","With that, we will now open the call for questions. ","Scott Leinenweber ","Operator, we will now open the call. ","Miles White ","Operator? ","Scott Leinenweber ","Operator? Operator, are you there?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. ","David Lewis ","[Question Inaudible].","Miles White","We cannot hear the question, operator. ","Operator","Please check that your line is on mute.","David Lewis","Can you hear me now? ","Miles White","Yes.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you. So Miles, two questions for you. Obviously a lot of business momentum here in 2018 and meaningful drivers ahead like Libre 2 and MitraClip. So as you think about sort of sustainability, is sort of 6% to 7% range is sustainable over the intermediate term and how you think about Abbott\u2019s ability to deliver double-digits or low-teen earnings given the currency environment and all these various opportunities to grow?","Miles White","Okay. Thanks, David. Let me take the first part of that. Yes, sort of definitively and absolutely, yes, on the sustainability of earnings and better sales top-line and I\u2019ll get to earnings in a minute. In that 6% to 7% range, I\u2019d say yes, and frankly I\u2019m even looking at 7% and better. But if we look at the underlying momentum of each of these businesses today and the underlying growth of each of these businesses, there\u2019s actually some places I think it could get better, there\u2019s places we\u2019re obviously trying to improve. I wouldn\u2019t forecast it yet, but I still see plenty of growth, plenty of opportunity frankly with the new product pipeline for years to come. And you\u2019re seeing the evidence of that right now in the performance of all the businesses. The Diagnostics business growth rate has clearly turned up, that is clearly the impact of Alinity taking hold. It\u2019s having great success in Europe. Libre is doing super well. And on top of that, we haven\u2019t really put a lot of promotional emphasis behind it. So I see a strong future for both of those. ","The new product cadence coming out of Medical Devices is really good. And frankly, we expect another approval imminently here in the US. So I think that in terms of sustainability at top-line, I feel very good about that, I feel really very good about the underlying growth of the company, the sustainability of it et cetera. The little elephant in the room is just clearly exchange and I think that\u2019s true for practically every multinational out there. I think all of us, all investors, all companies doing business in international markets are experiencing the upturn in exchange now, and frankly, a bit of uncertainty about how long it lasts. Because every time we enter a new year we kind of think we've got a notion of what exchange in currency and so forth it's going to do. And it never last the entire year. We always see a change once or twice during the year. And some of that\u2019s just driven by new; some of it\u2019s driven by a trade talk and other things. But it's -- I think for all of us it's a little hard to forecast. So we see that in the third quarter, we\u2019ve seen a tick-up in currency impact. We're clearly moving into a headwind here. We'll see that in the fourth quarter. And I think that's going to continue into next year. The question is how far into next year and how heavy is that headwind? ","And in our case, we look at the overall businesses. And with the underlying growth rates, the underlying strength of the business is really strong. And we've been able historically to absorb exchange, mitigate exchange, yield exchange et cetera and be a very reliable performer for our investors. And that's always our goal. We always start the year with a double-digit earnings goal every year. And it's the rare year when we don't achieve that, hit it or exceeded. And this is no different. I think right now we're a few months ahead of next year. And a lot always happens in the first quarter. So we don\u2019t have any way to reliably tie down what we think currency is going to do. I don't think anybody does obviously. I know that it will be a headwind starting out what happens from there who knows? But we're go into the year looking at double-digits and with underlying growth like we have in all of our businesses, I'd say that was pretty solid. ","David Lewis","Okay, Miles, very clear. And second just follow-up through for you is just, can you help us put the Robert Ford announcement and the perspective and sort of share your thoughts on what it means for you over the intermediate term?","Miles White","What it means for me over the intermediate term is like a lot more help, which I'm happy about. Look, it's obviously a success in step. And one of the things that I think any good leader has got to do with his company is make sure that there is always good strong succession building growing et cetera in the company. And that applies to me too. So I think for the continuity of the performance of this company, the continuity of its strategy, the continuity of its sustainable growth rates and so forth going forward, that's important. Robert Ford has been in this company in his entire year. I've known him 22 years and paid a lot of attention in his careers to my imagine. And he's been an excellent operator, he's handled our entire St. Jude integration, done a terrific job with Medical Devices and consequently I want all of those medical device businesses continuing to report directly to him, even if he takes on more responsibility. And I'd say with time this will develop pretty nicely. And I think it's a very good strong move for the company. ","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Robbie Marcus","Oh! Great, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on a great quarter. Miles, I wanted to ask you about COAPT. A lot of us were at the TCT conference in San Diego last month and saw the great data there, too a room of standing ovations which we don't see in medical devices that often. So us on the street we can think about big numbers with such a large patient opportunity. Maybe tell us how you're thinking about MitraClip over next years and how you think the street should be thinking about it?","Miles White","Well, I will tell what, obviously the performance of MitraClip in that study was a real homerun. And it's not often that studies are so definitively positive and still good in terms of their impact for patients. So we're obviously very happy about that and very proud of that. Our objective will be to move through the regulatory processes as rapidly as can be done and make it available for use as rapidly as we can. I think the medical community sees tremendous medical benefit in that. And when you can make that kind of a difference, it's obviously big, important, good thing. And how rapidly we go through that regulatory process? Hard to predict. We have not got a lot of -- well, we don't have any particular impact for next year in our roadmap for next year at this point for any impact from that product. So, anything that happens is upside. And obviously beyond that, I think it's got a pretty sizable opportunity. And it's not a broad mass market product, but the number of patients that will benefit from the product is significant. And so I think it will clearly make a difference in the overall performance, the company's medical device business, the company et cetera. It's not one that's going to get lost in around there I can tell you that. Scott, if you want to add anything to that? ","Scott Leinenweber","No, that's fair, we will submit, as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks, to the FDA in the coming weeks and after that it's in their hands and we\u2019ll let that process play out.","Robbie Marcus","Okay, great. And maybe a follow-up on Libre. This is a product that's been widely successful, over 100 million run rate in the US, over 1 billion globally. And you really have one major competitor here that's -- let's call it at the upper end of the technology scale. And Abbott in our view is the low cost, easy to access, very easy to use product in continuous glucose monitoring. So, as we think about the evolution of Libre over the next few years, how do you think about Libre staying at the lower end of the cost and ease of use curve versus moving up and trying to compete with your main competitor there? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I'll tell you, interestingly enough, I don't actually look at it the way you just described. I think Libra is pretty different product. It's got tremendous capability, but given that value point that we have it priced at, it is accessible to patients all over the world. And when we first launched in Europe, we launched without any government reimbursements. And for the first time glucose monitoring was patient pay. And it had widely great acceptance just on that basis, which actually encouraged governments to reimburse the product. So I think with healthcare today, a lot of things that come to market are very expensive, whether they are pharmaceuticals or devices. And in this particular case, it was important that this have a medical and an economic value proposition that made it accessible to all patients or as many as possible. And there's 10s of millions of diabetes patients out there. Obviously there's Type 1s and insulin-dependent patients and there\u2019s Type 2s trying not to be. And so the product has a much broader appeal across a much broader patient base. And in our case, we have a much lower cost and far greater automated manufacturing capability to not only allow that cost, but to allow for mass production. And that\u2019s the path we\u2019ve taken. And we\u2019ve gone at this from an access standpoint that\u2019s far more retail and direct-to-consumer oriented, it\u2019s made a big difference. ","So I\u2019d say, at this point, we\u2019re making healthy profits on this product. We have no intention of changing the value proposition at all. And your question sort of suggests that we would raise price in order to be competitive, I\u2019d say, you want to be asking the other side, what they\u2019re going to do to make themselves a value proposition, because this product is incredibly good value proposition, which is why it\u2019s got such high demand. And to be honest, we don\u2019t even measure ourselves relative to any competition including fingerstick at this point. We know how many potential patients there are out there and it\u2019s our intent to capture the vast majority or possible -- maximum of them that we possibly can in just a few years. So I look at Libre right now and a lot of people call it wild success. I kind of think we\u2019re just getting started. And we\u2019re investing heavily in capacity to allow even more rapid expansion. And people will say, well, how do you model that? I think I\u2019m not sure we can model it, it\u2019s that good. So I\u2019d tell you, you probably need to think about this a little differently in terms of value proposition and kind of access that affords. And I think the future in healthcare kind of demands that from us, from all companies. ","There are certain products, obviously their small volume, their niche medical treatments and so forth that are costly to develop, costly to make and provide and so forth. But there\u2019s others that have much broader impact and much broader appeal. And part of the future of healthcare and the necessity for companies like ours is making those things is broadly accessible as possible. And we still obviously have to earn a return and I can assure you we\u2019re making a nice healthy return on Libre. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","So two quick questions. First a product question and then an earnings growth question. On the product side, obviously, the context here is that Abbott is a company delivering absolutely top of class revenue growth. But one thing in the quarter that I want to ask about was, neuromodulation that was a little slower like the last quarter. I am just curious, has your outlook for that business changed at all, or is this just still temporary hiring issues and when do you think you can return to more like double-digit growth in that division? ","Miles White","I think it\u2019s more of the same from last quarter and I do think this is temporary. I think it\u2019s going to take us a couple of quarters for work-through. Let\u2019s call it commercial execution issue we have and you don\u2019t fix that overnight, but we will fix it and fix it in the near-term and I do think that this is a business that should return to double-digit growth. So I can look at that as something that gets better for us. It was obviously very strong last year. It hit still a stall point during this year. But I do think that upside is there and it\u2019s strictly in our hands at this point. So yes, I\u2019m pretty optimistic about it. Do you go to bed happy about it? No. Can you fix it? Yes. And we are.","Bob Hopkins ","Okay. Two other quick little things. What was the US -- imminent US product approval you guys were highlighting in your prepared remarks? And then I also want to just follow up really quickly on David's question on earnings growth. And I realize you start every year at 10%. The street is modeling roughly 12% earnings growth for really the next couple of years. Given all the puts and takes, is that a reasonable place to start or could currency make that a little challenging? Thank you.","Miles White","Okay. First question is really easy. I was referencing HeartMate 3 and a new claim. Second question, a good question. I know the street, where it is. The street, generally, in its consensus, hasn't tried to factor in or tried to model exchange. And we're all looking at the same exchange trends right now, even the street. So, I'd say, look, if I privately polled the 20 analysts or so on the sell side that cover Abbott or any company for that matter, you'd probably all say, \"Well, this is my current estimate based on underlying growth but I'm not sure how exchange is going to impact it. And, secondly, I'm not sure how much everybody's going to try to absorb in their P&L and how much they're going to pass through in their estimates and so forth.\" I think we're all kind of in that boat together right now.","Do I think that 10% to 12% range right now is reasonable? We start every year at double-digits and whatever -- I think, as I said earlier, the underlying growth of these businesses is there. There's puts and takes, there's ins and outs. There's not just products ins and outs, there's tax rate. Everybody did experience tax reform, is going to experience some adjustments in tax rates this year. There's puts and takes. We obviously made a change in some of our debt costs with euro debt. That's a positive for us. So, there's a bunch of pluses and minuses we've got to sort out. The one that's hard to forecast in some way is exchange. And yet, you know, we're on the dot to the penny or penny above or better, every single quarter. So, we tend to like a lot of precision in our forecasting and the hardest thing to forecast here is exchange.","So, do I think that could be a bit of a mitigator here? It might be. But we're all going to know a lot more about that in a few months when it's time to set our guidance for next year. Historically, as you know, we have always tried to offset in some fashion or mitigate as much exchange as possible so that we can reliably deliver what our investors expect. I mean there\u2019s -- look there's a lot of moving parts in the world and we're always trying to synthesize all those moving parts and give you, the investor, reliability to the penny every quarter. And so far, I think for the last 15 to 20 years, we've been pretty damn good at that. Going into next year, our goals will be no different.","And right now, I think that even analysts and their estimates that inform that 12% consensus that you referenced as being out there now is subject to change by analysts factoring in exchange or any number of other things. But in our case, we're always trying to mitigate that. I don't know where it will come out but I think somewhere in that range is probably right. We'll be starting at 10% and we'll see what happens after that. I would tell you this, if exchange mitigates and we suddenly see a weak dollar, we're not going to have a problem making you happy.","Bob Hopkins","Fair enough. Thanks for the answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice quarter here. So, Miles, maybe the first one on the sustainability question. If I'm looking at '19, you have MitraClip FMR indication, which is incremental. Libre continues its trends. You have HeartMate 3, which is incremental. Portico US launch, which is incremental, a stable CRM outlook. In neuromod, your comps get easy. Alinity, it should be ramping in the US. It really feels like all the strength we've seen in '18, this should continue into '19. So, maybe can you just talk about some drivers for how we should be thinking about the pluses and the minuses?","Miles White","Well, Vijay, you forgot to mention Alere. You forgot to mention COAPT. You forgot to mention some improvements in EPD. It's interesting. I've never in my career here seen such breadth across the company in new products, new product launches, market conditions, et cetera. Even Nutrition right now is doing considerably better than it has in the last couple of years. I wouldn't forecast better for Nutrition but I like what it's doing right now. And EPD, it's in high growth or at least moderate to high growth markets with great tailwinds. It of course has a currency headwind like everything else. But all of these things are performing really well. And even the ones that you can see and forecast and track pretty well like Libre or Alinity, et cetera, they're actually accelerating. And that just gets better.","So, I think the sustainability of the growth and the diversity of it is a huge plus. It's not like we're reliant on a single product or a single country. We're not highly indexed in China and we're not over-dependent on a single product. There's just great diversity of growth opportunity across the board. And I think that -- I'm really proud of the company from a productivity and pipeline standpoint. And that goes for St. Jude as well. As I've said a number of times, St. Jude in the course of our acquisition negotiations with them, continued to talk to us the veracity of their pipeline and how good it was. And to be honest, they were right. And that's proven.","So, I'm pretty bullish on just the diversity of opportunity here. And while we can try to point to one or two of them, I think Libre and Alinity stick out, but incremental matters. And incremental in any business here, whether it's HeartMate 3 or neuro or even EPD or Alere or anything else, Portico, all of these things contribute to the growth of the company and that's how we like it. We like every bit of this company performing well.","Vijay Kumar ","That's helpful. And maybe one for Brian. Brian, when you look at the guidance for Q4 and implications for '19, the gross margins at 59.5% that would imply an actual rate into Q4. Any particular reason why GM sequentially should step up? How much did FX cost you guys in the EPS? Because a lot of questions on why guidance was not raised for the year. And it looks like at least $0.05 hit in the back half here. And is that sort of a similar number we should be thinking about, just given where FX is, when you think about for '19? Thank you.","Brian Yoor","Alright, Vijay. Let me start with the gross margin. Our underlying gross margin improvement has been strong. It's ticking up nearly about a half a point year-over-year and that's largely the effect of our synergies that are going on, both with respect to Alere and its integration and also continued synergies with St. Jude. And every year, we put an emphasis on improving our underlying gross margin of all of our businesses so that we have the healthy reinvestment back into the business. FX really is not -- it mixes, it moves around a bit here and there. It changes every day. But it's not really having too much of an impact. So, we're seeing, call it close to 40 bps of gross margin improvement. That's all underlying for the year.","Your observation on FX as far as earnings is pretty spot-on. If you recall, we came out at the beginning of the year when we thought that FX would actually be a tailwind of about $0.05. It's probably now closer to that, $0.03 to $0.04 down on a full year basis. So, we're powering through that. We're powering through that with all of the underlying performance that Miles has talked about with respect to all the businesses. So, when you look underlying, it's outstanding, very strong performance that carries momentum into 2019.","Miles White","I would just add one comment to that. Blame it on the CEO comment. I don't get overly worked up about raising in the fourth quarter. We've been ahead all year. We're performing strong. Like you, I'm looking at next year and the continuity and sustainability of it all. Whatever the fourth quarter is, it will be, and we're not going to miss. I think that's incredibly unlikely. We are all observing that exchange is a bigger headwind. But when you get to giving guidance for the fourth quarter or raising, I think generally one is tweaking. And at this point in the year, I think tweaking for one quarter is kind of, Eh! I'm looking at next year. And so I wouldn't read too much into that, other than look the obvious. We all know exchange is getting headier. And -- but beyond that, I think the story here is the underlying growth in fact is pretty strong and pretty sustainable. So, don't read too much into it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Raj Denhoy ","Hi, good morning. I wonder if I could maybe ask about one of the areas in Medical Devices that continues to be sort of a little slower and that's vascular. So, a couple questions here. One, is there anything you can give us in terms of how the initial launch of the XIENCE Sierra stent is doing? And second to that, also the PHP, your percutaneous pump is still -- that trial is still halted. So, any updates in terms of when that might get restarted?","Scott Leinenweber","Hi, Raj. This is Scott. Good morning. Yeah, I would just say with respect to the vascular business, I think the big news item earlier this year was the US approval of our XIENCE Sierra stent. That's off to a very good start. We knew going into that that physician feedback on it was very positive through our experience in Europe there. So, we've added Sierra to a number of our contracts here in the US. We've actually recaptured several share points in the US during the quarter. We also launched the product in Japan recently and it's performing there very well.","So, the business has some momentum behind the Sierra stent. It's a very good product. There's a little bit of masking of that growth with respect to some of the non-commercial royalty revenue that we get but that's noise. The commercial side of the business is really performing quite well with respect to that launch.","With respect to PHP, that's a program we're still committed to very much. So, we have not provided any updates on the timeline of late. I would expect we will in the future at some point.","Raj Denhoy ","Okay. Fair. Maybe just for my second question just kind of a broader one on kind of the tone and outlook for the business broadly. Obviously, it depends a lot on the portfolio various companies have but is there anything you can offer in terms of how procedure volumes and pricing broadly are tracking in the industry right now?","Scott Leinenweber ","Yes. No change really. I mean, procedures and demand volume from that side of things are fairly constant to the way they've been running and trending for the last several quarters. Pricing in some of the segments, such as CRM and vascular, is a modest headwind. But demand is strong and offsetting most of that. Those are really the only two areas of the medical device business where we think about price. The others are very healthy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Navarro ","Good morning, guys. Two quick questions. First, Miles, on Alere, you'll do $2 billion in revenue this year. I think that's hitting expectations. But Alere is going to be folded into organic growth in 2019. So can you help us think about Alere growth in 2019 and beyond? That's the first question. And then quickly on Libre 2, can you give us an update on the US approval timing? Thanks.","Miles White","Yes. Let me address Alere first. So, our first year -- you're spot-on on all your observations. Our first year was obviously stabilize, integrate it, organize, put management in place, et cetera, all done, all done well, and so on. And we benefited in this last year from probably one of the stronger flu seasons in a long time, so the infectious disease business in Alere, the infectious disease testing business did well in that context. ","Going forward, obviously, we now need to turn to driving growth. And I can't give you a forecast or a prediction on that for \u201819 yet or even \u201820 beyond that. But that's where the attention turns. I think we're mostly through all the disruption and\/or transition, synergies, et cetera, all that activity. In fact, I've got an update on that after this meeting later today. ","And at this point, our entire emphasis turns to what kind of sustainable growth rate we can now generate and trend out of that business. So, I don't have a specific answer for you yet, Glenn, but I think that's one of our growth drivers of the future and that's kind of next steps with it. And I'm sorry what was the second half of your question?","Glenn Navarro ","Timing Libre 2 in the US.","Miles White","I might have to ask Scott for some help on that because I'm not sure we can give you timing on that.","Scott Leinenweber ","Yes, that's right, Miles. We haven't provided timing yet on Libre 2 in the US. Obviously, we will bring an alarm version to the US at some point in time. The current version is obviously doing quite well as well. So, that's just another opportunity in the pipeline but we have not provided specifics on timeline yet.","Miles White","I would tell you this, it should take a lot less time than it seems to. The US lags, Europe and the rest of the world on some of these approvals in a way that I find hard to explain but it is what it is.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. One on capital allocation, one on Nutrition. Miles, you've been paying down debt. You've been quiet on the M&A front in 2018. Do you expect that to change in 2019? And I just had one question on Nutrition.","Miles White","Okay. Let me deal with that one first. Well, first of all, I think the organization has done a terrific job on cash generation and debt pay down. And I give Brian Yoor and the management team total credit for that because what we've done for cash management, debt management, debt pay down, and stuff has been led by him and terrific job. And to be honest, when we took all the borrowing down in order to do the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was -- Oh! Gosh, I think like 4.3, something like that and we made commitments to the rating agencies that we would get that down pretty fast and we're down to I think 2. So we've obviously paid off a lot of debt very fast and we're happy with the rate of that. And it gives us a lot of flexibility from a capital allocation or strategic flexibility standpoint.","But will we continue to pay down debt? We will. But I think we also -- we have other capital needs. For example, we want to target our dividend in a certain range as a percent of our EPS and we are completely able to do that and meet those targets and those goals for dividend payouts. Some of our capital attention has been paid to growth. And we are investing in Alinity and we're investing in Libre. We're making a large investment in capacity expansion for Libre that I think you'll see drive even more growth out of Libre than you can see now and fulfill kind of the larger mass market ramp-up we see for that product. We're putting a fair bit of investment into the expansion of Alinity. So, when we can invest our capital in growth, not only near-term but long-term with high return, that's a good use for our capital and we're obviously doing that.","We haven't, to be fair, seen a lot on the M&A front that interests us. And as I indicated in the past, we always keep our ear to the ground. We're always doing our homework on what possibilities may or may not be out there and what might interest us, what might fit our portfolio. But right now, we haven't seen anything that draws our attention that way. So, we don't have anything on our radar screen from the standpoint of M&A that we think is beneficial to us. ","We've got so much more opportunity in the company organically and out of our pipelines and the expansion of all the things we talked about earlier that that's really where our focus is. And fortunately for us, it can be, it ought to be. So, we just haven't seen anything to draw our cash for capital investment from the standpoint of M&A. I mean there might be little things here and there but nothing that I would say is particularly needle moving on a big scale here in any near-term way.","And then finally, I suppose the fifth, last opportunity is -- that I haven't mentioned -- it's not last in priority but -- is share buyback. And right now, we haven't been. What you're seeing in our EPS growth and so forth is pure growth and not enhanced at all by share buybacks. And to be honest, as we've all seen during the year, that hasn't been a high return investment for a lot of companies and we've had better uses for our capital that do have high returns for us. And so consequently, it doesn't rule it out. It doesn't rule out that we could do it but we'll only do it if it's got a good return for us and our investor, et cetera. And right now, our best investment is us. So, we're directing our cash that way. I think our cash flow is strong enough that we've got a lot of good choices. We will continue to pay down debt. But we're at the point where we've got strategic flexibility. It's just a question of where we use it. And I think that's all good.","Larry Biegelsen ","Very clear. And just last for me, Miles, on Nutrition. A year ago, that was the slowest growing business. That's clearly turned around. The international Pediatric Nutrition business is doing really well. Any color on what's going on in China? And lastly on that, the Adult Nutrition business in the U.S. has been a little weak recently. Is that still private label competition? What's the outlook there? Thanks for taking the questions.","Brian Yoor","Okay. Yes, I'll take the last one first, Larry. This is Brian. With respect to the U.S., what you're seeing is the impact of a wind down of a non-core product line for us. You'll see that here in Q3, otherwise, the U.S. business would be growing. You'll see it in Q4 as well. It's non-core to us and we just decided to wind it down. That's the only thing going on in the U.S.","With respect to China, the transition has gone smoothly. The food safety law transition has gone smoothly. I think behavior has been rational in the market. The market growth rates in China have been strong and we're always trying there to grow share. But our Greater China business has done quite well this year and we expect the market there in China to remain strong and stable going forward on the pediatric side of the business.","Miles White","Yes, I would only add that the whole Nutrition business obviously is doing a lot better this year than it did last year. And where it is right now, there's various countries or various segments of business where we want to do better. There's ups and downs. But overall, if you take it as a whole, a lot happier where it is today than where it was a year ago.","Scott Leinenweber ","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Chris Pasquale ","Thanks for sneaking me in. I wanted to follow up on the FX commentary and try to make sure we're all on the same page as we think about next year. Brian, if rates were to stay where they are right now, what would the earnings impact from currency be in 2019?","Brian Yoor","That\u2019s going to be somewhere probably between 3% and 4% of our earnings. And we've seen that before. And as Miles said, we always work to mitigate as much of that as possible. And the great news is that we have a lot of underlying growth in the businesses and sales growth that we're going to power through as much of that as possible.","Miles White","I would add to that, Chris, it's always kind of a judgment trade-off. If you could predict currency for the whole year or beyond, it would be one thing, but we can't. And so, we take a lot of different actions to mitigate the volatility of it or the impact of it. We've got a very sophisticated, and frankly, complex rolling hedging program on the currencies that we can hedge. So, we take out a lot of the unpredictability with that. Obviously, over the long-term, we're not currency traders and we're not trying to be. But we're trying to be able to make our earnings and our sales more predictable, more stable, more reliable, in terms of what our investors want to see, and frankly, impact on us, so we can plan and manage.","That said, gosh, today's currency rates if sustained, it would be a heavy headwind. Do I think all of that somehow passes through to the investor? I do not. Do I think that the current currency rates will be the same three months from now or the same six months from now? I do not. If you ask me do I think they will be up or down? I have no idea. All I know is, as I told you earlier, we look at the right balance of what is right for us to try to mitigate or hedge or whatever we're going to do to perform to the investment identity that our investors expect of us and where are we in a prudent range of how we manage that balance and how we deal with exchange and so forth in the performance for our investors. And we always start with a double-digit target of growth. So a lot of moving parts, and we'll see.","Right now, I think that's kind of the only elephant in the room for us. And everything else looks positive and strong and\/or is in our hands to manage. And the one that's not entirely in our hands to manage is what currency hands us. But then we do have a lot of things to do to try to minimize its impact on the overall performance of the company for our investors.","Chris Pasquale ","Thanks for that. And Brian, just to make sure that I'm hearing you correctly, you're saying about $0.10 headwind for next year give or take?","Brian Yoor","It's a range. Exchange -- currency moves every day. If you look at 3% to 4%, about that.","Chris Pasquale ","Okay. And then, Miles, just one last one on Alinity in the U.S. What's the latest on the timing there when you think you'll have a broad enough menu in place to really make a big push domestically with that product?","Scott Leinenweber ","Hi, Chris. This is Scott. I would just say, as you know, that the clinical chemistry and immunoassay instruments is the core business there. The instruments are approved and we are building our test menu at a pretty ratable kind of rate quarter-to-quarter, so to speak, and making progress on that front. It will still take a few more quarters until we get what we consider a critical mass there. So, you're probably looking back half of 2019 where we feel like we're really going to have the menu and the systems we need to go out and get business.","Chris Pasquale ","Great. Thanks.","Scott Leinenweber","Okay. Well, thank you, operator. And thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2018. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.","Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which adjusts the 2017 basis of comparison to exclude the impact of exchange and historical results for Abbott\u2019s medical optics and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017, as well as the current and prior year sales for Alere which was acquired on October 3, 2017. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay. Thanks, Scott. And good morning. Today we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $0.59 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting 23% growth. ","Sales increased 7% on an organic basis in the quarter led by continued strong growth in medical devices and improving performance in our nutrition business. Our full year 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.80 to $2.90 remains unchanged and reflects mid-teens growth at the midpoint. ","Back in January I commented that we were entering the year with strong momentum which has continued as we forecasted. Strong growth we are achieving is a direct result of the steps we have taken to position the company in the most attractive areas of healthcare as well as the outstanding productivity of our new product pipeline.","I will now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian. And I will start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 5.5% in the quarter. We remain focused on accelerating the launch of our new Alinity in Europe where we\u2019ve made good progress on test menu expansion and where we\u2019ve seeing increasing competitive win rates. ","Diagnostics has been almost consistent growth business over the past several years and Alinity is a highly differentiated platform which will build upon that strong track record for years to come. ","In Rapid Diagnostics which we created in the fourth quarter of last year with the acquisition of Alere, we achieved sales of nearly $560 million, somewhat ahead of our expectations and partially due to the strong flu season in the United States. This is a very attractive area of diagnostics testing and our integration of this business into Abbott continues to go well as we\u2019ve put in place the building blocks to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion.","In nutrition, sales increased more than 4.5% in the quarter, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of improving performance. Sales growth this quarter was balanced across our pediatric and adult nutrition businesses. In pediatric nutrition, above market growth in the US was led by Similac, our leading infant formula brand.","Internationally, performance improved across several countries and we continue to see stable market conditions in China following the implementation of a new food safety -- of new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of this year.","In adult nutrition, sales growth was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands in both US and internationally. In Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales growth of 7% was led by double-digit growth in India, China and Brazil. Our unique branded generics model was built to focus specifically on key emerging countries with socio economic and competitive conditions that provide a favorable environment for long-term growth.","We serve each of these markets with a broad product offering tailored to address local needs. This unique and successful approach positions EPD to continue delivering superior performance in the fastest pharmaceutical markets in the world.","And lastly, I will turn to medical devices, our sales grew nearly 10% led by strong growth in electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care. In electrophysiology, growth of 19% was led by market uptake of several recently launched products including our EnSite Precision cardiac mapping system and Confirm the world\u2019s first and only smartphone compatible Insertable Cardiac Monitor which helps physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias.","In structural heart, growth was led by MitraClip our market leading device for the minimally-invasive repair of mitral regurgitation. During the quarter we announced that patients in Japan will now have improved access to MitraClip for national reimbursement and we continue to make advancements on a number of clinical development programs targeted to deliver new products and indications for the minimally invasive treatment of various forms of structural heart disease. ","In neuromodulation, first quarter growth of nearly 20% was driven by our market leading portfolio which includes several recently launched products that offer improved relief for patients suffering from chronic pain and movement disorders. ","I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where sales grew over 30% in the quarter, driven by Freestyle Libre, our highly differentiated sensor-based glucose monitoring system. Libre now has over 650,000 users across the globe which represents an unprecedented level of patient adoption in the industry. As we've discussed previously, we're investing significant capital to expand manufacturing capacity which will allow us to meet anticipated demand over the coming years. Libre offers a true mass market opportunity with this unique combination of affordability accessibility and ease-of-use and will positioning ourselves to maximize its impact. ","So, in summary, as expected, the momentum we carried into the year has continued as reflected by our strong first quarter results. We continue to see significant growth contributions from a number of recently launched products across our portfolio and we'll well positioned to achieve our financial objectives for the year including top tier sales growth and mid-teens EPS growth as we continue to make investments to sustain our growth momentum into the future. ","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay, thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis, which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January. ","Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 6.9% on an organic basis and exchange had a positive impact of 4.2% on sales. The favorable impact of exchange rates on sales this quarter was driven primarily by the strengthening of the euro and other developed market currencies, which considering our cost base and hedging program as minimal fall through and impact on our earnings. ","Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 33.2% of sales all in line with our previous guidance. ","Turning to our outlook. For the full year 2018, we continue to forecast organic sales growth 6% to 7%. And based on current rates, we expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a little more than 2% on full year reported sales, with more than half of this impact driven by strengthening of the euro. In addition, we continue to expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion. ","We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales reflecting underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales. ","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter 2018. We forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.70 to $0.72. We forecast organic sales growth of 6% to 7% and at current sales we expect exchange to have a positive impact of a little below 3% on reported sales. In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of approximately $500 million in the second quarter. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investments of around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense somewhat above 30.5% of sales. ","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide an overview of our second quarter organic sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast double-digit sales growth. In nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single-digit sales growth. In diagnostics, we forecast the modest sequential improvement in sales growth of around 6% and in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to upper single digits which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business. ","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Mike Weinstein","Let me start if I can on couple of product launches and hope you can provide some additional color on how the U.S. launches are doing for both Libre and Confirm. And then second the ETT business had a slight weak for this quarter than was expected. Brian\u2019s comment in the second quarter guidance that you expect the business to rebound to double-digits in the second quarter. So, if you can just call out anything in particular that might have impact in the first quarter that you would use one time in nature. Thanks. ","Miles White","Thanks for the question Mike and before I going in to those answers. I\u2019d like to take a minute and just acknowledge you as an analyst in our space for just a terrific job you\u2019ve done over the years and acknowledge your change of career. We won\u2019t have you on these calls anymore, but she always had great questions and always hit the right points. And good luck to you and whatever you\u2019re going to do. And we\u2019ll miss you here. ","Mike Weinstein","Thank you, Miles.","Miles White","Let\u2019s start with Libre. The Libre launch, I\u2019d say has going exceptionally well. And is going exceptionally well, we obviously expected to keep going exceptionally well worldwide. as I mentioned we are up over 650,000 patients at this point. We\u2019re adding over 50,000 patients a month. We added about 150,000 just over that this last quarter. So, if I look at the acquisition rate of patients we expect to obviously be over a million patients at year-end and trending at a pretty healthy fashion. And then I\u2019m pretty gratified by that growth, it\u2019s true globally and I\u2019d say in terms of color the mix of patients is very strong, our reimbursement is -- I think we\u2019re reimbursed about two-thirds of all sales now internationally, that\u2019s strong keeping reimbursement of approvals in countries. I think that the value proposition of Libre, the affordability is particularly strong and appealing to patients as well as the performance, ease of use for the product and so forth. We get a lot of feedback that way. ","About two-thirds of the patients are Type 1 diabetics and about a third or Type 2 patients. So, we\u2019ve got, we\u2019re seeing validation of the appeal and use of the product in both segments. We\u2019re investing a significant amount of capital in capacity expansion anticipating that the growth legs on this product are going to be long because it\u2019s got a real mass market appeal and fit and there are as you know tens of millions of diabetics and tens of millions of insulin using diabetics, the majority of which are actually international and in our case so far the vast majority of our patients are international but we are off to a strong start in the US as well. ","At this point, we are a little over 50,000 patients in US and trending strong and I think as far as starts go and continuations and expansions and so far, that\u2019s all good news. So, we are running hard and the reception of patients here and abroad has been exceptional. I think that the opportunity in the category is quite large and the category gets a lot of attention and for us is a future growth driver we think it\u2019s pretty strong. ","I am not sure what other detail to fill in. But nice thing is it\u2019s the kind of growth challenge we\u2019d like to have. We are not having to over invest in SG&A because the customers our strongest marketers and given social media and so forth, that\u2019s been a huge plus. So, everything about it is doing really well and I think we will see this be a major growth driver for the company for a quite long time.","With regard to Confirm, also off to a strong start. We are capturing share; physician feedback has been very positive. It\u2019s a simple procedure and I think one of the appeals it is the only device that is smartphone compatible. It\u2019s a nice market opportunity and it\u2019s been a nice bump up in the growth rate. I know there\u2019s competition out there, there\u2019s competition in every category we are in and competition always makes you pay attention to innovation and next steps and next improvements and so forth. And I suspect we will see response for the success of this product but in the meantime doing quite well. ","And then finally EPD, if you focus into the category for many of, it\u2019s always something. And given the focus on whether it\u2019s emerging or high growth markets, we seem to have a given market that affects our EPD or even our nutrition business from time-to-time somewhere. And in this particular case it\u2019s Russia. And in the case of Russia the market has been -- the market growth rate has been slowing. We still see that in our IMS data and so forth. As you know we have two businesses in EPD there, the EPD brand and the Veropharm brand. Veropharm brand has withstood that slowly market growth rate far better than the EPD brand because of a lot of the hospital based were EPD brand is more pharmacy based. ","There\u2019s been a lot of expansion on pharmacies but that doesn\u2019t mean that there is expansion of prescriptions. And so, the overall market I think is one of temporary distribution channel dynamics as those pharmacies expanded and that has now ceased at that rate and the market I think will stabilize in terms of distributions channels, outlets and so forth. So that\u2019s created a little disruption in that market temporarily and that\u2019s it is, that in Russian. And without Russia we have been in the 8.5% to 9% ranges business and this looks healthier. So, I would say you got that and then maybe a small dynamic in Mexico where we have seen a couple of distributors consolidate. And when distributors consolidate there\u2019s a little more negotiating power and so forth. It\u2019s been a little disruption in Mexico. ","But to be honest that one hardly makes the radar screen impacting the overall global growth of EPD. The biggest issue was this quarter Russia. I think we will still see impacting the numbers next quarter. So, I'd say we're probably going to look at the same kind of a number particularly given the Russia impact next quarter. And then I think we'll start to see it turn. ","Mike Weinstein","That's good color. Miles let me just ask one follow up. So, you grew 6.9% organic this quarter, your guidance for the year was 6% to 7% if there are probably a bigger picture question people have is on sustainability. So, would you mind spending a minute, it's obviously only April of 2018. But just could you just give us your thoughts and ability to -- this type of revenue growth?","Miles White","Yeah, I think overall. I'd say this range revenue growth we're going to sustain. I know that I indicated on the last call I expect it to be at the higher end of this. Each day that goes by, where do you have Russia or a tweak or something that affects the expectations in the market did adjust. I am less concerned about couple of tents of a point of growth, and I'm less concerned about the details of each quarter. I mean I pay attention to that because obviously it matters to investors. I'm much more concerned about the long-term sustainability of the overall growth trajectory of the company and that I'm pretty confident in. I'm not sure I can break every quarter to the tenth. But I would tell you that the overall sustainable growth of the company I feel pretty confident about. And particularly in this range for now for this year and beyond, because there is so much new product launched and so much sustainable launch. I mean just between the series of Alinity analyzers and Libre and the new products launched by our medical device groups. There is an awful lot of new product tracking here. And that's not just a temporal thing that goes a couple of months or a couple of quarters. Our objective was to make sure that we had really healthy robust R&D pipelines and a good cadence of new product launches so we could sustain growth organically. And then whether we ever do anything else opportunistically and M&A and so forth becomes truly that opportunistic and very strategic. So, I think with the underlying baseline, I'm pretty confident of the current sales trajectory of the company. And I think we've got some pretty solid validation points here with the performance of the new products that have launched that are quite visible, quite trackable quite predictable to validate the growth prospects going forward. ","So, whether it's [65, 67, 69] might vary quarter-to-quarter. Because lots of things happened quarter-to-quarter. But overall, I think that growth range is pretty doable. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. please check that your line is not unmute?","David Lewis","Hello.","Miles White","Hello?","Brian Yoor","Hi David. ","Miles White","We surely have a technical problem. ","Brian Yoor","Are you there David? Maybe we move on and try to welcome back as we go Crystal?","Operator","Okay great. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with nutrition and then ask a couple of follow questions on Libre. Obviously, the bright spot here in the quarter was the acceleration in nutrition. So, Miles, can you talk about the sustainability of that? The international pediatric nutrition improved. And also, the adult nutrition business in the U.S. also improved. Those are areas that saw some challenges last year. And I was just curious as to why, you\u2019re guiding too low to mid-single-digits for Q2? And then I had a follow-up on Libre.","Miles White","Okay. Let me deal with nutrition first. I think for the long-term, I'd be cautious about setting expectations much higher than low to mid-single-digits in this business. Because markets around the world have slowed to a degree, they\u2019re not growing at a high a growth rate as they have historically. They\u2019re still healthy markets and I think particularly some international, you call it emerging markets and so forth still have some hefty growth opportunity. But I think overall, when you put it all together, it\u2019s probably a low to mid-single-digit business from a growth standpoint. It is profitable, it does generate a lot of cash and it is a fundamentally very strong and valuable business. ","So, I\u2019m happy about that. I would say that we\u2019ve seen some sequential improvement, because we\u2019ve been attending to, what I think have been adjustments to how we market, how we sell, adjusting to digital channels or online channels and so forth in some markets where there's been a tremendous amount of distribution channel shift and change. China sticks out. But it\u2019s been true a lot of places. ","So, I think that it\u2019s a highly competitive business in a branded space. We react to that pretty well, I give our U.S. team a lot of credit for how well they\u2019ve done in the pediatric and adult space, it\u2019s extremely competitive and it\u2019s competitive in both pediatric and adults not just pediatric in the U.S. And we will see from time-to-time a competitor tries to false advertising or other things to take momentary share. But I think overall, we\u2019ve not only sustained our position, but steadily grown it, from a share standpoint, we certainly see that in the U.S., I\u2019m feeling pretty good about how the U.S. is doing overall. ","And in some markets, where we got some either competitive issues or just disruption like the disruption in China for the last two years over this changing food safety and so forth the law. I think we respond to that pretty well. And I think we\u2019re seeing that stabilize as we are making adjustments in how we market, what channels we go to where the emphasis is. I think we got some stability in China. But I would say, we also have a lot of ambition to do better competitively in China, [we forget our hands around]. ","So right now, I think if we\u2019re able to see steady stable growth in this business at the rate we\u2019re at or even sequential improvement going forward that be pretty good. I wouldn\u2019t want to get out over the tips of my skis on that and predict a whole lot faster or higher, right now I\u2019m happy that is stable and headed north. ","Lawrence Biegelsen","That\u2019s very helpful. And then on Libre, clearly the launch is off to a good start in the U.S. and international numbers have been spectacular. But I think investors want to get some confidence about the sustainability of that. So, I guess my question is first, earlier in the year, you\u2019re seen comfortable with 50 million to 100 million for the U.S. in 2018, is that still the case? And second, what can you say on the pipeline. I know, you don\u2019t want to disclose much, but investors obviously want some visibility beyond 2018. Is there anything, you can tell us to give investors' confidence that there is more to come here? Thanks. ","Miles White","More to come on Libre?","Lawrence Biegelsen","On the pipeline, I mean, you have collaboration with Big Foot, you\u2019re expected to deliver next generation device to them with alarm, that kind of thing. So, the pipeline in the sustainability.","Miles White","Coming back to your first question about the -- we previously said 50 million to 100 million of sales in year one seemed reasonable and so forth, absolutely. And we\u2019ll be at the higher end of that range and we are tracking that way now and it\u2019s very early in the year as you know. So, I have no concern about that at all and let's just say we are ahead of our expectations here and you can see that in the growth rates, in the numbers and the patient acquisition rates and so forth. I think we\u2019ll go out at the end of this year $1 billion or more in run rate and 1 million patients or more. In fact, I think we are going to have well over 1 million patients at that point because our patient acquisition rate right now is pretty steady and rising. So yes, I think all of that\u2019s pretty reasonable, I\u2019d validate that for you.","And then with regard to pipeline, product improvements and so forth, yes, I mean as you know we\u2019ve got a pediatric claim in Europe, we will have that in the US that we\u2019ll file this year. There\u2019s improvements, alarms and so forth that will be -- that\u2019s coming. I am trying to think of all the things coming but I would just say yes there is plenty coming and other dimensions of it coming out of R&D that we will have announcements for this year and next year. So now there\u2019s a steady cadence of improvements, variations, claims, et cetera in the product going forward that I think keep this going for a long time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis ","So, Miles, I wanted to start with diagnostics. Two things to focus on there, may be a follow up on the balance sheet. Two things, Alere is a model kind of recovered faster than I guess we expected. So, if you could talk about Alere recovery and how the integration is going? And then secondarily Alinity and how you see the pipeline building there US ex-US throughout the balance of the year?","Miles White","Yes, I am sneaking the notes so I can remember all that, okay. Alright. I will start with Alere yes, I would say what Alere sees with our management team, I'd say the integration, the bulk hard work of the integration of that and St. Jude is pretty well complete. I mean there\u2019s a lot of things we will keep improving in both businesses overtime, investments we want to make and so forth. But I think the notion of make it a part of the company getting everything under control, getting a management team established and strategies and directions established and so forth, that\u2019s all gone exceptionally well. ","We are on track with all our synergies. I think we benefited. It\u2019s been a blessing. There\u2019s been a particularly strong flu season and a big chunk of Alere\u2019s business probably 15% or so Alere\u2019s sales is seasonal and somewhat dependent on things like the flu season, if not the flu season in particular. So, we saw an obvious upshot in our flu related and strip related testing and so forth from late fall into the winter and that\u2019s clearly reflected in the numbers. That will vary from year to year depending on morbidity and flu season and so forth. ","But some years will probably be lighter but this year was particularly strong and that was a big plus. Now underlying that interestingly enough as we\u2019ve told you we think they had a lot of good product lines that were undermarketed. We have had increasing success with a number of those product lines and strategies. One of the things that\u2019s on our radar screen that we\u2019re working out, we want to put a lot more money in to R&D product refreshments, product improvements, that sort of stuff, that\u2019s a multiyear thing, that\u2019s not going to be next quarter kind of evidence. But I think we\u2019ve got our hands around the commercial opportunities. There are places where we see room for correction, improvement et cetera. But I think we got the management team stabilized. I think it's financially stabilized. I think the uptick in sales while largely driven in this particular period by the flu season there is also underlying improvements in key product lines and key sales that I think are going really well that we are pretty happy about. ","Miles White","Alinity, we have taken some pretty deliberate steps to dramatically chip up our launch activity. With these large systems, and their multi-test menus. It's really important to have full or nearly full menus at launch because customers when they switch over a lab or switchover given instruments and so forth, want to be able to switch all the test on that product and not have to run different systems and so forth. And we're sort of hitting stride now on the completion or breadth of the menu offerings particularly, Europe. U.S. is coming along et cetera, our blood screening system Alinity has a full menu that's up. So, we've got some pretty ambitious plans about not only conversion of existing installed base but share capture and account capture. I would say about 15% of accounts come up for renewal or contracting each year. So, this will be a fairly steady multi-year rollout and trend. But if I track things like our prospect lists or prospect bank how many prospects, how many actively in the sales process, what's our win rate with the existing accounts, what's our win rate with new accounts? And I'd say the magnitude of the prospect banks and accounts has increased about six-fold. And our win rate in our existing accounts is extremely high up in the well over 90% category which you'd expect that happy customers and they're always easier to sell to than new ones. But our win rate in new accounts is quite high also. And so that's been pretty gratifying. And that's so far Europe and has evidenced. So, we're investing in expansion of sales force and expansion of installation service teams, expansion of support. It's well underway, and it's going well. So, we're pleased. ","David Lewis ","Okay. And Miles, very clear. And then just quick one from me, I think a lot of commentary this morning on growth drivers. But one of the basic steps for us this year is debt paydown. And it looks like you could be 1.5-2 turns net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the year. I just wonder, how capital priorities could change towards the end of the year. And do you have capacity for sort of growth-oriented M&A towards the back half of the year. Thanks so much ","Miles White","Yeah in terms of debt, we paid down $6 billion already this year, its [ph] April. And I'd say we expect to pay down another $2 billion before year-end. And cash flows are strong, we paid a lot of attention to that because it is our intent to bring our debt down as you know when we completed these two acquisitions we have about $28 billion in gross debt. And we're already 22 and we'll be 20 or little lower at year-end. That will put us at about 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA ratio not 1.5 or 2 and I still think that\u2019s pretty healthy and it\u2019s a pretty rapid rate of pay down on the debt. So, does the start to change your capital priorities at that point. I would tell you right now, we think the dividend is important for a category of our investors. And we like to target our dividend in 40% of EPS to maybe a little bit more than 40% of EPS range, 40% to 45% of earnings. And we like to maintain that range and we\u2019ve been steadily raising the dividend, and I think that remains a priority. ","Obviously, debt pay down remains a priority. But we\u2019re getting rapidly to a very healthy range and healthy balance. Would we keep paying down debt, we would. And yes, I think to answer your point will we have capacity if we choose to. We would, but I would tell you right now, that\u2019s not my priority. And we\u2019re not looking at M&A, we\u2019re not looking at any day. It\u2019s not in our priority list just now. I do want to keep paying down debt, do want to pay a healthy dividend. And frankly, we\u2019ve got some organic capital opportunities here internally both between the launch of Alinity and capacity expansion with Libre that are worthwhile. And I don\u2019t see that impinging on us so much that it squeezes us. ","We have flexibility referred to and of course as we get into \u201919, we clearly have flexibility. But right now, I don\u2019t feel constrained, but also don\u2019t have anything on the radar screen that I\u2019m particularly interested in pursuing because we\u2019ve got so much organic growth opportunity as it is. And I\u2019m feeling pretty good about the debt balance, feeling pretty good about the ability to fund our internal needs, our dividend all of those things. We\u2019re in a good spot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise ","Miles, just a big question to start off with. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your internal investing priorities. It seems SG&A stepped up a little higher than might I have thought, you\u2019re clearly investing in R&D. And you\u2019ve highlighted some topics Libre diagnostics, but maybe where are your priorities more broadly? And do you see that extra investment or that extra opportunity investments sustaining or accelerating to kind of 6% to 7% organic growth outlook you\u2019re talking about?","Miles White","Rick, I don\u2019t have an investment at Abbott. It doesn\u2019t mean that can use more money. Our business at Abbott. It\u2019s actually a good problem to have. They all believe with more sales and marketing expense and resources that they can expand faster, run faster et cetera. And of course, as always have a prudent balance to that. But I\u2019d say, we\u2019re kind of lucky. We\u2019ve got a lot of things that are launching, a lot of new products and opportunities. And we\u2019ve got some market expansion opportunities in EPD and so forth. So, and the combination of it is adding sales reps, adding service and support and increasing our penetration in a number of places. ","So, we\u2019re very fortunate, I think with Libre in particular that it\u2019s not as sales and marketing intensive from an expense standpoint as you might think. We get a lot of benefits, it\u2019s extremely, let\u2019s say productive, what I\u2019ll call the digital world, social media world et cetera. The places that I think would benefit from a lot more resource, obviously there\u2019s various device areas that would but you also have to make sure you get the product ready to go and so forth. So, we got a nice steady pipeline. We\u2019d like to put more money behind it. And nutrition it depends -- it's dependent on give countries and given channels. It\u2019s more selective. Would I put more money behind it? Yes, I think so. I think us spend rate could stand to improve in some areas of nutrition, I think it could stand to improve in EPD, if I put more behind Libre I don\u2019t know I mean the growth rate right now is pretty hefty. So, the good news is we are always going to be in this balance between how much we beat earnings by and how much we feed backed into the business. And what I tried to do over the years is find a balance there, a balance for the investor and a balance for the business to keep sustaining it and keep up with it. ","We watch on a percent of sales basis on where opportunities are. I think right now I am going to put a lot more in Alinity and -- because I think that clearly gets a bit of a boost and its labor intensive. So, I know that\u2019s a bit of ramble but good news is I don\u2019t have a problem figuring out where to put money. It\u2019s a bigger challenge of making sure I always keep the balance between what the investor would like to see and what we\u2019ll be keep ploughing into the business because I know you guys want to see sustained growth. I am confident we have sustained growth and then it's just a question and how to hard push on the gas pedal.","Rick Wise ","Got you. And just last from me on a more focused basis, maybe you reflected a little bit about the current dynamics in Cardiac Rhythm Management CRM, the business was flat this quarter, we had assumed low single digit growth. Your portfolio is filled out. I assume you did well on the de novo side may be not so on the replacement side. But just what\u2019s the outlook from here, what are you expecting, is it -- can this business grow and just how are you thinking about this longer term? ","Miles White","Thanks for the question. The business can grow. And you are exactly right, that\u2019s a tale of two different situations, the de novo and the replacement, we are doing very well on de novo to be honest. And that\u2019s pretty gratifying. And it\u2019s a little slower in replacement for a reason, some of that got pulled forward when there was a battery issue couple of years ago. So, a lot of that replacement got pulled forward, so it\u2019s a little bit out of the sink of the normal rate of the sale to come from replacement versus sales to come from de novo. So, I do think that\u2019s kind of a temporary phenomenon while we move out of that zone. ","But the de novo side is quite robust and I am pretty happy about that. So, as we move forward do I think this business grows more than 1% or 2%? I think it can. So, I think we see evidence and give it that attention. I also think we get a lot of opportunity in electrophysiology. I mean there are parts of this business that whether it\u2019s stents or CRM the lower growth rates with their mature and established markets and you said yourself can you grow these at a little healthier growth rate than 1% or 2%, in both cases yes. Our vascular business was slower this quarter. We lost a couple of share points in the United States over the last few quarters, and yes with the approval of launch of XIENCE Sierra in the United States I think that changes. ","So, we\u2019ve got plans, when you're more legacy mature businesses one way into the new product launches another way but you can't, you can't ignore the large established position you've got in CRM and stents and so forth and we're not. It does go up and down with different competitive launches or improvements and so forth from time-to-time, it pulses a little here and there. But we believe we can drive CRM and endovascular stent business at better rates than we see right now that the CRM numbers you see are exactly the anomaly you called out between de novo and replacement. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. ","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. One question on Libre and then one on the neuro business. First can you give us any color on who's using Libre in the U.S. today? And I'm thinking in particular about how the patients you onboarded so far breakdown in terms of type 1 versus type 2. And then CGM naive versus competitive wins?","Miles White","Yeah, I'm going to let Scott take that question for you. Go ahead, Scott. ","Scott Leinenweber","Hi Chris, how are you doing? Yeah, I would say in terms of the mix, it generally as best we can tell it's a little bit harder with data in the U.S. than some of what we get out of Europe because we saw a lot through our web shop in Europe. But we're getting, we estimated around two thirds type 1 and third type 2 in the U.S. just like we are internationally. We think that one, and then we're also getting we feel a nice balance of competitive wins versus people that are trying CGM for the first time and expanding that overall category. So, a nice balance stands across both dimensions. ","Chris Pasquale","Okay. And then neuro continues to be a really strong segment for you. Last year you guys actually became the market share leader in the FTS space in the U.S. I'm curious what all the focus on the opioid, epidemic om the country right now and pain management in general. Do you see an opportunity to move spinal cord stimulation up between the continuum to reduce the dependence on drug therapy for those patients?","Scott Leinenweber","Yeah, I would say look, that has been a great space for us. And we're now the number one player in chronic pain. So certainly, we have a great portfolio and that's playing out with physicians and with patients and we're seeing great real-world results and what not in the real world. So, I do think that that category continues to expand. I think it will take some market development certainly with respect to reimbursement and guidelines and things of that nature. So, it may build itself overtime, it's like going to be a spike. But certainly, we feel that's a really nice space longer term. ","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Glenn Novarro","Hi good morning. Thanks for feeding me in. Miles I have two questions on China. The first is relating to all this tariff noise that we're hearing. Abbott has major prices in China, but I don't believe you manufactured a lot in China and then send manufactured product back to the U.S. so maybe can you discuss the impact of any of these tariff threats between the U.S. and China on your sales and EPS. And then the second question is on China nutritionals, which did perform better than our expectations. Is China recovering sooner than you expected and why? Thanks. ","Miles White","Let me take that one first. No, it's not recovering sooner than I expected. I expected it earlier than this. But I'm glad that it is stabilized now. I think we expect the stability is much sooner than this, but we're there now. So, I think we've got a reasonably stable predictable market. Are we doing as well as we've like, what we'll see that overtime here. We're doing better, but I\u2019d like to do better than better. So, they\u2019re still room to go to improve performance and improve share gain, improve channel shift and so on. But I wouldn\u2019t tell you that this is ahead of my expectations or whatever, because mine may have been running a little ahead of where we are. ","Then with regard to production in China, I think to disabuse this notion, but we do produce in China. And we do bring product to the U.S. from China. And that happened because Alere produced a lot in China or at least a reasonable amount. So, what we manufacture in China that is exported from China or imported to the U.S. is almost entirely diagnostic products in the Alere acquisition. And so there could be some impact financially on that if something where to happen from a tariff standpoint. We have done that analysis. And ironically, we\u2019ve got a lot of business in China. We export a lot to China. We do manufacture infant nutrition in China as it is. ","So, we got a balance, we got a balance of things that we manufacture, import, export, et cetera. When we net out the impact of potential tariffs, the tariffs we might experience exporting to China or into China are minimal. The tariffs we would experience coming back to the U.S. from products manufactured in China are where the impact would be. And I would say that based on everything I\u2019ve seen so far total magnitude of impact on us if that were to happen at all about a penny. And so, we think, we\u2019ve got a highly manageable circumstance, if what we\u2019ve seen and estimated and the degree of tariff rates, products they apply it to and so forth, about a penny. And so, I put that in the category of I\u2019m always solving for penny somewhere. So that\u2019s a manageable outcome. ","Scott Leinenweber","Very good. Well, thank you operator and thank you all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2014. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","Also you will see in our earnings news release this morning that financial results from the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business have been presented as discontinued operations this quarter due to the pending sale to Mylan. As a result the line items of our consolidated statement of earnings are now reported on the basis of continuing operations. We also provide in the release a reconciliation between continuing and discontinued operations for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013 and 2014.","For the remainder of 2014, our earnings per share guidance will include results from both continuing operations as well as discontinued operations associated with the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business being sold to Mylan.

In today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Brian, good morning. This morning we reported adjusted earnings per share above expectations and another quarter of sequential improvement in total company sales growth. We\u2019re also raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance range which is now $2.25 to $2.27 representing double-digit growth. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 increased approximately 13% including discontinued operations which is above our previous guidance range. ","Today I\u2019ll focus my comments on results from Abbott\u2019s continuing operations for sales increase 6.7% operationally. Emerging market sales will now represent nearly 50% of Abbott\u2019s total sales and increased 15% in the quarter with double-digit growth and establish pharmaceuticals, nutrition and diagnostic. In the quarter, we also advanced number of transactions in our branded generics business to accelerate our ability to drive balanced and sustainable growth in emerging geographies.","We remain on track to divest our developed markets business in Mylan in the first quarter of next year. Mylan is well positioned with its global scale and capabilities to do well with this business over the long-term. We completed our acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals at the end of September, which establishes Abbott as a top 10 pharmaceutical company in Latin America. CFR provides scale and a product portfolio that strongly compliments Abbott\u2019s presence in Latin America and more than doubles our branded generic sales in the region.","CFR also brings a network of manufacturing plants and R&D facilities in Columbia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, which further diversifies our cost base in emerging markets. And most importantly CFR adds top talent with strong local market knowledge and a proven ability to quickly develop manufacturing and bring new products to market. We expect our announced acquisition of Veropharm to close by the end of the year. Veropharm positions Abbott to become a top 5 branded generics company in Russia providing us with income for manufacturing and a broad portfolio well aligned to our therapeutic areas of focus.","Following the close of these transactions, our established pharmaceuticals business will operate entirely in emerging geographies where the growth of branded generics are driven by favorable demographics, including growing healthcare systems and a customer base that largely pays out of pocket for high quality, trusted brands. ","Moving forward, we would expect this business generates sales growth in the upper single to double digits. We are also executing on our organic growth opportunities including the launch of a number of new products and innovations across our businesses I\u2019ll briefly review our third quarter results. And I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales increased double digits this quarter. We\u2019ve largely recovered from the sales disruption in our international business at the same time we\u2019re executing a multiple new product launches across key geographies. We continue to invest in our global infrastructure to support the strong global demand from adult pediatric nutrition. ","As we discussed last quarter we reinforced our footprint in China to the opening of our new manufacturing plant in Jiaxing and our strategic alliance with Fonterra to invest locally in China\u2019s milk supply. And last week in India we announced the opening of our third new manufacturing facility this year in nutrition, a stronger footprint in our key geographies will allow us to be closer to our customers and work faster to creating customized new products for their needs.","In diagnostics, we delivered 6% operational growth in third quarter of sequential improvement from the second quarter driven by continued above market performance in core laboratory diagnostics and point of care diagnostics. We are funding investments in growth and advanced multiple new system platforms across all three of our diagnostics businesses. In medical devices, our vascular business is performing below our expectations primarily related to sales of our drug eluting portfolio.","We remained focused on improved execution and increasing penetration of absorbing Europe and several key emerging geographies. MitraClip, our structural heart technology delivered strong double digit growth in the quarter and we expect continued adoption in the U.S. following improved reimbursement national Medicare coverage. Our peripheral stent, Supera also contributed the growth of our new vascular business in the quarter. ","In diabetes care, we launched our next generation flash glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre into the nearly $4 billion blood glucose monitoring market in Europe. Libre is a revolutionary new glucose sensing technology which generated very positive feedback early in its launch; it eliminates the need for routine finger sticks and provides glucose data in a simple format that allows people with diabetes to achieve better health outcomes.","And in vision care, 70% of our sales are generated by our cataract product, which increased double-digits again this quarter. Our new cataract lenses and the uptick of our catalyst laser cataract system are driving above market growth to support the growing global demand for our cataract lenses we recently booked ground on a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. In established pharmaceuticals, as we expected, sales improve sequentially again this quarter. The emerging market branded generic business increased double digits as a result of improved commercial execution and continued expansion of product portfolios in several of our therapeutic areas of focus.","We expect continued momentum in EPD as we exit the year including CFR where sales have been growing consistently at a double-digit pace. So in summary, we\u2019re right on track with our expectations that we communicated at the beginning of this year. Operational sales growth has improved sequentially each quarter. We\u2019re particularly pleased to see that type of improvement in our branded generics business and nutrition as well as steady global performance in diagnostics and vision care. We again exceeded adjusted earnings per share exceptions for the quarter and increased the midpoint of our EPS guidance range which results in another year double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","And we\u2019re continuing to build Abbott for global growth over the long term including the CFR acquisition in the third quarter and working toward our first quarter 2015 close of the sale of our developed market branded generics business for Mylan. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Freyman","","Thanks, Miles. As Brian mentioned upfront because guidance previously provided for the third quarter and the full year 2014 included the developed markets branded generics business for the Mylan, we will continue to include the contributions in this business and our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2014. However, our commentary and guidance for sales and other P&L line items this quarter and for the fourth quarter forecast will be for continuing operations only that is excluding the business being sold to Mylan. ","Today, we reported third quarter diluted earnings per share excluding specified items of $0.62 above our previous guidance range. Sales from continuing operations that is excluding the developed markets branded generics business increased 6.7% on an operational basis and 5.8% on a recorded basis during the quarter.","Including the contribution from discontinued operations sales would have increase 5.6% on an operational basis in line with previous guidance. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in several businesses including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition and steady growth in diagnostics and vision care. Total company sales in emerging markets increased 15% on an operational basis in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.4% of sales from continuing operations.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014, today we\u2019re raising the midpoint and narrowing our EPS guidance range excluding specified items to $2.25 to $2.27 which includes results from our developed markets branded generics business now presented as discontinued operations and reflect double-digit growth over 2013. We forecast operational sales growth from continuing operations in the mid-single digit for the full year 2014 based on current exchange rates we expect this change to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year recorded sales which is somewhat more negative than previous expectations driven by the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. This would result in reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 65% of sales adjusted R&D investment of somewhat more than 6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales from continuing operations for the full year 2014. ","Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2014, we forecast double-digit operational sales growth from continuing operations. As Miles mentioned earlier, we recently completed the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals and expect this business to contribute approximately $200 million to sales in the fourth quarter. Based on current exchange rates, we expect this change to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 2.5% on sales in the quarter. This would result in recorded sales growth in the high single digits for the fourth quarter. ","We forecast on adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment approximately 6.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 28% of sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter. So in summary, our sales and earnings progression for the year is playing out as we forecasted back in January as we continue to forecast another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. ","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook.","Brian Yoor","","Thanks Tom. This morning I\u2019ll review our third quarter 2014 performance and fourth quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I\u2019ll start with our nutrition business where global sales increase 10% in third quarter. In our international pediatric nutrition business, sales increase 14%. We\u2019ve recaptured our share in China and Vietnam following the previously recorded 2013 sales disruption and continue to drive uptake of new products. This includes new infant formula products Similac QINTI and Eleva that we recently launched into the premium segments of the Chinese market to further enhance our competitive position.","International adult nutrition sales increased strong double digit in the quarter, represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in this business. Sales growth is led by continued strong performance of our Ensure brand and double-digit growth in emerging markets. ","Last week Abbott announced the opening of our new nutrition manufacturing plant in India, the third plant we open this year to increasing demand for our nutrition products. This new manufacturing plants is one of Abbott\u2019s most technologically advanced nutrition plants in the world and sourced up to 80% of ingredients locally in India. ","We will work together with Abbott\u2019s nutrition R&D center in India to deliver innovations to address unmet health needs in pediatric and adult nutrition while also meeting specific local tastes and processes. In the U.S., nutrition sales increased low single digits in the quarter in line with expectations. ","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect global nutrition to deliver double-digit sales growth on an operational basis. In our diagnostics business, sales increased 6% in the third quarter representing sequential improvements from the second quarter where sales in emerging markets growing double-digits. Core laboratory diagnostics sales increase nearly 7% as we continue to outperform the market.","In the U.S., sales growth was impacted by comparison to the third quarter of 2013 when sales were higher due to the timing of equipment sales. Year-to-date growth of 7.5% better reflects the underlying performance of the U.S. business where we continue to build momentum with our enterprise account commercial model. International sales in the third quarter increased 8%driven by continued strong growth in emerging markets.","In molecular diagnostics, our core focus and largest business is infectious disease testing where year-to-date sales increased mid-single digits. In the quarter, growth in our infectious disease business was offset by decline in some of our smaller businesses as well as timing of tenders in several emerging markets.","In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 6.7%, representing a sequential improvement from the first two quarter of the year. International sales increased 17% as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. For the fourth quarter, in global diagnostics we\u2019re forecasting mid-to-high single-digits operational sales growth.","In medical devices, vascular sales decreased low single digits in the quarter. Sales growth was relatively flat excluding the impact of the third quarter 2013 sales through up related to a third-party agreement. We continue to see strong market adoption of MitraClip, our breakthrough technology for the treatment of mitral regurgitation and growth from Supera, a peripheral stent for the superficial femoral artery or SFA.","As Miles mentioned during the third quarter, MitraClip received national Medicare coverage and an improved payment rate for the procedure, which will help drive adoption of MitraClip in the U.S. Both structural heart and endovascular products grew double digits in the third quarter globally. In our drug eluting portfolio on September, we presented the first randomized clinical trial result for Absorb our Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold. One year results from the Absorb II study demonstrated that Absorb provides comparable results to science and lower rate of angina or chest pain.","Also in the quarter, we launched additional XIENCE for expanding the potential for Absorb used in more coronary procedures. As we look ahead, we expect to see improvement in vascular sales growth driven by commercial execution and contribution from new products as well as further Absorb penetration as we exit the year. So for the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sequential improvement in growth in the third quarter with relatively flat year-over-year sales on an operational basis.","In diabetes care, global sales in the third quarter were somewhat ahead of our expectations as the rate of decline in the U.S. was moderating. Outside of the U.S. we\u2019re focused on driving growth in both emerging and developed markets in our diabetes care business and recently announced European launch of our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology called FreeStyle Libre. It eliminates routine finger pricks and finger-prick calibration, and with glucose levels discreetly through a sensor that can be worn on the back of the upper arm. In the near term, we\u2019re working to obtain reimbursement for Libre in Europe as well as breakthrough market in a number of additional countries next year.","For the fourth quarter, in our global diabetes business, we expect a mid-single digit decline on an operational basis with international growth offset by the later stages of the market transition in the U.S. in line with our forecast earlier this year. In vision care, sales increased 9% in the third quarter. Sales of our cataract product which represents approximately 70% of our vision care business increased double digits, outpacing the growth of the global cataract market. We continue to capture market share with our recently launched premium intraocular lenses including our TECNIS OptiBlue line of lenses in Japan and our TECNIS Toric lenses in the U.S. and Japan.","In addition, we continue to see strong adoption of our new CATALYS laser cataract system. We are also receiving strong feedback from early adopter of our new TECNIS Symfony extended range of vision intraocular lens that we launched in Europe in the second quarter. TECNIS Symfony provides patients with a continuous range of vision including far, intermediate and near differences but with reduced incidence of halo and glare. And last week, we announced the distribution agreement in the U.S. with Carl Zeiss Meditec, a leading ophthalmology diagnostic company.","The Zeiss product line of diagnostics and visualization systems combined with Abbott's intraocular lenses, lens removal systems and laser cataract systems provide surgeons a comprehensive portfolio of cataract products to maximize the visual outcome and streamline patient flow. For the fourth quarter of the 2014, we expect our global vision care business to grow double digits on an operational basis.","And lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business or EPB where sales from continuing operations that is excluding the developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business increased nearly 13% in the quarter. This strong performance was driven by double digits sales growth across several emerging markets including India, Russia, Mexico, and Vietnam. This business continues to make meaningful progress and becoming a more consumer oriented organization and is focused on expanding products portfolios in key therapeutic areas. Implementing new branding initiatives across the portfolio and increasing its focus on marketing to the pharmacy channel.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, we forecast double-digit sales growth on an operational basis from continuing operations in our emerging markets branded generics business. This includes CFR pharmaceuticals, which is expected to contribute sales of approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter. So in summary, sales growth improves sequentially this quarter as we expected and we exceeded earnings-per-share expectations, raising the midpoint of our full year guidance range. We are on track for another year of double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2014. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","","Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a nice quarter. Miles I wanted to really start with the EPD business and first the updated agreement today with Mylan could you spend a minute on that? Because obviously there was some question about whether that transaction as it was initially constructed. So A, could you comment on that? And then B, the EPT performance of this quarter up 12.9%. Can you just talk about the sustainability of that performance? It seems like a very high number so can you just talk about how we should think about that business going forward, thanks. ","Miles White ","","Well, I assume there is one of the question this morning was some clarity on whether or not that transaction with Mylan is going forward I think that\u2019s clear we reported discontinued operations, - financials et cetera and as we very clearly said in the earnings release yesterday tracking forward no change probably that\u2019s what comment on that. So that was special takeaway some speculation on certainty there and that\u2019s all tracking according to schedule. The performance of the remainder of EPD actually it\u2019s both halves, we\u2019ve actually seen improvement in the developed markets part of the business which is good thing that\u2019s the part that we\u2019re divesting to Mylan. And we've seen improvement in the emerging market piece. I think some improvement in market and economy in few of these markets like India but overall let\u2019s say improvement in the overall performance of the business which we\u2019ve been expecting and waiting for and that was kind of what we intended and what we planned and we\u2019re seeing it. So, that\u2019s gratifying, I think everybody around the world, every company I have seen reporting as expressing caution around economies everywhere and currencies everywhere so forth and I think one issue that I continue to track closely which we\u2019ve obviously less control of then the operating performance of these businesses is just the overall currency volatility around the world and that of course effects this business because it\u2019s purely an ex-U.S. business but other than that I think what we\u2019re seeing here and gradual improvements in our performance in the business is good, that\u2019s good and I\u2019m feeling pretty good about that because as you know earlier in the year we were projecting sequential improvements in this business as the year went on and you guys directly ask about it every quarter and we\u2019re seeing that. Your greatest fear is that you don\u2019t see that so we\u2019re pleased with that now in addition we add CFR to that, CFR\u2019s performance in Latin America has been consistent double-digit growth and that\u2019s also a plus and going forward. So, I think if you look at the underlying performance of the business we exceeded double-digit growth and there is very little CFR in here because of the timing close there is not a lot of CFR in the numbers and even without it business is going double digit. So I\u2019m pleased with what I see in emerging markets when we\u2019re done with the Mylan transaction with the developed market business this business will be purely an emerging market business which has been our strategic intent to focus on because we see the conditions in those markets and the developing economies quite favorable to the business over time. So that remains an important strategic focus for us and I think the investors now will have a much clearer visibility of transparency to the opportunity in those markets. One of the great things about emerging markets is the growth potential there of these economies and the healthcare systems and that\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on that, that\u2019s a very important source of growth, it comes with volatility which means you got to be diverse, you got to be diverse in geographies you\u2019re in fortunately we\u2019re well spread out I think CFR helped us even further with that.","So, I like the prospects for the business and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re seeing the fundamental improve.","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","So Miles, just two quick follow ups if I can. So one obviously one you're confident that the transaction is going to go through. Two, the piece that we talked about that you didn't really address in all of your opening comments of this call was the vascular business which obviously had a difficult quarter. So can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that business strategically and how you turn that business around given your success now in turning around EPD? Thanks.","Miles White ","","Well first of all back to your original question about confidence. We\u2019re right on track with our transaction with Mylan and I\u2019m superstitious enough not to want to speculate or hypothesize or whatever. I would say we\u2019re on track with what we said, what we expected and everything we\u2019re doing is pointed at the conclusion on time, on schedule as described. And I don\u2019t know what else to say about it I don\u2019t really want to get into a lot of speculation about other stuff, but I think it\u2019s, as I said, tracking exactly where we wanted to be. So, that\u2019s about as much as I can say and only thing I should say. The vascular business is a disappointment. There is just no question about that. And this is our performance. You know to a degree, I think all of us competing in this business can look at a slower market, but this isn't about slower markets this is about us. The part of this business where I am most disappointed is the US in us and our performance there. There's a lot of price competition, but you know when there is price competition that price affects everybody, so the whole market is experiencing price competition. I think that there's a fair amount of commoditization that's happening here, its customers returning more and more towards value and less and less toward differentiation and performance of products. And I think when that happens your competitors begin to sell on price and other factors. I think this market has definitely changed.","The dynamics, the competitive dynamics have changed and our approach to it needs to change as well and that's just a fact. For us, you know, if you look at the performance is primarily the stent business and it's primarily the US. Now is there a residual effect in Europe, there is, is there a residual effect in Japan? There is. I\u2019d say in both countries, both geographies, that is Japan and Europe its price. But in addition, I think that there's a definitely a share war going on where the leaders in the category and as such, we\u2019re targeted by everybody else. And we all seem to be dealing with that as well as we should. And I think that's pretty clear. So, at this point, I don't have any projections to make to you other than you've got our full attention.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs ","Thank you good morning everybody. I wanted to sort of follow along the train of thought on the vascular business. And Miles if we make the comparison to the turnaround you may be able to execute on EPD, it seems like it's not completely analogous. And the reason I say that is EPD operated in very attractive end markets largely in the emerging markets. Whereas in vascular the vast majority of the business is in stents which I think would be hard to call an attractive market. So as you think about this business strategically do you need to rethink the business mix or the potential to engage in more aggressive portfolio modification to really change the growth portfolio of that vascular franchise?","Miles White","Well, first of all, let me tell you, I don't see an analogy between this and EPD other than there's been a time when both have performed below our expectations and we frankly - which in the pro forma at or above our expectations, so there is the comparability. Other than that, you\u2019re right. They\u2019re different. The answers to the device business or the stent business are clearly different. The dynamics of the market are different and so on. In our case, I think, there is two things. One is we clearly have to deal with our competitiveness in the stent category and in particular in the US. We simply have to figure out here how to be a lot more competitive than we apparently have been. So that's point number one, point number two beyond that, I think for this business to be a contributor to growth it's got to be broader.","We've got to broaden our footprints here. We've got to broaden into new areas and new innovations. Now, in our case, MitraClip, the peripheral, the longer term prospects for Absorb and frankly any other expansion beyond that, they're all considerations here. We can't just sit here and be a drug-eluding stent company and rely on that. So it's clearly our intent to broaden the business and grow other dimensions of it in the device area. But you have to do that on strong foundations, so we've got to fix the competitiveness of the underlying business first. And we\u2019re clearly looking at how we expand and shape this business going forward. I have no intention of being out of the business, I've no intention of shrinking, I have no intention of any other changes other than full steam ahead, but I\u2019d say the underlying competitiveness and then expansion from there is what's on the table.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay that's helpful for perspective and then maybe just on the underlying business, maybe you could talk a little bit more about adult nutritionals that that is a franchise that looks to be doing reasonably well and it obviously looks to be a pretty big opportunity in China on a go forward basis. Could you maybe just help us understand the adult opportunity that exists in front of you? And then how we should think about the impact that has to the global growth of that nutrition business on a go forward basis.","Miles White","I\u2019d tell you, I think this is a great business and again I always think we can do better at it. And in this case, it\u2019s very different dynamic. We are the adult nutrition business worldwide. And its one where - it's not about riding growth or competing with particular competitors because we're quite large I guess, I would say in the area. So we have to drive the growth and create the demand as well. And the single biggest uncreated opportunity thus far is China. And we\u2019re recently launching into that arena with powder-based products and so forth. We\u2019ll learn our way in here. We think we understand the dynamics of the market, but you always think you understand the dynamics of the market then the market teaches you more.","In this case, we\u2019ve launched. I think there's a big opportunity there. I think there's a future opportunity beyond that, beyond the powder-based business in liquids. And we\u2019re prepared for that as well, but I think we\u2019ll go at this - I don\u2019t want to say cautiously because that's not the right term. But thoughtfully, progressively we\u2019ll establish our distribution, establish our brand, establish our products, establish us in the categories. The dynamics in China are different than the dynamics in the US or other countries of the world their own behaviors and practices as consumers are different and so it\u2019s not like you can just take up a U.S. or European or Latin American model and apply China, you can\u2019t. But I think there is a big opportunity there and I think there is opportunity in the rest of the world to continue to grow the business. In this case, we don\u2019t measure our success so much on shares we do in so many other categories, we measure our success on real growth because our share is high and I think that a very high share and given segment you can\u2019t often too comfortable and that drive the opportunity or the market growth. I don\u2019t think our people are comfortable, I think they all understand there's a much bigger opportunity there to drive growth in this business we certainly do like that. ","And so for me that's a real upside for us that's on our radar screen for a lot of investment attention and as you know we've recently invested in additional plant capacity not only in China and India, but also here in the U.S. in Ohio where we built a brand-new liquid plant that is specifically dedicated to this business. And we\u2019re already into phase 2 expansion there so we've got great expectations of the ability this business to drive growth in the future both here and in the areas overseas. ","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay and maybe lastly for you or Tom, even if you don't monetize the Mylan shares that you'll receive still be sitting on a pretty big chunk of cash fairly under the level of interest rate still level of potentially rising and any updates on how we should think about use of capital going into next year and how you might look to offset the Mylan dilution and any headwinds that might materialize from foreign exchange in 2015. ","Tom Freyman ","Well, you got similar questions there, one is sort of capital allocation and the Mylan shares and then currency so let me just deal with the capital allocation first. I\u2019d say I'm probably not going to tell you right now what our intentions would be or what we\u2019ll do. I'd say your best proxy for that is just to simply to look at we've been good stewards and capital allocators in the past we always pay a healthy dividend, we always try to balance share repurchase, but at the end of the day we also have been investors in strategic growth opportunities and so forth and I think the best expectation is a mix of the above. We\u2019re not going to run the one side of the ship and tip. We\u2019re going to keep things relatively balanced. I think we\u2019ll be opportunistic about our Mylan holding. Obviously, we don't want to do anything to destabilize that holding or either company. And we think that's a pretty strong and valuable investment for us so we can afford to be I\u2019d say thoughtful about the disposition of those shares over time. Although it's not our intent to be long-term shareholders of Mylan I think that's been pretty clear. ","And you know I'm glad to have the capital and the challenge how to best allocated for our investors but I think, if we look at our track record historically we've been pretty good at balancing that for the range of investors we have those that rely on the income those that rely on a cash return those that rely on good strategic investments so forth so, without betraying any future direction here, and certainly time and opportunity can change here so you can expect more of the same from us and not something dramatically different in what you come to expect. ","With regard to currency, I note that a lot of companies that have reported in last couple of weeks a flag caution around currency around the world and you know rightly so. As you know our business is 70% international and in the continued operations now we\u2019ll be about 50% of emerging markets and some of those currencies have been disappointing or volatile if you\u2019re an American company and competing in dollars. And it remains a challenge for us so over the past few years we like other companies have taken quite a dent from currency and I\u2019d point out that over that time as you know the companies made tremendous strides in improving margins improving gross margins and distribution margins and unfortunately well fortunately and unfortunately we've done that because it\u2019s been able to absorb a lot of the currency hit and all pricing pressure that we've experienced around the world over the last couple of years and we still manage to improve margins, but or it would be eroding the bottom line that we\u2019re experiencing. ","So going forward I don't think any American company likes to have to keep dealing with that but for a period of time it appears to me we\u2019re going to be under some exchange pressure at companies around the world and expense in the market basket mix. Over the long term, our best hedge against currency fluctuations is to have our cost basis in the markets where we serve. And what I mean by that is our production, our plans, our products we've got a matchup some of our production in a proportion with profitability of markets and in fact that means producing end markets for the market and a lot of these large emerging markets and even the smaller ones that want foreign investments or want American brands or American companies or frankly European companies they also want you to invest there to build plants and employ people et cetera in their markets and over the long haul the best hedge against currency is to have your costs where your profits are and we happen to have profits in a lot of countries of the world and so we've got to ensure that we have also thought through, how to put some of our production capacity, R&D capacity, and so forth there we can\u2019t solely be exporters from the United States or concentrated places, capital all your cost in India, and exports it to the rest of the world. You've actually got to match it up where your profits are, invest in most countries and mitigate exchange.","So I think over the next three years that's something that's going to get a lot of focus from us and other multinational that are 40%, 50%, 60% international companies and businesses. And you\u2019re going to see many of us working to balance that overtime because to the extent that the kind of currency we've experienced continues, and we expect it to continue in the 2015. I\u2019d say right now, you know, I'm not ready to even start hinting about the 2015. We always start the year targeting double digits. And we always do target double digits. We always set a high bar for ourselves even in small economy. But the hardest part of predicting this is the currencies. And then we still deliver on the top of that.","So I think overtime, the only real way to mitigate currency is to do as I just described. You can head short-term, but that's it short-term, and for the long-term we\u2019ve got to deal with that. Because I think, if we want the growth from a participation of these markets then we've also got to shape our business to deal with the fluctuations of currencies because as you know our investors require us to get it right every quarter.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Miles I just want to come back to a strategic question here and you know and with nutrition back on track and the [receipting] in EPD you have two legs of the stool growing out in excess of the target rate you laid out for Abbott at the spin. Devices is the obvious departure which is more vascular and diabetes but one of your larger diversified peers is actually getting smaller in devices. And I guess the question is even though everyone's discussing large device consolidation, in light of the strength you have in the other two legs, and arguably better secular fundamentals in this business is why even bother getting much bigger in devices versus doing tuck in technologies for focusing on better execution?","Miles White","Well, I\u2019d say two things. First of all, I\u2019ll correct you a little bit and say I got three major businesses that are doing really well. I think diagnostics is doing well too. And I think relative to the kind of opportunities diagnostics has and how it\u2019s been performing, it\u2019s been a really solid performer over the last few years and has a hell of the bank of systems and new products coming. So, I think your analysis and I'd say look - and by the way I haven't told nutrition are back on track, you just did. But I keep the fire to our feet here on this performance. But, okay, let\u2019s take you description and say, the established pharmaceutical business and nutrition are trending in the right direction in terms of growth, expansion and so forth.","I think diagnostics is going to be a very solid performer at least devices. And I would take that in three pieces and say, you know the diabetes cure business actually I think is doing very well. I think they've stabilized the underlining business relative to the competitive bidding dynamics of the U.S. Every major competitor took their hit there. We just launched a unique, and I say spectacular products that in Europe at this point, that I think is going to drive a whole new generation of performance there that we\u2019re excited about. So I think in terms of things that we would do for our diabetes care business, we're pretty happy with how that's progressing at this point.","In our medical optics business, it\u2019s best-performing division in the company right now, which is ironic because as you know for a couple of years after we acquired it, we kept reporting disappointing performance to you, and of course you all really challenge us on that. But that business is performing well, taking share in its business. It's had a great run here of new product delivery and continues to. So, I like what I see and medical devices out of those two businesses at this point, good innovation, good R&D productivity, good commercial execution, good expansion, good platform, I just can't say enough good about it. That leaves vascular and vascular has got challenges, which I already talked about.","So, that\u2019s the one part of our release where you\u2019d say I am disappointed in the trajectory of disappointed in what I see in terms of performance. And we know that. I mean, nobody is going to be surprised to hear me say that over the phone. So, you can look at it any number of ways, you can say, well that's not very good any more. We\u2019ll just do something with that or shrink or just get rid of it or whatever. And I don't want to think that's necessary. I think right now our issue isn't - you can say the market is slower. All markets are slower. All markets are slower. There's no question about that. First issue here is our performance, our strategy, our execution, how we\u2019re doing our business in these markets.","And relative to our competitors, I don't think you abandon commitment to our investments in the business because of your own execution I think you go picture execution. And in our case, that's what I'm going to focus on. Do I think there's still a lot of opportunity in medical devices? I do. I think there is opportunity there are some segments of medical devices that are attractive to us and some that are not. There's some that we would not choose to be in and having chosen to be in, and there are some that we would choose to be in. And I'd say that ebbs and flows, it's not clear given point in time, what\u2019s going to evolve, what\u2019s going to develop.","I\u2019d say we all know that the easy part of it with a big tailwind of innovation funded by government reimbursements and so forth, that's not as easy anymore. Now you've really got to compete, and you've really got to be innovative, and you've really got to be better at it in your competition and you got to put a value proposition on the table with a product somebody wants and is willing to pay for it. So I think right now my focus on the device business is both fixing the base of that particular business as I described, and looking at where we would selectively choose to invest or expand I think one of the benefits of being large and diverse as we are is that we can afford to absorb occasional poor performance or economic downturn or whatever the case maybe and fix the business or improve its performance but we can afford to be patient about what new opportunities may come along and where we want to invest. There've been a number of transactions that we've done over time to build the company that have been from a timing standpoint opportunistic. ","We track those businesses and those segments for a long period of time and when an opportunity presented itself that fit and it was economically good for us and our investors then we pounced on it. And I think in this case some dimensions of the future of the device business require some patience here because the markets as you know aren't as favorable as they could be and it's not clear when that will change and it's not clear where the new opportunities in some of the areas of devices will be attractive. But I think for the long-term and especially in some out of the U.S. geographies and so forth there is still a lot of opportunities here so I\u2019m not ready to throw the challenge and miss it all.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","And Miles just to follow-up on something you mentioned on nutrition, U.S. adult very very strong, your pediatric maybe little less so. Is pediatric the business that you\u2019d like to see greater improvement and what steps need to be taken to do that?","Miles White ","I'm not sure I understood the question there. ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","","Just in terms of nutrition, we had all U.S. adult very strong and in pediatric maybe not as strong as we expected and given your comments on nutrition back on track but not quite where you wanted I wonder it\u2019s the area of improvement is that more in pediatric than this is in adult and what specifically has to happen in pediatric nutrition to improve that performance.?","Miles White ","Yes, okay. As you know, over the last 3-4 years there has been some largely there that impacted the pediatric nutrition business usually in China. And the recall that we had over a year ago clearly affected the business in China and several other countries. And when that happens to the pediatric business it typically takes a year or more to recover. And you might note that one of our competitors who was impacted more than we were by that particular recall has not recovered and we have. So, I think first thing I'd say is our team in China and Saudi Arabia and other places, Vietnam they\u2019ve done a wonderful job recovering not only share they had in the market but performance trajectory, brand confidence with the consumer et cetera and we\u2019re seeing that now. ","While we completely there we\u2019re close that cost a year\u2019s worth of growth and base and so forth to those countries. We're in a good trajectory in China a lot of new product launches are going on right now that are driving us I think very nicely, I'm not sure we\u2019re going to be satisfied and let ourselves to be satisfied in pediatric business in China until we've taken incremental share over and above where we were when the recall happened but we\u2019re on a good trajectory there and I think the team is doing well at that. ","We\u2019ve a launched a lot of new products around the world country by country over the last three years, our R&D productivity in the nutrition business has been exceptional, tops in the company and then put a lot of new products into the marketplace and it's our own commercial execution that needs to make those products successful in those markets. So I'd say, we're in so many countries that the opportunity from a pediatric standpoint is really strong, really good, and driven by good demographic circumstances in those countries and economic development circumstances.","So I\u2019m pleased with all of that. As I turn to the U.S., the U.S. has always been Abbott competition there's no tailwind of growth for the pediatric business in the United States, this is hand-to-hand combat. That's primarily Mead Johnson. And they\u2019re to be respected for medical competitor and they make us better and hopefully we make them better I think they're a very strong competitor with both relatively equivalent share in the United States and we just slug it out every day and I think that puts a lot of pressure on both companies to be innovative, to perform well, to always be looking at new ways to reach the consumer. And the medical community and in our case I think we've done really well. I think that our share growth, our share gain in various segments of the business has been excellent and if you asked me if I'm satisfied I'm never satisfied. I always want us to do better than we've done and I think the attention that we give that business is warranted and we've got a lot of attention on that business. Because I think it can do even better than it has I think we've got really good management team there and I think the opportunity and the upside for us is good. It's not a market driven growth, it\u2019s a competition driven growth we have to compete. ","And I tell the people in the company that if you really want to see head-to-head competition and understand what competition looks like in a business whether the pediatric nutrition business because in every country of the world it is head-to-head with our competitors. And I think we've done really well there from share standpoint and gross standpoint to access that market so that gets a lot of attention and focus for us. It\u2019s a profitable business, it generates strong cash flow. I like everything about it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Good morning, thanks for taking the question, so just one multi-part question for me just starting with the Mylan deal. I think when you announced the deal you said it would be $0.22 diluted any update from the new terms? And how should we think about EPS growth off of the 2014 base with the Mylan dilution and the CFR accretion? And just lastly on the same theme, I think Miles in the past you said that you tried to make up any delusion from M&A. Is that still the case following the Mylan deal? Thank you. ","Miles White","Going down the list, no change at all in our --","Thomas Freyman","Just to be clear that\u2019s comps.","Miles White","No change at all on our forecast of 2015 impact of the divestiture of the developed markets business for EPD to the Mylan. That stays at the $0.22. We estimated that in July. CFR, the way to think about that is we indicated that would add $0.07 to any baseline, you would develop in 2015. And the third question was, was what Larry?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","I think in the past you and Miles, I think it's Miles, I think I've heard say that you would try to make up any dilution from the M&A, is that still the case here? ","Thomas Freyman","I mean I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s quite the right way to phrase to I mean. We are very sensitive to dilution and I think if you go back and the many deals we\u2019ve done in the last several years, investors have not been impacted by dilution on any deal and so our efforts have always been that if there is some modest impact of the business that we find the way to manage through that without impacting investors. And I think that\u2019s the way to approach it and that\u2019s definitely in our history and I continue to be way we think about deals going forward.","Miles White","You know, Larry, I would just add to it. There is $0.22 on this divestiture of this business and that\u2019s - its chunk of make up now obviously our EPS well figured in that, but that all chunk of makeup. CFR will offset fair amount of that. And then I would only point out that to the question earlier, we aren\u2019t constrained with capital in terms of opportunities. But we want to be opportunistic in terms of any opportunities that we had with the company, so I don\u2019t want to just rush out and you\u2019re not suggesting this I understand. But obviously deploy capital is simply replace EPS and in long-term I am always looking to build EPS and grow the Company.","So we clearly with not only the continuing cash we earn and accumulate, but as the Mylan proceeds and so forth have tremendous flexibility for M&A and kind of without constraint. The only thing that constrains us is opportunities and fit of those opportunities and so on. So I think to the degree that they are investors who look at the net let\u2019s call it dilution from the sale of scaffold product business in the developed markets to Mylan, I would say be patient, you can\u2019t offset that or fix that in a few weeks, but longer term obviously our motive is to grow and improve the company. And I just can\u2019t predict the timing of that, but I can certainly figure all the possibility in the all deal is.","Thomas Freyman","And Larry, I\u2019ll just add one more thing to what Miles said and the way I entered the question. Obviously, Miles just pointed in the near term we will have - we won\u2019t have the earning of that particular business, but as we talked about that in July and as you saw on this quarter and this first quarter reported continuing operation, you saw significantly enhanced top line growth rate, a better bottom line growth rate and that obviously investors like that message when we deliver in July and that\u2019s when we shouldn\u2019t lose as we move into 2015.","Operator","Our final question today is from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks. Morning Miles, hi Tom. Miles you've approach this in multiple ways but I'd sort of like to ask you more directly when I think about the last year or so you've done an amazing amount of operational and portfolio reshaping. I mean clearly it seems like vascular is something that you're going to be paying more attention to. But if you list the top three priorities for your attention here where are you focused and you know operationally and portfolio perspective now that you've addressed so many of the major challenges? ","Miles White","I am focused on vascular and I am focused on devices. I think, you think about where you spend your time it\u2019s not like you run the one thing and only spend your time there. I mean they all got a lot of time and attention from all of us, but we know very clearly where we\u2019re headed and what we want to execute. What we have to do in almost every business here where we don\u2019t seem to be executing or defining that future as well is clearly in the vascular business and I think it\u2019s not even devices it\u2019s the vascular business and we can think of the vascular business as vascular we can think of it more broadly as medical devices exclusive of optics and probably just care center for minute and I\u2019d say that particular leg has both fix it dimension to it and an expansion of future strategy dimension to it and its capital so that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to get a lot of attention from all of us and more or so I mean I would say we believe we have been paying sufficient attention to all the things necessary in that business but clearly it shows in the performance right now but that\u2019s not sufficient and we\u2019ve got to take through this a lot more thoroughly.","And I think thinking from a standpoint of being more successful we just got to be a lot more successful not only in the current business but in the future. So, I guess if you said where is the majority of my worry time spent or my focus time or strategy time or whatever it\u2019s with my folks in the vascular business now.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","","Got you. And just to last operational questions. If you could talk a bit more about China are you back to normal in China? And do you think the new plant distribution from Tera, the new products had we think about growth and share there you know over the next year or two? It seems like there could be it could be quite extraordinary. And just last briefly remind us on the flash FreeStyle, how big the opportunity is, I know the market is huge, how big an opportunity how big a product could this be? And remind us about the US approval and launch times thanks so much? ","Miles White ","","Okay, with - China yes, I think we\u2019re back to where we were or we ahead of where were, we made up for the last year no but we\u2019re back to where we were in my view. And with regard to prospects in China going forward I\u2019d say the sort of the near term and the long term, the near term is often a bumpy ride in China and that can be because of local conditions, it can be economy, it can be the government, it can be the unexpected recall it can be anything, China is a bumpy ride and yes, it\u2019s a very attractive long term market so we made long term commitments and investments and have a long term strategy there including the ownership and development of our own dairies and own milk supply inside the country and I think that is unique among multinationals at this point. We\u2019ve ensured our own supply and our own access to ingredients at a very high quality level et cetera and I think for the long term that makes a big difference we\u2019re very very well positioned. So, I think the prospects in China are very good for the long term in spite of the fact that it\u2019s an occasionally bumpy ride okay and I think the underlying potential dynamics are all very strong and very good, it\u2019s a very competitive place, it\u2019s a different place to do business. But I can say that about any market around the world and I know people say it would they tend to lump emerging markets together like they\u2019re all the same, they\u2019re not the same and they\u2019re no two that\u2019s same and yes, they represent tremendous growth and I think China does in particular. Now in our case, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty spread across a lot of foreign markets and emerging markets around the world because we don\u2019t want to be over dependent on just China, just India, just Russia, just Brazil et cetera. So as you know with our CFR transaction, CFR doesn\u2019t happen to be substantial in Brazil or Mexico or very large market it\u2019s in a log of next level markets medium size et cetera where there is tremendous opportunities.","In our case we don\u2019t risk to over index necessarily just in China or India now when - market we want to be very successful in it so with the largest healthcare company, largest pharmaceutical company in India and I like that position but at the same time our share is at a point where there is still tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us we just don\u2019t want to be over dependent on any one market and while China is a tremendous growth opportunity so it\u2019s the rest of the world. ","With regard to Libre which is the flash glucose product just reference I don\u2019t know what I can tell you about the potential is to be honest I think we\u2019re going on at the beginning here with I think modest financial expectations but aggressive marketing intent, we\u2019re going at this a different way, I don\u2019t want to be overly reliance on reimbursement because I think this product has tremendous consumer or user appeal for the insulin dependent diabetic and I think the experience for that particular patient or user is so superior to what\u2019s available today or what they can do today that I think our challenge is to establish the value proposition and the product and it\u2019s benefits and it\u2019s use and it\u2019s experience to that patient group. And if we do that well then it won\u2019t as dependent on get keeping your hurdles of government reimbursement et cetera although it may be well enhanced by that at some point but we\u2019re trying to go about it more from a consumer approach perspective and go direct to the patient with this and to the extent that all regulatory circumstances allow. So, I think that\u2019s got great potential opportunity I don\u2019t know how to put a dollar value on that yet so I\u2019m reluctant to kind of ","Forecast one. Our team in diabetes care knows that almost any number they give me won\u2019t meet my expectations and I think that\u2019s kind of how we live it internally right now it\u2019s not clear that can completely project what the uptick will be or how fast but we\u2019re very pleased by initial reactions of consumers and professionals and physicians and so forth. And I think after we\u2019ve had some months of experience we\u2019ll be better able to put some numbers around what we expect here in terms of continuing trajectories, expansion share gain et cetera in the biggest user group there is which is insulin dependent diabetic and the frequent tester. So I think that\u2019s the best I can tell you about that at this point, right now we got an awful lot of expectation and hope and we\u2019re not overly focused on meeting particular numbers because right now the numbers are small of course because that\u2019s the initial launch phase but it\u2019s launched in 7 new countries and that\u2019s going to be pretty good test for us.","Brian Yoor","","Okay, thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks. Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2020.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.","With that I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. 2019 was another highly successful year for Abbott. Our focused execution resulted in strong financial performance, including ongoing earnings per share of $3.24, reflecting 12.5% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency. All four of our businesses performed well contributing to full-year organic sales growth of more than 7.5%, which is above the guidance range we set at the beginning of last year. The successful year was capped off by a strong fourth quarter with organic sales growth of 8.5%, including double-digit sales growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, and Core Laboratory Diagnostics, along with ongoing EPS growth of more than 17%.","Our consistent strong performance demonstrates that our business model is working exactly as intended. We've built the Company very deliberately through a multi-year process to deliver superior results for years to come. We've shaped our businesses to align with important trends to make sure we're in the right places with the right products and we've targeted businesses that are focused on some of the world's greatest healthcare concerns, for example, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are two of the most significant healthcare challenges of our lifetime. They are chronic, long lasting, and dramatically increasing in prevalence around the world.","Nearly every healthcare decision begins with a diagnostic test. And this testing not only occurs in the traditional hospital setting, but also increasingly at alternate sites such as physicians' offices, pharmacies, and even at home. Proper nutrition is the foundational element of good health across every stage of life whether you're a newborn baby, a child striving to grow, or an aging adult working to overcome a health condition. And access to healthcare continues to expand rapidly in emerging markets where 85% of the world's population resides.","We shaped our Company to achieve scale and leadership positions in all of these areas. The investments we've made and our focus on execution are working. Our product pipelines are strong, our operating culture is strong, and we're well positioned to achieve sustainable strong growth for years to come.","For 2020, we're forecasting another year of top tier financial performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.65, reflecting double-digit growth.","I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2019 results and 2020 outlook for each business, and I'll start with Diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the fourth quarter led by double-digit growth in core laboratory testing. The rollout of Alinity continues to go well in Europe where we're winning new business at a high rate and successfully renewing existing contracts that come up for bid. We continue to expand our rollout of Alinity systems across multiple key markets including US, where last year we obtained FDA approval of Alinity for blood and plasma screening and have made significant progress obtaining regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry test menu.","I'll turn now to Nutrition where sales increased 6% in the quarter, led by strong growth across several countries and segments of our business, including Southeast Asia and Latin America, across both Pediatric and Adult Nutrition as well as above market growth in the US. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth was driven by PediaSure, our nutrition solutions to help kids grow and thrive; and Pedialyte, our oral rehydration product which continues to see unprecedented uptick with both children and adults. In Adult Nutrition, global growth of 10% in the fourth quarter was led by Ensure, our leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna our leading brand for people with diabetes.","Moving now to Medical Devices, where sales increased nearly 11.5% in the fourth quarter led by double-digit growth in Structural Heart, Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, and Heart Failure. In Structural Heart, sales increased 17% in the fourth quarter. Over the last couple of years, our portfolio and long-term growth opportunities in this area have strengthened considerably. We've been building our position organically in this area for quite some time, when in 2017, the combination with St. Jude created what I'd now consider a best-in-class Structural Heart portfolio.","MitraClip, our market leading device for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation or a leaky heart valve is the cornerstone of our portfolio with annual sales this past year of nearly $700 million, growing 30%. Last year, we obtained an important new indication in the US that significantly expands the number of people that can be treated with MitraClip. And just last week, we announced that we are initiating a clinical trial that offers the potential to expand the treatable patient population even further.","Beyond MitraClip, several exciting technologies are expected to emerge from our Structural Heart pipeline in 2020, including CE Mark approvals for TriClip, a first of its kind technology to repair leaky tricuspid heart valves; and for Tendyne, which targets replacement of the mitral valve, as well as US approval of Portico for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.","Turning now to Diabetes Care where sales increased nearly 35% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system. Several years back, we saw an opportunity to approach continuous glucose monitoring or CGM in a fundamentally different manner compared to others in the space. We challenged ourselves to rethink existing paradigms as we sought to develop a solution that would truly benefit the mass population of people living with diabetes around the world. That aspiration influenced every aspect of Libre, highly accurate, simple to use, particularly affordable, and easy for patients to access.","The results of our unique approach have been remarkable by any measure. Libre has quickly become the global market-leading wearable CGM. Its user base has roughly doubled each year to its current level of approximately 2 million users globally, including the highest user base among CGMs in the US. Reimbursement coverage has ramped up quickly around the world as payers increasingly recognize its highly differentiated value proposition. And it's only CGM that's widely available through the pharmacy channel, which is a significant benefit for patients as it simplifies the process of acquiring the product.","In 2019, Libre achieved full year sales approaching $2 billion, an increase of 70% versus the prior year. And importantly, as we plan for the substantial growth opportunity to come, we significantly expanded our manufacturing capacity to keep up with anticipated demand for this life-changing technology.","Now, I'll wrap up with Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 10% in the quarter led by growth across several geographies in Latin America and Asia. For the full year, sales increased 7% for the second year in a row, as this business continues to execute its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets. These markets are growing rapidly, their populations are aging, their middle classes are expanding and healthcare spending is increasing due to improving access to healthcare. Our strategy to build a significant presence and scale in these markets is unique and continues to result in strong growth.","So in summary, this was another highly successful year with strong performance across our businesses. We continue to strengthen our leadership positions in some of the largest and fastest growing areas in healthcare and we're entering 2020 with great momentum across our businesses and targeting another year of strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2019 results and 2020 outlook in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to our results; sales for the fourth quarter increased 8.5%. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales. The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 12.8% lower than our previous full year guidance of around 14.5%, due to continued implementation of and adaptation to the US tax reform regulations. Our fourth quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to achieve our full year revised effective tax rate of 14%.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2020, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.55 to $3.65. For the full year we forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 0.05% on our full year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, offset by the impact of investments to support the rapid market adoption of our Alinity diagnostic systems, investments in Libre and MitraClip manufacturing capacity expansions and the impact of currency mix. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. We forecast net interest expense of around $515 million and non-operating income around $200 million. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 13.5% to 14% for the full year 2020.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted EPS of $0.69 to $0.71 which reflects double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7% and at current rates would expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 1% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 58.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 32% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $130 million in the first quarter.","Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid to high single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Nutrition, we forecast growth of around 4% for the full year and growth of 3% to 4% for the first quarter. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid to high single-digit growth for both the first quarter and full year, and in Medical Devices, we forecast double-digit growth similar to last year for both the first quarter and full year.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess, first, Miles congratulations on such an incredible run of 20 plus years of value creation, obviously incredibly impressive track record. And in light of that the first question, I'd love to ask, both you and Robert to comment on a topic, that I know is on the minds of most investors from a big picture perspective and that is the durability of the incredible 7% revenue growth outlook that you guys have expressed for 2020 and beyond. And the main reason I want to ask that question is that when you take a step back, there is no other company in med-tech modeling anything close to that kind of growth off of that large of a base, especially for multiple years. So Miles for you, I guess, just if you wouldn't mind providing some big picture thoughts on that durability topic. And then for Robert maybe getting a little bit more specific on the product areas that give you the confidence long term and whether or not M&A or divestitures could play a slightly bigger role going forward to help you maintain that level of growth? Thank you.","Miles White","Bob, this is Miles. There is a temptation to sort of say something that sticks my successor with just unbelievable goals for the future, etc., is overwhelming. So, I'm going to speak first. Seriously, we have been building what we've got here for an extended period of time. It didn't just happen. It's not based on a single driving product or driving business. It's actually quite broad-based across all of our businesses. And while you know, a lot of people have commented to me or us that gee, you get the lot of big numbers and you know hard for a big company to grow, etc., we don't actually feel like that big a company.","And we don't necessarily feel even though we've got leading positions in so many of our businesses, we don't actually feel like a lot of big numbers is working against us. We feel like the opportunity for growth, if you've got an innovative pipeline and you're in markets, where there is a natural tailwind of growth demographically or from an innovation standpoint and so on, yes, I don't really think that this whole notion of gee, our size or big numbers applies. If we were a tech company, you wouldn't be asking us that, because we'd be too small.","So, you know, I think if we look at the size of the opportunities where we place the Company and its businesses and the portfolio of products and geographies and so forth, I think there is enormous market opportunity that's untapped. And I think there is enormous penetration to be tapped, and I think there are some obvious examples out there. And fortunately in all of our businesses, I think every one of them is innovating and creating new products and innovating to replace older products in a way that's really never been true before and it's across the board. And so, as we look forward to that and model it, we think our growth rates are sustainable. How far out are they sustainable? I don't know, but years anyway.","And are we going to have speed bumps? We're going to have speed bumps of our own making, we're going to have speed bumps from trade, we're going to have speed bumps from exchange, we're going to have speed bumps in any number of ways, as all companies have and do, and yet we -- and we have them now, and we're still growing at a very healthy strong rate. And I credit the innovation pipeline, some smart acquisitions at the right time, with the right businesses, the right strategies, the right fits, I credit the execution of our organization and the culture of execution that is here. I have super confidence in my successor, no qualms. The minute you retire, everybody thinks you ought to diversify your holdings, because you're too concentrated in one thing. I only wish I had more.","And I'll remind them every day that I'm a shareholder, which he knows, but I have nothing but confidence in the pipeline, the management, the products, the strategies, and the new leader, who is going to take over from me, I have tremendous confidence in Robert, and he's got all the abilities, all the skills, etc. So, we can keep talking about the lot of big numbers and gee, how do you grow on this base? We don't feel slowed or anything by that. We feel like we've got tremendous opportunity to sustain our growth rates.","Robert Ford","Yes, Bob, this is Robert here. As you're aware, under Miles' leadership last 20 plus years, Abbott has been reshaped several times. I was close to him and to the Board when we went through this last reshaping of the Company to really position and align our businesses to kind of high growth markets, geographies, etc. And as Miles said, it wasn't just the acquisition piece of it, which was important, but it was also how we looked at our internal R&D, our internal innovation, how we thought about it. So obviously with the transition here to CEO, there's the natural question of the incoming. Do they think differently? Is there a change in strategy? Is there a different way of thinking? And I can tell you, I'm very much aligned with Miles.","We see things very similar as it relates to our strategy, how we operate, the philosophy of the Company, the vision we have for Abbott. And in the last 18 months for me, in particular to be kind of close to Miles during this transition period, being closer to him with his mentorship and learning how he has been able to kind of create value as you referenced in the beginning there, that leaves me with my number 1 priority to do that is to really execute as Miles said on these organic growth opportunities we have. And we have multiple growth drivers as you know, Bob that, in my opinion they're in their very early stages, whether it's Libre, the Alinity rollout, our rejuvenated cardiovascular portfolio, I think we've got a great opportunity in our adult International Nutrition business, our branded generic pharmaceutical business in the emerging markets, which is a very unique strategy.","So I look at all of that and I think your question how sustainable is this. I think all these opportunities are in the early stages here, and it's really going to be up to me and the team here to make sure that we maximize on all of these opportunities. So we've got a portfolio that's aligned to the biggest areas of medical need, attractive geographies. As Miles said about the pipeline, it's a very rich pipeline. We talk about how this pipeline has evolved, and how we haven't seen as rich as a pipeline at Abbott in a long time, and it's a nice cadence also. It's not just a kind of won and done. We've got multiple kind of rollouts here.","Our operate -- the way we operate is very strong. Miles talked about our culture. We set high aspirations for ourselves, and we do have a culture of accountability, of execution, and then you layer that in with 100,000 of the colleagues around the world that are passionate, they care about what they're doing, they believe in what we're doing, they believe in our strategy. I think we've got all the elements here to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate going forward.","Bob Hopkins","Great, that's super helpful. Just one super short follow-up on Diabetes. Robert, if you wouldn't mind just giving us a quick update on Libre 2 timelines and your thoughts there. And then if you're willing to give us a sense for in your 2020 guidance, what sort of growth assumption are you making for Libre in 2020? Thank you.","Robert Ford","Sure. So on Libre 2, specifically last October, I mentioned that we were working through a handful of issues. Quite frankly, we encounter this handful of issues in other parts of our business too, so it's nothing that's for us is terribly surprising. It's normal. I'm not going to go into any of the real specifics here. But what I will say, Bob, is that since that time in October, I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made. And I continue to be very confident in Libre 2 and its performance and the product itself and its iCGM label.","So regarding the guidance on Libre 2, what I can tell you is that we've got a lot of growth. We -- our guidance contemplates [ph] a lot of Libre growth. So we're not necessarily differentiating here between one and two. But if you look at our Q4, we had a great Q4 with Libre and that's without Libre 2 in the US. It was a great way to exit and to enter 2020. As Miles said, we're the market leader in CGM in revenue and in the amount of patients, and we're growing at twice the rate.","Our strategy here, has always been Miles talked about challenging some of the paradigms. It has always been from the moment we launched, to look at this as a more kind of consumer, retail, kind of web shop online play here. So when you look at our Q4, you don't see that kind of big Q4 spike and then drop in Q1, which you usually see from kind of medical benefit DME products. Our growth is very kind of consistent and sequential.","The US has done very well in the year. Obviously, we want to do better, but we exited the year with well over 0.5 million patients in the US. We set up some goals for 2019, as it relates to distribution, payer coverage in the US, formulary positions. And we exited 2019 exactly where we wanted to be, with all of those goals, all favorable to Libre.","So, our focus in the US in 2020 here is really to take advantage of what we've established in terms of the infrastructure and drive demand. So you'll see more TV advertising, you'll see more sales force expansion, you'll see more partnerships and execution of those partnerships, you'll see more sampling. And I think that, that same momentum that you see in the US is also there in our international markets, which is obviously a much larger base for us, and we saw great momentum in Q4.","So our 2020 here is really focusing on international markets as expanding Libre into geographies that we haven't yet launched. We were capacity constrained in 2019 to the several markets that we haven't launched, and we put in place now plans to roll Libre into those new geographies and rollout Libre 2 into some of those Libre 1 markets.","One thing I think is important to kind of put front and center here is the clinical aspect of Libre. It is the most studied CGM right now. And if you look at the data, whether it's our data, whether it's real world evidence data, whether it's third-party government sponsored trials, they all say the same thing, which is people that use Libre have better outcomes. They live better. They have let -- their A1c drops. Their hypo drops. Their rate of hospitalization goes down. So that the value proposition that we've always envisioned for Libre not only is it intact, but we actually see it growing. It's an easy to use, intuitive, consumer-friendly product that delivers the outcomes that are real and measurable and it's priced for mass adoption, it's affordable.","We always saw the therapy benefit not only for type 1s and for pumpers, we saw this therapy benefit for people that were on one shot a day insulin, oral med patients. So we always looked at this market to be 80 million to 100 million people. Now, is it going to penetrate all the 100 million people? That might be a little bit too aspirational. But what I would say, is it more than 2 million, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million people? Absolutely. And that's how we're building our strategy, investing in the product, investing in the awareness and investing in the scalability, so we can capitalize on this opportunity.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks for taking the question. I'll echo Bob's sentiment. Miles, sorry to see you go, but we're very happy to have someone so confident as Robert step in. Maybe if we could turn to Structural Heart. I was wondering if you could give an update on where we are with reimbursement and MitraClip? And then also a bit more broadly, Miles, you talked about some of the new product launches we're going to see in 2020. Maybe you could just walk us through those and the expectations throughout the year?","Robert Ford","Sure, Robbie. I'll take that. On MitraClip listen, we had a great quarter, had a great year, and as Miles said in his comments about $700 million product growing at 30%. And the interesting thing here is that the penetration of the therapy is only at about 5%, right. So we see a long opportunity. I talked about MitraClip being a multi-year, multi-billion dollar opportunity here. And there's several elements to that. CMS reimbursement is an important building block. We expect that some time in Q2. But I've always said that it was more than just the CMS reimbursement for the indication expansion we got. We know that we need to be able to penetrate the therapy. We need to open new centers, make it more available. To do that, we need to hire more reps, invest in field clinical teams to be able to get that penetration. And we've also invested in a lot of clinical evidence and building clinical evidence here, we just recently announced our study to investigate MitraClip in moderate risk surgical patients.","So again, we've been investing to build this market and obviously MitraClip gets a lot of attention in the Structural Heart portfolio. But if I take a step back here, I think it's important that we look at, we've always seen valvular heart disease as a big opportunity for Abbott, whether it's the demographics, whether it's the medical need. And we saw this unique opportunity with the St. Jude acquisition to put together our MitraClip capabilities with the portfolio, St. Jude and really create a standalone business unit that was best-in-class for Structural Heart. And we did that and it's been about two years that we've done that. And I -- I think we're seeing really the impact of the effect of a dedicated team, R&D, clinical, and we've got a nice cadence of products coming out this year as a result of that work.","We've got two new CE approvals that we expect this year, Miles mentioned them, TriClip. This is a modified version of our MitraClip to treat the leaky heart valve. We believe it's a big opportunity, because the therapy -- if mitral therapy is low, tricuspid leaky valve treatment or repair is even lower. So we know that -- we know how to build this. We did it with mitral, and we're going to go about doing it the same way, building the capability, the clinical evidence.","Another big opportunity we have is with Tendyne. This will be the first minimally invasive mitral replacement valve. So if you think about our team right now, we've built a lot of competency on mitral repair, and now we're going to put in the hands of this team not only the opportunity to offer repair, but also a replacement solution that's minimally invasive. And I think there is a great opportunity for us in that space too. Both those products are enrolling here in the US. So we do plan to bring those to the US.","On the aortic side, we've made investments on Portico. We knew that we needed to make some clinical and some R&D investments here to increase the competitiveness of the system, and we like the data. We think there is going to be a segment of the population, segment of the market that we will be able to compete effectively. It's under FDA review, and we expect approval shortly.","And then finally on our Structural intervention, this is a part of the portfolio that doesn't get a lot of attention here, but it's about a quarter of our Structural Heart business. It's growing double-digit. We've got great products there. We've seen a great ramp up with our stroke prevention technology, with PFO, our congenital business, and Amulet, which is right now under clinical evaluation in the US for treatment of LAA.","So I take a step back here, I said, yes, MitraClip is a big growth driver, and we got a lot of things going right there. We're making the right investments from a clinical, from a commercial perspective. But I look at the portfolio that's been built here and I'm very excited, it's very complete, it's very differentiated and there is a nice cadence, Robbie, to the launches.","Robbie Marcus","Great, I appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Alinity still hasn't really start its launch in the US, yes, you put up 13% growth in Core Lab in the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about the impact in 2020 from Alinity both in the US and outside the US?","Robert Ford","Yes, I think that we're going to continue to see this kind of rollout of the Alinity platform. The challenge we had a little bit in the US and Miles talked about the progress we made is that, when we launched it in Europe, we had a more complete kind of assay menu. And that allowed us to more -- with more intentionality go after the market, the existing accounts, new accounts. And then the US, we've now achieved, let's say a critical mass of assay menu, test panel etc., that allows us to have that same kind of intentionality we had in Europe, have that same intentionality move into the US. Q4, we did have some capital sales, so that brings up the growth rate a little bit. But I think you're going to see the same kind of growth rate in the US, the same kind of ramp up that we saw in Europe.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but I'll reiterate Miles, there's some fairly significant and unique value creation over these last 20 years. So congratulations again on behalf of shareholders. Robert and Miles just starting off with a couple of businesses that had lagged in 2019 that are actually showing some improvement here in the back half of '19, which were Neuromodulation and CRM, some pretty decent improvement, specifically in the fourth quarter. I mean, Robert, you can just talk through what specific changes have been made in those two businesses? And how you're thinking about the outlook or sustainability of those franchises into 2020? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Robert Ford","Sure. So let's start over with Neuro then. I mean I think we had a tough year, full year in Neuro, when we came into the year, we talked about some of the challenges we were up against. And there are really two we had, obviously the sales force expansion and some of the disruption that, that created. But we felt it was important to do, to make that sales force expansion. And then some of the market declines that we saw. We're kind of seeing double-digit growths and beginning of the year kind of saw that go to flat and even negative growth rate.","So I think the sales force expansion piece, we kind of got past that in the middle of the year. It's a unique selling model, about 30% to 35% of our sales team in the US was new, was under a year. So we spend a lot of time getting them up to speed, not only with their territories, but how to go about the selling process, etc. And I think that's -- that's largely behind us. Now obviously if you look at the sales reps, the ones that have 7 to 10 years of experience, they're much more productive than the ones that have got 12 months, but we're seeing a nice steady ramp up in terms of the productivity of those new sales reps.","And the other thing we talked about was how innovation and new product launches could kind of fuel the market growth? And I think you saw that in Q4 not only with us, but even with some of the other players in the market come out with new product launches, at least what I see now from some of the pre-announcements having kind of an impact there.","And so we came out with our product launch, Proclaim XR early in Q4, and I think you saw the impact of that in Q4. I think it's a modest -- it was a modest improvement, we expect more. And a lot of our focus here in 2020 is going to be to ensure that this new sales team has got innovation to sell. So we're expanding our MRI portfolio. We know we need to do. We're launching a new radio frequency ablation generator. This is an important part of our customers' practices, and we felt that we weren't as competitive with our offering there.","So we developed a new system that will be rolling out this year. And we also believe that programming and connectivity -- connectivity to devices, consumer devices is an important aspect, patient adoption of the therapy. So we'll continue to work on how we integrate to implant the device into those -- those more consumer products. So we've got a nice cadence of rollouts there.","And on the CRM side, we talked about this in the beginning of last year, we had -- we encountered some challenges. And we felt that one of the things that we needed to do for the CRM side was to make sure, it got more focus and more attention, not only from -- not only from me obviously, but from the management team. So we made an organizational structure change. Q1 of last year, which got finalized in Q2, where we separated the CRM business from the EP [ph] business.","And we didn't do it just from a field sales perspective, we did it up really across all functions. So we have a dedicated CRM business unit with a dedicated leader, R&D, etc. And I think you've seen some of the output of that focus in the second half of the year. I would like to see a couple more quarters strung together. So that's what we're aspiring here too.","But I think one of the biggest impact of that focus obviously, the field has an impact, but I'm more excited about the focus on the R&D side. I think we had to kind of slowed down our R&D innovation over here and that focus, that dedicated business unit focus, I think you'll see the output of that, not only in 2020, we have a couple of product launches in the US, new ICD, and in Europe also, but we've got plans for a nice cadence of innovation in '21 and '22. So I'm excited about kind of what we've done there. Obviously, it's early innings in terms of this business unit we'll be creating, but I like what I see.","David Lewis","Okay. And just two quick follow-ups for me. Just Robert on MitraClip, is there a specific embedded assumption in the guidance for MitraClip? And how acutely do you think we see that recovery in the back half? And then your margin guidance about 50 basis points is a little lower than 2019 consistent with our numbers, but if you could just highlight two or three of the examples of significant reinvestment for growth in 2020 that would be super helpful? Thanks so much.","Robert Ford","So, I just -- on your question about MitraClip recovering growth, and I think we've been pretty strong in our growth rate. The US has done very well. And what we saw in the international market, if that's what you're referring to, we did see that kind of impact of the -- some of the studies that came out in Europe impact us in the first quarter, but every quarter sequentially flat. We've seen improvement, and I think we've passed -- we've passed that on.","Regarding the guidance, I mean we've got a lot of growth. As I said with Libre, we've got a lot of growth here. We've contemplated, as I said, CMS approval, but I have been fairly consistent with the CMS approval is going to be an important aspect here, but it's not just that, right. It's the -- we've been showing really strong growth in the US even without the reimbursement, and that's a result of the investments that we've been making both in the field and clinical perspective. And I'm sorry what was the other question?","Brian Yoor","It was on -- it was on margin expansion. I'll start off by saying this margin improvement is an ongoing focus for us David, it has been and will continue to be whether that's gross margin, whether that's the leverage we continue to get in SG&A. And yes, notably, we did see that this year. You may be off just a little bit from our modelling, the foreign currency mix, we have a little bit of a headwind next year, but we have our gross margin expansion plan underlying. But keep in mind as Robert said, with these investments that we're doing for growth, whether that's continued Libre expansion, whether that's the most recent MitraClip expansion we announced, as well as the unprecedented uptake of Alinity, that's presenting a little bit of a headwind, but that's a good news item in the short term and longer term. You'll continue to see those gross margins expand, as we look out over the years.","David Lewis","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys. Congrats on a really nice springs here [ph]. One may be on Nutrition, the adult side has come in really strong. I know, China has been a bit of a bother with some regulation -- regulatory changes a couple of years ago. Could you comment on what you're seeing in China, is Adult Nutrition back. Is -- has something changed in China for you guys?","Robert Ford","Well, listen we achieved a pretty strong growth rate in Q4 and that's despite some of the softness that we did see in China. We talked a little bit about it in Q3, Vijay. We've seen some improvement, but some of those dynamics are still there, whether it's the birth rate or some of the kind of competitive intensity. We have obviously developed a plan here, as were going into Q4 and going into 2020 here, a big part of that strategy to address some of those competitive dynamics there is innovation and product launches and we put a plan together here.","We got a nice steady stream of -- cadence of launches in China. But I do think that it does point out to the strength of our Nutrition business that we're able to post this kind of growth rate despite still some continued softness in China. And I think that speaks to the strength of the business, Miles talked about we had some very strong growth in South, Southeast Asia and Latin America on both sides of the business, Pediatric and Adult. And I don't think that -- I think it shows this -- China is an important market for us for sure. It has our intentions -- our attention. But we're not overly reliant on it.","Vijay Kumar","Yes. That's helpful, Robert. And one on Diagnostics. I know flu has been the topic du jour. Just curious what that means for Diagnostics? On the Core Lab side, Alinity, really strong trends. You spoke about continued share gains in Europe. I'm just curious where we are in, on the US side? Have you -- is the win rate on the US side comparable to Europe or is that something that we should be expecting for the back half heading into '20, '21 [ph]?","Robert Ford","Yes. As I said, in Europe, I think we've had kind of good success in Europe. We talked about winning new businesses at that 50% rate. The renewals of our existing business, where we're trailing nearly -- nearly all of that business. And I think in the US right now, it might be a little bit too early, just because you don't we really didn't have the intentionality the launch that we had in Europe. Now that we've got a more complete menu, I think our ability to compete and our competitive fitness, let's call it that way in the US increases to the same level that we've had in Europe.","Vijay Kumar","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on another really strong quarter. And Miles, I'll echo what the other -- the other comments and add that I'll miss interacting with you on these calls, always insightful and fun. Just two quick questions. One, maybe for Robert on capital allocation. I know I've asked this on a few calls before, but you guys have paid down a lot of debt recently. Are you, Robert maybe thinking about M&A a little bit differently? Should we expect more tuck-ins in 2020? And I just have one quick follow-up.","Robert Ford","Sure. I think what you'll see is the same philosophy, the same framework that we've had for this year, which is a very kind of balanced approach. As you've said, a lot of our focus, the last couple of years has been to pay down debt. We paid down close to $10 billion over the last two years. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is around 1.5 now. And we've got kind of payments that are due in the next few years and that's all kind of contemplated in our capital plan.","The other thing we're always going to have a mindful eye here, Larry is ensuring that a portion of that capital goes back to our shareholders. Our dividend is a big part of our identity. We've increased our dividend for 47 consecutive years. This year we just announced a 13% increase. So -- and we announced also at the end of last year, our share repurchase about $3 billion. We do that from time to time mainly to kind of offset dilution. We'll also look at our growth opportunities, and we've talked a lot about them whether it's the rollout of Alinity, whether it's the manufacturing expansion of Libre. We just announced in Q4, a new manufacturing site, a second manufacturing site for MitraClip. Those are all great returns for our shareholders in terms of the return of that capital.","And then on the M&A side, we're now looking to do any deals right now. I think the framework that Miles has always worked is true to me, which is you know it needs to meet our threshold of it being strategic or, and at the same time opportunistic. And we've been looking at a lot, but we're always studying, we're always looking, and I haven't seen anything crossing the radar here that kind of falls in -- falls into those two -- those two buckets. But we're always going to keep looking, as we've always done.","Larry Biegelsen","Perfect. And then just one housekeeping for Brian, and Brian congratulations on your retirement and I'll miss you as well. Just FX on the -- on EPS, the impact in 2020? Thanks for taking the questions.","Robert Ford","The impact of what, EPS FX.","Brian Yoor","FX, it's around $0.05, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks, Brian.","Brian Yoor","Based on the mix, you got it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Good morning, everybody. Maybe I'll start off with EPD. EPD, Rob, it's always a little bit of a black box to us Medical Device and after all just said to me, I won't drag everybody else into it. You're clearly doing exceptionally well, strong fourth quarter, and you're saying mid to high-single digits for 2020. But maybe just give us a little update some of the key drivers. What could gets you to the upper end of your range? And maybe some of the challenges, just give us some perspective about what you're thinking about for 2020?","Robert Ford","Sure. I heard this comment a couple of times now about kind of EPD or pharma business kind of being a black box or not as transparent and as not as understanding. I mean I will say here, the biggest focus of this business is taking opportunity of the geographic dynamics, right? You can either have a proprietary pharmaceutical business a little bit more higher cost versus pure generic business, which is obviously very cheap.","Our branded generic business kind of sits between those two book-ins. I come from an emerging market, so I can tell you that when we buy medications, it's not reimbursed. So you pay for it out of pocket and you're willing to pay a little bit of a premium to ensure that what you're getting is high quality product. And I think that's what this business has been built on is taking advantage of that dynamic of this population in these markets growing with their disposable income and allocating some of that to their healthcare costs on brands that they trust. And that's what we've been building over these years. A key driver of this strategy here is you need to be, you need to have the breadth and the depth in your therapy classes.","So, we have comprehensive portfolios in the geographies that we're competing. They're deep in each therapy class. You need to be omnichannel, you need to be present in the doctor's office, you need to be present in the pharmacy, you need to be able to kind of communicate directly with the consumer and you need to be local. You need to have a local R&D or engine organization and manufacturing to be able to move fast with the opportunities that you see. And I think that's at the core of our strategy.","One of the challenges in this business, as Miles has always said is the FX piece of it, but the performance growth, we expect it to be in this kind of high single-digit growth, and a big driver of that is being in the right markets, with the right infrastructure, with the right products, with the depth and the focus on execution.","Rick Wise","Great. And turning to two other areas, Heart Failure business has done a great job. How sustainable is the robust growth we've seen? And maybe talk a little bit about the implications of the less invasive surgical approach for HeartMate 3, what that might mean? And just last maybe touch a little bit on Alere. It's been a little bit of an disappointment. What are the next steps? Help us understand what's going on? And where we go from here with Alere? Thank you so much.","Robert Ford","Sure. On Heart Failure, I mean we had a very successful 2019. We achieved the destination therapy indication for HeartMate 3 at the end of '18. So that rolled into '19. So you saw the growth rate of about 20% here, Rick, that growth is predominantly driven by share gains and specifically here in the US. So we exited 2019. Our estimation right now is through our internal data north of 80%. So as we go into 2020, we expect that to not be at that 20% rate now and to mirror more of what the market is growing, which is we expect to be in that mid-single digit range. But I do believe that we've got a lot of opportunity. I talked about cadence of innovation in our products and one product that's comped pretty quiet, but we've done a really good job there, which is CardioMEMS.","CardioMEMS is now close to $100 million. It's growing 30%. We continue to enrolled in our guide HF trial that's going to be used to open an NCD, but the outcomes there are also extremely meaningful in terms of hospitalization reductions, etc. So I think that will be kind of our next driver of growth in Heart Failure, and I'm very pleased with what the team has been able to build in that business.","Going to your question on Alere. It's been a little bit of a -- we'll call it like a mixed bag here. We've had some businesses that we brought into Abbott, and I think we've done very well with them. We've accelerated their performance. If I look at the infectious disease portfolio in our developed markets, that's done very well. Yes, of course there is some opportunity there with the flu season. But I think the team has done a really good job here expanding the portfolio and looking at those that installed base beyond just a flu test. And our cardiometabolic business has done very well too, growing in the high-single digits, low-double digits.","So I think those two businesses, we've done a really good job with, and I think the team has done a good job on the cost side with the synergies too. But you have pointed out that there are some parts in the business here, where we were not pleased with, we're not satisfied. Our emerging market Infectious Disease segment had a tough 2019, part of that is kind of NGO purchasing cycles and dynamics in certain markets, but we've got to do better than that. And we've implemented a strategy here to really look at other emerging markets outside of the African continent here and build the value proposition of those tests in other emerging markets.","In our toxicology business too, I don't think we've been able to kind of fully maximize the value there and that one there has got a lot of attention too. So we had a good Q4, a lot of focus here, a lot of good growth in the US, and I think part of that was a little bit of the flu. But if we can get these two business here, our emerging markets and our toxicology business to execute on the plans that we put in place for them, I think you'll see that is kind of a mid-growth, a mid-single digit kind of growth business for us. But I look at the trend and the dynamics of these products for the opportunities we have, the strategy to get into these businesses is still very much intact also. Miles talked about more and more testing move into alternative channels. We continue to see that, and we're targeting steady improvement here. But I think the long-term growth opportunity because of that trend is very positive.","Rick Wise","Thanks, and congratulations.","Scott Leinenweber","Thanks, operator. We'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Your line is open.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Congratulations Miles on your retirement and Brian, I hope your next chapter is a positive one as well. Just I guess a couple of cleanup questions. In terms of the, I guess PHP product, I was just wondering if you can maybe update us on just the timelines there for expected launch?","And then, also for Amulet as well just kind of expectations for a launch just to get some timelines? And then also, I think you Robert had also mentioned just some products within the CRM business launching there. Could you just maybe update us on expectations for that franchise. I think you mentioned a new ICD platform and some other milestones to expect within the CRM portfolio? Thanks.","Robert Ford","So sure, on PHP and Amulet, I mean those are still I'd say a couple of years away. So we're still in kind of clinical evaluation of that. We'll then kind of put the information together, submit to the FDA. So I'd say you kind of have normal timelines over there. So you can look at it about a couple -- a couple of years away.","On the CRM side, like I said, I think the biggest opportunity we had when we changed the structure was to kind of get the innovation going. So we've got two product launches, we've got a new version of -- new update to our implantable cardiac monitor planned for this year. We've got a new ICD planned again for both US and Europe. And our growth expectations here are to be -- to do better than what we've been doing, steady sequential improvement. We've had some challenges, and I think that these products here will allow us to continue that sequential improvement. Yes. So I'll --","Kristen Stewart","Perfect. And then, I forgot [ph].","Robert Ford","Go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","I was just going to say and do you see any opportunities, I think Bob had mentioned this, but any opportunities just in terms of divestitures within Medical Devices or elsewhere within the portfolio or some smaller tuck-in. I know you said, it didn't sound like you were going to do any larger scale M&A, but just more product lines to bring into the portfolio from a more of a tuck-in acquisition from technology earlier stage?","Robert Ford","Yes. Listen if I take that and just talk about our model, we have a diversified model. I fundamentally believe in our diversified model. I think you've seen sequential improvement in all four areas over the last couple of years from a big picture perspective. Now when you go into each one of them, can you find some areas that we can do better, and we should do better. Yes, we can and we've talked about some of those today. But that doesn't mean that we don't think they're great opportunities that just means that we need to focus on doing better and executing better on that. So as I look at these four businesses, I like the businesses we have.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Miles White","Okay, this is Miles again. I'll wrap up and close for us. So first of all, thank you all very much for your very kind comments. And on behalf of both Brian and I -- well, speak and tell you that it's been a great honor and a great pleasure for us to lead our Company. It's been a tremendous experience. I feel like I've had two or three careers here in the last 21 years and probably have. Brian was estimating this morning this was our 85th or 86th earnings call. And therefore, I can't tell you that I know yes, whether I'm going to miss him, but I'm sure had a lot of them. And they're always challenging, they're always interesting opportunities to converse with you about the prospects of the Company and so forth.","I feel like I leave the Company in perhaps its best position ever in terms of products and growth, future opportunities, etc., as I said at the beginning. I'm very pleased with the succession and the management team that's here. It's not just the CEO that's changing, the CFO is changing and Bob Funck, who's our long time Abbott employee and he's been our Controller for a number of years and been in some of the most challenging jobs at Abbott and so forth, will be an absolutely superb successor to Brian.","You know that a lot of our management team has changed over the last couple of years as we move to a next generation of leaders and managers in the Company. And I think it's a great mix of people that are homegrown and also have come to us either through St. Jude or other outside places and we're just really happy with the team, we've got, the pipelines we've got, the positions we've got. We think our success is sustainable. And I think the track record that we've laid down over the last years has been recognized that way, and we're appreciative of the recognition that all of you have given.","As I commented tongue in cheek, as a significant shareholder of the Company, I'll obviously be watching closely. And especially in the -- the immediate future, as the Chairman.","So with that, we'll close the call. Thank you all very much, and thanks for all your support.","Scott Leinenweber","Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 AM Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relation website at abbottinvestor.com.

Please refer to that release for additional important information about Abbott, St. Jude and related matters.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 above our guidance range. Sales increased 6.5% in the quarter, led by strong performance in Established Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices and Diagnostics. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we took an important strategic step with our announcement to acquire St. Jude Medical. Abbott and St. Jude combined will have a highly competitive medical device portfolio, including an industry-leading new product pipeline across cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. This strategic action builds upon the steps we've taken to achieve critical mass and leadership positions across each of our four businesses.","In Diagnostics and Nutrition, where we hold market-leading positions today, we've been investing in R&D and infrastructure in high-growth geographies that have strengthened our global scale and competitiveness. And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, we've taken a number of strategic steps over the last couple of years to position our business for long-term growth. EPD now operates entirely in emerging geographies and holds leading positions in many of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets for branded generics in the world, including India, Russia and Latin America.","All four of our businesses will now hold leading positions in large and growing markets that are aligned with healthcare and demographic trends, providing a strong foundation to deliver top-tier growth over the long-term.","I'll now briefly review our second quarter results, and I'll start with Diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of 6% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics.","Our Diagnostics business has been a solid and continuous outperformer in the company and in its industry over the past several years. There is an opportunity here to further maintain if not improve upon this growth trajectory, as we prepare to bring multiple next-generation systems to market across every area of diagnostics where we participate. We'll provide more details on these systems and our launch plans during the second half of the year.","In Nutrition, sales grew around 4.5% in the quarter or more than 6% excluding the impact of Venezuela. Growth in the quarter was led by U.S. pediatric and international adult nutrition. In the U.S., above-market performance in Pediatric Nutrition was driven by continued growth of recently launched products including non-GMO products for infants and toddlers. In Adult Nutrition, double-digit international growth was led by Ensure and continued expansion of the adult nutrition market, where Abbott is the global leader.","In Medical Devices, sales growth in our Vascular business was led by share gains in our core stent business and double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation.","Our Endovascular business also contributed another quarter of strong growth, driven by vessel closure products and Supera, our unique peripheral stent for the treatment of blockages in the leg. And earlier this month, we received FDA approval for Absorb, the only fully dissolving vascular stent. This first of its kind product is an important addition to our market-leading drug-eluting stent portfolio in the U.S.","In Medical Optics, sales growth of 5.5% was led by double-digit growth in our cataract products business where we continue to capture share and drive growth with our portfolio of premium cataract lens products. Last week, we further strengthened our portfolio in the U.S. with the FDA approval for our TECNIS Symfony lenses; the first and only lenses that provide a full range of continuous high-quality vision following cataract surgery.","In Diabetes Care, international sales growth of more than 15% was driven by continued consumer uptake of our new and innovative FreeStyle Libre device in Europe. We continue to see strong demand as consumers and healthcare professionals become increasingly aware of the many benefits of this innovative device. There are now more than 125,000 patients utilizing FreeStyle Libre in Europe and we're working to bring this novel technology to new markets, including the United States.","And in Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, our strategy of targeting key geographies with a broad portfolio across select therapeutic areas continues to deliver strong results. Sales growth of 9.5% or 14% excluding the impact of Venezuela, was led by balanced growth across several markets including India, China and several countries in Latin America.","The acquisitions and subsequent integrations of both CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm have exceeded our expectations and are contributing to strong growth overall.","So in summary, it was a good quarter and we're particularly pleased with the steady cadence of new product approvals and recent launches that are contributing to growth including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Absorb and Symfony. And we took another important step to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth potential with our announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Thank you, Miles. Sales for the quarter increased 6.4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 3.2% in foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was somewhat higher than previous expectations due to modest strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the quarter. Reported sales increased 3.2% in the quarter.","Regarding other aspects of the P&L in the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.6% of sales, somewhat above our previous guidance. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 31.6% of sales, each in line with previously-issued guidance.","Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2016. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 from continuing operations remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results.","We continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full-year reported sales, somewhat higher than previous expectations of negative 2%. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits for the full-year 2016. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57% of sales for the full year, which includes underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.","We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approaching 31% of sales for the full year. We now forecast net interest expense of around $100 million, reflecting changes in interest rate assumptions on both, our borrowing rates for debt and the income we earn on some of our investments, and around $35 million of non-operating expense.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.59, again reflecting double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast operational sales growth of mid-single digits in the third quarter and at current exchange rates, we'd expect the negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%.","Turning to other aspects of the P&L. For the third quarter, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio somewhat above 57%, adjusted R&D investment around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.19 in the third quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release.","Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter and full-year operational sales growth outlook by business.","For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast mid-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. And lastly, in our Medical Devices business, for Vascular we now forecast low-single digit sales growth for both the third quarter and full year. In Diabetes, we forecast high-single digit growth for the third quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the full year. And in Medical Optics, we forecast low to mid-single digit for the third quarter and mid-single digit sales growth for the full year.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Miles, let's start with a couple of items, if we could. I'm sure everyone would love to get an update on the two transactions in both St. Jude and Alere. So in particular on Alere, I think people would love to hear your comments.","And then second, fundamentally, it was a good quarter. I think the mix of growth was a little bit different than what we saw at the last couple of quarters. If there is one business that probably is worth spending a few more minutes on is the international pediatric nutritionals business. We've seen a couple of the local companies announce weaker results. Your quarter this quarter wasn't as good as some of your recent quarters, so maybe you can talk about what's going on in some of those markets obviously and particular at China. Thanks.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As usual, Mike, you are spot on. I feel like you must've been in the room or something here.","Let me deal with the transactions first, and I'll go right to the one that you targeted, Alere. From our perspective, there has been no change. They still haven't filed a 10-K. Our access to the information has been limited. And they did put out a press release with an update that I think was at least from my perspective over-enthusiastically embraced from one of their analysts. But to that extent, the update they put out basically provided no particular new information and was a requirement they had with their bondholders for the extensions they got on the requirements in their agreements. And, the information they put out was characterized as preliminary unaudited summary only, et cetera.","So I think from our perspective, no change other than the passage of time. And that's about all I can say about it at this point. So I'm not an odds predictor here so I have no particular predictions to make other than the information that's here and there is no more really to say about it since the last time you asked me the question.","So moving to St. Jude, I'd say everything is tracking well. We've got a second request from the FTC which we'll certainly respond to. I'd say there is not much in the way of surprises there. All of our planning going forward is going according to plan. There is no surprises, no negatives. Their performance appears to be tracking according to our forecasts, our expectations and for their forecasts.","In fact, I'd say their report this morning looks to me like their best quarter in about the last six quarters anyway. And they're trending in the right directions as we predicted and forecasted and saw in our due diligence. So I'd say with regard to St. Jude, everything is tracking well. We still hope to close that by before year-end. I think that will be close call just as we work our way through the administrivia of the FTC's request and so forth and whatever we may have to do there. But I'd say there is no big surprises at all. We're just going to try and complete the work that we've already indicated and everything there is tracking according to plan.","With regard to the mix of business, I'd say you can see in our numbers, it's a strong quarter across the board, across the world in all of our businesses but one. And the Nutrition business is weaker and the weakness is primarily focused on China, Pediatric. Really nowhere else. And what's been not only forecasted by some of our global competitors but also our own experience has been a slowing of growth in the China pediatric market. Last year at this time I think that market was probably 13%, 14% growth estimated and this year it's probably just under half that, would be our estimate, and I think that's probably consistent with what some of our competitors have seen or expressed as well. Well, we're seeing half the growth rate as a market rate that we've seen in the past and that's clearly softening the sales growth rate and we've seen that and we are seeing that. We have not yet seen in any data that there is any share change that's impacting us but our growth rate is clearly slower.","So I'm a little cautious on the second half. I don't expect that to change on this particular business. I don't expect that growth rate or that, let's just call it softness. It's not softness in terms of decline, it's slower growth. It's still a pretty healthy growth rate compared to anywhere else in the world and it's a good growth rate. It's just not the double-digit growth rate it was last year or the year before and, as you know, that market has been a pretty high grower from a growth rate standpoint for quite some time. So that's an adjustment for all of us to adjust to. I don't know whether that's a long-term change in the market. I know that there is an increasing breastfeeding rate in China.","But in terms of other fundamentals, we see channel shifts and so forth, but channel shifts shouldn't impact the overall market over time here. So other than the dynamics of just lower growth or slowing demand, I'd say that's about the best way I can characterize it. As I said, the market growth at 6% is still a healthy rate; it's just not the one that we've been used to and enjoyed for the past several years.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Maybe I could just get in two quick follow-ups. So one on the Alere question. Can you just talk about some of the items that you're still waiting on beyond just the filing of the 10-K? And then second, Brian, you raise your estimated FX impact on the top-line for the company. I assume there is an incremental FX headwind on the bottom-line, and that's in part why you're not raising 2016 guidance. But if you could shed any light on that, that'd be great.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With regard to I guess Alere, some information has been provided to us. We've made a number of requests regarding books and records and things that we want to audit and have access to. Some of that has been provided to us and a fair amount of it has not and continues not to be. So there is really nothing more I can say at this point, Mike, unfortunately. The announcement that they put out was not that forthcoming, and I certainly wouldn't share the optimism that one of their analysts expressed about their announcement. But I think we're just in a waiting situation here.","With regard to guidance, I mean, I'll just pre-empt Brian a little bit here. You recall, we did raise guidance after the first quarter. And I think \u2013 I want to be careful how I state this, because all of our businesses are running really strong here, but I'm a little cautious on the second half. Part of it's FX but part of it is just watching underlying market growth, I'm particularly keeping an eye on China. I didn't mean I'm negative on China at all \u2013 I'm not. But I think it's premature to forecast or forecast for raising guidance on the second half of the year, so I think we'll just keep our powder dry there.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Mike, around $0.01 to $0.02 on the back half.","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Perfect. Understood.","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","(20:53).","Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking the questions.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to start with Medical Devices. Your results there even excluding the royalty were better than recent trends, and you called out some new products. I was wondering if you could give us some more details on the contributions of those and what you expect out of Absorb or any other meaningful products going forward.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll give you a little bit of overview, and then I'll ask Brian for a little help on some of the details here. But the Vascular business is doing better and a couple of things there. MitraClip is certainly a contributor to that and so also is the Endovascular business. On the core stent business, and there is still pricing pressure there, because it's an intensely competitive market among three of us but, at the same time, we're gaining share. And I think that business, if I would characterize it, is doing better and stronger than it has been in the last, I'll call it, year-and-a-half. So I'm pretty pleased with the progress there and the performance of the team.","The royalty situation itself, there is a catch-up in there, which inflates the number, the growth number for this quarter, because it was catch-up of the past. But it's also \u2013 that we're going to have that royalty going forward here, so that'll be something we will clearly have in the future which has not been there for the past few quarters. So that's a plus. But if you take out the impact of that catch-up in the royalty, the growth in the Vascular business in the quarter is better than we've seen in quite some time. Brian, do you want to add any detail to that?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Matt, we're growing to mid-single digits even tough for the royalty here. MitraClip had a really strong quarter. We're seeing great adoption uptake and utilization in the centers we're in there. And our Endovascular business continues to perform well. It's growing double digits. It's a combination of both Supera for the SFA, as you know, as well as our vessel closure business.","And as far as the other side of like Medical Optics, I mean, you continue to see us grow, outpacing the market in cataracts, particularly with our premium lenses. And just excited about the cadence of the portfolio that's coming here, particularly with Symfony, to continue to build upon that. And then of course you know the story on FreeStyle Libre.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The optics market, particularly in the U.S., as you know, has experienced a fair amount of price decline in the LASIK business. And setting that aside, the performance in the cataract and the intraocular lens business has just been stellar, and we're really pleased with that. And pleased with our R&D group for the products that they've put out, pleased with the reception by customers and to be growing in healthy double digits in that segment is, well, it's great fun. All of these businesses have had their times when they've been down or waiting for new products, but these businesses are all doing really well.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And maybe just one follow-up on Diagnostics. You've talked for a while about the potential for a refresh of the Core Lab and Molecular systems. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit more thoughts on timing, the feature upgrades and what really matters there, and how that can contribute to growth for Dx?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we've got a number of new systems coming here, all of which have been under development for a few years in our Diagnostics business, and we're starting to see those roll out now and we will see over the next, let's say, two years, three years.","First of all, we just launched AlinIQ, which is an informatics program that is designed to help labs with productivity and their own cost management and so forth, which we think is going to be exceptionally well received. That's launched. Following that, we've got five systems coming. There is a next-generation system in our Point of Care business that will begin to launch in Europe in the second half of this year; probably in the fourth quarter, then in the U.S. in 2017.","Then the Core Lab systems to both immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing will begin to roll out as well. We expect European launch before the end of the year and in the U.S. in 2018, early in 2018. Blood screening, same thing. Late in the year in Europe, late this year in Europe. A brand new system. Beyond that, hematology in the following year of 2017, early 2017 in Europe, and then all of these early on in 2018 in the U.S. And then finally in our Molecular business in the second half of 2017, we begin to roll out a new system in Europe.","So that's a lot, and that's unprecedented. No company in our business has ever put that many new systems out. They're not just refreshments; they're not just software updates or upgrades or incremental improvements on existing systems, they are all complete new refreshed systems or redone and with some new advantages and so forth. So we're pretty excited about the entire product line.","Diagnostics has been doing really well with the mature products in its line, and when you think about the complete line of new products coming over the next couple of years to that business, I think that's just really a great shot in the arm there for a business that's been outperforming as it is anyway.","Customers will start to see those systems at the AACC Conference in Philadelphia in later this month. At a number of the industry trade shows in the U.S. and Europe we'll clearly be introducing those systems to customers so they get a preview in advance. So I think the future for Diagnostics looks pretty good.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, Miles. Good morning, everybody. Miles, just to start with sort of a bigger picture question, a lot of the pushback that I get in talking about the acquisitions, that St. Jude, Alere, it seems to revolve around a few points that both are challenged, even troubled assets, that you're taking on too much integration challenge at once, the uncertainty around an equity raise, the lack of certainty around how Abbott will add value improve or better run particularly St. Jude, and maybe a little lack of clarity about the Abbott senior management team, how that's going to change, who is going to lead the effort, again, particularly on the device side.","While I personally don't agree with these thoughts, I'd be curious just looking at the big picture here, again, given your long track record of successful opportunistic M&A, how is St. Jude, Alere, set up better or worse than some of the past challenges you faced? Why are these the right deal after another few months of thinking about it? What needs to be done to ensure that these are the right moves today for Abbott shareholders?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say a couple of things, and I understand the sentiments of investors in general. I mean I think that first of all I'd say, it's not a skeptical or cautious attitude on the part of investors, with just about everything, not particular to Abbott or specific to Abbott, but I think there is just a lot of caution out there. All that frothy, robust enthusiasm of a year and a half ago is definitely not there now. And yet the market is at a near high, but in our businesses that enthusiasm, or at least that attitude, doesn't seem to be that lit up. So we put this in the context of all of that.","I think what I find in the feedback from investors is they just want a lot more clarity and a lot more visibility so that they can forecast or model or know where all this is going to go, because I can lean on historical track record and say, hey, look, AMO wasn't a great performing business when we bought it, but right now it is doing exceptionally well. The assets we assembled there is EPD.","We're not at the time great asset \u2013 let's say (29:41) CFR was a pretty great asset, but a lot of the assets that we put together weren't necessarily super-performing assets. And right now, I'd say we've got one of the gems in the branded generic business globally because of the markets and the things we're in. And I think the track record of how we integrate or how we manage our businesses is proven. We're not intimidated at all by the integration. Frankly, that part, I think, we've shown we're really good at. We've got an experienced team in place. I'm not worried about that at all.","And frankly, in the case of St. Jude, the organizations are so well aligned, I think that one will go extremely well and extremely smoothly. I don't consider St. Jude to be a particularly challenged organization. I think that they've got a great pipeline of products. I think they've got a lot of good products. They went through a fairly significant organizational structural change over the last two years that, I think, proved to be somewhat disruptive to the operation of the organization. We're well aware of that. We're well aware of what it meant, how it works, et cetera. But understanding that, I think we've got a pretty good idea of how to integrate St. Jude and run it going forward.","With regard to the management team, the management team that will be running our device businesses will be a mix, probably a fairly balanced mix of Abbott and St. Jude people. Where we believe that there is a clear benefit to Abbott management, talent, et cetera, or experience that we can bring to the party, we certainly intend to do so. And we pretty well wind out what we think that is and we will also have the benefit of some of the most experienced and best managers and so forth at St. Jude.","I think St. Jude has been, probably, more maligned in the last year than it has deserved because they missed earnings in the third and fourth quarter and they've had some delays in product approvals. But to be honest, if they had an MRI compatible CRM product, I don't think we'd be hearing nearly as much criticism of St. Jude. And it's amazing how one thing, or maybe if they were achieving the reimbursement of CardioMEMS faster, that's about it.","Beyond that, their businesses are booming. All their other businesses are doing super well and they've already shown that they can recover share, when they get a CRM approval, by their performance in Japan. So I think it's been overblown, Rick, and I understand the investors are disappointed. It takes them a while to recover from them that and then they're skeptical. And they may look at Abbott and say, why do you think you can do it better? And my answer to that is, I think we can do it better and I think St. Jude can do it better and so does St. Jude. And I think that the two of us together, both believe that, first of all, they resolve their MRI compatibility issue and continue to run the business well, which they are, this business is going to do not only how analysts expect and we expect, which is growth of 4.5%, 5% or more, but frankly, maybe even better than that. As I've indicated on other calls, St. Jude's own estimates of how they're going to do are even higher than that.","Our deal was done based on estimating, frankly, same kind of growth rates analysts estimate, which quote them at call it 4.5% to 5% going forward. And right now, they're tracking towards that with their performance in all their businesses. We're just waiting for an approval of an MRI compatible CRM and I think this changes.","When I look forward, I think the breadth of the business and the combination with Abbott and the improved performance in our own Vascular business is nothing but up. And well, right now, you've got this period where there is uncertainty, uncertainty about when will it close and you haven't forecasted what it will do and so forth. I think it's \u2013 I think a lot of our investors are just more cautious. But I look at it and look down the road at our own projections in what we believe we're going to do and I think, okay, the stock is whatever it is today, $42 or whatever. I don't think investors are ever going to see another point to buy in at this level. That's what I think. I actually believe that.","And I think our track record, which is proven, we know how to integrate it, we know how to manage it, we know how to do well with it, we know how to add value to it, we know what the breadth of offering is, we know the quality of their pipeline and the quality of their people. You don't just buy it, put it in the portfolio and leave it alone. You buy it and you put the best management you can in place and you run it the best you can. We've got really excellent managements in our Medical Device business and I think they've got excellent people too. So in spite of the fact that they've disappointed investors, I think the investors got to get over last year and look forward here, because I don't think we bought some challenged property here.","Alere, yeah, it has challenges, they acknowledge they have challenges too. And frankly, they've had challenges for a number of years and the management team that's there right now, has been there just a little more than two years, they have dealt well with a lot of the challenges Alere has. Now, they clearly have more, right? And to be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them here or they are going through, et cetera, one thing I'm certain of is that they are trying to do everything they can their way to address the challenges in the company. I don't think otherwise. So whether it all works out the way it originally planned or not, I don't know. We can't predict.","As I've said many times, we like the products, and to us it's an opportunistic opportunity to expand our Diagnostics business. Our Diagnostics business is one of the most consistent top-performing businesses in our country and in its industry and they've proven they know how to manage costs, they know how to manage product, they know how to manage the commercial operations, they know how to grow, they know how to compete. This business is one of our best most reliable businesses in the company and to expand that footprint with more products is just an opportunistic plus. If for some reason it didn't work out, we still have one of our top-performing companies in the industry but if we can add to it, well then even better.","So I think to address further investors, having two deals in the hopper at the same time is a lot of moving parts for investors. It leaves some things uncertain. It leaves the issue, as you said, the equity issuance uncertain. Obviously, for some reason both of these didn't happen, there wouldn't be a need or a desire to do that because we're trying to balance our overall debt and equity balance sheet. So we'll see. We just don't know at this point and I think there is other ways that we can consider addressing that issue around the equity, since I've had the feedback from investors that they are concerned. At least they don't like it because it's dilutive. And I'm aware of that.","But I don't think we're anywhere close to where we have to make a decision on the equity issuance. At this point we're planning for it, but we're only going to do it if it's in our interest to do it to balance our balance sheet. So full transparency. We're planning to do it but there is other ways that may well be addressed and we're nowhere close to a resolution to that. I think that the uncertainty of that for investors just has them cautious, concerns and so on, and I think what I tell most people is, look, by January, this is all going to be pretty clear. And it's going to be resolved one way or another and we'll know whether we're going to do something like that or not. I think the same thing is true, that we get asked a lot about the Mylan shares and what are we going to do and are they going to play a role? And the answer is to be determined, unclear, you know. If \u2013 right now my sense is if I don't have to sell those shares I'm not going to.","So I think that there's enough moving parts. So I actually like the moving parts even though investors want real clarity I don't want to make any of these decisions until I actually have to, and there is probably a number of months that are going to go by before we have to. And it's unfortunate it leaves a little bit of uncertainty not only for Abbott shareholders but for Mylan's too to some degree. But if we don't have a need to sell those shares, I don't intend to. So at least not anytime soon, let me put it that way.","So I think those are all the moving parts, and I think there is some frustration out there, I think people want to buy the stock, I think they want to be in the stock, I think they want the ride that we think we have ahead of us here for the coming years. They just don't know whether there is going to be some surprise they can't anticipate. And right now, I think all the possible outcomes are pretty evident, and I don't see anything that's going to take us backwards, but I certainly see a lot of things that are going to take us forward. And I'm pretty optimistic about it. I just think that we and investors have to ride through about, call it, six months of less certainty on some of the choices here, until it starts to resolve. And that's not going to be next month, it's going to be a while.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, that's great perspective. One tiny quick follow-up. Obviously FreeStyle Libre is often running in Europe. You said you're working to bring it to the U.S. What's needed to make that happen? What kind of timing should we expect for FreeStyle Libre in the U.S? Thanks so much.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there is \u2013 gosh, I'm not sure how specific to be about that. We're going to submit, as soon as possible, and I would estimate it is approved in the U.S., is my estimate and my guesstimate in the first quarter. That's what I would guess. And there's two stages to this. There's a Libre Pro and then a Libre consumer. So I think that our ambition would be to get this approved probably within the next six months to eight months, something like that. But we'll see.","There is a number of steps that are going to happen here in the interim. In the meanwhile, I think it's doing exceptionally well on its rollout in Europe, we've had a really good reception from the states and countries with regard to reimbursement which I think is unusual. This has been \u2013 thus far, Libre's success has been driven by consumer pay, and direct consumer pay. And we are achieving our goals of getting key countries and key prices to agree to reimburse the product which should frankly make a big difference in the performance in the market, and it's already trending north at a pretty good clip.","So I'm pretty enthusiastic about Libre and, of course, when you've got a product that's as good as that is and trending like it is, you're in a big hurry to get it approved in the U.S. yesterday. So that's where we are. Brian, do you want to add anything to that, or Scott?","Brian B. Yoor - Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer","No. I think that's perfectly characterized. Thanks.","Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. My first question relates to St. Jude. They did report this morning, and I thought what was very important is the fact that all their new products and timelines were reaffirmed this morning, which really sets St. Jude up to rebound and have a strong 2017. And Miles, you mentioned St. Jude's internal forecast, we've read it in the proxy, 10% revenue growth for the next five years, which is well above what the Street is modeling.","And I'm curious...","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's above what I modeled.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And it's above what I modeled. What is in that forecast that gets them to that 10%? And I guess another way to say is what are the upside surprises that could exist within the St. Jude outlook portfolio over the next five years? If you can maybe call some out to us. And then, putting the two companies together, there could be sales dis-synergies. I think you're hoping for sales synergies. How soon do you think you can achieve those sales synergies? Thank you.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. A couple of things. First, before I phone a friend next to me here for some of the details underlying specific products, I would tell you that \u2013 first of all, if you've got a robust portfolio of new products coming, that's always a good thing, and we're naturally always optimistic about the uptick of products, the penetration of products, the introduction of products and so forth. And it's always a constant balance of being sufficiently enthusiastic and pushing your organization hard enough on how you want to take those products to market.","And then there is always the speed bumps; something slows you down somewhere, whether it's reimbursement or the timing of an approval or whatever. And in all my years in the industry, I have never seen, on a particularly consistent basis, any company including my own deliver its new products on-time, on-plan, on-schedule without some kind of delay. Even with Libre, our ambitions were \u2013 in terms of our own internal goals, we're probably a couple of months behind where we wanted to be \u2013 months, okay, couple months. And yet, we have pretty stiff goal in our own minds about what we're trying to do here. And if you look at the product, it's screaming north at a rocket-like pace, which is a good thing. And all it takes is some minister somewhere to slow down his decision a few weeks and you're off by a couple of weeks.","So when I look forward at St. Jude and I look at the 10%, is it potentially possible? Yeah, it's potentially possible, but it's a lot of green lights. It's a lot of green lights without many speed bumps. And the reality of life is, is there is a lot of speed bumps. So I would've judged it back a little bit in terms of just caution. I think they're aspirational about the pace at which those new products come. I don't think there's any disagreement on our part with them about how good the products are, how well received they'll be or what competitive response will be and so forth.","I also think they're going to benefit from some great market growth rate behind a lot of these products. They don't have to go tear it away from somebody else in competition, hand-to-hand combat. The CRM business is hand-to-hand combat, but a lot of the other businesses here are frankly just plain innovative, new and relying on growth and training physicians and usage and so forth. So I think that while they would \u2013 their estimates really were sort of in that 9% and up range. I think we're just being naturally cautious of the unknown, that the (45:18) unknown. And I think analysts are, too.","When we looked across a consensus of analysts for St. Jude, the consensus was around 4.5% to 5% growth going forward here for the next five years. And what's ironic about that is I've spoken to a lot of these analysts because we know them covering us as well. And they'll say, yeah, I know that's what my model says but I'm just not sure they're really going to do that. And that's because their growth rate was more flat over the last five years. But the growth rate was flat over the last five years because they didn't have some of these products or a Thoratec or some of the other businesses they've got now. And right now, they've got a heck of a lot more in the pipeline and a heck of a lot more that they've added to the company since, say, three, four years ago.","So I don't think the last five years' growth rates are relevant as a comparison. I think what they've got and what they've done is. And I think right now, the growth rate is only suppressed because they've got difficulty with not having an MRI-compatible claim on their CRM\/CRT products. And you take that away and this business is already at analysts' projections and analysts' projections have been more robust than the past history.","So I think St. Jude is one of those stories where once you disappoint some investors a couple of quarters, the investor doesn't believe the projection of the future as much as he believes the rearview mirror. So I think they've got to put the points on the board and earn back a little credibility that what they've projected is actually going to happen. And I think the sentiment will change on St. Jude.","I'm not investing in sentiment; I'm investing in real products and real company and real business. And I think that what they're tracking at right now is giving the evidence that what they've projected is valid. These businesses, if you look at all the segments of businesses, they're really doing great. The one soft spot in the company is CRM and they do have to get better reimbursement status for CardioMEMS. Okay. That's two things and they're all over that, and we're comfortable with how they're all over that. And the rest of the company is doing gangbusters. So I think they just got to show the evidence here over time. Rick, I've already forgotten the second half of your question.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Well, it's Glenn. Not Rick.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And second \u2013 it's all right, Miles \u2013 and it's sales synergies. So there's the potential for dis-synergies, but as I look at this deal both companies are very compatible. And so there conceivably should be sales synergies. So maybe comment on, is that \u2013 how soon that can happen?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yeah, Glenn. May I call you Bob?","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, sure.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I apologize. It was such a windy answer, I lost track. In any case, I think the synergies are going to be easy to get. I think the commercial synergies, and first of all it depends on the integration of your sales forces, the integration of your sales management structures, your commercial management structures. I think it depends on how we construct our integration our \u2013 well, there's integration and cooperation across boundaries with the multiple businesses. That will and how customers embrace that particularly in the U.S. will determine how rapidly that goes.","Now, having said that, the companies have had some experience that way for some time already because we've had a joint marketing agreement with St. Jude for a number of years between our stent business and their CRM business, so we're already well familiar with each other. Of course, the dynamics change when you're part of the same company and that's a positive. It gets better. So I think that the nature of the kind of commercial synergy we would look for in the broader portfolio of products that we offer, how we approach our accounts, how we can service our accounts, et cetera, I'd say that planning is well underway if not starting to be in practice in a number of cases. And in between Mike Rousseau, the CEO of St. Jude; and Robert Ford, our EVP, and that organization or these two organizations I think the two of them and their people have planned and cooperated exceptionally well going forward here so I think we hit the ground running as if the two companies had been together for a long time. I don't really foresee a lot of hiccups or bumps here.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. And since you called me by the wrong name, Miles, can I squeeze in one more question?","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. The Mylan stake, when you do sell the Mylan stake, the cash that you realize, will that be considered OUS trapped cash and if so, how do you handle the tax liability if you bring it back indeed to pay for Alere or St. Jude. I remember a few years ago when Tom was CFO, you brought back cash and the liability was called out as a one-timer. Is that something that you would consider doing? Thanks.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I don't anticipate that.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. But the cash would be considered international cash? Is that correct if you do sell the stake?","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President, Investor Relations","Glenn, I would assume we can navigate this without the tax correction. I think we've shown a propensity across the corporations through our buybacks and other means to access our cash in an efficient way. And I think you can assume the same about this if, to Miles' point, if we're in a situation where we sell the stock.","Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't think we're going to have that hiccup.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just, Miles, on Libre, a clarification question. First quarter 2017 is that the professional version or the consumer version? As far as I know you haven't disclosed yet when you're filing the consumer version in the U.S. And second under the Dexcom panel tomorrow, what do you think the implications are for Libre? And I did have a follow-up. Thanks.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hey, Larry. This is Scott. I'll touch base on the professional version very quickly. As you know, we filed for that device in the middle of last year. We're working with the FDA on that and that is the approval we would expect in the next six to nine months on that particular point.","Obviously, as it relates to, as you know, the Dexcom panel tomorrow, I mean we're really excited about the U.S. market. We think there is lots of opportunity there. We think Libre is a unique technology. It's a discussion we'll be watching closely to see how the FDA is thinking about these novel technologies and how to apply them for diabetic patients' needs in today's market.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Scott. And then lastly, we saw J&J adopt ASU 2016-09 yesterday and had some implications for their tax rate. What are the implications for you guys and when do you plan to adopt it? Thanks for taking the questions.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yeah. So we don't need to adopt till 2017, Larry, and we're still assessing what that means in terms of our ongoing earnings on a year-to-year basis because there are some moving parts there. We're still assessing it. We won't adopt until we have to.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President, Investor Relations","Sure.","Miles D. White - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Scott Leinenweber - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions.

Welcome to Abbott\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brian Yoor","Okay, good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2015. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. Please note that first quarter and guidance provided today on the call for sales, earnings per share and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","In today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Brian, good morning everybody. I will be brief this morning and leave some time for questions. ","Our first-quarter performance exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines and we reported double-digit operational sales growth, exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter, closed on the sale of our EPD developed markets business to Mylan and launched a number of new products across our portfolio.","I will summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for some further detail. Operational sales increased 10% in the quarter with particularly strong performance in our branded generics, international, nutrition and global diagnostics businesses as well as double-digit growth in emerging markets and that did include the additions of CFR and Veropharm.","While currency was a factor, including a 7% negative impact on the top line, we continue to manage through its effect on the bottom line. Our first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.47 exceeds our previous guidance range and reflects growth of 38%, but again as I said that includes the addition of CFR and Veropharm in comparisons.","Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged and reflects double-digit underlying growth, excluding the impact of currency. So in the quarter starting with nutrition, sales increased more than 6% with continued double-digit growth outside of the United States. The new pediatric products that we have launched into China and other fast growing geographies are continuing to perform well. Products like Similac QINTI and Eleva, and we have got strong performance in the online segment.","These new products drive share expansion and contribute to our growth in the market. The international adult nutrition business has consistently delivered high single digit to double-digit sales growth. Our adult nutritional Ensure is roughly a $2 billion brand globally today, and we launched it into the retail segment in China earlier this year. ","In March, we also opened a nutrition pilot plant in Singapore. This facility in addition to the others there allows us to customize more of our products to meet consumer preferences across Asia. ","In medical devices, diabetes care returned to growth this quarter as we expected. We have had a very positive early response to the launch of our new FreeStyle Libre device. As I mentioned last quarter we are already expanding capacity to meet this demand. Libre is a highly differentiated technology that helps people self-manage their diabetes without the need for routine fingersticks. We are also building a portfolio of products based on our sensor technology and FreeStyle Libre Pro is our first professional use device that was launched in India earlier this month.","Our vascular business also performed in line with our expectations. Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven by high single digit performance of our endovascular products, as well as double-digit growth of our structural heart product, MitraClip. The market opportunity for mitral regurgitation is significant, but still in its early stages and MitraClip is the only product on the market to date that can treat this disease in a minimally invasive way.","In medical optics, sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. We recently launched two new cataract lenses and saw a pickup in our cataract lens growth as the quarter progressed.","In diagnostics, we delivered 6% growth in the quarter. The continued success of our commercial strategies with core laboratory customers are driving share gains in the US and emerging markets. We continue to invest in the development of next-generation system platforms across all three of our diagnostics businesses. ","In point-of-care diagnostics, sales increased double digits. In the US we have had success with large healthcare networks, standardizing our point-of-care testing with our i-STAT system. Outside the US, our expansion efforts continue in both developed and emerging geographies.","In established pharmaceuticals we\u2019re executing better commercially. That is something that I have given a fair amount of attention to on past calls with you. We are expanding our product portfolios in our therapeutic area of focus \u2013 areas of focus and driving more awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers, physicians and pharmacists.","Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, sales in our key emerging markets increased in low double-digit with above market growth in India, Brazil, China, Russia, and Colombia. With the sale of the developed markets business to Mylan completed in February, EPD is now focused solely on emerging markets.","We received 110 million shares of Mylan stock for the developed markets business, and recently sold roughly a third of our position. The net proceeds from the sale of Mylan shares and our strong balance sheet provide us with additional flexibility to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long-term growth.","So in summary we reported first-quarter results ahead of our expectations. We are building on the momentum we had exiting 2014, and we expect high single-digit full year operational sales growth and continued progress on margin expansion, and we are well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015. I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Thanks Miles. AsMiles indicated, today we reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.47, above our previous guidance range and reflecting growth of 38%. Sales for the quarter increased 10% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact of 7% from foreign exchange.","Reported sales increased to 3% in the quarter. Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in nutritional, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals, which included the impact of 2014 acquisitions. Sales in emerging markets increased strong double digits in the quarter.","First-quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.1% of sales, somewhat above our forecast and up nearly 500 basis points over the first quarter of 2014. The year-over-year comparison was driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses and in part the comparison relative to an unusually low ratio experienced in the first quarter 2014.","In the quarter, adjusted R&D investments was around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expenses were around 34.5% of sales. The over delivery in the first quarter EPS compared to our guidance was in part the result of the dynamics of exchange on our results, including the timing effects of hedging activity on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L. We expect the first quarter favorability on this line of the P&L to partially reverse in the second quarter, with remaining net gains for the year to be offset on the operating income line of the P&L over the last three quarters.","As we discussed last quarter, while the weaker euro impacts our top line, movements in the euro have a minimal impact on our bottom line due to our euro denominated cost base. Therefore the further weakening of the Euro that we saw in the first quarter of the year does not impact our 2015 EPS forecast. ","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from continuing operations remains unchanged. Regarding our full year 2015 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high single digits. Based on current exchange rates we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 7% on our full year reported sales, up over our previous projected in January of around 6%.","This should result in reported sales growth in the low single digits for the full year 2015. Brian will provide more details on the 2015 outlook by business in a few minutes. We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales for the full year driven by gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses.","We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and now forecast an adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. Overall we continue to expect to expand our full year adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015.","We now forecast net interest expense of around $120 million, reflecting changes in the interest rate assumptions on both our debt and some of our investment. We forecast an exchange gain of approximately $35 million on the exchange gain loss line in the P&L for the full year, reflecting some reversal of the favorability we saw on this line in the first quarter as mentioned previously, and we forecast around $5 million of non-operating expense for the full year 2015.","Turning to the outlook for the second quarter, we forecast ongoing EPS of $0.49 to $0.51, reflecting double-digit underlying growth, largely offset by the impact of segment foreign exchange headwind on operating results as discussed on the January call, as well as the partial reversal of favorability in the exchange gain loss line of the P&L from the first quarter as previously mentioned.","We forecast operational sales growth in the low double digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we would expect the negative impact from exchange of somewhat above 8%, resulting in reported sales in the low single digits. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales in the second quarter. We forecast net interest expense of around $35 million and approximately $15 million in expense on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L.","Finally we project specified items of $0.23 in the second quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release. So in summary, our full year ongoing EPS guidance remains unchanged. As we start the year, we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong EPS growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment. And with that I will turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks Tom. This morning I will review our first quarter 2015 performance and second-quarter sales outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I will start with our nutrition business, where global sales increased more than 6% in the first quarter.","In our international pediatric nutrition business, sales increased to 11.7% driven by double-digit growth in China and Latin America. We continued to capture market share with new infant formula products we launched into the fast-growing market segments and geographies over the past year. This includes Similac QINTI and Eleva, which we launched into the premium infant formula market segment in China in 2014.","International adult nutrition sales increased nearly 11% in the quarter driven by strong double-digit growth in Latin America. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in our international adult nutrition business. We continued to expand the adult nutrition category internationally, and recently launched our Ensure brand in China into the retail market segment, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Abbott.","We also continued to expand our local presence in key markets. As Miles mentioned, in addition to the three manufacturing plants we opened last year in China, India and the US, we announced in March the opening of a new nutrition pilot plant in Singapore. The state of the art facility will serve as a second global R&D hub. In the US, pediatric nutrition sales were up 4.5% driven by market share gains in the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market, and double-digit Pedialyte growth as a result of the strong flu season.","Adults nutrition sales in the US were impacted by competitive and market dynamics, including softness in the institutional segment. We expect a modest improvement in the US adult nutrition sales growth over the course of the year as we launch new products. For the second quarter we are forecasting mid to high single digit growth on an operational basis in our global nutritional business, driven by a continued double-digit operational sales growth in international nutrition.","In our diagnostics business, sales increased 6% in the first quarter with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets. Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased 4.7% in the quarter. This above market growth was driven by strong growth in our core laboratory segment as this business continues to increase its win rate and gain share with its customer focused solutions.","The US growth was impacted by a comparison to a strong first quarter of last year when sales increased double digits driven by higher blood screening sales. Last week we announced a partnership agreement with the number one coagulation company in Japan to provide coagulation testing solutions to core laboratories worldwide. This partnership broadens our diagnostics offering to meet our customers\u2019 needs and to deliver high quality results in an efficient workflow as part of Abbott\u2019s total solutions.","Coagulation testing is approximately a $2 billion market segment of the in vitro diagnostics market that is growing in the mid-single digits. In molecular diagnostics, sales increased 7.4% in the quarter driven by growth of our core business segment, infectious disease testing. Growth was also favorably impacted this quarter by the timing of tenders in emerging markets.","In Europe, we are early into the launch of our IRIDICA, infectious disease testing platform, which helps identify serious infections such as sepsis. For the second quarter we expect relatively flat growth in our molecular diagnostics business as we project growth of the infectious disease business to be offset by the declines in our non-core oncology and genetics businesses.","In point of care diagnostics worldwide sales increased 15.5% with double-digit growth in both the US and internationally as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets. Strong growth in the quarter was driven by continued performance in the large hospital segment, as well as continued adoption in the physician office laboratory and ambulatory setting, where small portable solutions such as Abbott i-STAT help improve efficiencies.","For the second quarter, we expect our global diagnostics business to generate mid-single digit operational sales growth. In medical devices, sales in our vascular business increased 2% in the quarter. Sales of our MitraClip product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation increased strong double digits in the quarter, both in the US and internationally. Last month we presented data that reinforces MitraClip\u2019s ability to reduce mitral regurgitation and improve a person\u2019s overall health and that supports further adoption of this device.","Our endovascular business continues to have momentum with sales growing high single digits in the quarter driven by strong growth in our base business, including vessel closure, as well as our peripheral stent, Supera. And in our drug eluting portfolio in the US we have gained sequential market share following the XIENCE Alpine launch. XIENCE alpine is the only drug eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions. We have also recently announced the launch of XIENCE Alpine in Japan.","For the second quarter, we expect sales in our global vascular business to increase low single digits on an operational basis. In diabetes care, global sales in the first quarter increased nearly 3% as this business returned to growth after lapping the impact of US reimbursement changes. Outside of the US, strong consumer and physician adoption of our revolutionary new glucose sensing technology, FreeStyle Libre, has exceeded our initial expectations driven by a successful direct to consumer campaign.","We continued to expand FreeStyle Libre to new geographies. Earlier this month, we announced the launch in India of FreeStyle Libre Pro for professional use. Libre Pro uses the same sensor based technology as our consumer focused FreeStyle Libre product and helps doctors obtain the comprehensive data they need to make treatment decisions. India is a logical target market for Libre Pro because there was a large diabetes population, but self monitoring of blood glucose is not a common practice.","In the US we have and will continue to segment our products and our commercial strategies to drive profitable growth. And last week we announced the launch of FreeStyle Precision Neo, a new compact, easy to use, blood glucose meter that allows people with diabetes to easily access a well-known multinational brand in the over-the-counter market segment. For the second quarter, we are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in our diabetes care business.","In medical optics, sales were down 3.4% in the quarter. While this performance was below our expectations, we expect to improve sales growth in our medical optics business over the rest of the year as we launch new products. Earlier this year in the US we launched TECNIS Multifocal Low Add, which provides more range of vision options to patients and surgeons. And just last week-end at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Meeting we launched our TECNIS Preloaded in the US, which improves the ease of use for the cataract surgeon and enhances predictability of the procedure.","For the second quarter, we expect our global medical optics business to grow mid single digits on an operational basis. And lastly, our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD, where sales increased strong double digits in the quarter, including the impact from recent acquisitions of CFR pharmaceuticals and Veropharm. In February, we completed the sale of our developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business to Mylan. With this business now focused entirely on emerging markets we saw low double-digit underlying sales growth in our key emerging markets, which include India, Russia, China, Brazil and Colombia along with several additional markets.","Performance across the Latin American region was strong during the quarter as we are starting to see the benefits of a more complete product portfolio and sales infrastructure due to the integration of CFR. Additionally Influvac sales were strong and benefited from the production capacity expansion we completed last year. For the second quarter, we expect similar strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis, including the impact of the acquisitions I mentioned.","In summary, our first-quarter earnings per share and operational sales growth exceeded expectations. We launched several new key products across our portfolio of businesses and our outlook for the year remains unchanged as we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth.","We will now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, congratulations on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just like comment from a big picture perspective, you have now really have done a great job of re-shifting the portfolio with disposition of the developed established pharmaceutical business and bringing in CFR and Veropharm, just how are you thinking about just kind of shaping Abbott going forward. It doesn\u2019t necessarily seem that you need to be in a rush to certainly deploy any of the cash, and you have plenty of flexibility, but just how are you thinking about just kind of more from big picture strategic perspective kind of what is next?","Miles White","Thanks for the question Kristen. I would say we want to grow and we want to get bigger. And I think there is, obviously two dimensions there. One is organic and organic can be expansion of products or expansion of geography and then there is I think our footprint could benefit from being a lot bigger in a number of our businesses or even as a corporation in the diverse mix of businesses we have.","So that would imply some M&A activity et cetera, and nobody would be surprised to hear that out of me, I don\u2019t think. So I think both dimensions are important to us and we are putting a fair amount of attention on both. The notion is I think we have got the right core. It is a very solid core of businesses that are performing well or they are in markets that we know will continue to be healthy and drive good growth and have great opportunity for us.","I think we have got the core of the company well positioned today for the attractiveness of both product markets and geographic markets that we think there is a lot of opportunity for investors for. But beyond that I think we can do more and I think we can do a lot more and particularly if we\u2019re bigger in a number of these spaces. So my intention is to get bigger. I think strategically that is how I\u2019m thinking about it. ","And to your comments about resources and timing and so forth as I have said in the past they don\u2019t feel particularly capital constrained or resource constrained and yet I don\u2019t feel like they have to rush out urgently either.","I think we can afford to be thoughtful and prudent but at the same time that doesn\u2019t mean sit on our hands. So I think the deal market or the M&A market out there \u2013 I would love to say we all go out there with a plan, we have the following priorities, we have the following targets et cetera. Those plans are always dead on arrival, the market tells you either who is willing to talk to you, who is willing to engage, what valuations maybe, what the circumstances in any given geography or industry may be, those things always tend to determine the timing of opportunity and I think what we have been good at is being ready even opportunity aligns, and when peoples\u2019 willingness to engage aligns and so forth.","And I can\u2019t always predict the timing of that. But I can tell you if you are not ready when the things line up then you are not able to take advantage of it. So, we are obviously I think always tracking, always studying, and we have always got an idea of what our priorities would be. The market will tell us what order we get to address and to some degree, but you are right.","We are sitting in a very, very good position I think right now in terms of our readiness, our ability to have resources et cetera, to invest, the condition of our underlying business. We have given a fair amount of attention to our cost structure, to our supply chain structure, to our back office structure, our G&A, all those sorts of things over the last couple of years really to ready ourselves for bigger business and greater expansion, particularly geographically, and I would say that has all fallen very nicely into place.","You can see it in the results, you can see it in the gross margin, you can see it in the G&A line, you can see it in the efficiency of the business, you can see it in the growth rates of some of the businesses and so forth. I think I feel pretty good about the foundation and that is the kind of foundation you want to add to. You don\u2019t want to add to a weak one with a lot of problems or a lot of things you are trying to fix and you want to add to a strong one. So I think we are in a really good position right now. We feel good about it.","Kristen Stewart","And you have been really reshaping Abbott to be more of a consumer focused business, is that how we should think about M&A priorities going forward in terms of things that could really leverage kind of the Abbott brand and stay within that structure?","Miles White","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say to an extreme degree. I think, the word I have used a lot in the past is balance. I think historically, particularly in developed markets a lot of our businesses were reliant on government reimbursement or single payer systems and so forth, and we wanted a different balance of that, where there was consumer choice, consumer preference, consumer pay et cetera.","The very nature of the mix of our business is now is much more like that, not just because of the businesses, but because of geographies and the structures in those markets. So I would say we have and, for example, in our pharmaceutical business, branded generic pharmaceutical business overseas, those are very much consumer pay markets. The economic structure of those markets is a little different. They are more attractive to us. We have targeted those countries with that structure in particular as opportunity. So I would say to the degree that opportunity exists for us, yeah, it is very attractive.","But I would not rule out, Europe, the US or traditional markets as opportunities for us for some of our businesses. I just want a different or a more balanced structure, so we are not over-reliant on heavy concentration in given geographies where there is an awful lot of decision control at a central point. And then a lot of European countries are like that. It is one of the reasons Europe hasn\u2019t been as high a priority for us as emerging markets, but I wouldn\u2019t run all the way to one side of the boat either.","Kristen Stewart","Perfect. And then just a quick follow up for Tom. Tom, would you be willing to provide just the organic growth in the quarter for Abbott overall and then just --?","Tom Freyman","And the top line is the mid single digits adjusted for the acquisitions.","Kristen Stewart","Perfect, okay, thank you.","Tom Freyman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","Thanks. Just to clean that up to Tom. Anything more precise than mid-single digits on the organic growth?","Tom Freyman","Right around 5 Mike.","Michael Weinstein","And then the - it was a [bead] [ph] on the quarter but then not raising the EPS guidance is that just the timing of FX impacting the P&L over the course of the year?","Tom Freyman","I\u2019d say a lit bit of it is that certainly in that exchange gain loss line I talked about that should be considered to be a little extra in this quarter offset by some negatives over the last three quarters in the currency area. I\u2019d say we\u2019re although - it was a really good high quality quarter when we look at how the business has progressed both on the top line and particularly in the gross margin area and we\u2019re just pleased with that progress at this early point of the year and I think it sets us up nicely to continue to build on that as we progress through 2015.","Miles White","Mike, I would add to that the analysts and investors who cover us have all paid a lot more attention in last couple of years to currency than have had to in years past and probably because multinationals have expanded so much in a lot more countries; I mean we all used to be so euro focused and yen focused and lot of companies still are, but because so much of the growth for many of us is Asia, Latin America, other emerging markets we pay a lot more attention to a lot more currencies and I think that\u2019s made it harder to forecast and predict particularly the mix and the shifts and so forth although, when it all goes in one direction like it did the last couple of quarters that\u2019s pretty easy.","But for us, at least in terms of the currency piece I think all of us were caught off guard somewhat by the magnitude of the currency shift in the fourth quarter of last year, although maybe we shouldn\u2019t have been, but we were. And in our case as I pointed out in the past we\u2019re less vulnerable to the euro, very much less vulnerable to the euro than a lot of companies might be just because of the mix of our business and where we produce and offset the exchange, but then that means we got a bigger basket of currencies to look at, look at those currencies and I say okay, well the ruble improved on us in the first quarter, thank God, and quite substantially while the Brazilian real did not and went the other way. China is very stable, India is pretty stable for us right now.","So, the big currencies that you would normally think would affect us or could affect us and knock on wood and I look at, I think okay this should all be pretty stable for the year barring events I can\u2019t predict in the external world. With regard to guidance which you asked about and I\u2019m circling back to, I just think it\u2019s early in the year to do any change in the guidance, I\u2019m kind of a Murphy\u2019s Law believer that the minute we make any kind of confident move something is going to go wrong with currency or something, I don\u2019t know. I just think it\u2019s a little early in the first quarter; I\u2019ve to say to echo Tom, the underlying performance of the company is real good and to the extent that this momentum continues and there is no change to earnings assumption - or to currency assumptions and so forth, you\u2019re going to be pressuring us on this point again in the quarter here. And that\u2019s all good, but I think I just like to see more cards played before we move in that direction.","I look back over our last 7 or 8 years to see how many times we had adjusted guidance in the first quarter and I think we just gave it to you a couple of months ago so to change it two months later does that make sense. I think when we change guidance a couple of times in the first quarter in the last 8 years and I\u2019m not even sure why I did it then, because I think in general I had to see half the year played before I\u2019ve got a good feel for how things are going to lay out because generally the second half of the year is different than the first half of the year for all of us and it\u2019s usually around the currency or some catastrophic event and world events and I would just like to see another quarter played and then if we\u2019re cranking along like we seem to be then you\u2019re going to be pressuring us and I\u2019m going to be nodding and say you told me so you were right.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. So let me switch to strategy, so Miles depending on what plays out with Mylan I could see you guys in the year with maybe $12 billion and $13 billion of cash probably it\u2019s for nickel that would be outside of the U.S. you would have still call it $5 billion of net debt potentially net cash, -- made that point. Does the cash position and the fact that really all of it being outside of the U.S. is that really drive you to an acquisition of U.S. assets or U.S. domiciled assets and do you think you can put given the opportunities that you think you can put that cash in your balance sheet to work?","Miles White","Let me go in reverse order, do I think I can put the cash in the balance sheet to work? Yes. The timing of when I can put at the work is kind of the question which I sort of addressed to Kristen a little bit ago. I can\u2019t predict timing very well Mike, I can predict in ten and my intent is that I\u2019ll put it at the work. I think we\u2019ve always found the good balance here, we are pretty stable, reliable, predictable in terms of dividend and payout and so forth and we have been pretty solid about balance of share buyback and capital deployment but we have also been pretty good about deploying the higher return investments and so forth and I think our deal records speak for itself. So, I would say yes, the intent there, the timing is little harder to predict but I\u2019m not [indiscernible]. Now having addressed that GMI, am I stuck with only opportunities overseas because of the structure of tax system in the world. No, I don\u2019t think so, I\u2019m not ruling out the U.S., I am not ruling on that at all and I think, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve got great tax guides and great management of our cash flows and access to cash if we\u2019ve through and I think we\u2019ve got good borrowing capacity if we want to so forth.","I think I\u2019ve got enough flexibility that I don't have to stay in an external world. I think there is a lot of reasons that overseas \u2013 say economically more attractive. We all know what those are, but I think those are all sort of financial packs cash related at the same time I think there is opportunities that are attractive to us strategically for our business that aren't overseas and I don't think I can rule those out. So I don't feel constrained to being overseas. I don't feel like our ability to finance what we may be interested in, its constrained that way so while I am always looking in other geographies of the world for opportunities to expand our footprint, I would tell you I have not failed to fish in my own dock here in the U.S. and look at opportunities in the U.S.","Michael Weinstein","And Miles last question and I\u2019ll jump in, it\u2019s been relatively quiet over the last six months since the treasury action on U.S. corporate and voting to outside the U.S. is that something Abbott might still consider?","Miles White","I am not looking at it. Let me put it that way. The \u2013 I may not evenly think that Washington will come to its senses eventually here and make adjustments to the tax code to mix U.S. based multinationals more competitive globally with all the companies that we compete with. I mean there is a lot of script written about this and my position on its been clear. This tax code disadvantage U.S. companies and put the sale sign on them for European and other companies to buy us and arbitrage tax rates and I strenuously object to the philosophy of the U.S. government on that line because I think in no way enhances job global creation or business creation or economic recovery in the United States when you advantage everybody else to buy our companies. So I hope at some point that both parties in Washington will address that and I think so. Again, one of the log, I think the minute we did something in around in version or otherwise that Congress surely would change the tax code and I wonder why bothered so I am not \u2013 and I am not even sure I am not tax technician to tell you whether there is a path to do that anymore.","I think right now the way things have been structured in a way the treasury addressed it and affecting the trend for some companies looking in version I think it\u2019s clearly advantage that different M&A environment for non-U.S. companies for the U.S. companies I think that's absolutely clear and you would have to be blind not to see it. So I don't \u2013 it\u2019s not on my radar screen Mike. I am looking at things more strategically and more traditionally meaning I look at the strategic fits of the business or what we can do with it and what we can expand it and so forth and I look at whether those economics working, I am not trying to subsidize our M&A analysis with tax arbitrage.","Now, I think lot of other companies [ex-U.S.] are definitely subsidizing their analysis with tax arbitrage because they can but we are not and that said I don't \u2013 I am not seeing the expectations of tax inversion premium in value. I think values are high. I kind of always think they are high. I think they are high around the world for a lot of reasons, a lot of deals are getting done at expensive prices and expensive multiples they are not because of inversion or tax they are just expensive and that's driven expectations in a lot of places up, but I always think it\u2019s expensive out there and my job is to make the best deal I can for the company, but it\u2019s pretty hard to get a real deal in some cases unless you have got a plan for what you are going to do with the business and how it\u2019s going to operate in your hand.","So I guess to summarize all that there is \u2013 the short answer is I am not focused on inversion for the benefit of tax. Doing those things is temporarily pre-disruptive to a company and if there is a long term belief that you need to do that and some companies have done then it must fit them strategically. In our case I don't know that we need to do that and I would rather hope here that our government will fix the tax code in the next couple of years and if they do I think it\u2019s going to dramatically enhance the competitiveness of companies like us. It\u2019s commercial for me but that's kind of the deal.","Michael Weinstein","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you. Good morning Miles, Tom and Tim. I wanted to just start with the business actually and specifically around medical devices where actually, I think the overall growth rate of that business looks to be trending a little bit better than where it has. So, I was hoping if you could just go into little bit more depth on the turn in the vascular business and then also what gives you confidence specifically on the medical uptick side that will see a churn in that franchise through the balance of 2015?","Miles White","Okay. Let me start with the vascular side. I think what we have seen occur here over the last few years in the core strength business in particular because everything kind of revolves around the strength business, is a certain amount of stability out in the marketplace, there is always price pressure. There still is. The major competitors in the market are pretty competitive and physicians that use our product they use all of us. And they kind of balance it. So I think what you have seen is the value of incremental innovation has diminished and the market has kind of stabilized, one might even suggest that\u2019s commoditizing to a degree but it\u2019s kind of stabilizing, so I would say there is kind of drum beat to price pressure as governments are payers or hospitals or whatever the case maybe are trying to manage their own budgets and in some ways I think it just forces [indiscernible] a lot more innovative about where our next frontiers are etcetera. And I think that in the medical device business there is a lot of opportunities for innovation and rather than look at much broader footprint of very matured products we are putting our focus on a lot of innovation at eventual levels and a smaller level where there is a lot of opportunities for growth expansion and continued improvement to health care.","I am not prepared to talk a lot about that today, but I would tell you that's where I am headed with that to grow and expand that device business perhaps a little differently then what people might expect. But I like the core of what we have. I think we are going to have to manage it a little differently going forward but I think the expansion for a lot of other related areas is there. On medical optics it\u2019s kind of two stories here, am I pleased with our performance, sometimes. We had three or four very strong quarters in a row and then the business kind of hit a wall, there is several explanations for that part of its us, part of it is our own competitiveness or responsiveness, part of its one of our main competitors kind of waking up again and responding to the share that we had taken in the cataract business. I would sort of attribute that to just the ebb and flow of competition and which is good. There is also some structural things going on there in the optics business. We are seeing some customer consolidation in the Lasik market. We are seeing lower utilization in the Lasik market. We have been seeing that for a number of years now.","Cataract business for me is strong. We have got a great drumbeat here of innovation coming steadily, our R&D groups have done a fabulous job I think over the last several years and they continue to just constant product innovation and launch. So, I think there are some tactical things we got to do a lot better. I like this business it\u2019s one I want to expand in if you got these you got to adjust internally it makes it little harder to expand, you like to add to a strong and well operating core. So, we know we\u2019ve got some improvement to do in our performance and I would say optics means on my radar screen is one to expand because there is lot of opportunity there.","David Roman","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe switching gears on the nutrition side, I think in your prepared remark you said that you had entered the Chinese market in adult nutrition with ensure in retail stores there, I know that\u2019s an opportunity that sort of in its infancy right now, but would you sort of agree with an assessment there overtime that Chinese adult opportunity can be low kind billion dollar -- $2 billion or $3 billion opportunity sort of using the Vietnam template as an example I\u2019m just looking at kind of a demographic opportunity in China and how long would it take you to realize something like that?","Miles White","I\u2019m breathless to your expectations, look I would tell you I\u2019ve an ambition to put a big business. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll put it two or three in front of the billion here and I would like to get to few hundred million and kind of get some critical math and momentum. I do have an ambition for it to be a very substantial business, kind of along the line directionally headed. I\u2019m just cautious about getting ahead of myself here on that, I\u2019ve got a couple of businesses here at Abbott, but I\u2019ve had those same ambitions for 10 years and there is still around half a billion dollar. So, I don\u2019t want to perpetually be a visionary because it never comes true. I would like for it actually to happen and so in this case I would say, I believe that opportunity is there, I believe that potential is there. We got to establish the category, we got to establish the use, we got to establish the brand and I think what we\u2019ve seen in the past is that every country we\u2019ve done that in, it\u2019s been pretty substantial, we create the category, we\u2019re the category, we got to do that in China, there is an adult category in China. It\u2019s a little different than what ensure or does, but there has been some regulatory change there that\u2019s been favorable to us and log us to establish this category at a more rapid pace. And I think it\u2019s attractive and I think there is a big upside here. So, you and I would at least be conceptually online, I\u2019m just afraid to put that specificity around size because I don\u2019t know how long it might take.","And you could be right and wherever we\u2019re when you\u2019re right, I want you send me a note to let me know you were right because I\u2019ll be very happy if we are. But, I think there is a lot of opportunity to get big like that.","David Roman","Okay. I guess if you feel better we never put a timeline on it so I was more of a peak opportunity \u2013","Miles White","I think you\u2019re going to be right, as I said, we get to a few hundred millions first, we will start and have a temporary celebration and keep moving on, I mean, this is kind of like having a kid and literally and you want him to be a cheater. Let\u2019s just take one step at a time here.","David Roman","I look forward to that celebration. And maybe just lastly on the P&L, looking at your kind of guidance for the year on operating margin, you\u2019ve obviously done a tremendous job of expanding profitability over the past of couple of years. But still as I kind of look at where your margins are versus your peers, it looks like there is still some room to go even after where you end up this year. Are we still sort of in a period where you think Abbott is under earning versus the peer group insurance segment with room to go on the profitability side?","Miles White","I don\u2019t like that characterization so much, I mean, when I look at the study annual progress of really a complex multitude of initiatives nearly from top to bottom line across all these businesses, I think it\u2019s just exactly the way to go about it and \u2013 but, to answer your question directly I definitely see more margin expansion opportunity across a number of these businesses and that\u2019s part of our expectation as we move forward. And I think you\u2019re already seeing it in the first quarter here and we\u2019ve objectives in 2015 for that 100 basis points plus and there is no reason to stop there. I think each of these businesses in moving forward and it\u2019s a huge priority for the management team here as we look at the business.","Tom Freyman","Let me add to that a couple of things that underlying one is, there is some cost side to get there \u2013 there is a lot of load hanging fruit early on that one can get okay that got that. There is other stuff it\u2019s structural whether its supply chain related or plant related where the plant is, cost to labor, cost to inputs, cost to commodities, distribution all those sorts of things, right. The structural ones take longer and if I look at the nutrition businesses as an example where we\u2019ve been added for four, five years, there wasn\u2019t study drumbeat every year, but what we\u2019re seeing the benefit of now is the bigger structural investments we had to make that took two or three years to realize even four years in some cases because of plant plan, occasion, supply chain etcetera. And we\u2019re now starting to see the benefits of that. So sometimes you got to actually change process system etcetera to get at it.","Second piece of it that affects the margins is price and we\u2019re protecting price. This is a little bit two steps forward, one step back. Exchange keeps you racing some of the advantage of the top line and you see exchange advantages here on the bottom line to the extent that you can put pass in right places and that\u2019s true. But for the last few years we\u2019ve watched tremendous advantage gained in gross margin management, cost reduction, you raised by exchange and all multinationals are seeing that to some degree.","So, we look at it and we say okay, we just got to have pretty aggressive targets here to improve these margins steadily. I got to treat exchange almost like a cost at this point each year or price reduction and so constantly we look at the balance of that exchange how we manage it and in effect treating it like an erosion of price because that contributes to margin so you have got multiple factors that work here and we have been very intentional about how we spread our business, spread our cost space, managed exchange, hedged exchange all of those sorts of things to protect that because honestly it hurts to gain it through cost and give it back through price erosion or exchange over year and we have affected mix the markets we choose, the products we choose and so forth, the mix and profitable segments versus some profitable segments, less profitable segments all that affects it. Some of it just takes time now to give you the bottom line answer to your question is there is still opportunity, yes there is. And it\u2019s not just little. We keep plugging it away at pretty big chunks of opportunity here.","David Roman","Okay great. I appreciate all the detail. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley .","David Lewis","Good morning. Miles just coming back to the Mylan stake here your treatment here this stake has been more patient than I think some expected which and so far is working out to your advantage. I wonder what your thoughts from here?","Miles White","Just stumping.","David Lewis","That's right. Patient is perfect but I wonder what your thoughts are here and how you are balancing sort of access to capital and the potential optionality of Mylan and there seems to be this view about west community that you are spending a lot of time thinking about this stake and what you do with it. How much time you\u2019re spending on it, is this sort of important to you and how you are balancing these different factors?","Miles White","I just love the voracious and patience of the investment community. We didn't even finish this deal till February that was two months ago and I know you can say why you could have been thinking about it all ahead of time. Yes, I know but you know until it\u2019s done it\u2019s not done and now it\u2019s done, right. I would also say I don't feel constrained at all by the form of our capital whether it\u2019s in Mylan stock or cash or anything else. The fact is it has no bearing on what we can or can't do from a strategic standpoint because if for whatever reason our capital is tied up in Mylan I would just probably borrow to or unlock it. So I don't feel like I have got any constraint at all. And I am happy to have been patience. When this deal was done you\u2019ll recall the original value put on the sale of the EPD business was 5.3 billion and as I am watching the great theater out there that is surrounding Mylan and the team I\u2019ve respect for the value of our position has risen because investors have valued Mylan stock so you say that's lucky and I think good luck any day, but I am happy that we have been patience because it\u2019s clearly accruing value to us as an owner and investor of Mylan stock, I think [indiscernible] has got to an aggressive team there, he\u2019s got aggressive plans obviously other people have aggressive interest in them and all of that has been in our favorable interest financially and it\u2019s not inconsequential that was $5 billion value, $7 billion now and that's just more optionality for me and I am happy about that so I don't feel like I have to be in a real big hurry to do anything to resolve that stemming and one of the reasons that we only sold a third of the stock is because that's all we wanted to sell.","We didn't want to sell any more than that nor would we have and I would like where our \u2013 where we are with it I think it\u2019s been prudent to hold it, its proven to be a great value gainer for us and it\u2019s not a constraint so there is no hurry on Mylan other than we don't intend to be long term holders but that doesn't need to be hurry if I put it into the cash I can tell you right now I can't earn this much on that because I am earning leaving it in Mylan, so until I need to sell it I think it\u2019s in the nice place.","David Lewis","Okay, very clear at this whole -- doesn't work out I guess you can always be [indiscernible] so the other question I want to go in Tom is gross margins there has been lot of commentary on margins on the call here but specifically this is the strongest gross margin quarter I think we have seen since this has been actually going back before this spin, at least the four quarters before the spin so can you just specifically in this particular quarter any specific drivers of gross margin it does seem largely sustainable under the second quarter but what's really driving the strongest number we have seen in three years?","Tom Freyman","It\u2019s just business mix continuing focus on cost reduction everyone focused on expanding and really it\u2019s across the board is in the businesses. There is a probably a slight amount of this benefit that's coming through there as well but it really is \u2013 really operating focused.","David Lewis","Okay and Miles just one last quick question on and I will jump back in queue, there were two businesses you called out about a year ago as areas you are going to see more intensive management focus I think one was U.S. nutritionals and the other obviously was EPD. Between those two it does appear that there is more sustainable growth efforts sort of coming through a fruitful on the EPD side and the U.S. nutritional business but I wonder if you could update us in terms of that management intensive focus and where you see those two businesses today? Thank you.","Miles White","Well, the EPD business has been pretty transparent to all of you to watch, what we done overtime I mean there was several things going on. One we came to conclusion that we wanted to focus on emerging market not develop markets and that part clearly with strategically better fit within Mylan in a much larger business focused in those developed markets and so we did that. Now you will note we also acquired wonderful company CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America which gave us a very strong position in Latin America and enhance the one we already had and we made a fairly significant move in Russia that got done during the core of the whole Ukraine issue which was a different hit, again [Murphy\u2019s] laws if you believe it can go along -- everything kind of aligned badly and we still got that deal done unfortunately we did it Ruble so it didn't hurt us when the Ruble collapse.","So that was really good strategically and I think that what we have got now in our EPD business which was done fairly transactionally as a complete redirection of that business refocus, re-emphasis where I think the biggest opportunities from our standpoint are for what we are focused on and interested in and so that's been good. That repositioning has been good. It\u2019s been very intentional. It took us about 18 months to get it done frankly I think that was faster than we might have expected, the things aligned very well for us. And so, I look at the underlying growth rates of the countries that we are focused in EPD. They are strong. I look at our own performance, its improving, could it be better, sure it could. But right now it\u2019s double-digit and above its market rates in its countries and I think that's all good.","So I like the positioning of that and that's the core that I can add to. On the nutrition side, we have gone through quite a bit of change too. There has been some management change in the businesses. I like the management team. We have in place right now a lot in terms of its capabilities, it\u2019s just getting its feet under it most of our leaders there have been in place for better part of six to nine months if there has been a change that's good. Some of that's organic some of it\u2019s from outside. We have made some changes in how we are investing in the business and frankly how we are marketing all of that has been a strong improvement. I think the pediatric business is well positioned. We will see a fair amount of improvements in our marketing coming forward here, new product launches and other things that I am pretty excited about but I think will be good for that business.","So, I have actually got a pretty strong comfortable feeling about the U.S. I think our adult nutrition business is weak or weak relative to what I would expect of it. It\u2019s a strong business we are large in the category as you know and I think there is some things that we are working through there. We have got a good team there and it takes a while to see the results of the changes in marketing that we put in place and the changes in products and etcetera. so I think we just got to be I hate to say the word for you guys a little patient to wait for the results to show, but the actions that we have taken which were pretty deliberate are in place. I can remember years ago in Chicago did once that folks are saying all the pieces are in place we are going to super bowl on that and I don\u2019t think we were in 500 that year I think the pieces are in place. The right management in place and I am pretty pleased with where we are with that business. You don't see it as much from your perspective because it wasn't so transactional like divesting or acquiring from the company\u2019s word in EPD, but I think, I need the nutrition business is now well positioned. ","When I look at the international part of it, we withered a number of events whether its recalls or other things in that business and call out one example I would say the team in China has done a wonderful job regaining loss market, loss share loss position from that recall couple of years ago that business is going well. The pediatric business I am speaking of now and the share somewhere between 8.5% - 9% whatever the way we measure it and trending well, those rates are trending well are positioned in a number of other companies in other countries are improving well. So I like the underlying fundamentals of what I am seeing out of our nutrition business and I would like to say a couple of quarters of evidence of good momentum here and I think you will see it.","David Lewis","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Tom Freyman","Okay we will take one last question from the queue please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just two quick strategy questions, one on devices and one on EPD. First Miles it sounds like from your comments that the strategy in traditional devices is going to be a little more focused on smaller innovation based deals and I was wondering is that the right way to look at it because I assume your comments in line to be a lot bigger don't really apply to traditional non-consumer facing MedTech? ","Miles White","Let me clarify it. I wouldn't say exclusively and so I wouldn't want you to think you are only going to see little out of me because that's probably not accurate but I think that you can't just assemble large and mature either. You got to have a foundation and a presence and a core but the future of any core or foundational business in devices almost always depends on innovation replacement cannibalizing yourself with future innovation etcetera. So there is got to be a balance there. And I think we are at a point where we got this very strong core but probably not enough of the innovation that comes from the smaller kinds of companies etcetera and you can\u2019t do everything in our own R&D in that particular business. You can't diagnostic you can't in devices so I would say you might see both. You might see that I can tell you intentionally you are going to see we are going to be investing in smaller opportunities that could get a lot bigger because we want to build the breadth of that business but you are right. We may well have to pay attention to the foundational base as well. So we wouldn\u2019t rule that out, but I don't want to give you the impression that I am just looking at couple of big add-ons or something there because I am not. Does that make sense?","Bob Hopkins","It does. It does yes and will follow up a little bit more offline because I wanted to ask one other one just about EPD because you have done a couple of deals lately I am just curious are there others out there in EPD from an M&A perspective or is this an area where you have kind of found what's available acquired them I am just curious how hard it is to find assets in EPDs since it looks like that's an attractive business long term?","Miles White","It is not hard at all to find asset. That part is easy and it\u2019s not hard to find really good assets. That part is easy and it\u2019s not hard to find assets with good management, good fit, good products, good geographic location. That part actually easy and I think our people and our team and some of our contacts and stuff, I think we\u2019ve a unique advantage there geographically and internationally on that particular dimension, I can think of one or other companies that historically I\u2019ve thought. We\u2019re thinking about it the same way because we keep bumping into them everywhere we go when we\u2019re out hunting, fishing whatever you want to call at looking opportunities, we keep burning into the same one or two companies out there doing the same thing so I know that they think a little bit like we do. But I would tell you that part is easy, well hard part is getting beyond the recognition of it and getting to something where either somebody is interested in a transaction or it\u2019s the value that doesn\u2019t make [indiscernible] and that\u2019s sometimes a challenge.","A lot of the things that we would be interested in and some of the international markets are family sponsored, family owned or privately owned etcetera and sometimes it\u2019s just more it\u2019s just more complicated. It\u2019s not easily transacted, it takes well what I call lot of relational time getting to know each other and getting to become familiar and comfortable to get somewhere with the deal. I would say that CFR transaction this is the fabulous company. It was a family company even though it was public. It had a 90 year history. It was emotional thing for them to sell the company and the company is super high quality, the management is high quality. I couldn't be more pleased and it\u2019s a great home if you are habit for it. It\u2019s a great performer that deal took a while to develop comfort and relations and so forth and that's how a lot of them are that's how lot of them are, [Indiscernible] was the same way and I think it just takes time so if you ask me do I think there is opportunities out there, there is a lot of opportunities but they\u2019re not fast.","Bob Hopkins","Terrific I appreciate the comments, thanks so much.","Brian Yoor","Okay, thank you operator and thank you everyone for all your questions.

Welcome to Abbott's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Brian Yoor","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom, and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2013. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.","In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.55, ahead of our previous guidance range, strong performance across our businesses as well as gross margin and operating margin expansion, expense controls and lower tax rates enabled us to deliver strong double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth, despite the impact of a supplier recall in International Nutrition.","We also announced this morning a 57% increase in Abbott's dividend, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term growth of the company and our commitment to increasing shareholder returns. This declaration increases our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share from $0.14 a share, effective with the dividend to be paid in February 2014.","Reviewing the results for the quarter in more detail, total company sales increased 4.3%, operationally, but excluding the sales disruption in International Nutrition, sales would have increased approximately 6%. Sales growth in International Nutrition was affected by the supplier recall initiated in early August in China and two other markets for certain pediatric nutritional products.","While there were no health issues associated with the recalled products and the supplier subsequently determined the products had been safe for consumption, the recall created significant disruption in these markets. As a result, International Pediatric Nutrition sales were significantly lower than our previous expectations in the quarter. We anticipate that it will take time to work through the impact of this supplier recall and expect lower sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first half of 2014. We initiated additional marketing investments in the third quarter in these markets as part of our recovery plans.","The long-term fundamentals of this business have not changed. Demand for both, adult and pediatric nutrition is strong and we remain optimistic about our growth prospects. Excluding the impact of this disruption, International Pediatric Nutrition sales would have increased in the strong double digits.","Reviewing the results of our other businesses in the quarter, Performance was in line with or ahead of expectations. Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth and Medical Devices delivered nearly 4% growth with double-digit growth in Medical Optics. We again saw a strong growth in emerging markets and also began to see better performance in developed markets.","Total company sales in developed markets increased in the low-single digits, which was ahead of our expectations and a sequential improvement over the second quarter. Abbott's leading market share position and the introduction of new technologies are driving profitable growth in these markets.","Diagnostics, one of our most durable growth businesses, increased more than 6% in developed markets with double-digit growth in point-of-care and strong growth in U.S. Core Laboratory Diagnostics, driven by several large customer account wins.","Medical Optics, also contributed to our improvement in developed markets. Growth of our Cataract business has accelerated over the last three quarters, driven by new product launches, including the TECNIS Toric in the US and TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan.","Total company emerging market sales in the quarter increased 8%, operationally, driven by double-digit growth in each of our three Diagnostics businesses as well as high single-digit growth in Medical Devices. Excluding the sales disruption in International Nutrition, emerging market sales in our Nutrition business would have increased in the high teens.","In Established Pharmaceuticals this quarter, sales increased modestly. While recent macroeconomic and market pressures in certain emerging markets resulted in somewhat slower sales growth this quarter, growth rates in emerging markets have been and are expected to continue to be higher than the growth rates of the developed world and the overall global economy.","Established Pharmaceuticals remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long-term growth in emerging markets, a rising middle-class, improving access to healthcare, and consumers that are seeking and willing to pay for high-quality brands. Emerging markets are projected to drive 70% of the global pharmaceutical growth over the next several years, and the majority of that growth will be from branded generics.","In addition to sales outperformance in several businesses, we delivered strong gross margins and operating margins. Adjusted gross margin was nearly 56% in the quarter, ahead of our expectations with strong execution in both Diagnostics and Nutrition. Adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, a 210-basis point improvement over the third quarter of last year.","We have sequentially improved adjusted operating margin each quarter of this year as we remain focused on improving gross margins and reducing G&A expense. In the third quarter, we increased marketing investment in our Nutrition business to support recovery from the supplier recall while we reduced G&A expenses in other areas.","As I mentioned earlier, this morning we announced the 57% increase in Abbott's quarterly dividend, as we have indicated since early in the year. Over the course of our first year post-separation, we\u2019ve continued to assess capital allocation for the company. We have now completed that assessment and this announcement reflects Abbott's commitment to providing immediate and significant returns to shareholders in the form of dividend.","A strong and increasing dividend has always been important to Abbott. We are recognized as an S&P dividend aristocrat having consistently increased the dividend for each of the last 41 years. We have built the company to continue to deliver sustainable earnings growth and our investment identity continues to be one of growth with now an increased commitment of returning cash to shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss third quarter results in more detail. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Thanks, Miles. Before I go through our results for the quarter, I would like to summarize at a high level the major changes from the expectations we had when we provided guidance back in July. As Miles indicated in his remarks, the disruption in our International Nutrition business that occurred in the third quarter had a meaningful impact on that business in the quarter. As a result of this event, sales in our International Nutrition business were around $90 million lower than our previous expectations.","In addition, we decided to make additional marketing investments in the quarter to accelerate recovery. Combination of lower sales and higher spending related to this event negatively impacted our ongoing earnings per share by around $0.05. This was offset in the quarter by better than expected gross margin performance, reductions in G&A expenses, and a lower tax rate. This resulted in ongoing EPS of $0.55, which represents a 31% growth over 2012 and exceeded the midpoint of our previous guidance range by $0.03 per share.","Turning to the details for the third quarter, sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis. That is excluding an unfavorable 2.3% impact from foreign exchange. The sales disruption in our International Nutrition business is estimated to have reduced Abbott's worldwide sales growth by nearly 2%, the sales would have increased around 6% without this event.","Emerging market sales were up more than 8% in the quarter on an operational basis and it would have increased more than 12% on an operational basis without the disruption. Sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses including operational sales growth of more than 10% in Diagnostics and nearly 12% in Medical Optics, along with an improvement in total company sales growth in developed markets.","Reported sales, which include the impact of exchange, increased 2% in the quarter. The third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, ahead of our previous guidance and up 70 basis points over the prior year, despite the impact of exchange reflecting strong underlying performance. Foreign exchange negatively impacted the gross margin ratio by almost 150 basis points in the quarter, somewhat lower than our previous expectations.","In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was approximately 6.5% of sales, in line with previous expectations. Ongoing SG&A expense was also in line with previous expectations reflecting additional marketing investments in our International Nutrition business, offset by G&A expense reductions. Overall, our adjusted operating margin ratio improved 210 basis points in the quarter over the prior year.","Our year-to-date ongoing tax rate through the third quarter was 19%, lower than the forecast we provided on the second quarter call. This 19% rate also reflects our expectations for the full year 2013. The revision to this lower tax rate for the full year resulted in a tax rate of 15.7% for the third quarter.","Turning to the outlook for the full year 2013. Today, we are confirming our ongoing full-year earnings per share guidance range of $1.98 to $2.04 reflecting double-digit growth. We are forecasting operational sales growth that is excluding the impact foreign exchange in the low-to-mid single digits for the full year 2013. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2% on full-year reported sales. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-single digits.","We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55.5% of sales, ongoing R&D at around 6.5% of sales, and ongoing SG&A expense of somewhat more than 30% of sales. We also forecast the full-year net interest expense of approximately $100 million, non-operating income of around $50 million, and around $40 million of expense on the exchange gain\/loss line of the P&L. Finally, as previously indicated, we forecast the full year ongoing tax rate of 19%.","Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2013. Operational sales growth is expected to be in the low-to-mid single digits, which includes the impact of the Nutrition disruption. At current exchange rates, we would expect roughly 3% negative impact from exchange. We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter of approximately 55.5% of sales. We also forecast an ongoing tax rate of 19% for the fourth quarter, in line with the year-to-date rate.","Lastly, similar to the third quarter, we expect the recent sales disruption in our International Nutrition business to impact our ongoing earnings per share by approximately $0.05 in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our forecast.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for the operating highlights and growth outlooks by business.","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Tom. This morning, I will provide an overview of third quarter performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter. My comments will focus on operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.","I will first discuss Nutrition, where global sales increased more than 3% in the third quarter. The sales disruption in International Nutrition is estimated to have reduced global nutritional operational sales growth by approximately $90 million.","Global Pediatric Nutrition sales grew 2.7% in the quarter, including International Pediatric sales growth of 3%. Excluding the sales disruption, International Pediatric Nutrition continues to drive strong growth as it launches new product innovations and executes on geographic expansion initiatives.","U.S. Pediatric sales were up 2%. Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market and continues to drive uptake of recent innovation launches, including Similac Total Comfort, our first switch formula that addresses a broad range of mild-tolerance symptoms.","Global Adult Nutrition sales increased 4.4% operationally in the quarter. International adult sales grew 7.5% overall and double digits in the emerging markets, driven by product innovations in our Ensure product line and execution of market expansion initiatives. U.S. Adult Nutrition sales were up 1%, negatively impacted by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin improvement initiative. Excluding the impact of these exits, U.S. Adult sales would have grown mid-single digits.","As previously discussed, we will continue to see the impact of the sales disruption on International Nutrition growth in the fourth quarter and in first half of 2014 as we continue to work towards recovery, so for the fourth quarter we expect our Global Nutrition business to grow low-single digits on an operational basis.","Moving onto Diagnostics, which delivered another quarter of strong growth with sales increased 10.5%. Core Laboratory Diagnostics operational sales increased 9% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth in the U.S. and internationally.","International sales grew 7.7%, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. U.S. sales increased 15%, driven mainly by a number of key account wins as large health systems continue to choose Abbott's integrated and flexible solutions to management the testing volumes and to increase operational efficiencies.","We also continue to broaden and differentiate our industry-leading assay menu and expect to launch new tests in the area of diabetes, cancer and cardiac care. Most recently, preliminary clinical trial results suggest that Abbott's high sensitive component test on ARCHITECT may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with heart attack symptoms.","In Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 16% in the third quarter. International sales growth of 24%, was led by continued strong infectious disease growth and geographic expansion in emerging markets, including the benefit of tender wins in Brazil, Russia and Africa, as well as continued growth of companion diagnostics.","In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 17%, driven by continued growth in the U.S. hospital and Physician Office Lab segments, as well as strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting our Global Diagnostics business segment to generate high single-digit operational sales growth.","In our Established Pharmaceuticals business sales in the quarter increased modestly. Sales growth in key emerging markets was 2.3%. We continue to focus on implementing tailored strategies to accelerate growth in emerging markets that are projected to remain attractive for branded generic pharmaceuticals over the long-term. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our established pharmaceuticals business.","Lastly medical devices, which includes our vascular, diabetes care and vision care businesses. Sales growth in medical devices increased 4% in the quarter. In our vascular business, worldwide sales increased 2.5%. Sales growth continued to improve sequentially over the second quarter inline with our expectations.","International sales increased nearly 3% driven by continued momentum in key geographies of our next generation drug-eluting stent, XIENCE Xpedition and our bioresorbable vascular scaffold Absorb. This includes continued share gains in Europe as well as Japan where we launched XIENCE Xpedition in August following the successful launch of the XIENCE PRIME small vessel drug-eluting stent earlier in the year.","MitraClip, our first-in-class device for treating mitral regurgitation also contributed to international growth in the quarter. U.S. sales increased nearly 2%. While the drug-eluting stent market declined in the quarter, we have continued to gain share over the course of the year with the U.S. launch of XIENCE Xpedition. Mid single-digit growth in our global endovascular business also contributed to vascular performance in the quarter.","In August, Abbott completed its acquisition of IDEV Technologies which expands our endovascular portfolio by adding the SUPERA stent. SUPERA is available in Europe and is under review by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of blockages in the superficial femoral artery or the SFA. This unique technology provides Abbott an opportunity to further penetrate the largest and the fastest growing SFA segment of the global peripheral market. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect our global vascular business to increase in the low-single-digits on an operational basis.","In diabetes care, global sales in the third quarter increased 1%. International sales, which comprise 60% of total diabetes sales, increased nearly 9% in the quarter driven by continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the implementation of the CMS competitive bidding program for Medicare patients. We project fourth quarter diabetes care sales growth to be down low single-digits on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of CMS competitive bidding in the U.S. partially offset by strong growth internationally.","In Vision care, we exceeded our previous expectations by delivering nearly 12% growth in the third quarter. Cataract sales which represent more than 60% of our global vision care sales, increased double-digits, well outpacing the market. Strong cataract growth was driven by the uptake of new products, including TECNIS OPTIBLUE in Japan and TECNIS Toric in the U.S. Both products provide Abbott with access to large and growing segments of the cataract market, where Abbott wasn't previously competing with Toric lenses representing the fastest growing category in the premium segment. Strong double-digit growth in key emerging markets also contributed to performance this quarter.","In August, Abbot completed its acquisition of OptiMedica, which provides Abbott with a state-of-the-art laser system and immediate access to the rapidly developing laser cataract surgery market. This allows Abbott to have broader reach in the growing cataract market. For the fourth quarter, in our global vision care business, we expect another quarter of double-digit operational sales growth, driven by a continued strong performance of our cataract business.","In summary, while sales and earnings were affected by a disruption in our international nutrition business, we delivered strong performance across our businesses and improved operating and gross margins. Excluding the impact of the supplier recall of nutrition, total company's sales growth was balanced across both developed and emerging markets, with continued sequential sales growth improvement in developed markets and continued double-digit growth in emerging markets. We improved gross margin by 70 basis points and expanded operating margin by 210 basis points in the third quarter.","Finally, we announced a 57% increase in our quarterly dividend demonstrating our confidence in the long-term growth of the company and our commitment to increasing shareholder returns.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","First off, I thought you did a good job of covering all the issues in the Nutritionals business and the impact of Fonterra. I think that's pretty straightforward. Let me start with the dividend, because obviously it's a very significant increase. You have meaningfully changed the profile of Abbott's payout and the ongoing payout ratio for the company.","My question, Tom, is the mix of the company's cash flows because as everybody knows Abbott of course has been generating 70% of its sales outside the U.S. Can you talk about the ability to fund the dividend long term given your mix of sales and cash flows as you look out and do you need to repatriate profits in order to sustain that longer term? Thanks.","Tom Freyman","Yes. I think, we are in really good shape for that Mike. As you know, we have very strong cash flow as a company on a normalized basis this year probably approaching the $4 billion range, and we have been in a very good position today to cover our cash needs between the various geographies. As we go forward, I think we are in a good position to do that with this dividend payout and obviously that is part of the plan. I think over time as the company grows and we fund growth wherever it is, debt levels might gradually increase over time, but we are in very good shape to fund this dividend increase.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay. When the Board, I guess, contemplated what the right mix was going forward of dividend and buybacks and acquisitions, maybe Miles can give us little insight into how you came up with this payout ratio and what's the thought process on the right mix with the company on capital allocation?","Miles White","Yes. If I take you back to the fourth quarter last year when we split the companies and we split, we aligned cash flows and debt and so forth with dividend payout, everything kind of aligned in a proportional way with the cash flow generating capability of the two companies.","You will recall at the time, AbbVie announced a disproportionately higher dividend, we had a disproportionately lower dividend and payout ratio than we had as a combined company historically. We thought that was appropriate for a pharma business like AbbVie's, and the question we had at that time, because we were actually not trying to be dividend neutral between the two companies. The combined dividend, as you will recall, went up a little bit, not a lot, but a little bit and we wanted to kind of stabilize and see what cash flow is going forward, because as we looked at the investment identity of remaining or new Abbott, it was unclear to us exactly where to kind of put the dividend not only from the strength of our performance, but just in general what the peer group and\/or investors would expect. Over the course of the year, we got a fair amount of feedback and we had a chance to look at that and we concluded that it was so essential to the overall identity of the company that the combination of growth and income was important to our investment base and that income piece was actually probably a little more important than we had placed it at that time, which I acknowledged to investors over the course of the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year.","So, in terms of looking at the expectation of it, I acknowledged to investors during the year we\u2019d look at look at it. We\u2019d look at capital allocation. As Tom already indicated, it's not a strain on cash flows or a strain on capital allocation. We are a healthy cash generator, and frankly, I think we are going to continue to be a healthy cash generator going forward, because we are seeing great progress in the margin initiatives we have both on the gross margin line and on the G&A line and I think there is still lot of opportunity there for us to improve margins and improve cash flows as we grow.","So, as we looked at that, we said making sure we live to that historic identity of a combination of growth and income was important, and we came to the conclusion that at the payout ratio we began the year, we were not quite where we needed to be or wanted to be on the income side, so we chose to take it to where we believe that was, at least relative to a peer group, and there were probably several different peer groups investors would compare us to, but relative to the peer groups we would be compared to, we put ourselves in a position where we think we are pretty competitive, if not attractive combination of growth and income, and then from a cash flow standpoint, it's completely achievable.","With regard to share buybacks or M&A activity or other things longer term or frankly even debt pay down, we think that the cash flows just as they have been historically are strong enough to accommodate all of that. So we made the move, and I think rather than tickle our way into it a little bit at a time, we just sort of concluded let's just go where we think it needs to be or would like to be, and we will just set it there and not do this incremental creep up over time. Our investors ought to know what our identity is and what our payouts are going to look like. That's why we just chose to announce it now and get it over with.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","Okay, and maybe just a follow-up one fundamental question if I can and then I will jump. If we look at the quarter outside of the whole issue with Nutritionals, there are really kind of two things that stood out to me, and one was the strength of the Diagnostics business. I don't think people would have expected your U.S. core immunoassay business to be up as much as it was. Then on the downside, the EPD business which continues to struggle. I think people were hoping that as you anniversaried some of the price cuts from last year that that business would start to pick up in the second half and obviously it didn't. So can you talk about what gets EPD going and is the answer a quarter, a year from now, two years from now, is that maybe that just isn't as good as a business as we hoped, does that business remain part of the portfolio? Thanks.","Miles White","Okay, that's an easy one. It absolutely remains part of the portfolio. Couple of things. Earlier in the year, I acknowledged I think couple of times on these phone calls that what I saw as the bigger issue in EPD for us was our own execution. While we had bumped up against some of the volatility of emerging markets from time to time, whether it was price pressure or whatever it might be. The fundamentals underlying that business in those markets over time were strongly in our favor. So the part that was more in our control that I was not as satisfied with was our own execution.","We have made a number of changes in the last few quarters here on that in terms of the structure of our organization, some of the management leading the organization. Frankly the commercial strategies and a linkage between the breadth of our product lines in the therapeutic categories of products in markets that we are marketing and promoting.","It takes some time for that execution to sink in and show some results. So I would tell you, as much as I was self critical of us early in the year about our own execution, I would tell you today what I see coming out of the business is all in line with what I would want to see there. I like what we are doing. I think we are doing the right things, but I think it's going to take probably several quarters here before we see the impact on the top and bottom line. So from an anecdotal standpoint, what I see is all good. And I think the team is doing exactly what it ought to be doing on the execution line for every one of its geographies, but it's going to take some time to see it roll through. So I haven't lost any confidence at all.","And I would say it's going to play out here. Has it been delayed, relative to our initial expectations either because of market conditions or our own execution? Yes. Do I expect it to be further delayed in terms of what the performance would be going forward? No, I don't. I expect it will take a few quarters for us to start to emerge and show up on the top and bottom-line but I haven't lost any confidence at all in the business and its prospects for us going forward.","As an example I would tell you, in the early part of the year, we also saw depressed performance in our Device businesses and we took a number of actions beginning late last year in those businesses and what we have seen this year is every quarter, in particular the Vascular business and the Medical Optics businesses, sequentially improving on the top and bottom line and sequentially improving share. And we track share in these markets geographically as a real measure of whether we are succeeding or not and we have seen great evidence across the board here that we are increasing share in these businesses, improving our positions and that the actions take place.","So I am pretty confident that everything in these businesses is headed in the right direction. It's just going to take us a couple of quarters to see it. I wouldn't have said that quite as strongly about EPD probably three quarters ago but what I see now I like and I think you are going to see that top in bottom-line coming forward.","Now back on diagnostics. There is another story that's taken time to play out. I mean that business keeps getting better every quarter and I don't think anybody expected double-digit sales growth on the top-line and yet its growth keeps improving. It's margins keep improving. It's ahead of its own plans and schedule in terms of operating and gross margin improvement. It's ahead of anything that we have communicated to investors and you on the Street, and I think that they have got great pipeline of systems in development all of which are on schedule to sequentially roll out in the next few years.","So I think that sometimes, because we got this quarterly orientation as public companies, we are impatient about how quickly we want to see the impact and it does take some quarters to see the impact. Since I have seen it in Diagnostics, I have seen it in Vascular, I have seen it in Medical Optics, I have seen it in Nutrition, I have seen it in the performance of our gross margin initiatives, I am confident that EPD will be just fine and then it will play out in the commitments that we made to you and forecast that that we think that business will do.","I think it's fortunate and that I think this quarter is a good example that we had so much success with the margin initiatives, because had it not been for this supplier recall in Asia, we would be spewing profit and sales growth this quarter and I think you would be ridiculing our guidance, but the fact is the issue with Fonterra and our Asian markets did set us back, and yet we still were able to exceed expectations this quarter.","We think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance for the fourth quarter, because I think the recall is going to continue to impact us there for a while. It was about a $90 million hit this quarter, we are currently forecasting it to be about a $100 million in the fourth quarter and yet we are going to maintain our guidance and I think we would have been in a position here to be substantially raising our guidance but for that, so the underlying fundamentals in all of these businesses, and I think EPD too, all look good to me. You just can't see the visibility of the EPD performance yet, but we will.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with the margin question for Tom. The gross margin, I think I heard you say that there was a 150 basis negative impact from FX in the third quarter, Tom. Could you talk about when that goes away and what the implications are looking forward to 2014 and then I just had one product-related question.","Tom Freyman","Well, we do expect, Larry, some of that to continue into the fourth quarter, probably at somewhat lower level, probably closer to 100 basis points since we are currently modeling it. This is an item that does bounce around depending on the currency volatility. Obviously, you know, revenues immediately impact margin and sometimes there is some timing differences on the cost side, but this quarter did come in a little heavier than we thought and we overcame it quite nicely, but we would expect about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter. If rates would stabilize, hopefully next year will be a better year relative to exchange on the margin and it will be share performance, but we will have to see what volatility brings.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks for that. Then on the product side, it would be great to get an update on the progress of ABSORB in Europe and also the next steps for MitraClip in the U.S. Thanks.","Brian Yoor","Hi, Larry. This is Brian. Yes. With ABSORB, we are still continuing to see some sequential improvement there. We had another nice quarter it started to become a more meaningful portion of the portfolio. I think we will continue to see further increases from it in the fourth quarter, particularly as procedures pick up and more adoption takes place. Also in Europe, just as we come out of the summer months, we tend to see procedures pick up, so ABSORB is on track with our plans and continuing to make progress.","Go ahead Miles.","Miles White","Larry, let me just insert one comment there, before Brian moves on. We are representing a whole portfolio of our stent products now across the board, including ABSORB, particularly in Europe. We are seeing sequential share pick up, both versus last year and versus last quarter.","I think that as we forecasted in the past, what we have done to bring pricing into a tighter band across the products and allow physicians and hospitals, let's say, easier substitution of which product they wish to use and we have got ABSORB, I think, priced in a better place now. We are seeing a pretty good share pickup. Actually, we are seeing it in Western Europe, we are picking up share in Japan although that's with expedition same in the U.S., so we are seeing good share pickup now across the board in all these markets. Europe gets the extra benefit of having ABSORB and we are definitely seeing the impact of it there.","Brian Yoor","And then with respect to MitraClip, Larry, I mean again a meaningful contributor to our international sales growth. That is with respect to the U.S. as we just still remain in conversations with the FDA and we want to see where that lands. But we know they talked to us about decision by the end of the year and nothing has really changed from acquisition with respect to MitraClip. It's not factored into our guidance at all at this point","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking the question","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. I was hoping if you could come back to the diagnostics business a little bit. And I think, specifically in your prepared remarks, you talked about a number of big or a few big contracts wins. When I was down at AACC over the summer, one of the things that seemed to be clear among lab managers with whom I spoke was that a propensity for labs looking to do sort of one-stop shopping or looking to buy across the portfolio where you and Roche consistently sort of came up. Can you maybe just talk about the dynamics in the lab market, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? And whether you are seeing the benefit of scale play out at all?","Brian Yoor","Yes, hi, David. This is Brian. With respect to diagnostics, it is one where it is more about the total solution that you bring. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we have had a lot adoption from people who like the flexibility and the scalability and the offering that we bring from end-to-end with respect to our cash with respect to our equipment. We have had, to your point, some nice key account wins in the U.S. with takeaways from multiple competitors in the core lab with respect to our core laboratory business.","Recall, we put in place this enterprise approach to selling. We started with the European markets. As we moved into the U.S. markets, we are definitely seeing that pay dividends in terms of the approach there in terms of selling the complete solutions that we are talking about. So in the U.S., you saw the results in the quarter. That's largely attributed to these account wins. There was like five or so major account wins that we had taken which helps to build momentum. It tends to be sticky over time as well when you are talking about these contracts, because they tend to be longer term in nature.","So If you are looking at molecular, we have again strong growth there. Again internationally infected disease has been our strength. We continue to penetrate there. We had strong double-digit growth in emerging markets having some key tender wins in some key countries Brazil, Russia, Africa. Most of our sales, again 60% of molecular outside the U.S. and that's where we are really growing nicely. And the U.S. is more of that durable growth that we continue to expect to see.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","And then maybe just a follow up on the overall top line outlook, both for this year and also how you think about the business going forward. There has obviously been an evolution of your thinking throughout the course of 2013. I think we started mid to high-single-digit growth for the year and then mid to high single digit growth in the back half and now it sort of looks like where you are year-to-date is kind of where you are saying things are going to be for the balance of the year, and understandably there have been some new factors like the Fonterra situation that have emerged. So maybe if you could just talk about the top line growth profile both on a near and longer term basis. Is 4% the right base line? And then how do you get back to that 5%, 6%, 7% type level?","Tom Freyman","That's an easy one, David. We are right where we expected to be but for the issue with nutrition in Asia in this quarter. Had that not happened, we would be at 6% on the top line and there is lot of ins and outs there. I mean I guess, first we should probably talk operationally which would be the case. I mean clearly exchange this year, I think for everybody, has been a significant issue but in any case exchange comes and goes. The underlying operating strength of the business has ramped just as we had expected it would. It hasn't done it in every single business the way we thought it would.","EPD has been slower. Diagnostics and devices have been faster but what it boils down to is, we would be right where, in fact, we are. I mean we are where we said we would be on the bottom line, where we said we would be on the top line, but for the issue with nutrition in Asia. And I would tell you that our plans haven't changed at all nor have","our expectations. I wouldn't be setting a 4% top-line target, I would be doing higher than that and we haven't changed our expectations because we don't see the underlying factors any differently than we have before and we don't our strategies any differently.","We are not changing our investment profile. We are not changing our geographic profile other than beyond what we have told you. So for us, it's all systems straight ahead and it's so far playing out exactly as we had hoped and expected. We are getting very good gross margin improvement, very good G&A improvement. We get lot of room to go there, our pipelines are evolving very nicely in R&D. Our execution in EPD is progressing just as I have wanted it to, our growth in Nutrition is progressing as we have said and remains strong.","Diagnostics, particularly strong, the Device business is all improving and Medical Optics dramatically so, so I would say, it all looks to me very strong. The one exception and it was a significant exception in this quarter, was the Asian issue with Nutrition and that's one we will just recover our way out of and we are not going to change our intentions with China or any of the other countries.","We are not changing anything about our strategies. It happened it wasn't of our making we are dealing with it and we will continue to deal with it, but our prospects and our expectations haven't changed one bit.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then maybe just a last thing, I know there has been discussion earlier around use of capital and the decision to raise a dividend. Maybe you sort of frame up how you are thinking about M&A that the deals that you have been doing as of late is a good reflection of the type of acquisitions we should expect on a go forward basis.","Miles White","Well, I would say a couple of things, and I go back to the bigger picture. The overall intent of the company as we have described now for the better part of the year as great combination of growth and income hasn't changed and we are in emerging markets for a reason, for the growth that they represent. We are broadly spread in those emerging markets, so we are not over indexed in one.","We are focused on our margin initiatives et cetera, which is going to be an absolutely great improvement over time here to lever the bottom line with that growth. It's going to generate increasing cash flow, so we have the cash to do the things we want to do, so I think, all the working pieces are progressing as we would wish.","One of the things we saw in the quarter that I think is important for investors to note is, that when the company hits adversity, like any company, you expect your management to navigate that adversity and protect your investment. Either protect that investment or improve upon it in some fashion.","I think that what we saw here was even in the absence of the pharma business, we spun-off. The company and its management are capable of managing through adversity and protecting the investors' investment in the company and still delivering the expectations on the bottom line and it hasn't knocked us off of our trajectory or intent.","Now to go more specifically to your question about cash allocation or capital allocation, on the M&A front, it remains an opportunistic world. I would tell you that there is a lot of things that we have looked at and turn down, or decided that they weren't economic to pursue. I would describe the deal market in terms of attractive opportunities right now is limited and where there are businesses that might be available, I think some of that price expectations or value expectations are frankly out of line with reason and we are not poor buyers as you might know and I think also one of the things that's affected that M&A market if you are a dollar-based company and you are looking overseas exchanges definitely affecting the valuations of companies.","I think when exchange is volatile and\/or moving as much as it did this year, it's prudent to wait. It's prudent to wait to see values align, so in some cases we have looked at lot of things. We are always vigilant, we are always paying attention. I can't say we are aggressively hunting, but we are mindful of opportunities as they might fit our businesses or intentions, should we want to add to the business, so I would say we are opportunistically ready if it happens.","We are not constrained from a financing standpoint, nor would anything we might look affect our capital allocation as it might relate to dividends or share buybacks, so we try to maintain a pretty healthy balance for our shareholders over time, obviously, very steady dividend and share buyback to return cash to our investors on a meaningful basis and if we can enhance the growth prospects of the company with something in M&A that fits what we are doing and fits our businesses, or fits our overall governing strategy, then we take a good hard look at it but if the value is not there, we don't move.","I would say that in the past year here, there is only a couple of times when we have found that the value and the strategic intent of the company have lined up in those occasions both with IDEV and OptiMedica, we have moved on it. But other than that, I would say, we are cautiously surveying and not overly jumpy.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that's very helpful perspective. Thanks, Miles.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from with Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, good morning guys. I had a quick question. A follow up on the gross margin. You had 55.9% in the third quarter. So great gross margin and you are calling for about 55% in the fourth quarter. And I know nutritionals are going to -","Tom Freyman","Glenn, actually that's 55.5%, I think.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","55.5%, sorry. And I know nutritionals are going to weigh a little bit more. But are there fewer offsets in the fourth quarter? So Tom I am wondering if you can just give us the put and takes? And then as a follow up, is 55.5% a good number for the first half of next year given the nutritional issues and then strength thereafter? Thanks.","Tom Freyman","Glenn, we are not in a position to talk about '14 right now. So as we get through this year and then obviously we will talk about our guidance at the appropriate time.","Miles White","What Tom really means is we are not going to talk about '14 even if we are able to.","Tom Freyman","Yes. It is probably just some mix things between the divisions I mean every division is showing nice progress. I wouldn't read too much into that slight change in outlook and then hopefully if we continue to execute the way we did in the third quarter, maybe we will do a little bit better than that forecast. So I wouldn't read too much into it and as Miles had indicated and we have said in our remarks, many times it's a driving gross margin improvement over time. It's a major focus of the company. It has been for a number of year now and as we go into '14, obviously we are going to be pushing to drive that off. So I think we will be in good shape when we report in the fourth quarter and nothing significant in terms of what that guidance means.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Can I just sneak in a quick one then. Absorb. I am assuming Absorb is being priced at a premium in Europe. You talked about certain ranges. Can you give us a sense of what the premium ranges are in Europe? Thanks.","Miles White","Glenn, we are trying to decide which one of us is going to answer this question.","Brian Yoor","Let me go ahead, and we talked about this before. It really depends by market. I mean certain markets are going to demonstrate different premiums versus others just where the baseline is, but I think it's really a market-by-market segmentation in terms of how we compete with our portfolio of products. But its not, again, as we know, to be a workhorse type stent and as Miles mentioned it's part of the portfolio solution along with Xpedition and the other things that we have out there, which is contributing to me for share gains, but we, by market, it would be hard to just quote an overall number. But I don't know. Miles, Tom?","Tom Freyman","Yes, I will just say a couple of things. As Miles talked about on the second quarter call, I mean our goal on this pricing is that the price is not a barrier to use and now that's kind of what supports the use of the product as a workhorse stent. So I would say, as we look at it in any one market, it's a relatively modest premium and certainly not a barrier to the use of the product.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Is the only barrier right now reimbursement in certain countries?","Tom Freyman","No, I just think it's a matter of not all lesions lend themselves to Absorb right now. And it's a matter of physician training. Physicians need to become comfortable with it. Those that have used it quite a bit find that they can apply it to a relatively high percentage of the lesion. So those are really the two things that the commercial team continues work on in terms of increasing the uptake for the product.","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Yoor","Thank you","Operator","Thank you. Our next question come from Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning, Miles. Can you talk a little bit more about how the new EPD management team is settling and you touched on it a little bit? Maybe you used some language like we are taking tailored steps to drive better growth. Can you give us any more color on new team strategies or focus? Are they focused more on execution or something else? We would be very grateful for any perspective? Thank you.","Miles White","Yes. Well first of all let me address the team. We have brought a number of new people to the company from other places that have been a terrific addition in terms of their knowledge and experience. The branded generic markets around the world are all a little different country-by-country. That said, they have got a lot in common from a similarity standpoint. They are not like proprietary pharma.","Among the things that we have found, at least in our own management and our own team as we separated the company, we have a lot of people in positions that are very experienced with the proprietary pharma businesses, but not so experienced with branded generic marketing which is marketing a brand, marketing broad product lines, marketing broad therapeutic categories, where a lot of your attention isn't to a given molecule. It's to a channel, to a pharmacy, to a hospital, to a consumer in a lot of cases and often so, but it's about the breadth of offering, the brands and so forth and less about a patentable advantage, so the marketing skills and the channel skills, commercial skills around that are different.","We have made some changes in our marketing teams at the top, we have separated the developed markets from the emerging markets, because frankly their business structures and characteristics are quite different. The channels in the markets are quite different, the way the markets behave are different, our emerging markets don't reimburse, the developed markets do, so there is very different points of call and points that drive the business and I would say now we have got our management team much more aligned with the differences of the various markets and we have got our marketing teams better aligned with it. Frankly then, it's a question of tailoring the particular elements of our therapeutic category. There might be 10 or 12 different therapies in a category like gastrointestinal and we want to make sure we got the right mix for each given market. It could be different from country to country and that align alignment is taking us a little bit of time, but I would say we are in much stronger position now knowing exactly what the mix of products is we want by country by therapeutic category, by channel, et cetera and all of the working in concert is just taking time.","Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus","In terms of the margins again, you clearly indicate you are seeing continued improvements in Diagnostics and Nutritional margin. I think am I understanding correctly that you are ahead of plan in Diagnostics, and when I think maybe Tom, when you talk about the 20% margin goal for Diagnostics and Nutrition by 2015, is that now looking possibly conservative from a timing and\/or magnitude perspective? Maybe you could talk about the ramp up of manufacturing distribution facilities and where we are in all that process Tom?","Tom Freyman","Yes. I mean, the division already had quarters in that range and they are not halting their progress and their activity and I think it's fair. You characterized it pretty fairly, Rick, that we certainly think we are going to do better than that and I think if you follow the results over the next couple of quarters, you are going to see really good progress relative to that goal, so yes, it's the situation in Diagnostics.","In Nutrition, obviously, with the event we are going to get a very temporary setback here until we recover. We still did expand the margin in the quarter, but a little bit short obviously of what we were targeting before the event, because we need to invest to recover, so we get a little bit of a bump in the road there, but I think within the matter of few months we will be rapidly back and continue to target that same high level of improvement in Nutrition that we have been talking about for some time, so Diagnostics, I would say ahead as you characterized it properly and Nutrition we should be right back on track in relatively short order.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Tom, or for Miles, just a quick question on this particular recall in the Dynamics. In other - larger recalls you have seen and this is different and that it's not an Abbott quality issue and the severity of the impact is actually a little bit less, but you are actually assuming the recovery period is going to be quite similar, so can you help us understand the dynamics and whether this guidance kind as it heads into early next year, reflects any conservatives and I wonder just given the dynamics of this recall with other larger players in China, it does actually presents a long-term share opportunity of the company.","Miles White","Well, I would say this. I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell us that exactly because our experience in the past. We have had experiences in the past with whether it's been a recall or some other event that's impacted share, but what happens in the market is, mothers in China are acutely aware and acutely informed and same with Vietnam, same with frankly, I suppose, any market in the world. Mothers are acutely aware of what they feed their babies and they follow infant formula and so forth closely and with social media and other things. They are just an often informed consumer base.","So when something happens that creates any kind of concern, whether it is rumor or otherwise around infant formula, it impact mother's confidence in the product or the brand. And in this particular case, the fear that was created was around botulism and as it turned out not to be valid and not to be true. It didn't turn out that there was a result that way till weeks later.","We can take exception to why it took weeks and so forth and we have had those conversations but in the meantime, the mother switches to another brand. When she switches to another brand, she doesn't have a lot of incentive to switch back real fast. It is like a lot of things. The media around the negative, meaning that the fear of contamination of some sort is far greater and more intense than the media around, gee, it was a mistake. So consequently we and other companies that were affected by this find it more difficult to switch the mothers back than it is for them to have switched themselves in the first place.","So we try to model what the behavior of the consumer is going to be and how we might affect that behavior to get her back, but it's frankly just more difficult. So we model it and the end result is the same, whether it was quality issue from our company or quality issue from another company or simply a rumor that wasn't the quality issue at all. At the end of the day, if the mother is in any way lacking in confidence about a brand or a product, she switches to something else and it take some time to get her back.","So we have invested considerably in a number of things in marketing to rebuild consumer confidence in us, our product, our brand and to attempt to switch mothers back to us who were our consumers in the first place. You follow that model and what eventually happens is the baby moves off of infant formula to baby food and other things and you are starting with a new set of moms coming along who are at a stage where they are going to feed their infant formula and in effect you end up replacing the consumer who was affected by the adversity with new consumers and it's about rebuilding and the brand and the brand confidence.","So it takes time. It's not an instantaneous recovery. And the damage tends to last a while as you cycle out the consumer who has switched away and new consumers cycle in. And that's what keeps the pace of recovery more measured than we otherwise might like it. The more immediate recovery depends on our ability to get that mother back. That depends very heavily on our customer relation management systems and so forth. So we know who that consumer is, so we can reach her through social media and other mechanisms. Unfortunately we have had this experience a few times. So we are getting better and better at it.","I don't know that we are at a point where we can very reliably forecast what that recovery looks like. I would tell you that in the first week here after the event became known to the public, the initial drop off was significant and then there was a steady ramp of recovery. There was a major week long holiday in China and consumers loaded up prior to the holiday because stores would be closed. That created a blip. Then of course it drops off during the holiday. So you have got a bump in the recovery rates. So you look at the trends of the sales and it's choppy because of buying patterns affected by holidays and other things.","I would say, the underlying trend in performance is encouraging but it's still going to be at a measured pace and I think we are going to need some weeks, if not a couple of months here of experience to see how our recovery is going because, frankly in some markets we can only measure data monthly. Otherwise it's anecdotal. In China, we can measure data weekly, but its only segments of the market, so we are getting partial data and a lot of anecdotal evidence about what the magnitude of loss was and what the recapture rate or recovery rate is. I would say, we have seen some encouraging things, but we need more data and time here to trend it out, so it is hard to forecast it out very far.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, Miles. Very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up question. If I think about your statements about this Nutritional business in the beginning of the year, obviously during the year we have had this recall issue that's well understood, we have also had statements by the NDRC in China as well. If you think about structurally your Nutritional business over the next several years, do you still feel as confident in your ability to take share in China and as confident in your ability to drive margins higher? Thank you.","Miles White","Well, let me deal with the last first. I am not like in any confidence at all about the margins. I think that first of all it's a very good business and it's a very good business in China and other markets as well, so I am not concerned about that. The issue that occurred this summer for all manufacturers around pricing, I would say small bump in the road dealt with, but the bigger issue here was this recall.","Now, has that changed our prospects or anything in the way we view China? China is a choppy market sometimes. I think it's big, it's very attractive. It's clear. The Chinese government has its own policies about Chinese companies and what it would like to see as. It's the evolution of its own economy and its own companies and I think you see that across a lot of businesses, a lot of different industries and so forth. Not just in for Nutrition or Medical Products and so forth.","That said, China is an attractive market and it's attractive for us from a growth standpoint and from a share standpoint. It's a very, very competitive market. It's competitive among multi-nationals and it's competitive with Chinese-based companies or China-based companies with whom we compete, so I would say it's an intensely competitive market, share can move, share can change.","It tends to change the most when there is some adverse event, otherwise you are in a battle everyday for share much as we would be in any consumer-like market around the world. Our prospects and our expectations of China haven't changed. Our investment profile hasn't changed. We have built a large plant in China, we intend to build more and we will build more. I suppose it's rather convenient, but we have been looking at our entire global sourcing and supply chain with regard to our Nutrition business and owing to what we believe are the growth prospects globally, China is part of that.","This doesn't change it. In fact, if anything, it's pretty convenient timing that we are considering our total global sourcing strategy at this time and I would say, if anything that helps us focus on what the answers to that might be, so, while China will from time-to-time, as any emerging market maybe from time-to-time, be choppy, I would say collectively the emerging markets overall are pretty attractive opportunity. As we have said before, you have got to be in more than few of them, so that you can balance and mitigate the adversity in any one of them at any given point in time.","I can't recall a year when we didn't have some developing market have a problem whether it was a devaluation or supply problem or something. Foreign exchange issue, whatever the case maybe, there has always been a problem somewhere and there has been over performance somewhere else.","I think collectively, the emerging markets represent an awful lot of growth and an awful lot of development. To the extent that you can balance a portfolio of businesses and geographies across them, there is a tremendous growth opportunity there for companies to participate in.","If you over index in any give place like at China, then your trip is going to be a little rockier. In our case China, is big opportunity, but all of our businesses have somewhere between 8 and 14 markets that they have targeted as primary growth opportunities to balance that potential choppiness from time-to-time. Unfortunately, the investor will read the media about given one of them and I think that looks volatile to investors and if you are only in that country it might be, but we are pretty well diversified across them.","This is a really good example. This was a fairly significant hit but we have been able to absorb it. I wouldn't want to have to absorb this very often, but the point is, with the diversity we have in product line, geographies et cetera, we were able to absorb this, navigate it and keep right ongoing. So I would say, that's a plus. If you are going to participate in these kinds of growth markets and access the growth that's there, then you have got to have enough breadth to manage that volatility from time-to-time and we do.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you very much","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just firstly on nutrition. What kind of confidence do you have in some of those outer year revenue guidance ranges that you talked about in the $9 billion to $10 billion range for 2015. Does the recent impact of the recall in China impact that aspiration at all?","Secondly, do you think there could be any positive structural tax benefits for you going in to 2014? Which is the closer rate to think about, is it more like 21%, more like 19%.?","Then just on the buyback. You made some helpful commentary, but could you just be a bit clearer. Would your intention to be to actually reduce the net share count for the company or just a more or less offset employee stock options?","Then just lastly. Consensus margins call for flat margins basically between 2014 to 2016. Obviously that's calling for maturation of the margins and a topping out of the underlying efficiency gains. Would you be disappointed with flat margins, the EBIT level between 2014 and 2016? Do you think you can do better? Thank you.","Brian Yoor","Well, you got all that done in one breath. Let me see if I can run back through all that. Margins, for starters. I haven't looked at what the consensus is across the analyst community. But I would tell you that it depends an awful lot on what happens with exchange for starters and what happens in general in the economies of the world. So I would say, as a company we expect to improve our margins and I have great confidence in that.","That said, actions taken from time to time either by governments on pricing or exchange or other things do affect margins one way or the other and that is less predictable for us, of course, but had we not had the progress we have had in our own operational margin improvements and G&A margin improvements we wouldn't have been able to absorb those for our investors and we have and still improved margin in spite of that. So I would tell you that as a baseline, in terms of margin improvement, I would expect us to continue to improve margin. What I can't predict for you is the external factors that might impact it.","Tax rate. In 2014, Tom?","Tom Freyman","Just like all of the guidance type questions, we will cover that at the appropriate time in the future. Obviously as I indicated in my remarks, we expect this rate to continue through the fourth quarter and to be our rate for the full year '13 and we will see how it trends as we go into 2014?","Brian Yoor","You better to be clear which rate you are talking about. This quarter's rate is not a fourth quarter rate.","Tom Freyman","Right. The 19% rate that we have in the year-to-date third quarter and the 19% we predict for the fourth quarter, 19% for the full year is how we are going to finish '13, we believe and we will see how we trend into '14 as we finalize all our planning activities on '14.","Miles White","Yes, we are careful Jeff, not to give guidance in pieces. I know that a lot of you want a build models for 2014 but we don't talk in terms of payout ratio and dividends, we don't talk about some of these elements because everybody will be backing into some earnings estimate for next year which we are not prepared to talk about yet. I want to see how some of this trending is going to come in the fourth quarter. Our goal is always double-digit. So that part is fairly straight forward. You could start there every year but how the elements will come together is still to be seen.","Now I have got to back up, and remember, the other early parts of your question. Growth in the nutrition over the long-term here. The goals in terms of revenue growth in nutrition haven't changed.","What I can tell you is what the recall in Southeast Asia will do at least in the near term. I think I know what's it going to do and I think I know how we are going to recover from it and I think I can project that to some degree but frankly it was a setback. So it has probably cost us some time, but I wouldn't say it is going to cost us longer term. The revenue we aspire to or the share we aspire to et cetera, it's a just a question of time and the pace at which we can recover it, so I think there is kind of a finite magnitude of its impact on us and we then grow beyond it. I would say our revenue aspirations haven't changed, whether we got the timing just right or not, unclear.","What I want to be careful about doing is, giving you a specific number for 2015, because I don't know what that number ought to be exactly, so full transitory that way, but in terms of general growth rate here and general trending I would say our aspirations for the Nutrition business haven't changed. Then finally, you asked about buybacks. Tom?","Tom Freyman","Yes. I mean, we have continued to be a company that buys back shares most years, virtually every year. We have been pretty active this year continuing to buyback probably in the $1. 5 billion range.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Question was specifically though around what we were just trying to offsets options and stock comps versus share count and frankly at a minimum we do. The employee grants and so forth and generally share count has gone down.","Tom Freyman","Right. Obviously, the baseline would be the dilution impacts, so we have been pretty opportunistic to increase beyond that. Like the other questions, we will see how we do in 2014, but have a substantial authorization in place, I think over 2.6 billion remaining on that authorization, so we have plenty of room to continue to buy back shares as we see appropriate.","Miles White","We don't like share count to go up, actually we like it to go down. We have got one more call in the queue please? One more question?","Operator","Yes. Okay. Our final question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Thanks for taking the question. Miles, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your thinking within kind of the medical product side, specifically within devices. A lot of companies within the space have been talking more and more about the increased importance of being really deep and broad across product line, so I am just wondering how you are feeling with the Vascular business and to what extent going forward, do you think you need to be more broadly in cardiovascular to really be successful there. Then also kind of your thoughts on how to position the Diabetes business, whether that might be another opportunity for you to expand as well?","Miles White","Okay. First, let me take the Cardiovascular Device business. We have a desire to be broader, I suppose like everybody else does. I think the timing in the categories you are broader in depends on your strategy and it depends on how you want to get there, so I would say our acquisition of IDEV was in a category, where we wanted to be broader. No question about it. That was an attractive opportunity for us.","We always have a pipeline of opportunities that we are tracking, some of which we have equity investments in and participate either passively or indirectly in and others more directly, so I think it's kind of question of when those opportunities ripen and when the right time is to bring them into the portfolio if we do that. I would say, we are always looking to broaden the device businesses and we are always looking for innovation beyond our own.","That said, I think it depends on the timing. There's a lot times in the Device business that companies will go out and invest in a lot of things early and it will take four, five, six years for something to develop. We have made equity investments early, but we tend to wait until we can see the whites of its eyes before we are ready to move more substantially on an investment. We can tell it's coming to commercial fruition, so I would say we definitely continue to have aspirations for breadth that way. That would be true of our Medical Optics business as well.","Turning to Diabetes Care, lot of change going on in that market right now and I would say that in particular in the U.S. with the competitive bidding and so forth. If you track the few competitors in this space and their responses to that and compare our various performances, you will see that there has definitely been an impact on the Diabetes Care business dramatically for some relative to others, less impactful on us. Our strategy has been different there than some of our competitors. And I think we have held share and revenues very well.","Longer term. The strategy, at least for us, is a focus on very innovative family of products coming in our R&D pipeline that we have alluded to in the past and are beginning to emerge now, I think are beginning to get some visibility now in terms of continuous testing and so forth that I think will be game changing and very well received by the market. That's very different than the base core business today. But we have actually great expectations and aspirations about that. And we think we are in a position here that others are not in, at least in this particular category. So we have got great hopes for what our R&D people are coming with. As I said, it's beginning to show and as the next 12 months or so progress, you will start to see more of that.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities","With the continuous testing, is that just expanding or I guess some sort of Navigator iteration?","Tom Freyman","Well I would say, it captures some of the intent of Navigator but in a very different way. So I think it's meant to address the frequent tester, the insulin dependent tester and the person who clearly wants easy but a frequent continuous monitoring instantaneously and in a different way, somewhat different way than Navigator but it's clearly met to address those who were Navigator users and others and frankly on top of that.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities","Just last question, I guess. Would you also be looking to expand beyond the existing kind of businesses that you are in within devices or just deepening across more adjacencies?","Tom Freyman","Well, you know, I just never kind of forecast that. It's always possible because we look for businesses that have characteristics or criteria that are consistent with the characteristics in our portfolio, and it depends to some degree on whether those businesses have an advantage being part of Abbott or we can do better with it than what we see it doing standalone or as part of somebody else. So I would say first priority is always related strategic fit with our existing businesses but in some cases it might be a new category. Although today I could tell you, I am not focused on something that's not part of Abbott now.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities","Okay. Thanks very much.","Tom Freyman","Okay, thank you.","Miles White","All right.","Brian Yoor","Thank you, Lisa. Thank you for all your questions and that concludes Abbott's conference call.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian and I will take your questions.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks Scott, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll discuss our 2016 results, as well as our outlook for 2017. For the full year 2016, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.20, representing double-digit underlying growth. Continued strong performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion enabled us to deliver adjusted earnings per share at the upper end of the initial guidance range we set forth at the beginning of last year. ","Importantly, 2016 was a year of significant shaping for Abbott. We\u2019ve lined our businesses with long-term growth trends, and it\u2019s been our intention to build leadership positions in all areas of healthcare where we compete. This past year, we took multiple strategic steps to ensure we\u2019re in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for our future.","I\u2019ll start with the pending sale of our medical optics business, or AMO. We entered the vision care business several years ago with the intent that AMO would be a foundational cornerstone for us to build upon. Under Abbott, this business performed well, gaining share and improving operating profitability; however, as we looked over the long term, we didn\u2019t see sufficient opportunities for us to build AMO into a more broad-based leader in vision care. Strategically, the decision was made to strengthen our medical device business in a market that offered the greatest long-term growth and leadership potential, and that market is cardiovascular care, one of the largest and most important areas of healthcare.","The recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical creates the kind of market-leading position we seek in all of our businesses. This includes strong positions in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market, including coronary stents, cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Importantly, Abbott now has one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry. The combined best-in-class portfolio has the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors.","So we enter 2017 as a stronger company. The fundamentals of the markets where we compete remain strong, and we have good momentum across our businesses. We\u2019re also entering a period where innovation and new product launches will fortify our leadership positions. I\u2019ll touch on some examples and important new products during my commentary on each of our businesses in a moment.","As we announced this morning, we expect to deliver strong financial performance in 2017. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint.","I\u2019ll now provide a brief overview of our 2016 results and 2017 outlook for each business. I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where Abbott is the global leader in the adult market and maintains leadership positions in the pediatric market across several geographies, including the number one position in the United States.","As expected, fourth quarter sales growth was affected by challenging market conditions in China, including new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect in January 2018 and a consequent oversupply of product in the market. Although we expect market conditions will remain challenging in 2017, the longer term fundamentals of the Chinese infant formula market remain attractive. With localized R&D in China and a world-class global supply chain, we\u2019re well equipped to navigate this highly dynamic market with a competitive portfolio of products that are aligned with evolving customer needs and purchasing channels.","In the U.S., we continue to outperform the pediatric nutrition market driven by several recently launched new products, and we continue to drive strong growth in both pediatric and adult nutrition in Latin America and Southeast Asia.","Turning to established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, which achieved double-digit operational sales growth for both the fourth quarter and full year 2016, EPD has grown into the business that we envisioned when we created and further shaped it through a series of strategic actions, including the sale of our developed markets business and the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia. ","With leading market positions in several geographies, including India, Russia and Latin America, EPD is well positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world. In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to execute our unique operating model which focuses on portfolio selling in core therapeutic areas where we have well recognized, highly trusted brands. This portfolio approach creates unique channel opportunities in differentiated relationships with physicians, retailers and pharmacies that are looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions.","We continuously refresh and enhance our localized product offerings through internal development, cross-registration of brands across geographies, as well as local and regional acquisitions and in-licensing. In 2017, we\u2019ll further strengthen our development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India. In addition to developing new drug formulations, dosing and other differentiated offerings, the center will act as a hub, shipping products to over 30 countries that will further develop differentiated products to suit local needs.","In diagnostics, we achieved another year of above-market sales growth in 2016, and importantly we initiated the global launch of Alinity, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. The Alinity solutions represent a major leap forward over competitive systems in terms of automation, throughput, space efficiency, and ease of use, which will help our customers address issues they face every day, including higher testing volumes, constrained staffing and space, and complex disparate processes and instruments. ","In the fourth quarter of last year, we obtained CE Mark for our point-of-care, immunoassay, clinical chemistry, and blood screening systems, and have initiated the launch of these four systems in Europe. Over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll launch the full Alinity suite across Europe and into additional geographies, including the U.S. in the 2018 time frame. This unprecedented level of innovation is an extremely ambitious undertaking and one that will strengthen our competitive position tremendously for years to come.","Lastly, I\u2019ll cover our medical devices business. As I mentioned earlier, 2016 was truly a transformational year for this business. The acquisition of St. Jude represents a major strategic move that establishes Abbott with a premier medical device business comprised of cardiovascular, neuromodulation, and diabetes care. These represent some of the largest and fastest growing areas of healthcare, and we now hold leading positions in each area. ","In 2017, our focus will be on integrating the businesses, achieving the projected synergies and financial targets and successfully delivering on new product launches. Our integration approach will bring forward the best of both companies with a focus on creating a best-in-class cross-functional organization. In terms of synergies, we anticipate annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020, including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies. We\u2019ve modeled the progression of these synergies as fairly linear over the next four years.","Lastly, 2017 will be an important year for innovation across our medical device business. In our diabetes care business, growth is being driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose monitoring system that eliminates routine finger sticks. This system offers convenience, ease of use, and affordability, and is a truly differentiated solution for the large and growing diabetic population. ","In 2017, we\u2019ll continue to focus on driving uptake in Europe where we now have over 250,000 users. We received U.S. approval for the professional use version of Libre in the third quarter of 2016 and we look forward to bringing the consumer version of Libre to the U.S. market in the second half of this year.","Other areas where the combined Abbott and St. Jude business will drive rapid growth and important new product innovations include mitral valve disease, where Abbott is the global leader in minimally invasive repair with MitraClip, and has multiple ongoing development programs in the area of mitral valve replacement. The combination with St. Jude strengthens our R&D expertise in this area and broadens our commercial presence.","Atrial fibrillation, where Abbott is now the number two player in this fast growth market with a broad portfolio of products, including the recently launched EnSite Precision Mapping System. Heart failure, where Abbott is now the clear global leader in assist devices and is developing other important heart failure products with great potential to improve outcomes and reduce cost, and neuromodulation, a fast-growing device market that addresses pain and movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. The addition of St. Jude adds multiple recently launched products that will drive continued strong growth in this business.","So in summary, we delivered on our projections in 2016 and expect double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in 2017. Our portfolio is aligned with favorable demographic trends that are driving growth in healthcare. Through a series of organic and inorganic strategic actions, we\u2019ve built leading positions across all of our businesses, and our broad-based innovation pipeline has never been stronger than it is today. With these growth drivers intact, Abbott is well positioned to deliver significant growth in 2017 and the years beyond.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2016 results and 2017 outlook in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay, thanks Miles. Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.65, in line with our previous expectations. Sales for the quarter increased 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.8% in the quarter.","Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales, all in line with previous guidance. Overall as we look back at 2016, we achieved our financial objectives for the year, including mid-single digit operational sales growth and margin improvement to once again deliver double-digit underlying adjusted earnings growth.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.50, which reflects double-digit underlying growth of Abbott\u2019s base business, accretion from the acquisition of St. Jude of $0.21, the pending sale of our medical optics business which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, and the expected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on our operating results based on current exchange rates.","In terms of our 2017 sales forecast, please note that all references to sales growth unless otherwise noted are on a comparable basis which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include St. Jude\u2019s 2016 results adjusted for the recent sale of its vascular closure business, and excludes sales of our medical optics business. On this basis, our 2016 sales baseline would be $25.4 billion, and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the mid single digits for the full year 2017. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year comparable reported sales. ","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full year, which reflects the profitability mix of Abbott and St. Jude as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our integrated business. We forecast adjusted R&D investment for the combined businesses of somewhat above 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of St. Jude.","We forecast net interest expense of around $700 million. The increase over 2016 reflects debt-related interest expense associated with the St. Jude transaction, partially offset by deployment of proceeds from the sale of St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure business and the pending sale of our medical optics business. ","We forecast a loss of approximately $15 million on the exchange gain\/loss line of the P&L for the full year 2017, and we forecast around $45 million of non-operating expense. ","Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 16.5% for the full year 2017. The 2017 adjusted tax rate is lower than our historical adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% which reflects the tax deductibility of the higher interest expense that I discussed earlier.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44. As you would expect, synergies associated with the St. Jude acquisition are expected to ramp as we progress through the year. We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low single digits and at current exchange rates we\u2019d expect a negative impact from exchange of around 1.5%, resulting in low single digit comparable reported sales growth for the first quarter 2017.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $210 million in the first quarter.","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our full year and first quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit operational sales growth for the full year 2017 with balanced above-market growth across our key emerging markets, and we forecast low to mid-single digit growth for the first quarter. In nutrition, we forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2017, and relatively flat sales growth for the first quarter with expected sequential improvement in growth rates as we progress through the year. In diagnostics, we forecast operational sales growth above mid-single digits for the full year 2017 driven by continued above-market performance in the U.S. and international markets, and we forecast low to mid-single growth for the first quarter. In diabetes care, we forecast double-digit operational sales growth for both the full year and first quarter, driven by continued strong market uptake of FreeStyle Libre. Lastly, Abbot\u2019s legacy vascular business and St. Jude have been combined into our cardiovascular and neuromodulation business. ","Yesterday, we issued an 8-K that provides comparable quarterly unaudited sales for the first nine months of 2016 which assumes that St. Jude was part of Abbott in 2016. This morning, we provided an additional 8-K to update the comparable quarterly unaudited sales to include the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for this business and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low single digits for the first quarter.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you. Can you hear me okay?","Miles White","Yes.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, perfect. Good morning, Miles. A couple things I wanted to touch on first. So one, can you talk about the St. Jude performance in the fourth quarter? The St. Jude CRM sales ended up coming in below, it looks like, the street\u2019s expectations, and the guidance for the first quarter seems to suggest that that business is still struggling from the recalls they had in the third quarter. So if you could touch on the St. Jude performance and then the outlook there.","Then second, the overall business, the expectation I think that Brian laid out was that the business would grow operationally low single digits in the first quarter, but then get to mid-single digits for the year. So if you could just walk us through that, that\u2019d be great. Thanks.","Miles White","Okay, first comment on St. Jude fourth quarter, CRM I think has continued to struggle. I mean, we can see that in the sales and the share and so forth. I expect that to be rectified imminently here, shortly. The good news is we\u2019ve seen in other markets around the world when they\u2019ve gotten their MRI claim, they have recovered and restored whatever position they have lost. That\u2019s obviously been an overhang for them for this last year and the fourth quarter was no exception. So the good news is we expect that very shortly, but your observation about it was correct.","I\u2019ll turn to Brian here for a little bit of underlying detail on your second question.","Brian Yoor","Sure, Mike. A step-up in sales throughout the year is simply what Miles message is - the stabilization of the CRM that we just talked about on the MRI claim, but also the opportunity to penetrate the accounts that we have with the combined businesses together is another contributor as we go to the market with a much broader presence of products as we call on the various accounts. Also, you\u2019ll note that they had some nice approvals that we talked about with EnSite Precision, a key driver of growth in atrial fibrillation which has been growing in the double digits. ","We expect a lot of continued strong growth here, and there\u2019s also a couple key catalysts here that we\u2019re expecting as we move through the year, one being Confirm, which is in the heart failure space with atrial fibrillation - we expect that to be a unique contributor for the patients who have atrial fibrillation, and then also the continued contribution of neuromodulation. They recently had the Verse [ph] technology, which has had a lot of success and we expect that to continue, and then that for deep brain stimulation as well. ","Finally, there\u2019s one more catalyst, and that\u2019s HeartMate 3. It\u2019s been doing really well in Europe. They\u2019re the leader there. We do expect an approval of HeartMate 3 in the U.S. as we move through 2017, and that would be a contributor on the back half.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, and then just quickly on your bridge, if you would Brian, the assumed impact from both FX and from the AMO divestiture for 2017?","Brian Yoor","Yes, the assumed--again, on a comparable reported sales basis, which Scott--and we filed an 8-K this morning, it\u2019s 2.5% of sales on a comparable basis, and then the AMO business will likely have sales in the first quarter of no more than a couple hundred million dollars. But as you recall, the full year was about $1.2 billion.","Mike Weinstein","Sorry, I meant EPS.","Brian Yoor","Oh, on the earnings per share? De minimis, Michael, on AMO. It typically is not a big earner in the first quarter just based on the pattern of spending; and again, if there is a little de minimis contribution, that also plays into the moving parts of where we\u2019re offsetting the dilution that we\u2019re seeing from the vascular closure divestiture.","Mike Weinstein","I\u2019m sorry, Brian, I was talking about the full year bridge for 2017, so the FX headwind I think in our modeling, we were at about $0.08 for FX for the full year. Is that close--","Brian Yoor","You\u2019re in the range. You might be a little bit north of that, Mike. We are probably closer to a dime.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, and the AMO divestiture, is that still about $0.11?","Brian Yoor","You\u2019re right, Mike, and remember this offset to--the AMO divestiture is $0.11, but we\u2019re deploying proceeds, so the net is $0.07. That is a complete wash with otherwise what we had a long time ago with our general purpose financing, which was also negative $0.07. ","Mike Weinstein","Understood, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to explore, I guess, some of the trends in nutrition, because you talked about improvement throughout the year as well there, too. So obviously we know about some of the challenges that you had in China last quarter, and you had some puts and takes in the results this quarter. Can you walk us through your assumptions for how China fares for the early part of the year until you lap your comps, and then what else is driving that improvement in nutrition?","Scott Leinenweber","Hi Matt, this is Scott. I\u2019ll touch on it very quickly. As you know, market conditions continued to remain relatively challenging in China for all competitors. It is a market dynamic. We do expect as we go through the year, our performance in that business to improve. Certainly as we start to lap through some of the impacts that we started to feel in the third and fourth quarter here of 2016, you\u2019ll see some natural improvement but we also expect our business to improve as well.","If you go outside of China, though, really there\u2019s been nice performance in Latin American and in Southeast Asia. We continue to perform very well in the U.S. on the pediatric side of the business, and then obviously as you know, optically our results have looked a bit suppressed because of our scale-down in Venezuela, so our results and our performance in 2016 actually are a little bit higher than the print would indicate there as well.","So we have a number of initiatives in place in China. We\u2019re well prepared and understand the situation on the ground, and we\u2019ll work our way through it at the beginning of this year and we expect our growth rates there to improve throughout the year.","Matt Taylor","Great, then just one follow-up on that earlier CRM question. Just because MRI is such a big deal, can you talk about why you have confidence that, I guess, the pacemaker approval could be imminent, and can you give us any update on the timeline for your high power expectation for the timing of that approval in the U.S.?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, so I\u2019ll touch base on the high power piece initially. So our updates on that are it will be later in the year. We\u2019re looking at about the fourth quarter there for both of those high power devices. The pacemaker piece, we think is a little bit more imminent. We\u2019ve had ongoing discussions with the FDA on that front and we feel like that one is right around the corner and should start to contribute here fairly early in the year, but the other two will be second half of \u201917 items.","Matt Taylor","Great, thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Good morning everybody. Hello Miles. It\u2019s hard to resist asking you a bigger picture question. Obviously we\u2019re witnessing what could be dramatic political policy changes in Washington. [Indiscernible] it seems like a lot could have potentially positive impacts on Abbott, but there\u2019s some worrisome things as well - hospital capital spending uncertainty post-ACA changes, trade agreements--especially with some of the trade agreement changes. It\u2019s hard, again, to resist asking you, how are you thinking about some of these issues? Are you concerned that this is all going to be a net plus or a negative? How are you adapting, et cetera, especially given your significant OUS exposure?","Miles White","You know, it\u2019s hard to speculate. I\u2019d say in general I\u2019m optimistic, and I\u2019d say for a number of reasons. Some of the things that have been talked about won\u2019t necessarily directly affect us. They may affect a number of multinationals. Obviously our new administration is pro-business, but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in that, as you know. The things I look for that might affect us, I think early on, I think we\u2019re all waiting to see if there\u2019s a tax reform package that would allow us the ability to access overseas cash and repatriate cash, et cetera. I think that would make a big difference for a lot of multinationals. I don\u2019t really expect to see any changes in the Affordable Care Act directly affect us as much as I think they\u2019ll affect other segments of the healthcare industry or business, and I think a lot of the effort will be pointed at other segments more than the spaces we\u2019re in. At least as far as that is impacted, we\u2019re primarily a diagnostic device company in the United States, so I think that to some degree, some of that impact could be favorable for us.","The other things that I watch going forward is policies that affect strong dollar-weak dollar - you know, strength of currencies and so on, because we\u2019re so geographically diverse internationally. I mean, I think one of the benefits - it\u2019s not the primary benefit - but one of the benefits of the St. Jude acquisition is it does spread and balance us into developed market currencies a little more than we have been, and in general I\u2019d like to see stability in the currency markets for us relative to the dollar, which has been a headwind for us for at least four years now. I think that will affect all multinationals.","So you know, while there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around the various things that this administration appears to be making priorities out of, I\u2019d say that there are relatively few that would impact us early on, and I think the impact is likely to be favorable, that being primarily tax and\/or cash access.","Rick Wise","Turning to a cash flow question, maybe Brian, you\u2019d want to talk about the cash flow outlook post-the St. Jude deal, and maybe any stepped up initiatives to focus even more on even better cash generation potential and help us think what that might mean for debt pay down over the next couple of years and your targets there. ","Miles White","Brian is point at me to take that question, Rick. You know, there is a stepped up emphasis on cash flow, definitely, and I\u2019d say we\u2019ve always been a pretty strong cash flow generator. We balance our use of cash, as you know, among internal capex, dividend, share repurchase, M&A activity, and so forth. Obviously for the next little while, we\u2019re not going to be putting a lot of emphasis into M&A. We\u2019re going to hold back on magnitude of share repurchase, et cetera. We\u2019re maintaining our dividend, growing it a bit, and a lot of emphasis will be put on, I\u2019d say, rapid pay down or reduction of debt. I think that\u2019s kind of a prudent place to be for the nearest term, so we\u2019re being very, very prudent about cash use, cash flow, et cetera internally. I think we can do that for a while here and put ourselves back in a range where I think a conservative financial company like us would be, and get back to kind of the normal balance. ","You know, we\u2019ve slowed the growth of the dividend. Will we restore that? We will, but we want to get to some targets, some leverage targets first, and we want to get there rapidly. So you know, not only in terms of our internal investments and so forth that we\u2019ve across the board got a very emphasis on freeing and generating cash, and I\u2019d say generally when we\u2019ve had even a little bit of emphasis on that in the past, we\u2019ve done very well, so that definitely is getting a lot of attention right now.","Rick Wise","Just one last quick one from me on Libre. Libre is off to a clearly brilliant start in Europe, and you\u2019ve said, I think, second half \u201917 filing in the U.S. How do we think about growth from here and what kind of label you\u2019re hoping for to drive U.S. adoption of the technology? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, it\u2019s already filed, but it\u2019s--you know, I have to say, to be honest, the FDA has shifted sand on us a couple times here, so consequently we\u2019re seeking both claims, replacement claim and adjunctive claim. We\u2019re going parallel path on this, and I think that the performance of the product thus far ex-U.S., Europe and other countries, has been frankly excellent and does have replacement claim and so forth. I think the potential for the U.S. is extraordinary, and I think not only is the product itself an extraordinary product, but I think its value proposition is unparalleled. So--and I think the reason we\u2019ve been able to get reimbursement in Europe and drive uptake as much as we have owes to the fact that governments there recognize the value proposition in the product as not only impact for patients but impact on the cost to the healthcare system.","So I\u2019d say at this point, I clearly can\u2019t predict what the FDA\u2019s timelines and so forth are going to be here, but we\u2019re upbeat about the potential for it.","Rick Wise","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Novarro","Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the MRI ICD. Last year, St. Jude was telling the street approval, I think somewhere around the second quarter of 2017. You\u2019re now saying kind of fourth quarter of 2017. Can you talk to us about what\u2019s creating this delay, what\u2019s the hold-up at the FDA?","Miles White","You know, I think you\u2019re referencing--I think you\u2019re confusing two different products possibly here, which is high voltage versus low voltage. In effect, we\u2019re telling you now we expect the low voltage, which is the primary bulk of use, imminently here, which you could read first quarter, not second quarter, and high voltage later in the year. Two different areas.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, I\u2019d just add to that as well. Obviously we\u2019ve been working with them on the low voltage piece. There\u2019s a bit of a gating factor and [indiscernible] generally run in parallel as well, so those discussions overlap and the process overlaps for a period as well, so there\u2019s some sequencing to that.","I will say on all of these timing items that I gave [indiscernible], all of those were contemplated along those lines in our deal model, so there\u2019s nothing different in our deal model relative to those timelines.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, all right. I guess for some reason, I thought they were assuming a 4Q16 pacemaker MRI safe approval, and a 2Q17 MRI safe ICE approval. But let me just ask you one other question. The cash proceeds that you\u2019re getting from selling the medical optics business to J&J and the cash proceeds that you\u2019ve received from the asset sales to Terumo, have you applied that to your 2017 guide; in other words, are the cash proceeds being used to pay down debt or are we waiting to get more clarity on Alere? Thanks.","Miles White","No, we\u2019re not waiting for more clarity. We\u2019ve pretty much applied it to our entire borrowing scheme, et cetera. No surprise, we\u2019ve been able--you know, as we went into this, we had planned for many different paths and outcomes, so it\u2019s contemplated in our financing.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarity, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First on EPB and diagnostics, the Q4 guidance was a little softer than the full year 2017 guidance. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that and what drives the acceleration? And just second for me, Brian, can you talk a little bit about the margin profile of the company beyond 2017? The guidance you gave for this year implied, if my math is right, about a 22% operating margin and a better gross margin than we expected. Just a little color on how to think about the margins going forward, thanks.","Brian Yoor","Sure. Larry, I assume when you\u2019re talking about established pharma, you\u2019re referring to the Q1 guidance, and it is a little bit low. In 2016 it was the last, and it was just the timing of when these shipments are received of some essential medicines into Venezuela, so that\u2019s just causing the last of our quarters of comps here. They\u2019ll step up right to the growth rates we\u2019ve been accustomed to seeing for several quarters now, which has been high single, even double digits based on the strength of this business. That\u2019s with respect to EPB.","With respect to the margin and how to think about it, there definitely is the impact of bringing in St. Jude into the mix, and that provides some natural accretion there. You\u2019re probably in a very tight range there with what you referenced in terms of a profile of 22%. I think of the expansion over \u201916 being roughly half mix, but also synergies. Keep in mind we\u2019re going to improve the profiles that historically St. Jude have had, and those will ramp significantly in Q2 and even further from there as we move through the year. ","Then finally, gross margin, as you know, and operating margin has always been a focus for us, and if you want to deliver double-digit underlying base earnings growth, you\u2019re going to be naturally in that 70 to 80 BPs of range based on mid-single digit top line growth. ","Larry Biegelsen","Brian, thanks for that. On the diagnostic business, I didn\u2019t hear you comment as to why--I mean, if I heard the guidance correctly, you expect low to mid-single digits in Q1, but greater than mid-single digits for the full year. If you could just comment on that, that\u2019d be great, and that\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes Larry, what we anticipate in diagnostics, which as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks had some really strong growth, in particular as we hit the second half to the year and Alinity really starts to gain some traction and we gain access to some contracts on that front, so there\u2019s some natural strength there in the back half of the year.","In the first half of the year, the first quarter what you\u2019re seeing, to Brian\u2019s point on EPD, there was a smidgen of Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016 in diagnostics, and you\u2019re also seeing some of that last scale-down within our genetics business which is well known and as expected in our molecular diagnostics business as well. So it\u2019s more of a comparable item there. The underlying strength of that business is strong, and it will actually pick up steam as we head out through the year.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, just a modeling question then a big picture question. For the interest expense line item, I think you\u2019re modeling about $700 million for the full year. That does include, I think, some of the debt that was taken out for Alere. What are you assuming with that for the balance of the year in terms of redeployment? Is that assuming going down to pay down debt or share repurchase, or how should we just think about that to the extent Alere does come or doesn\u2019t come in, in terms of accretion?","Brian Yoor","Yes Kristen, the way to think about the build of the 700 is we took out $15 million of debt for the St. Jude transaction, and I think that was somewhere around 3.75%. Keep in mind, too, we\u2019re also assuming some debt from St. Jude as well - that was a contributor to the addition of debt, and we just had our ongoing normal debt that had interest on it for Abbott. When you add all those things up, and then to Miles\u2019 point say that we said we\u2019ve contemplated the deployment of proceeds from the divestitures that we earlier talked about, that\u2019s how you net out to the 700.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, great, and then I guess big picture for Miles, you\u2019d mentioned obviously earlier in your remarks, this is a significant year of shaping for Abbott. Certainly I think we can all agree to that - it\u2019s been several years of shaping. As you look over the next three to five years, how do you just think about Abbott overall? Is it likely that we\u2019ll see another kind of reshaping of the mix, any thoughts on further divestitures of the businesses or potential, I guess, break-ups? I know you\u2019re obviously putting a lot in in 2017 here, but I guess how do you just think about the evolving healthcare environment and kind of macro environment now, relative to the mix of your businesses? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I\u2019ll put this in a little bit of context. When we spun off AbbVie, which has now been four years ago, there was a lot of, call it post-separation, call it clean up to do. We had to take the attendant overhead in the company down, finish the back office separations and so forth with AbbVie, and as you know, we did want to reshape some of our portfolio. We sold the developed market generic drug business to Mylan and we acquired CFR and Veropharm, so we made a number of moves that we think positioned the EPB business very strongly. We had great organic internal investment in diagnostics and strong business that really wouldn\u2019t benefit from a lot of M&A in nutrition, and the weaker part of the company that got attention from analysts, investors and others that we believe needed strengthening as a fourth leg of the company was medical devices. With the St. Jude acquisition, we think we\u2019ve pretty directly addressed that, and having placed our investment on the cardiovascular health segment, which we believe is pretty important, we determined we didn\u2019t have the same opportunity in medical optics to build and add on and grow onto that, like in this case J&J would, so we divested that.","Now at this point, having made all those significant changes, we look at the company and say, we\u2019ve got four very strong sectors that are very well positioned in their respective product markets and their respective geographic markets. Our challenge, or at least opportunity now looking forward for the next few years is integrate St. Jude and, frankly, focus on the organic pipelines of new products coming, and execute so that we can see the growth benefit of the strength of these four segments around the world, so in their various segments want to see the growth out of ADD for all these new systems, we want to see the growth out of St. Jude in our vascular business for their new products. Obviously the same with EPB, which has got a very good sustained growth track, and same with our nutrition business.","So I\u2019d say we\u2019re going to be focused pretty operationally here for the next several years. That\u2019s our intent. I think when you go through a phase where you\u2019ve made a number of transactions, people get very transaction focused, and we\u2019re still an operating company. That\u2019s what we intend to be here, is an operating company, and operate them very well and grow the targets that we\u2019ve grown. We\u2019ve always had double-digit earnings targets and we\u2019ve positioned ourselves in growth markets, both product and geographically for the purpose of sustaining that identity for investors to be double-digit earnings growers and so forth. With the new product pipelines and the strategic positioning of the company, I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned to deliver on that, so that\u2019s going to be our focus for the next few years. ","Kristen Stewart","Okay, and you\u2019ve certainly made a lot of individual purchases in the stock, so clearly I guess that expresses your view on what the future holds.","Miles White","I\u2019d say it very much expresses my view on what the future holds. You know, you always hear these comments about alignment with your shareholders. I am a shareholder, and I believe that the stock represents excellent value, and that\u2019s why I bought the shares.","Kristen Stewart","Perfect, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thanks very much for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay?","Miles White","Yes.","Bob Hopkins","Great, good morning. So first question is, I just wanted to make sure I understand the fourth quarter growth rates in a little bit more detail. Would you be willing to give us the--you know, what was the core legacy Abbott growth rate this quarter ex-Venezuela? I know it was 3.8% organically, but how much did Venezuela detract from that?","Brian Yoor","Yes, our core growth rate excluding Venezuela would have been around 5%.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, so--and most of that drag goes away in Q1?","Brian Yoor","Well as we discussed earlier, we\u2019ll have bits and pieces in EPB mainly, but then we\u2019re through it.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, and then two other quick things. I was wondering if you could give us for the fourth quarter, what was the legacy growth rate of St. Jude\u2019s revenue base, kind of ex-divestitures. I was just curious what a clean revenue growth rate was for St. Jude in the fourth quarter.","Brian Yoor","Yes, so a clean growth rate, it was in the low single digits, on the upper end of that around 2.5% or so. You know, we expect obviously as we go through the year with some of the launches, with the approvals on the MRI side, with EnSite Precision and some of these other innovations that are coming, as well as with some of the modest revenue synergies that we have baked in initially, that will ramp over time, that the St. Jude combined business with ours should accelerate growth here in 2017 over \u201916.","Bob Hopkins","And then just lastly, really quickly on 2017, two quick things. One, the EPS guidance for the first half was a little bit below where the street was. Can you help us understand the cadence of the earnings power over the course of the year, like maybe what percentage of their earnings is in the back half, just given that Q1 number was a little bit below what we were thinking? And then also, I was just wondering if you could give us your view on Abbott\u2019s opinion of the outlook for the growth rate of the ICD market as we look forward into 2017, given that that\u2019s been obviously challenged of late. Thank you.","Brian Yoor","Let me take the first one here, Bob. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that you\u2019re going to have greater than 50% on the back half of the year, and also contemplated in that is the benefit of this financing also that we talked about. The combination of that, the deployment of our proceeds to generate benefit and synergies ramp is just going to naturally put you into a stronger second half versus the first half.","The other thing in the first quarter I\u2019d just note is that when you think about the FX impact, it has a modestly heavier impact on Q1 relative to the other quarters, so we feel comfortable with this ramp, we know the pieces are in place, some of them are just simply comps. ","Bob Hopkins","And then on ICDs?","Brian Yoor","Yes, we expect that market to be relatively flat as an overall market, which would be a little bit of price down offset by some modest volume.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Maybe two quick ones for Brian and then one strategic question for Miles. Brian, I have two questions. It\u2019s been a long time since we got the first synergy number - almost a year. Any greater clarity, kind of post-close of St. Jude, how you\u2019re thinking about that synergy number, either the mix of revenue or cost synergies, the absolute size of that number, and the cadence over the next couple years?","Brian Yoor","Yes David, nothing really. We said it was going to be linear, fairly linear. We talked about the mix being heavier on the SG&A side initially and then the revenues ramping over time. I\u2019d say the difference about us versus just putting a revenue--or excuse me, a fully synergy number out there is we go out and identify these relatively fast as part of our normal acquisition due diligence, so those are well in place, they\u2019re in plans to be executed. We hope to do a little better maybe in the first year than what we said in linear, but we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the year.","David Lewis","Okay, and I know you and Miles both stressed free cash flow earlier on in the call. Is there any kind of target, either in \u201917 or \u201918, as a percent of net income we should be thinking about in terms of free cash? That\u2019s a question for Brian. And then Miles, I just think given what happened earlier this week, it\u2019s pretty interesting - the two best consumer-oriented device companies were probably yourselves and J&J, and they\u2019re buying one of your consumer-based franchises but they announced they want to get out of their other consumer-facing diabetes franchise. Can you just talk about how you see the diabetes franchise going forward and why you think that\u2019s the right consumer franchise for Abbott to stay in, versus ophthalmology where you made a different decision? So those two, and I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thank you.","Miles White","Yes, I would say we\u2019re in kind of a unique position relative to a lot of the traditional competitors in this space in diabetic glucose monitoring. In the past, the four major competitors there, and there\u2019s always--there\u2019s a lot of other smaller ones, it\u2019s been a finger prick and a little chip business, and we have a unique position here with Libre that is a completely different product that eliminates the need for that finger stick and gives a continuous glucose read that\u2019s, frankly, impactful for the patient, both Type 2 and Type 1 in a very different way. I think that puts us in a unique position to see a transformation of that market and to benefit from it, if not lead it. Others don\u2019t have that, and I think that the competition in what I\u2019ll call the traditional part of the market and the commodity nature of it, the economics of it have clearly changed negatively in the past couple of years. Ironically, J&J kind of led that, and in our case we\u2019ve got a different position with Libre that I think gives us a unique platform to benefit as one of the disruptors.","Going forward, I believe that platform has possible utility for us in other testing segments, so in our case we see a growing business that as we replace the traditional finger stick business, not only ours but others, I think there\u2019s an opportunity there that\u2019s a real growth opportunity and a very valuable one.","David Lewis","Okay, and Brian, just on free cash? Is there a decent percentage to think about, maybe this year or next year as a percent of net income that the free cash generation can be?","Brian Yoor","Yes David, let me provide some context too. I think you saw our cash flow from 2015. I think with all the things that Miles mentioned [indiscernible], you should expect to see a little bit of a step-up when you get to the K in \u201916, showing the step function of the efforts we\u2019re making here on free cash. ","You know, it\u2019s tough to completely model out what the ongoing sustainable, I\u2019ll say, free cash flow conversion is to net income in the early years with an integration, but if you look at St. Jude, they are a very powerful cash earner. We\u2019re excited about bringing that into the portfolio. If you take away the one-time things that are transitory, David, that go with an integration, be that expense or capital that bears fruit long-term, we\u2019ll probably be in that competitive range that you see others, probably somewhere in that 70% to 80% range. That\u2019s probably what we\u2019d target.","David Lewis","Great, thank you so much.","Scott Leinenweber","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Miksic","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. So just one follow-up here. I know there\u2019s been a number of questions on MRI and St. Jude, but maybe just a couple of clarifications, if I could. We hear some different expectations in the field around these low power pacer leads, and if you could just clarify whether this is a new lead system you\u2019re waiting on, which was our original understanding, or whether we should expect the pending approvals to relate to labeling on existing leads? It\u2019s a nuance that obviously could make a difference as we think about the ramp. And I have one follow-up. ","Miles White","Okay. Yes, our initial expectation will be a new lead, and I think that\u2019s a strong position for us, we like that. But we are also seeking approval on the existing lead so that we can provide that as well for existing patients, but I think going forward we like the notion of new lead and so we expect the initial approval here to be that. ","Matt Miksic","Great, and then the follow-up, Miles or Scott, if I could, on EPB. One of the things that we get often, questions we get often is just around the sustainability of this growth that you\u2019ve seen - impressive sort of high single, low double digit. It\u2019d be helpful if you could shed some light on maybe what we can--the drivers of that business, how we can think about sustainability, what potential future growth drivers could be to carry this into \u201918 or beyond would be very helpful.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes Matt, this is Scott. You know, that business has been delivering at a high level here fairly consistently for years, quite frankly, since it\u2019s been reshaped. You know, the demographics in these markets are aligned with growth for the long term. The model that we operate, quite frankly, is quite unique. There\u2019s not another multinational company or a local company, quite frankly, that operates the model that we operate with the variety of shareholders, including the trade channel, which is a very powerful channel for us.","So given the demographics and the model we operate and the strong brands that we have, we see this growth rate as highly sustainable over the long term.","Matt Miksic","And that\u2019s through sort of--is it portfolio expansion of that product? Is it also geographic expansion on that sort of core model that you\u2019re describing?","Miles White","You\u2019ve got several drivers of growth, Matt. It\u2019s first of all the call it growth or emergence of a middle class in a lot of emerging markets. Remember, this business is 100% focused in what characterize as emerging markets, and the middle class income growth and the growth of their healthcare systems alone is a major underlying growth driver. Most of these markets are not reimbursement-driven, they\u2019re consumer driven and have a model that is both a combination of call it medically driven through the physician or consumer driven through the patient and the pharmacist. So all the drivers of that growth and the distribution structure and so forth say this has got strong underlying growth.","I\u2019d say it\u2019s target rich for geographic expansion in addition, and beyond that portfolio expansion, so a lot of our organic effort internally is driven toward expansion of key therapeutic areas, expansion of product, formulation innovation on product, and distribution management. In a lot of these countries where we are the leader, we\u2019re a leader with not that big a share, so you get all the benefits of being the leader on the shelf, the leader in distribution, the leader in breadth, et cetera, with a lot of potential expansion and share gain as well. So all of the various factors that would drive growth are pretty favorable in these geographies and product areas that we\u2019ve targeted. ","Matt Miksic","That\u2019s great, thank you.","Scott Leinenweber","Thank you, Operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

","Unless otherwise noted, our 2017 commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, the current year and historical results for Abbott\u2019s medical optics and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of last year, as well as the current year sales for Alere, which was acquired on October 3, 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude\u2019s historic sales related to administrative fees paid to Group Purchasing Organization in order to conform with Abbott\u2019s presentation. ","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Thanks Scott, and good morning. Today I\u2019ll discuss our 2017 results as well as our 2018 outlook. ","For the full year 2017, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.50, representing 13.5% growth. Strong performance across many of our businesses enabled us to achieve adjusted earnings per share well above the midpoint of the initial guidance range that we shared at the beginning of last year.","This past year was a very good and important one for our company. We performed well and our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took some very important strategic steps forward, as you know. Also, a key element of our long-term success has been our ability to proactively shape our company to ensure we\u2019re in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for growth. This past year was important in that regard. It began with the acquisition of St. Jude in January followed by the sale of our medical optics business and in the fall our acquisition of Alere.","The additions of St. Jude and Alere will enhance our leadership, scale and presence in attractive areas of healthcare. We\u2019ve long been a major global player in diagnostics, and Alere adds rapid diagnostics to our existing leadership position in the $50 billion global diagnostics market. St. Jude, on the other hand, made us a leading player in medical devices, particularly in the very important cardiovascular area, where were previously had leadership in only certain focused areas. Adding St. Jude made us a major player in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market. St. Jude also brought us into a promising new area, neuromodulation to treat chronic pain and movement disorders.","While we were adding these pieces, we sold AMO, our medical optics business. Though this business was very successful for us, we didn\u2019t see a path that would move us into a broader leadership position across the larger vision care market, so we sold the business to J&J who is already in that position, which allowed us to focus on other priorities and growth opportunities. ","As we enter 2018, we\u2019re more diverse and better balanced than ever before. We\u2019ve sharpened our focus and enhanced our leadership positions and opportunities for growth. Importantly, our R&D productivity is at a new high. Over the past several months, we\u2019ve launched a number of products that will increase our competitiveness, open new markets and contribute to growth in 2018 and beyond. Great products are coming from our pipeline, which I\u2019ll highlight as I review each of businesses in just a moment. All of this translates into our expectations for another year of strong financial performance in 2018. As we announced this morning, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.90, which reflects 14% growth at the midpoint. ","I\u2019ll now provide a brief overview of our 2017 results and 2018 outlook for each business.","I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales grew low single digits in the fourth quarter, reflecting a modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. In the U.S., growth this quarter was balanced across our pediatric and adult businesses. In pediatric nutrition, growth was led by Pediasure and Pedialyte, and in adult nutrition growth was driven by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. Internationally, while much has been discussed regarding market dynamics in China, particularly the evolving regulatory environment and ongoing channel dynamics, I\u2019d note that we\u2019ve continued to see improving market conditions there. As expected, the new food safety regulations went into effect in that country at the start of this year. We were well prepared for this change and the market is in the early stages of transitioning to new products. ","As we look at the overall $30 billion global nutrition market, we see a market that remains attractive. Favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends remain intact, which provides strong foundational support for market growth going forward. Our position within the market remains highly competitive with well known and trusted brands in both pediatric and adult nutrition and a great global footprint that spans both developed and emerging markets. Our focus is to continue enhancing our competitiveness and to capitalize on future growth opportunities in this market.","Turning to established pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where we achieved another quarter of double digit sales growth led by broad-based performance across several countries, including India, China, and Latin America. As you know, over the past several years we\u2019ve shaped this business through a series of strategic moves. These actions not only shaped how we participate by adding scale and strengthening our product portfolios, but also fundamentally enhanced where we participate. Our business is unique in that we are focused exclusively on emerging markets. There is no other business like it in the world. Emerging markets are growing rapidly, their populations are aging, their middle classes are expanding, and their healthcare systems are developing. Our strategy to build significant presence and scale in these fast-growing markets is unique and has been highly successful.","Moving to diagnostics where we\u2019ve consistently achieved above-market growth with our leading platforms in core laboratory, molecular and point of care testing, the fourth quarter was no exception with sales growth of nearly 7%. This past year was important for this business on two fronts: first, the addition of Alere expands our presence in one of the few areas in diagnostics where we weren\u2019t already a leader, the highly attractive rapid diagnostics market. Over the past few months, the team has made good progress integrating this business and we continue to see several levers for growth acceleration, including opportunities for geographic, platform and test menu expansion. Secondly, we initiated the launch of the Alinity platform of instruments, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. As we previously discussed, the global launch of Alinity will be a multi-year process. We initiated the launch last year in Europe and will launch in additional geographies, including the U.S., over time. This highly differentiated platform promises to be a significant sustainable growth driver for this business over the coming years.","Lastly, I\u2019ll cover medical devices, where sales grew nearly 10% in the fourth quarter led by strong growth in electrophysiology, heart failure, structural heart, neuromodulation, and diabetes care. As I mentioned earlier, adding St. Jude was truly a game changer for us, instantly transforming us into a broad-based medical device leader with scale, presence, and a great pipeline of next-generation products. One area in particular that shined this past year was our new product productivity. ","In rhythm management, we closed the MRI safe product gap across our portfolio in the U.S. including FDA approvals of our pacemaker, ICD, and CRTD devices. These approvals enhance our competitiveness tremendously in this area. In electrophysiology, we launched EnSite Precision, our best-in-class cardiac mapping system. We also launched our next generation Confirm insertable cardiac heart monitor in Europe and the U.S. With its slimmer product profile, easy insertion procedure, and smartphone connectivity, initial customer feedback on Confirm has been very positive. In heart failure, we launched HeartMate 3 in the U.S. This lifesaving system helps pump blood through the body for advanced heart failure patients as they await further treatment, including heart transplant. We also have an ongoing development program to expand our indications here to include destination therapy for patients where transplant isn\u2019t an option. In vascular, we launched Xience Sierra, the newest generation of our leading Xience stent system in Europe. Initial market feedback has been positive and we anticipate bringing Sierra to the U.S. in the next few months. In structural heart, in addition to double digit growth, we continue to advance our pipeline in several areas, including minimally invasive new approaches for mitral and aortic valve replacement as well as tricuspid valve repair.","As you can see, the combination of Abbott and St. Jude created a best-in-class cardiovascular device portfolio with depth, breadth, and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors. We had a long-term strategy to become a leader in cardiovascular care. We laid the foundation over a number of years and the combination of Abbott and St. Jude brought it to completion. St. Jude also brought us into neuromodulation where several recently launched products led to 30% growth in the fourth quarter through both share capture and market expansion. This leading portfolio of products offers (indiscernible) relief for patients living with chronic pain and helps those suffering from movement disorders. The positive effects of these products are nothing short of amazing.","In diabetes care, sales grew 28% in the fourth quarter led by Freestyle Libre, our highly differentiated glucose monitoring system. Over the course of last year, we also achieved a number of important regulatory and reimbursement milestones for Libre. Notably in North America, we received regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Canada. On the reimbursement front, we obtained national coverage in the U.K., France and Japan, and earlier this month we announced that Freestyle Libre obtained Medicare coverage in the U.S.","In summary, 2017 was a very good year for us. We performed well, our new product pipeline was highly productive, and we took some very important strategic steps forward which yielded both immediate results and strengthened our long-term growth opportunities. We\u2019re entering 2018 with very good momentum, we\u2019re more diverse and better balanced, our leadership positions are stronger, and importantly a significant number of recent and upcoming product launches position us for strong growth in 2018 and beyond.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2017 results and 2018 outlook in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay, thank you, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to 2017 sales growth, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable basis and do not include results from our earlier acquisitions, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we utilized all of last year. ","Turning to our results, sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% on an operational basis. Exchange had a positive impact of 2% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 9.7% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.9% of sales. Overall as we look at 2017, we delivered strong adjusted EPS growth of 13.5% and significantly exceeded our cash flow objectives with full-year 2017 operating cash flow in excess of $5 billion and free cash flow in excess of $4 billion. ","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 to $2.90, which reflects 14% growth at the midpoint. In terms of our 2018 sales forecast, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. On this basis, our 2017 sales baseline would be $26.7 billion, which excludes sales from Alere, or rapid diagnostics as we call it, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, and also excludes sales from our former medical optics and vascular closure businesses, which we sold during the first quarter of 2017. So for the full year 2018, we forecast organic sales growth of 6 to 7%. In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $2 billion for the full year 2018. ","Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of a little below 2% on our full year reported sales with more than half of this favorable impact driven by strengthening of the euro. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, when the euro moves, the fall through impact on our results is modest, taking into account our European cost base and our hedging programs. ","Before I review our outlook for the P&L, I\u2019d note that we\u2019ve reclassified certain pension-related items in order to comply with recent changes in pension accounting standards. As a result, approximately $150 million of net pension-related income has been removed from operating lines of the P&L, primarily cost of goods sold and SG&A expense, and now will be reported as non-operating income. With that in mind, we forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 30.5% of sales, which reflects the pension-related reclassification I just mentioned as well as incremental investments in the businesses to support recent product launches and to further strengthen our pipeline. We forecast net interest expense of around $775 million. This forecast includes the net interest impact of $4 billion of debt that was repaid earlier this month as well as anticipated additional debt repayments throughout 2018. We forecast a gain of approximately $5 million on the exchange gain\/loss line of the P&L for the full year 2018, and around $110 million of non-operating income which includes, as mentioned earlier, pension-related net income in accordance with the recent changes in accounting guidelines. Lastly, as a result of U.S. tax reform and our forecasted mix of global income, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of 14.5 to 15% for the full year 2018.","Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2018, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.57 to $0.59. In terms of our 2018 first quarter sales forecast, please note that the first quarter 2017 organic sales baseline would be $6.15 billion which, as we commented earlier, excludes sales from our former medical optics and vascular closure businesses which we sold during the first quarter of last year. On this basis, we forecast organic sales growth of 6 to 7%. In addition, we expect rapid diagnostics to contribute sales of a little more than $5 million in the first quarter. At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a positive impact of around 3.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&D investment around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $200 million in the first quarter.","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In nutrition, we forecast low single digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In diagnostics, we forecast organic sales growth of mid-single digits in the first quarter and mid to high single digits for the full year; and in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid to high single digits for both the first quarter and for the full year.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Mike Weinstein","First off, congratulations on a very nice close to 2017. I think it\u2019d probably be helpful, because the fourth quarter of \u201916 to the fourth quarter \u201917 has some moving parts, what do you think the clean organic performance was for 4Q17?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes Mike, I would just chime in - there are a couple but they\u2019re relatively modest. As you know, St. Jude had a battery recall in the fourth quarter of last year which suppressed that baseline a bit, and we had a little bit of timing in EPD, but other than that, that\u2019s about it. Our organic growth would be around 7% this quarter - really strong.","Mike Weinstein","And the confidence in the 2018 outlook, Miles, that the 6 to 7%, which I think if you would have surveyed the street before, they would have said you guys would have said mid-single digits, so obviously this is at the upper end or more bullish than that, is it the momentum that you\u2019re seeing particularly in the device side of the business, and could you speak specifically to a couple of product launches? One of them I think everybody would like to hear about is Libre; another one is Confirm, which our check suggests is off to a very nice launch.","Miles White","Yes, I\u2019ll tell you, look - the forecast we put out, it\u2019s a strong forecast. It just is, I mean relative to peer groups, competitors, segments, the whole thing, and even relative to us. To be honest, even looking at that, yes, I feel pretty confident about it. I don\u2019t know the unknown, I don\u2019t know what exchange may or may not do - that\u2019s always unpredictable, but based on everything we know at this point, my view is yes, 6 to 7, and probably closer to the high end of that.","If I look at the underlying performance of the business and in different segments, and I\u2019ll just recap some of this, the drag on some of the growth here has been in nutrition, and even that is sequentially improving. The situations that we\u2019ve seen that have set that business back a little bit have all improved and are all improving, so I think first of all, that\u2019s a good omen.","Secondly, in all the other areas, take EPD, very sustainable growth. They had a very strong fourth quarter - I think it was 14%. I don\u2019t expect 14 for the whole year \u201918, but let\u2019s face it - they\u2019re running strong. Then I look at diagnostics and devices and they\u2019ve both got just a tremendous bunch of new product launches, and they\u2019re not flash in the pan product launches. These are going to sustain growth over a number of years because these are big and broad product launches. The Alinity product launch, I think is going to make a big, significant difference in diagnostics. I think we\u2019re going to see increasingly better performance out of Alere. But look, Alinity is across six segments of diagnostics, so I think that\u2019s a pretty sustained momentum. They\u2019ve been doing a terrific job, frankly, in the 6 to 8% growth range with a lot of, I\u2019d say, aging systems and older systems, and now they\u2019ve got an entirely brand-new product line out there in all categories, so I think that bodes well.","Then, I finally look at the whole cardiovascular device area. You\u2019ll recall, Mike, many people challenged whether St. Jude was really growth, and there was a lot of grumbling a year ago about that acquisition. Sequentially over the course of this year, St. Jude\u2019s going from first quarter 2.4% to 4% in the second quarter, 4.2% in the third quarter, and 10% in the fourth quarter. I won\u2019t tell you that I think 10% is sustainable for the year, but they had a 10% fourth quarter and they didn\u2019t have to stretch to do it, and the product launches and approvals, mainly the product approvals particularly in the U.S. that I forecasted to you in both July and October, all happened, and there was some skepticism about that because of the situation in Somar but, frankly, our team has done a terrific job in Somar and a terrific job communication with our U.S. regulators, and we got all those product approvals and those launches are all out of the blocks and going well.","So you know, knock on wood - I looked into 2018 and it all feels remarkably strong and sustainable, and I think that\u2019s terrific. Tax reform was a nice boost, and there\u2019s a lot of things here that are all looking up. Then I finally come to Libre, which--you know, I enjoy the fact that every time something is announced with Libre, it\u2019s a surprise to somebody because everybody seems to have such low expectations for it, and I think we\u2019re going to continue to surprise people in that category. We\u2019re investing several hundred million dollars in expansion. This is a big product. I think you estimated at one point $50 million to $100 million in the U.S. this year - I think that\u2019s a good range of estimate. But you know, frankly, it\u2019s going strong. We\u2019re adding probably 50,000 customers a month right now and that\u2019s increasing, and that was primarily Europe. That doesn\u2019t even reflect much U.S. yet. So as we came out of the fourth quarter, the growth rate of that product is just tremendous and we\u2019ve got a series of enhancements and approvals and additions to it coming that only make it better.","As I said, it\u2019s not an niche product - it\u2019s a mass market product, because there are tens of millions of Type 1 diabetics, and frankly the same in Type 2s trying not to be Type 1 diabetics, and I\u2019m one of them, so I wear the product, I live the product, I know the product, and I think this product has a long track road ahead of it. So as I look at all the growth drivers of the company and then some of the elements of St. Jude, like neuromodulation and structural heart and other things, I think there is just an awful lot of growth here.","So I go into \u201918, I look at the numbers that we forecasted, and yes, I feel pretty confident about it, so at this point I\u2019m looking at the success we\u2019re having with cash flow and the balance sheet, investment in expansion, investment in capacities, investments in R&D and SG&A, which I put more money into, and everything looks pretty good. ","Mike Weinstein","Miles, if I could ask--","Miles White","I realize it was a long answer, but you kind of asked a big question.","Mike Weinstein","No, no, that was perfect, thank you. Just so you guys know, the sound quality isn\u2019t great on our end, so just FYI. Miles, I did want to ask you about capital allocation and the benefit of tax reform. Tax reform is going to lower your overall tax rate in 2018 by 150 to 200 basis points. You\u2019re also getting access to previously trapped cash in your global cash flows going forward. Can you just talk about what you plan to do with the trapped cash and then how the access to global cash flows changes at all your capital allocation plans? And then I\u2019ll drop, thanks.","Miles White","Yes well, it\u2019s not trapped anymore. It\u2019s terrific to have access to it, I have to say. I\u2019m pleased with where tax reform came out. As a multi-national and a company that had a lot of debt in the last two years because of the acquisitions, I had concerns about some of the structures they were looking at, but it all turned out pretty good. I think it will stimulate a lot of growth and investment in the U.S. in particular, and you can see that in a lot of the things that companies are communicating, and the same is going to be true for us.","As far as capital allocation, Brian mentioned in his remarks we were up to a gross $28 billion of debt because of our acquisitions of St. Jude and Alere, and a little bit of lingering debt we had just over time, and we just paid off $4 billion of that so we\u2019re down to $24 billion. Over the next six months, we\u2019ll pay off probably $3.5 billion to $4 billion more, and we\u2019ll be down to $20 billion by the end of \u201918. The cash flows in the company are strong. Brian\u2019s run a program with our EVPs to be very conscious of cash generation, and that\u2019s been extremely successful, and our cash flows and profits and so forth right now are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been. So as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re going to make a priority out of getting that cash or getting that debt down to a more balanced level. We will--we\u2019ve already exceeded the targets that the rating agencies had for us, and we\u2019ll be below--on debt to EBITDA, we\u2019ll be below 3 at year-end, and on a net debt basis we\u2019ll be below 2. So we\u2019ll be in a very strong metrics position at year-end, and that puts us in, let\u2019s say, a position to be at a more normal capital allocation viewpoint at that point.","We raised our dividend in December by 6%. I\u2019d anticipate we\u2019ll raise it again at the end of the year probably more than that, because we like to maintain a payout ratio of a little better than 40% of EPS. So I think our capital allocation, our cash flow is strong, we\u2019re pushing down the debt fast, faster than we anticipated by at least 18 months, so all of that right now is frankly looking quite good, largely due to the tax reform and the management of cash flow here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Taylor","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. The first question I wanted to ask was specifically on diagnostics. I guess I was just a little intrigued by the fact that the guidance you gave for the year implies some improvement, and you also talked about that in your comments. I wanted to explore two things. One is can you talk about how the Alinity roll-out could cadence through the year, and then secondly, now that you have had Alere or rapid diagnostics under your belt for a little while, can you talk about the state of that asset and how you expect that to grow over the coming years?","Miles White","Yes, thanks Matt. Let me start with Alinity. First of all, it\u2019s six different systems, two in particular that are in the core laboratory, one that will address transfusion, one that will address point of care testing, one that will address hematology, and one that will address molecular diagnostics, so there\u2019s multiple dimensions to this. You\u2019ve got approvals around the world. They\u2019re all approved in Europe at this point. A couple are approved in the U.S. We expect more approvals the following year. We tend to be pretty much on those approvals. The menu expansions in our development have gone extremely well in the last, say, 10 to 12 months, so they\u2019ve got very full menus, and therefore the pace of introduction can go much faster because accounts don\u2019t really want to address change until they\u2019ve got full menus, or close to it, so that momentum picks up.","Then you\u2019ve got to deal with the life cycle of contracts that are out there in the world. Now, today we\u2019ve got, I want to say, 25, 26, 27,000 instruments out there in these main categories, main core lab categories, and my goal is to replace that entire base and of course take a fair amount of share over the next five to 10 years. So there\u2019s a ramp there, there\u2019s a scale there. It\u2019s a significant scale, and our attention now is all about scale-up and all about pace and magnitude. This is not going to be some incremental, slow-rolling thing. It starts that way initially - it starts as a slow roll, and then it\u2019s going to pick up tremendous momentum because it\u2019s our intent to replace that entire base and frankly take a lot of share with it. So I think we\u2019re in a really great position with Alinity. Our challenge now is just mass scaling as we attack that market. ","On Alere, I\u2019d say our team has done a terrific job. We have an entirely new, from Abbott, management team there. I\u2019d say their progress in terms of integration, reorganization, etc. has gone extremely well. Literally within a couple of weeks, we reorganized the entire company into business units, fully integrated business units with management teams and so forth. I\u2019d say that our assumption of the business has gone at warp speed and gone well. We\u2019re ahead of schedule on literally everything, on target on our synergies. We\u2019re ahead of our targets on sales and profit. Flu and strep seasons in the U.S. have aided that to some degree, but thus far I\u2019d say everything is sort of on point as we\u2019ve projected. ","Beyond that, I don\u2019t have a lot more detail to give you, other than so far, so good, and I think our transition management has been excellent. It\u2019s been that way with St. Jude too. What we did at St. Jude, we\u2019ve done faster at Alere, and St. Jude was pretty fast. We went through sort of the same things with St. Jude - we reorganized a lot of businesses there into fully integrated business units, we did it in the first six months. That\u2019s usually very disruptive, but we managed to do it without disruption, and we did it with Alere in a matter of weeks, so I\u2019d say we\u2019re in a strong position. I\u2019m very pleased with the management team and how rapidly it\u2019s up to speed. We\u2019ve got a couple of new hires on some of the business, but I\u2019d say this team has gotten up to speed quick.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks. One follow-up - this is probably the most pleased I\u2019ve heard you sound in while on how things are going and the results kind of speak for themselves, but I know you\u2019re never satisfied. What areas would you point us to where things aren\u2019t going well, that you want to improve, and how do you think about dropping all this good growth on the top line through to the bottom line versus investing in all the things that you have to invest in now?","Miles White","Well, I\u2019d say two things. We\u2019ve still got improvement to make in nutrition, and we know that and our nutrition team knows that. We\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about that - I\u2019ve personally talked to our (indiscernible) around the world and so forth, and there\u2019s no point in having your (indiscernible), we simply want to do better. I\u2019d say even where our growth rates are right now, sequential improvement is a plus. Now, there are a number of places we\u2019re pretty positive and pretty happy with performance. I\u2019d say the U.S. stands out as executing really well. There\u2019s a number of countries around the world executing well, and the ones that had difficulty are improving, so that remains a point of attention to us.","I\u2019d say in terms of the happy column, a lot of our success right now and what we\u2019re focused on is organic growth. We\u2019ve never had such productivity out of R&D at Abbott, and frankly so has St. Jude, and I now consider them Abbott. What St. Jude had said about their pipeline to the street over a number of years is true - they had and do have a terrific pipeline of products. We\u2019ve gotten the approvals, we\u2019ve closed the gaps where they had deficiencies, and there\u2019s a lot of growth there, so what I\u2019m particularly happy about is that the organic growth opportunity here across all of our businesses - nutrition, EPD, pharma business, the new product launches in diagnostics and devices, including St. Jude and Alere, it\u2019s just--its broad and it\u2019s deep, and it\u2019s exciting to have that much innovation and new product to be launching.","So our challenges aren\u2019t so much fixing problems or deficiencies; our challenges are how fast we can scale and how fast we can run. I\u2019m pretty confident that it\u2019s sustainable and it\u2019s sustainable for a long time because it is organic growth of new products, so I\u2019m pretty happy about that. I\u2019m not out looking for M&A and I don\u2019t have any significant M&A on the radar screen - in fact, I don\u2019t have any M&A on the radar screen because I want to hit those debt targets by year-end. Our targets are more aggressive than the ratings agencies. I want to get back to where our capital allocation flexibility is as flexible as it\u2019s ever been, and I want to get their fast and I\u2019m going to get there fast. ","So you know, I think our challenges are how to keep the pedal down on that growth, because all of these businesses have opportunities at the same time and some of it is some fairly significant scale-up, and Libre is a tremendous opportunity. It\u2019s a mass market product and it\u2019s unlike any other medical devices. Medical devices by nature are sort of niche therapies - this one is not, and this one has a totally different rhythm to it, and the pace of scale and the magnitude of opportunity is more like tech than it is med-tech. That\u2019s an interesting challenge for us, it\u2019s a positive challenge, it\u2019s a good challenge, and fortunately we\u2019ve got such strong cash flow, we can afford the capital investment that we want to spend while we\u2019re paying down our debt and paying our dividend and so forth. So I mean, as challenges go, that\u2019s a pretty nice set of challenges. You don\u2019t lose sleep on those.","Matthew Taylor","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Miles, there\u2019s a lot of conversation this morning on growth, but it was fairly robust EPS guidance for Abbott to start the year. I think for us, what\u2019s interesting is unlike a lot of your peers who are dropping through all the tax down to the bottom line, you\u2019re reinvesting, which makes sense given your premium growth. But I wonder if you can sort of give us a sense of where that reinvestment is going, and given your flexibility, how you\u2019re feeling about this sort of mid-teens EPS growth over the next couple of years.","Miles White","Well nice try - I don\u2019t give guidance that far ahead. Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I have seen that a number of companies have dropped through quite a lot of tax benefit to the bottom line, and frankly I expect to see that. I mean, there are some industries and some businesses that really benefited from tax reform. If the primary source of your sales and profits is the U.S., obviously you got a really demonstrative benefit. If you\u2019re a multi-national or you had a lot of debt or something, it\u2019s not as demonstrative; but now having said that, we\u2019ve dropped through some of that tax benefit into our EPS, and I think that\u2019s reflected in our guidance this morning.","I did direct a significant amount of the benefit from tax into R&D and SG&A, and I think that\u2019s warranted given not only the new product launches and how fast we want to run with some of these, but--so I\u2019ve directed some of the benefit to increased R&D investment, and you can imagine--I mean, I\u2019ve directed some of that at diabetes care and Libre, I\u2019ve directed some of that at neuromodulation and other cardiovascular products, I\u2019ve directed a fair bit of it at SG&A expansion and so forth. When you\u2019ve got these kinds of opportunities, you\u2019ve got to invest in them and put fuel behind them, and fortunately tax reform has given us that ability. ","We will spend some of that money investing in manufacturing in the United States as it\u2019s predicted that that would happen. We will - I won\u2019t tell you where or what products and so forth, because I don\u2019t want to forecast that to competitors and so forth, but in fact the U.S. will benefit, as will some locations overseas where we\u2019ve got already existing capability, facilities, expertise, etc. But we are directing a fair amount of this to help ensure we\u2019ve got not only a sustainable product pipeline and rapid innovation and enhancements to products, but that we\u2019re also doing our best in marketing areas and so forth to maximize the opportunity that\u2019s in front of us as rapidly as we can.","We don\u2019t want to think about it so incrementally, because I think sometimes when you\u2019ve got these new products and opportunities, you\u2019ve got to go hard and fast, and I think when you do that, you establish a better share position, a better market position, a better use position with customers, regulators, etc., and that\u2019s much more sustainable over time. So as you ask me, I think if we get our job done particularly in the areas where we just--you know, that I\u2019ve just highlighted, which is a lot, I think our growth rates are pretty sustainable.","We start every year with a double digit earnings growth target, and as we\u2019ve indicated this year on an apples-to-apples comparable growth basis, we expect 6 to 7%, and I\u2019m in the upper half of that range in my beliefs. But I\u2019d like to see that growth rate increase, even substantially going forward. We\u2019re always trying o be double digit earnings. I\u2019m not concerned about having a double digit earnings growth rate on a sustainable basis for the next few years. I want to drive the top line so that I can sustain that at an even higher rate, and that\u2019s where my focus is.","David Lewis","Okay, that\u2019s very clear. Thanks for the color, Miles. I think St. Jude has gotten a lot of attention on the call but Alere less so. What\u2019s your focus for 2018 for Alere? Can this asset definitively get back to underlying growth in \u201918, and how quickly can Alere get back to what you would think is market growth for point of care? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I\u2019d say slower than St. Jude. St. Jude, as you all remember it, it went through about a four or five-year period where it didn\u2019t have much growth and the street was unhappy with that, and it even missed its earnings targets a couple of times. What they were right about was they had a robust R&D pipeline and a product pipeline, and they were right about that and I think the people that led and managed St. Jude should feel vindicated about that. We do, because there was a fair amount of concern and criticism when we acquired St. Jude, but frankly as you can see in the numbers, there\u2019s growth here and there\u2019s going to be growth here, and it\u2019s not just small incremental growth . It\u2019s significant, and I\u2019m really happy with the performance of St. Jude.","I think Alere is a little longer story. The company had a lot of internal operating challenges. It hadn\u2019t been invested in, so I think pipelines are going to take a little longer to develop. I think restoring the cohesiveness of performance of functions in the business, in some of the business, it\u2019s going to take a little longer. So I expect Alere to emerge, I\u2019m going to say over two to three years, because we want to put more investment into new products, refreshing products, R&D, SG&A, etc. We do have some rationalization to do - that doesn\u2019t mean restructuring, that means the integration of those functions and businesses, and figuring out what are old products, what are new products and so forth. ","I think Alere will be a little slower emergence than St. Jude has been. St. Jude sort of exploded on the scene here over one year, and I don\u2019t think Alere will explode on the scene but I don\u2019t think Alere is going to be flat either. I think we believe there\u2019s a lot of growth here in this entire rapid diagnostic and point of care space. I think there\u2019s a lot of growth, and I think that growth is sustainable over many years, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be--I\u2019m not going to be telling you the same story about Alere at the end of the year. At the end of \u201918, I\u2019m going to tell you we had a good year, it tracked better than we thought, it\u2019s showing growth. I\u2019m going to tell you all those things at year-end, I\u2019m pretty sure, and we love the underlying assets and products and so forth. I mean, that\u2019s all going to be true, but I think operationally it\u2019s going to take a little longer to get this back on an investment cycle in products and launches and so forth that we\u2019ll want to see. ","The good news is we\u2019ve got so many other opportunities at the same time that I think it\u2019s nicely staged. You don\u2019t want everything to show up at the same time, so I think it\u2019s nicely staged to help sustain the growth in diagnostics while they're dealing with the scale-up of Alinity.","David Lewis","Great, thanks Miles. Congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, and thank you for the question. Very nice quarter. Can we turn a little bit to EPD? That area of growth tends to be a little bit of a black box for investors. How do we think about the sustainability of that growth rate? This is the second quarter in a row of mid-teens growth.","Miles White","You know, Joanne, I think the fundamentals underlying the markets drive an awful lot of the growth. You know, the managers in that business and I sort of have this ongoing debate - I\u2019m always chronically dissatisfied and they\u2019re always telling me, hey look, we\u2019re really growing fast here. But the fact is the underlying dynamics of the market drive a lot of the growth because we\u2019ve selected markets and countries, emerging markets in particular that have growth characteristics which I characterized in my remarks. So the underlying fundamentals of those markets are all very positive in terms of growing healthcare systems, growing middle class, spending on healthcare, etc., but succeeding in those markets requires a certain amount of presence and strength and scale, meaning you want to be in the top five competitors in most of these markets. China is a little different, but you want to be in sort of the top five competitors. You want to have very broad product lines and you want to have some depth in various therapeutic categories, and you want to have a strong brand. I think our teams around the world have done a super job at that, and I think there\u2019s countries where we believe we can do even better, a lot better. ","So I\u2019d say, first of all, the underlying dynamics are strong. We\u2019ve put a fair amount of emphasis in renewing and broadening our products. We\u2019ve put a lot of attention into our own, let\u2019s call it development productivity, registration productivity, etc. We\u2019re putting more and more investment into India and our distributor organizations to do just that, because we believe we can and should. We\u2019re putting a lot of attention on gross margin management to improve our gross margins, whether in procurement or things that we source from third parties that we should do ourselves, and so forth. So there\u2019s a lot of emphasis on margin improvement, and frankly the margin is already good, better than good, but we know that there\u2019s opportunity to improve it still further. A lot of people think of generics as commodity, generics that don\u2019t make much money. These are branded generics where the brand matters. It\u2019s sort of an OTX type thing in a lot of these markets, and we make pretty good profits here, so the characteristics of these markets have been that.","That said, the last couple quarters had some anomalies that bumped these numbers up and down. We went through a couple of disruptions in India, for example, which is a big part of our business, where we went through the demonetization issue and then the GST tax thing. We actually managed that really well, I think, but that affected inventory management by wholesalers and distributors, which are a big part of our business system here. So sometimes I think we\u2019re going to see some of these quarters look very up, and other times they\u2019re going to be a little less up, but they\u2019re always up.","You know, I think--I don\u2019t think the 14% we saw in the fourth quarter is something we expect every quarter. If it starts to happen three or four quarters in a row, I\u2019m going to be back with my managers, saying I think you were a little conservative, but I think it\u2019s a double digit grower. I think it\u2019s easily sort of 9 to 11% on a very sustainable basis on the sales line, so a lot of that is fundamentally in the markets and then we\u2019re pressing to kind of broaden our product lines and gain share because of the way we manage the business.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. As my follow up, neuromodulation sales were up 30% in the quarter after being up 50% for the beginning portion of the year. How do we think about that growth going forward, and there was a lot of good buzz coming out of NANS. Could you please update us on that?","Miles White","Yes, I\u2019m going to have Scott help me with that, but--because I asked the same thing. I said, jeez, why are we down to 30%? It\u2019s because of the comparison to this fourth quarter last year. Scott can give you a little color on that, but the growth rate here remains strong and the opportunity remains strong. This is one of the bright--well, we\u2019ve got a lot of bright spots, but this is one, clearly.","Scott?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes Joanne, as you recall, we launched first in deep brain stimulation products in the fourth quarter of last year, to Miles\u2019 point. Obviously the business is coming off a great year - we\u2019re number one now in the chronic pain segment. We do expect to capture more share next year. The market is growing in the low teens and we expect to grow faster than that.","Joanne Wuensch","Perfect, thank you very much.","Miles White","You\u2019re welcome, thank you, Joanne.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the strong finish to 2017. I wanted to start back on St. Jude. You guys laid out some synergy targets around the acquisition. I just wanted to get an update on whether or not you think that there is upside to those historic targets, particularly on the revenue synergy side. We\u2019ve been assuming revenue synergies hitting in year two, but are you already seeing revenue synergies come? ","Also just on the margin contribution, with the rebound in top line growth for the St. Jude franchise, is it safe to assume that the margin contribution outlook for that unit in 2018 is going to step up nicely?","Brian Yoor","This is Brian. I think those are the right assumptions. We\u2019re right on with our synergies as we\u2019ve tracked. We\u2019ve always said $500 million by 2020. We had a great year, we executed very well. We integrated and achieved our synergies, expect that to continue, and that\u2019s incorporated into our guidance. As Miles discussed earlier, we\u2019re very excited about the acceleration of top line growth here, and there\u2019s a lot of opportunities and I think the continued growth and sequential growth momentum \u201918 over \u201917 should be accretive to the operating margins, not only for that business unit but for Abbott as well.","Josh Jennings","Thanks. Just a follow-up one on nutrition. The food safety law took effect in China on January 1. I know it\u2019s very early, but can you help us think through what you\u2019re seeing initially and what you expect to see over the next couple of quarters in the pediatric China market, and also an update on nutritional pricing in the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles White","I\u2019ll answer part of that and then I\u2019ll phone a friend here at the table. I\u2019d say first of all, I personally was concerned that this switchover in the food safety law, what we had to all do to comply with product labeling in a number of products and so forth, I was afraid it was going to be terribly disruptive, and it turns out we\u2019ve already experienced the disruption in the past two years as the market was flooded with many products and a lot of volume and a lot of channels and so forth. The single biggest issue we all had to deal with was reregister products and comply with the elements of the law, and all of our concerns were would we get our products through the regulatory bodies in China and be ready for that transition, and the answer is we made it. So you know, I think that, I\u2019m happy with.","We\u2019ve been careful to monitor our inventories of previous product versus new product, etc., so to the extent that we can have visibility to that, I think we\u2019re comfortable with how that transition has gone. I think we\u2019re not seeing the kind of disruption that we might have or that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple years, so thus far I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t see unpredicted disruption, so hopefully we can now stabilize back into a more normal, call it competition in the market. It\u2019s a very, very dynamic market anyway in terms of channels and numbers of competitors and the intensity of competition and so forth. We didn\u2019t need the disruption of the food safety law, but I think that\u2019s stable and kind of behind us at this point.","Brian or Scott?","Brian Yoor","Sure. On the U.S. side, you asked about the price, and I would just say we\u2019ve never historically really relied on price. It\u2019s about volume, and we had a great year in our pediatric business in the U.S., and that\u2019s all about share capture in the infant milk formula market part of the pediatric business, with innovations that we introduced, and we want to continue staying to be a share leader there. But also, bright spots there in that pediatric portfolio are Pedialyte and Pediasure, which also have done quite well in the U.S. and are great brands for us. ","Then I think the story in the adult is we knew we had some adjustments to make. We\u2019re making the right adjustments. We know we have some innovations coming and we\u2019re seeing sequential improvement even here in the fourth quarter \u201917, and we want to continue to sustain that momentum and compete on share and market expansion on the adult, because we just typically hadn\u2019t relied on price in the U.S., or anywhere for that matter. ","Scott Leinenweber","We\u2019ve gained some share back in adult - that\u2019s nice to see. I think the team\u2019s done a terrific job in the ped market, and we remain the clear leader in that market. At this point, as Brian said, we\u2019re not relying on price. I think there\u2019s a clear value proposition to be marketed out there, and we haven\u2019t tried to stretch that, nor will we. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I\u2019ll just ask two quick product-related questions and drop. CRM, I think you grew about 2% in the fourth quarter. Is that how we should think about 2018, or do you think that could better? Then there was a question asked earlier on Confirm Rx, maybe just setting expectations, could you do, say, $50 million in 2018 on that product? Is that realistic? Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter.","Scott Leinenweber","Thanks Larry. Yes, I think on CRM, you\u2019re about right - we would expect something in the low single digits on that front. To your point, Confirm, really great opportunity. Obviously we\u2019re still early in the launch of that, first quarter. The feedback, though, we\u2019re getting from physicians on that one is very positive. This is the only device out there that\u2019s smartphone compatible, so there\u2019s a big benefit on the patient side of it as well. Your forecast on that one, I think seems reasonable as well.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions, guys. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Glenn Novarro","Hey, two quick questions me as well, and both are for Brian. Brian, the weaker U.S. dollar has become a tailwind to the top line. Does any of that fall to the bottom line, or is that completely hedged away - question one. Then number two, the lower tax rate for this year, is this a sustainable new run rate for the next couple years? Thanks.","Brian Yoor","Sure. Let me take the exchange question. As always, it\u2019s early in the year, so we\u2019re reluctant to necessarily flow what\u2019s through there. It\u2019s a little modest. We know we have the hedge there, so we have a modest impact from the sales I quoted. You know, I think Miles has said this before - let\u2019s see how things go. If rates hold and things pan and history is an indicator, it\u2019s similar to last year, we may see some of those flow through; but I think it\u2019s just too early. There\u2019s a lot of events that we watch throughout the year.","Go ahead, Miles.","Miles White","Yes, let me just add one comment to that. As you plan a year, we all can calculate what we believe our tax reform impact is going to be given our geographic mix and so forth, as you know, and then there\u2019s exchange. If you\u2019re a multi-national, you\u2019ve got a lot of currencies to deal with. It\u2019s not so predictable. The exchange happens to us a lot of times, so we try to prepare for that with hedges. That said, going into the year, what we chose to do was say, listen, we\u2019re going to put some of the tax benefit from tax reform into the EPS, and we\u2019re going to put some of it into investment, as I described earlier, because that we can forecast, we can predict, it\u2019s knowable. ","Exchange isn\u2019t so knowable, so if exchange continues to benefit us, there\u2019s really not enough time in a given quarter or year to reliably invest back the benefit of exchange, so the likelihood is if exchange runs better than we forecasted at this point, the investor is likely to see some of that. Obviously we hedge some of it to protect the stability of earnings, but you can\u2019t hedge it all, so if we are favorable, yes, you\u2019ll probably see it.","Glenn Novarro","And on the tax rate?","Brian Yoor","Sure. As I mentioned earlier, the range we got was 14.5 to 15% for \u201918. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to tax reform. I\u2019d just note that regulations are still being formed, interpretations are ongoing, but from where we sit today, we believe we should generally be in the same ballpark of this range and we\u2019ll provide further updates as we learn more too, as the tax laws unfold here. ","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Thanks Miles, thanks Brian.","Scott Leinenweber","Thanks Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Bob Hopkins","Thanks very much for fitting me in. Just two quick questions. One is on emerging markets. Just wanted to see what emerging market growth was in the quarter and if that accelerated in fourth quarter versus earlier in the year, and then what your outlook is for 2018 from an emerging market perspective, because it seems like things have been really going well in emerging markets generally. That\u2019s just the first question.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair characterization. Generally when it\u2019s quiet, things are going good in emerging markets, and it\u2019s been fairly quiet. We did deliver double digit growth in emerging markets this quarter. To Miles\u2019 point, there\u2019s a lot of strong fundamentals in those markets that would point towards growth going forward.","Bob Hopkins","Then the other one I wanted to ask about was just back on Freestyle Libre, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you\u2019re bringing on 50,000 new customers, I believe you said a month.","Miles White","A quarter.","Bob Hopkins","A quarter? Okay, that makes--","Miles White","Yes, I\u2019m sorry if I misspoke. It\u2019s per quarter.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, that makes more sense, but still a big number. I assume right now the majority of that obviously is outside the United States. Can you give us a sense as to the pace of your sign-ups in the U.S. and what you think for 2018 from a patient perspective for Libre in the U.S.?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, I would just say, look, we launched pretty much right at the end of the year. Obviously there was very modest sales in the fourth quarter number there. Without giving a number, I would say the strips are basically tracking right with our expectations. I think Miles had mentioned a quarter or so back when asked what a reasonable estimate for year one sales would be, and it was agreed upon it\u2019d probably be in the $50 million to $100 million range, and that\u2019s still where we sit today.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, thank you very much.","Scott Leinenweber","Very good. Well, thank you, Operator, and thank you for all your questions. That concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs.","John B.

Also on today's call will be Miles White, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations. Miles will provide his opening remarks, and Tom will review the details of our fourth quarter results, as well as our outlook for 2012. I'll then discuss the highlights of our major businesses. Following our comments, Miles, Tom, Larry and I will take your questions. ","Some statements made today may be forward-looking, including the planned separation of a research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

","As you can see from our earnings news release, Abbott reported another year of strong performance in 2011 despite what's been another challenging year for the healthcare industry and for the global economy. We managed through these challenges as we've always done and delivered full year ongoing EPS growth of nearly 12%. And as we announced this morning, we expect to deliver another year of strong performance as we issued guidance of $4.95 per share to $5.05 per share for 2012. I'll talk more about the year ahead in a moment. ","In 2011, Abbott sales grew more than 10%, driven by double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, International and Nutritionals, Molecular and Point of Care Diagnostics, International Vascular and Global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals. HUMIRA had another outstanding year, and with nearly $8 billion in sales, solidifying its global position as the anti-TNF market leader. In addition to full year double-digit sales growth as forecasted, we improved the profitability of many of our operating businesses, and in the fourth quarter, we delivered an adjusted gross margin ratio of nearly 64%. We also generated more than $9 billion of operating cash flow, which was another record year. And we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our payout ratio is strong at more than 40%. We've increased our dividend for 39 consecutive years, making Abbott one of only a handful of U.S. companies to deliver with such consistency. ","Our return of cash to shareholders through dividends, together with Abbott's stock price appreciation, generated a total shareholder return of nearly 22% in 2011 compared to 2% for the S&P 500 over the same period of time. This level of performance led all large-cap medical device companies and was also near the top of large-cap pharmaceutical companies. Abbott's performance in 2011 is our best annual return in 5 years and our second-best performance in 10 years. Abbott's 5-year total return of nearly 35% was more than double the S&P Healthcare Index. Over the same time period, the S&P 500 Index declined 1%. ","To continue to generate value for our shareholders and align Abbott's long-term strategic goals with shareholders' best interest, we announced in October our intention to separate Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies, one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals. Creating 2 independent companies provides 2 unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders as the investment identities and operating models of each business have evolved independently over the last several years. Both enterprises will be well-positioned large-cap investment opportunities in their respective peer groups. They'll also have broad product portfolios and global presence, strong balance sheets, significant and durable cash flows and are expected to have strong investment-grade credit ratings. As we've said, each will generate a dividend that when combined will equally Abbott dividend at the time of separation. And as you can see from our earnings news release this morning, both businesses performed well again in 2011. ","After we announced the separation in October, we immediately brought our transition organization together. This is the same organization that executed the separation of our hospital products business and successfully integrated our key acquisitions, including Knoll, Guidant and Solvay. Right now, we're working through the many details of separating the 2 organizations. This has been simplified in large part by completing the separation of our Established Pharmaceuticals business at the beginning of last year. But as you can imagine, there's still a significant amount of work to do. The transition team has developed and is implementing detailed plans to prepare for the separation. ","Moving onto our 2011 results. I'll start with the diversified medical products businesses, which is comprised of 4 similarly-sized segments: Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Medical Devices. In our Established Pharmaceuticals division, which is our branded generics business, we delivered sales of $5.4 billion in 2011, an increase of nearly 20%. We spent the better part of the last decade building EPD into the global organization it is today. Most recently, we completed the integration of Piramal Healthcare Solutions in 2011 which, together with our existing business, made Abbott the largest pharmaceutical company in India, one of several rapidly growing emerging markets. The success of EPD is built on literally hundreds of different products sold around the globe. ","Our global Nutrition business delivered more than 8% growth for the full year 2011. In the U.S., we regained all the share we had lost due to the late 2010 infant formula recall and reestablished our position as the infant formula market leader with Similac. We also continued to drive double-digit growth of our toddler brand, Pediasure. International sales increased 14% for the full year as we continue to drive growth in fast-growing emerging markets. At $2.5 billion, our emerging market Nutritional sales comprised more than 40% of our total Nutritional business and increased 17% for the full year. ","As I discussed in our investor meeting in October, one of our key priorities in our Nutrition business is to expand its operating margin. Similar to the success that we've seen in Diagnostics and Diabetes Care, we're implementing an improvement plan to drive our nutrition margin from the low teens in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015. We began to see progress from our efforts in the fourth quarter. While quite detailed, this plan has 4 main drivers of improvement: manufacturing locations and processes; materials and packaging costs; distribution; and product and geographic mix. ","Let me give you a few examples. We're building plants in key emerging markets, including China, to be closer to the customer, as well as reduce manufacturing and shipping costs. We'll be online with new facilities in 2013. We're moving from a distributor model to a direct model in certain countries, which we expect to generate significant savings. And we're improving both our product and geographic mix, and in some cases, exiting product lines or markets to focus on more profitable opportunities. These are just a few examples of many initiatives that are underway in the nutrition business. We expect to see good progress in 2012 with much more significant improvement in operating margin in 2013 and beyond. ","Moving on to Diagnostics, which had another impressive year in terms of both sales and margin. Sales increased 9% with continued double-digit growth in both Molecular and Point of Care. We delivered strong growth in emerging markets such as China, where in Core Laboratory Diagnostics, for example, we continue to place new ARCHITECT systems. In 2011, across Diagnostics, we launched a number of new devices and tests, including our wireless i-STAT point of care device, a Vitamin D assay on ARCHITECT and a new molecular diagnostic that's used with a new lung cancer treatment. We expect approximately 20 new product launches in 2012. ","Diagnostics continued its successful multiyear operating margin improvement plan. 2011 was a record year for margin dollar contribution, up more than 35%, resulting in an operating margin of more than 18%. In 2012, we'll continue to expand the margin profile of our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business while we drive more significant contribution from our Molecular and Point of Care businesses. By 2015, Diagnostics should deliver more than $1 billion in margin annually, reflecting an operating margin that we expect will be more than 20%. ","And finally, our Medical Devices segment, which includes Vascular, Diabetes Care and Vision Care. In Diabetes Care, in 2011, we launched our new InsuLinx glucose monitor in Europe. This technology is the foundation for our new product pipeline as we improve the testing experience for insulin-dependent patients. Both the gross and operating margins in our diabetes business continue to improve. ","In Vision Care, we launched 5 new products in 2011, including the European launch of our new TECNIS Toric intraocular lens for cataract patients. Our Vision Care pipeline is balanced across our LASIK, cataract and eye care solutions business lines with numerous products launching over the next 5 years. And in Vascular, we launched several important new products in 2011 that solidified our position as the #1 vascular device company globally. In the U.S., we launched our XIENCE nano small-vessel drug-eluting stent, and in November, launched XIENCE PRIME, our next-generation DES that's also approved for long lesions. Both of these products have allowed Abbott to expand into market segments where we weren't previously competing to capture additional share. ","In Europe, we received CE Mark for our bioresorbable vascular scaffold or BVS, ABSORB, and we expect a full commercial launch by the end of this year. We delivered high single-digit growth in our endovascular segment, which includes our carotid stents vessel closure devices and peripheral balloons and stents. Our endovascular business is approaching $500 million in annual sales, and we expect double-digit growth in 2012. ","In 2011, we also saw continued gains from our new TREK balloon franchise, delivering 20% growth for coronary balloons for the full year. We also continue to perform well in emerging markets. This geographic segment comprises nearly 20% of total vascular sales and increased 25% for the full year. In addition to our endovascular business, we expect numerous new product launches to drive growth over the next several years. This includes ABSORB, as I mentioned; our U.S. launch of MitraClip for mitral regurgitation; our recently announced new drug-eluting stent system XIENCE XPEDITION, which we anticipate launching in Europe in the second half of this year; as well as numerous coronary and endovascular products in our pipeline. ","In our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business, we delivered another year of industry-leading performance. HUMIRA, our biologic for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, continued to exceed our expectations, delivering strong growth again in 2011. With its broad range of indications, strong global market position and well-established safety and efficacy profile, it will continue to be a strong and sustainable growth product going forward. Beyond HUMIRA, we delivered strong growth with many of our durable specialty-focused products. This included double-digit growth for the full year 2011 in the U.S. for Lupron, Synthroid, CREON and AndroGel. In our pharmaceutical pipeline, we advanced 2 products into Phase III development and now have more than 20 compounds or new indications in Phase II or Phase III. I'd like to focus on just a couple in particular. ","As we discussed in October, we've made significant progress on our pipeline over the past several years, augmenting it with promising late-stage assets and successfully advancing internal programs. One of these internal programs is HCV, where our data to date have shown that we're in the running to have a leadership position in this category by effectively curing HCV with a short course of therapy without interferon. We'll present additional HCV data this spring, and more importantly, initial results from our Phase IIb program in the fall. Another late-stage compound I'd highlight is bardoxolone, which is in Phase III for chronic kidney disease. Bardoxolone has the potential to prevent and possibly reverse the progression of CKD. To date, no treatment has been shown to reverse disease progression. Bardoxolone could change the treatment landscape as well as have a significant economic benefit to the healthcare system. We're developing this compound with our partner Reata, and recently expanded that agreement to jointly develop and commercialize their entire portfolio of next-generation anti-inflammatory treatments across a number of diseases, including RA, MS and COPD. ","So in summary, as we look back on 2011, it was really another outstanding year for Abbott. We delivered ongoing EPS growth of nearly 12% and generated a total shareholder return of nearly 22%. As we look forward to 2012, we expect to deliver another year of strong earnings growth while investing appropriately to ensure successful futures for our 2 leading healthcare companies post separation. Each has its own unique and compelling investment identity, and both are well-positioned in their respective markets. ","We expect Abbott to be one of the fastest-growing large-cap diversified medical products companies with a durable mix of products and a strong emerging markets presence. The new research-based pharmaceutical company will be a leader in its industry with a strong and sustainable portfolio of biologics and specialty medicines and a promising pipeline. We believe both of these companies will be attractive opportunities for investors. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom and John for a more detailed overview of the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2012. Tom?","Thomas C. Freyman","Thanks, Miles. We're very pleased with how we ended 2011 as we had a strong fourth quarter, delivering double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth. And we had strong overall performance in 2011, with ongoing EPS above the original guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. ","For the fourth quarter, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.45, an increase of 11.5% over the prior year. For the full year 2011, ongoing EPS was up 11.8%. Sales growth in the quarter was 4.1%, including a favorable 0.2% impact from exchange rates. With the significant movement in a number of currencies during the quarter, impact from exchange was almost 1% less favorable than we had forecasted on the third quarter call. ","We continue to see the benefit of our strategies to expand in the emerging markets with total emerging market sales across the company of $2.5 billion, representing nearly 25% of total sales, with particularly strong growth in Nutritionals, Vascular and Diagnostics in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 63.8%, up 320 basis points from the prior year. While changes in exchange rates contributed roughly half of the improvement over 2010, we did see significantly better operating performance across most of our businesses, including Vascular, Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals, Diabetes Care and Diagnostics. ","Overall, as we look at 2011, we delivered strong ongoing EPS growth despite a number of factors that impacted our industry. We continued to expand our presence across emerging markets, advanced our late-stage pipeline and made great strides to improve the overall efficiency of the company while continuing to invest in the business to drive future growth. And we generated record operating cash flow of more than $9 billion in 2011. Most importantly, we announced our plan to separate into 2 leading healthcare companies, each with a unique investment identity. ","Looking ahead to 2012, as Miles mentioned, the separation is on track for completion by the end of the year. So the guidance we provided today reflects a full year outlook for the company in total. Today, we issued a full year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $4.95 to $5.05, reflecting another year of strong performance. Regarding sales growth for 2012, with the recent movements in various exchange rates, we'd expect there to be a sales headwind this year. Current rates would result in a negative impact of exchange on sales of approximately 2.5% in 2012. ","Our operational sales growth in 2012 is expected to be in the mid single digits. However, if current rates were to hold, the negative impact from exchange would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits this year. Our sales forecast reflects an expectation for somewhat slower growth in our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business, offset by stronger growth in the remainder of the Medical Device and Nutritional businesses. Our outlook for Proprietary Pharmaceutical reflects ongoing trends in our U.S. lipids franchise, including a continued decline in Niaspan and an expectation for generic competition for TriCor in the second half of the year. ","Also for 2012, we're forecasting continued improvement in our adjusted full year gross margin ratio, which is expected to approach 62% for the full year. This reflects efficiency initiatives, favorable mix and current exchange rates, partially offset by the decline in U.S. lipid sales. We're forecasting continuing strong investments to drive long-term growth in 2012 and after the separation, for both companies, with R&D of 9.5% to 10% of sales and SG&A of somewhat under 28% of sales. Overall, we expect to expand our operating margin ratio by around 100 basis points in 2012. We're forecasting net interest expense of around $450 million in 2012. We saw great progress in improving liquidity through the buildup of cash and by paying down short-term debt in 2011. But since both short-term investments and long-term debt are at such low interest rates, there's little expected change to net interest expense in 2012 from the amount seen in 2011. ","Regarding the tax rate in 2012, we expect a rate of 14.5% to 15%. We're forecasting quarterly ongoing EPS growth in each of the quarters that's consistent with the growth implied by our full year EPS guidance range. Our operational sales growth in the first quarter is expected to be in the mid single digits. However, at current exchange rates, we would see a roughly 2% negative impact from exchange in the first quarter, which will result in reported sales growth in the low single digits. We're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 61% in the first quarter, up over the first quarter of 2011. And finally in 2012, we're planning to resume share repurchases. ","So in summary, we exceeded our key financial goals in 2011, including strong EPS growth and cash flow generation while continuing to take strategic action to shape Abbott for the long term. Our outlook for 2012 again reflects strong performance as we execute the steps necessary to separate Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies by the end of this year. With that, let's turn to the business operating highlights. John?","John B. Thomas","Thanks, Tom. This morning, I'll review the fourth quarter performance for 2011 and the 2012 outlook for our major business categories. I'll also provide a brief overview of our pipeline and the major milestones we expect this year. I'll describe our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results on a reported basis, that is, including the impact of foreign exchange. For our 2012 division outlook, when I get there and given recent FX trends, I'll provide both operational and reported expectations. ","So let me start with our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, where our worldwide reported sales in the fourth quarter increased nearly 7%. For the full year 2011, worldwide reported sales in pharmaceuticals increased 11%. Global demand for HUMIRA continues to outpace the market with reported sales up nearly 16% in the fourth quarter. Performance was driven by strong U.S. sales growth, consistent with underlying trends in the quarter. We continue to see steady market growth globally, including strong performance for HUMIRA in the gastroenterology and dermatology segments. International HUMIRA growth in the quarter was impacted by our previous change to calendar year reporting for our international operations. Therefore, adjusting for results on a calendar year basis, HUMIRA international sales would have increased approximately 15% in the fourth quarter on a reported basis. Full year 2011 recorded sales for HUMIRA increased 21% globally, ahead of our original outlook at this time last year, which was low teens growth. As we look ahead to 2012, we expect low double-digit reported sales growth for HUMIRA worldwide, which includes the negative expected impact of foreign exchange. ","Global reported sales of CREON in the quarter were approximately $175 million, up approximately 13%. Full year 2011 global reported sales were approximately $630 million, and that was up 45%. CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market. And over the past year, we've captured the vast majority of new prescription starts in this category. U.S. sales of Lupron in the quarter were up 7%. Full year global Lupron sales were $810 million, and that was ahead of our expectations. Our recently approved 6-month formulation of Lupron Depot continues to perform well, driving share gains and further expanding our category leadership. And U.S. sales of Synthroid were approximately $135 million in the quarter. Full year sales were approximately $520 million, and that was up more than 15%. For 2012, we expect U.S. Synthroid sales of more than $500 million. ","Moving on to AndroGel, where U.S. sales in the fourth quarter were approximately $260 million, up nearly 20%. Full year 2011 sales were approximately $875 million, an increase of nearly 35%. AndroGel holds the #1 share position in the testosterone replacement market, where growth is being driven by increasing diagnostics and treatment of low testosterone. Our new low-volume formulation is the fastest growing therapy in the market and has quickly gained market share. So for 2012, we expect continued double-digit growth for AndroGel. ","Moving on to our more mature lipid franchise, where sales of Niospan were $258 million in the quarter, down 10%, with prescription growth slowing following the discontinuation of the AIM-HIGH trial in May as we previously discussed. Global TRILIPIX\/TriCor reported sales in the quarter were down approximately 4%, reflecting ongoing impact from the ACCORD study and continued softness in the overall cholesterol market. ","In terms of our 2012 outlook for our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, we contemplated the current dynamics of the total cholesterol market, prescription trends for our range of lipid products, including TriCor, TRILIPIX and Niaspan and the entry of generic TriCor in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect low single-digit reported sales growth for the global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, including roughly flat performance in the U.S. and low single-digit reported growth in the international business. On an operational or performance basis, excluding the impact on the foreign exchange, we expect international Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales growth of mid to high single digits. ","Moving onto our Established Pharmaceuticals division, or EPD, which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio. Fourth quarter reported global sales were nearly $1.4 billion. Excluding the impact of timing related to a significant tender for vaccine sales that occurred in the third quarter of 2011 rather than the fourth quarter, sales in our Established Pharmaceuticals business increased approximately 3% in the fourth quarter. In 2011, we received approximately 250 product approvals across numerous countries. And over the next several years, we expect more than 1,000 product launches in EPD, including registrations across multiple geographies to help drive continued durable performance in this business. So for 2012, we expect mid single-digit operational sales growth in our Established Pharmaceuticals division, including continued double-digit growth in key emerging markets with strong bottom line growth. However, since this business consists entirely of international sales, we expect reported sales growth to be roughly flat, including a mid single-digit negative sales impact from foreign exchange. ","Turning to our worldwide Nutritionals business, where global reported sales increased approximately 8.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by mi -single-digit sales growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally. Full year 2011 global sales were more than $6 billion in this division, an increase of more than 8%. Over the course of the past year, we've advanced several strategic objectives in our Nutritionals business. In the United States, Abbott Nutrition continues to maintain its strong market position in both infant formula, as well as adult nutritionals. In addition to regaining significant U.S. infant formula market share in 2011, as Miles mentioned, we drove double-digit growth in Pediasure, our toddler brand, and Ensure, our top-selling adult nutritional product. Internationally in our Nutritional business, we successfully completed approximately 50 new product launches in key countries around the world. And also as Miles mention, we continued to deliver strong double-digit growth for our Nutrition business in emerging markets, as well as drive meaningful operating margin expansion. As we look ahead to the full year 2012 in our global Nutritionals business, we're forecasting high single-digit reported sales growth including mid single-digit growth in our U.S. business and low double-digit reported growth for our international business, which includes an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1%. ","In our global Diabetes Care business, worldwide reported sales increased 4% in the quarter. U.S. sales were up more than 7% as we continue to grow our retail prescription share through expanded consumer outreach and patient education. In 2011, we launched our new FreeStyle InsuLinx blood glucose monitor in Canada, as well as several European countries and expect to launch it in additional markets this year. In addition, in 2011, we significantly improved the profitability of our diabetes business, increasing operating margin by more than 300 basis points as a result of favorable product mix and operating cost reductions. And we expect continued margin improvement throughout 2012. So as we look ahead to 2012 in our global diabetes business, we expect flat to low single-digit reported revenue growth, including an estimated impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2.5%. ","In our Core Laboratory Diagnostics business, which includes immunoassay, blood screening and hematology, global reported sales in the quarter increased nearly 6% with U.S. sales up 10%, driven by continued strong growth of our ARCHITECT and PRISM systems. Full year sales were nearly $3.4 billion, and we continue to deliver strong margin improvement. In our Point of Care business, reported global sales in the fourth quarter increased nearly 8%. Full year global sales were up more than 10% in 2011, driven by strong growth of our bedside cardiac tests and continued expansion in emerging markets such as China. And in Molecular Diagnostics, reported global sales increased more than 10% in the fourth quarter, driven by double-digit sales growth in both the U.S. and international markets. Full year global sales were up nearly 15% in 2011, including more than 20% reported international sales growth. We've seen strong uptake of our ALK companion diagnostic to a new non-small cell lung cancer medicine. And we continue to place new systems and expand the menu of tests offered on the PLEX-ID System. So as we look ahead for the full year 2012, we expect our worldwide Diagnostics business, and that includes our Core Laboratory, Point of Care and Molecular businesses to generate mid single-digit reported sales growth, including an estimated negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately 2.5%. ","Moving onto our Vision Care business, where worldwide reported sales in the fourth quarter increased approximately 2% and more than 4% for the full year 2011. Internationally, we've seen good uptake of our new TECNIS Toric IOL in Europe and strong double-digit growth in emerging markets such as China and India. For 2012, we expect low to mid single-digit reported sales growth in our Vision Care business, including an estimated negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2%. ","And finally, in our Vascular business, worldwide sales in the fourth quarter were $826 million. Sales were roughly flat on a reported basis. However, excluding noncommercial revenues, sales increased mid single digits for the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the third-party distributor of PROMUS is now transitioning away from this product as we approach the end of our distribution agreement with them this year. International Vascular sales, which now comprise more than half of our total Vascular business, increased 7% in the quarter. In emerging markets, which comprised nearly 20% of this business, increased more than 14% in the quarter. ","In our coronary stent business, the U.S. launches last year of XIENCE nano in May, followed by XIENCE PRIME in November, contributed to DES franchise revenues of approximately $480 million in the fourth quarter. XIENCE sales increased nearly 10% globally, offset by a double-digit decline in PROMUS revenues as expected. With the recent U.S. launches of nano and PRIME and continued strong performance in Japan, China and other key international markets, XIENCE has solidified its position as the #1 drug-eluting stent family globally. XIENCE PRIME is the only everolimus drug-eluting stent available in long lengths in the U.S., which is helping us to continue to gain share at a higher price point. Our endovascular, other coronary and structural heart businesses comprised 40% of Vascular sales, and they increased mid single digits in the fourth quarter, led by continued strong growth of MitraClip, which posted sales in the fourth quarter of more than $25 million. Also, it was driven by growth in coronary balloons, with the launch of TREK, as well as growth in endovascular, driven by our new Armada line of peripheral balloons, and our renal stent, Herculink Elite. So as we look ahead to 2012 for Abbott Vascular, we expect roughly flat global reported sales growth, including our assumptions for PROMUS and nearly 2% of negative foreign exchange, offset by continued strong performance from our underlying business. The PROMUS transition will be nearly completed by the end of 2012, positioning 2013 for a stronger reported growth rate. ","And now turning to our pipeline. Since Miles spent time this morning discussing a number of compounds and technologies in our portfolio, let me spend a few moments outlining some of the milestones we expect that will occur this year in 2012. We've taken significant strategic actions to strengthen and advance our pipeline, and we expect a good deal of activity throughout this year, including new regulatory filings and product approvals, clinical trial advancement and data presentations. ","Starting with Diagnostics. We expect regulatory filings and approvals for a number of new assays for our ARCHITECT platform. We also expect the worldwide launch of a Web-based informatics platform called OneLab, designed to connect all of the labs\u2019 information into one easy-to-use system. OneLab was released in Europe and Australia this month and is expected to launch in the U.S. and Canada later this year. ","In Molecular Diagnostics, we expect CE Mark for a number of infectious disease tests for our m2000 system. In addition, we'll launch our ALK companion diagnostic in more than 50 additional countries, following U.S. approval last year. In our Nutrition business, we expect nearly 70 innovations globally in our adult and pediatric business lines in 2012. In our Vascular business, the productivity of our pipeline is resulting in multiple new coronary and endovascular product launches across every major geography this year. Some of these include: our continued rollout of XIENCE PRIME, including geographic expansion into Japan and China in the first half of 2012; the launch of XIENCE XPEDITION in Europe, which offers a new catheter for enhanced deliverability, as well as a broader-size matrix; 2 stents for iliac indications in the U.S., Absolute Pro and Omnilink Elite; and a full commercial launch by the end of this year in Europe and a number of other countries around the world of ABSORB, our bioresorbable vascular scaffold. We're finalizing the ABSORB U.S. trial design and expect to begin enrollment in the first half of this year, with our Japan registration trial beginning in the second half of this year. We also continue our ongoing dialogue with the FDA on the U.S. review of MitraClip. In AMO, we expect European launches for a number of products, and we plan to submit our U.S. PMA for the TECNIS Toric intraocular lens. ","And then finally, in Propriety Pharmaceuticals, 2012 promises to be a pretty significant year for our HCV program, with results from our initial interferon-free trials presented at a spring conference and preliminary data from several Phase IIb studies in the fall. We have a high level of confidence that our HCV compounds in development can dramatically change the treatment landscape. We plan to present additional data analysis from our Phase IIb study of bardoxolone this year as well for the treatment of chronic kidney disease. The Phase III program is enrolling very well, and we continue to expect results from that trial later next year. Also in development for CKD is atrasentan. We expect to complete our ongoing Phase IIb study in diabetic patients this year and plan to initiate the Phase III program next year in 2013. We expect to present Phase II data from ABT-126, our NNR in development for Alzheimer's and other conditions this year as well, likely at a medical meeting this summer. ","We're working with regulatory authorities to finalize the Phase III study on elagolix for endometriosis and expect to initiate the global trial in the coming months. We plan to present Phase III pivotal data for Duodopa, an intestinal gel for advanced Parkinson's disease at an upcoming medical meeting. We expect to submit our U.S. regulatory application for Duodopa later this year as well. And finally, certainly the most important milestone for 2012 will be the separation into 2 companies. As Miles mentioned, we expect significant activity leading up to the separation as we disclose additional detail and meet with existing and potential new investors throughout the coming year. ","So in summary, in 2011, Abbott demonstrated strength through its sales and earnings growth and reported financial results generating total shareholder return, as Miles mentioned, of approximately 22%. We delivered gross margin expansion and significant profitability improvements in many of our major business segments, as well as another record year of cash flow and dividends. As we move into 2012, we look forward to delivering another year of strong growth as we prepare to separate into 2 leading healthcare companies with unique investment identities. With that now, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, we will take questions from the analysts.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question today is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Let me start with gross margin; outstanding. I guess, I'd ask Tom. What took so long to get here? It's such a major leap forward. Can you talk about a couple of points? Are the efficiency initiatives completed? What more is there to be done? How sustainable is this? And maybe just help us understand a little better why maybe the sequential dip in first quarter and why it ramps through 2012?","Thomas C. Freyman","Sure. Well, we've been talking a long time about a number -- really the focus of the entire company and every single business on improving gross margin. And as we've also talked about over the last couple years, it's -- our progress, our underlying progress has really been masked by some of the pricing pressures in pharma through healthcare reforms and austerity in Europe, as well as an occasional generic issue. And what's really been going on in the business has really been quite good. And I think this quarter, as we moved into the fourth, you're really starting to see the benefits of that play through. And we do expect this to continue into next year. For 2011, we finished with an ongoing gross margin a little under 61%. And as I indicated in my remarks, we should be approaching 62% next year, and that's despite the effect of TriCor and the slowdown of Niaspan. So as we talk about the operating margins in the business and when you see those operating margins in the 10-K when we file it in a few weeks, you're going to see that most of the businesses are making very nice progress, and we expect it to continue longer-term. So we do expect this improvement of at least one point next year overall despite the headwinds. And we expect continuing improvement beyond 2012 because every division is focused on it, every plan. And including, for example, the program Miles went through in nutrition has pretty detailed plans on how to get there, and we're very focused on executing it.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Second question, let me turn to the stent business if I could. It's sort of half-related to the margin question. As promised, volume declines. Can you talk a little bit about how you keep margins whole? Is it all through the uptick of the new products and XIENCE PRIME? And maybe any just broader perspective about your view of the market outlook for 2012 and growth and pricing pressures and how you\u2019re -- what you've dialed into your numbers.","Thomas C. Freyman","Well, overall, I mean, obviously, we are offsetting the PROMUS effect with product mix improvements and really business mix improvements. And so just like the other headwinds, when you net it all out, we are showing an overall improvement. In terms of the overall environment, clearly, in particular, the pharma business went through the austerity period in Europe and the U.S. healthcare reform. But we've seen a bit of a more stable outlook for 2012. Certainly, we\u2019ve factored in some degree of adjustments in our forecast. But I think 2010 and 2011 were a bit of a step function, and we expect that aspect of pricing, et cetera, to be a little more normal in 2012.","John B. Thomas","Yes. So Rick, we would expect -- as you know, price declines have moderated, so from year-over-year high single-digit declines, which we saw last year, it's more in the mid single-digit range, which is encouraging. And in addition to what Tom said, we would obviously expect to pick up a lot of that business with XIENCE PRIME, which we continue to sell and market in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And now that we have nano and PRIME, we have the full complement of ranges and sizes and lengths that's not always available with some of the other competitors. And that's one of the reasons why we've done so well internationally. We keep talking about the fact that this business has grown to more than 50% internationally, where double-digit growth is the norm in a lot of these key emerging markets for us, as well as some other more developed Western Europe countries as well, where we continue to take share with PRIME. So I think those things plus the MitraClip, x U.S. run rate, is now at roughly $100 million on an annual basis, and that's helping as well.","Thomas C. Freyman","Rick, I'd say one last thing. Clearly, as PROMUS pulls out of the market and really if we're going to have 2 independent products as opposed to the same product, that is going to bring a better dynamic to the DES market for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Miles, let me ask you, I guess, the tough question first. Going back a year ago on the fourth quarter of '10 call, someone had asked you about 2012, which was setting up to be a difficult year, and whether you thought sustaining 10% EPS growth was still achievable. And you had commented at that time that, that was still your goal. And then someone asked you at the October analyst meeting on the spin announcement whether the double-digit EPS goal was still an appropriate target. And your answer at that point in time was, yes, you thought that was still an appropriate goal. But then today's guidance is 6% to 8% EPS growth for 2012. So can you comment on that? And has anything in your view changed that makes 6% to 8% the appropriate target for this year versus the 10-plus percent before?","Miles D. White","Yes, I think that's a pretty simple answer. I think everybody is aware the single biggest thing that's changed is exchange. There's been a pretty big shift in currency in the last 3 to 4 months here. And that's the single biggest part of any change in our expectations going forward really.","John B. Thomas","The other thing I'd note too, Mike, as you know, is our guidance of $4.95 to $5.05 brackets what the first call consensus is right now, which is $5.02.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. So Tom, maybe you just want to add to that. So Tom, you think that the FX impact right now and the bottom line for 2012 would be a negative 2 to 4 points?","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, I mean, we factored these rates in, and clearly, that had an impact on the progression of our forecast as we worked through the fourth quarter and worked on our plan. And these rates have definitely affected us, and that's in our numbers for 2012.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Any additional sensitivity you can give us on that, Tom, just so we can think about it going forward? Obviously, if the dollar weakens or strengthens from here, we can think about the potential impact on the company's bottom line. I think historically people have viewed Abbott as being relatively insulated, absent some of the currencies where you can't hedge, like Latin America.","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, as we -- the closer we get to a year, the more -- the less exposed we are to currency. And that has to do with the way exchange rates get into inventories and some of our other natural positions. So the further out you are, the harder it is to forecast. The closer you get into a year, it gets a little less -- a little more predictable. And I feel like we're in pretty good shape here. And certainly, it's manageable. Even if rates do go up or down, I think we can manage 2012 within this guidance range.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, 2 other maybe quick follow-ups. One, could you just talk about HUMIRA in the quarter and then focus really on the U.S., which was obviously very, very strong? Just would like to get your sense of the -- if there's anything in there that aided the quarter because it's obviously well above recent trends. And then second, the FX impact on gross margin is a bit tough. Obviously, it helped a little bit this quarter. In that 2012 guidance for gross margin improvement, how much is FX a factor on that line?","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes. On HUMIRA, nothing unusual in the U.S. The script rates are strong. And when you look at the overall dynamics on the product growth, it's very much in line with expectations there. For 2012, I'd say a modest part of the margin improvement is exchange. And there's a lot of -- the majority of it is operating performance, the cost-reduction programs that we've talked about, efficiencies, product mix and the like.","John B. Thomas","Yes. Mike, the only thing I'd add to there on the HUMIRA is what we said in the past and what we talked about in October at the meeting and Rick talked about is the differentiation of HUMIRA in terms of breadth of indications, depth of clinical data, our differentiating efficacy and safety profile, our strong managed care position. Derm share has been picking up nicely, as is gastro share. Those have all combined to make this what we think is a durable growth vehicle going forward. I think some of the expectations and uncertainty around some of the other products in the market have dissipated as more data has come out on things like orals and so forth. And so we've seen competition in the past. Every year since we've had this product, there have been multiple products that have been in the market. HUMIRA continues to shine in terms of its overall profile. And so we don't expect anything to change that overall trajectory of strong double-digit growth here, particularly for this year.","Miles D. White","Mike, this is Miles again. I can't help but chuckle here because I recall in October, you advocating to me that we should take a more cautious view of earnings growth in 2012. And I'm wondering if you had some prescient view of exchange. And if you had, I wish you'd said so.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, if that's the case, I wouldn't be on this call. I'd be doing something else. Actually, the conservatism is -- for me is, as you know, is top and bottom line, just setting a bar that's reasonable and achievable.","John B. Thomas","Yes. And I'd also say, too, Mike. You know this. I mean, the other countries are also discussing the impact of foreign exchange. And I think when all the companies report at the end of the day, like is usually the case, in a week or 2, our growth on a relative basis will be strong and in the upper half of the group.","Miles D. White","I think I could add to that. I'm pretty happy with what I see in the operating performance of the company right now on so many dimensions. I'm happy with the commercial performance of a lot of our businesses. There's still places we can make improvements, no question. But I think, in general, I'm very pleased with what I call the operating execution. And I'm pleased to see, even earlier than I might have expected, some of the impact on gross margin because I do expect even greater improvement because I think there's a couple of target-rich opportunities for us in the businesses to improve our margins so that's a good thing. While we've got a lot of these product launches or registrations underway, with both EPD, and frankly, even our Nutrition business internationally, we had 52 new products launched in the Nutrition business last year, which is very important to filling out the product lines and the strategies and the countries. And so we've got a lot of really good things going on. Now we know that we'll experience the beginning of our lipid franchise going generic this year. HUMIRA's growth and momentum will, I think, nicely offset that to a large degree. There's actually a lot of good fundamental things going on here that I think position us well actually in both companies. So exchange is little harder to predict. If it goes better than we think, we'll be happy. And if it doesn't, we'll do everything we can to adjust to it. But I think with all the moving parts of the businesses right now, I think this is the prudent place to be. That's the one thing we can't control very well.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Miles, I wanted to come back to Hep C, where you made some interesting comments. I think one of the interesting things when you started talking more about your Hep C program earlier this year was the diversity of that program. And I guess, as you look out at the next 3 to 5 years in terms of the multitude of players that are getting more active in this market, are you comfortable with your organic program or internal program on Hep C as you see the market developing over the next 3 to 5 years?","Miles D. White","Yes, I think so. I mean, I think that there's been an awful lot of attention paid to everybody in the category. And I think we surprised some people when we exposed our program in more detail in October. I mean, we've obviously seen a -- so we said changing competitive response out there. I think we've got a really promising program here. And we like what we're holding. Well, I think as you've seen from the -- well, it's fair to say, some of the reaction out there, it's a highly valued segment. And I observe that, and I think, man, if that's how people think of it, the value of our pipeline must be astronomical. I mean, we have all the types of assets we need. I'm very pleased with what we've got and the potential for it as it particularly impacts patients and the disease. So yes, I'm very hopeful and very optimistic about the program and very excited about it for the pharma business.","John B. Thomas","Yes. And as a reminder, Dave, we talked about this in October. But we did show some of that first 12-week course of therapy. It's a smaller subset of patients, but it did demonstrate that 90% cure rate, and most importantly, without interferon. And we think that's critical obviously to these new therapies and where we're going and the promise of our program. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're going to present some of the initial Phase IIb full data set later this fall and also in the spring.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very helpful, John. And maybe one more strategic here for Miles and maybe one for Tom. Miles, I know it's early, but you did mention a restatement of your prior remarks, which is that you are committed to a total dividend for both assets that's equivalent to the prior dividend. I guess, is it still too early to suggest that -- is it a reasonable assumption to assume that of the 2 assets, we see, generally speaking, a higher relative dividend on the pharma asset, and generally speaking, perhaps more debt on the pharmaceutical asset relative to the diversified asset?","Miles D. White","Yes. It's too early for me to comment on any of that. I think when we're ready later in the year to put out the split of the economics of the companies and all those sorts of things, we'll address it then. But yes, it's too premature. The main thing is, look, our investors have come to rely on and expect a certain cash return. And we're well aware that the profiles of the 2 businesses, which frankly owes to the different investment identity of the 2 businesses, would suggest they would not be necessarily identical on a lot of dimensions. So I understand the nature of the question. I think we'll deal with it when the time comes. But look, they are 2 different investment identities. We understand the question, and we'll have an answer for you later in the year. But in the meantime, our investors, in addition to the growth profile we provide, do expect a certain cash return that's a combination of dividend and\/or share repurchase from time to time. And what we do know is that because investors will initially hold both shares, it's important for us to make sure there's no diminution of that cash return to investors. How we split it remains to be seen.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, very helpful, Miles. And just real quickly, Tom. You\u2019ve talked a lot about Nutritionals and opportunity for margin expansion, which seems very clear. And Miles also reiterated it. But from a top line growth perspective, are you comfortable with where the current growth profile of the Nutritional business and the current market share for Nutritionals sort of post the recall? Are we sort of back to where you want to be? Or is there still significant room for upside in either growth reacceleration or share?","Miles D. White","David, you've got 2 different markets. There's the U.S. market, and then there's the international market. And of course, there's 2 different markets internationally, 1 Europe, 1 the rest of the world. The U.S. market for Nutritionals is not particularly a growth market as a market. But our team has done really well there. We have regained all the share that was impacted by the recall. And they've done a nice job in the U.S. of gaining share relative to competition over the last several years. But the U.S. market for infant nutrition is a declining market, slightly declining. At least for the last couple of years, it has been. And we've gained share against that headwind and grown. So do I expect to see the same kind of performance out of our business? I will say that is certainly what we press for. It's a well-performing business. I like the plans; I like the team; I like the product portfolio. I think it's a well-executing team. So I expect to continue to see good performance out of the U.S. The growth profile overseas, I think, should improve. And I think it's already a strong growth profile, but there's a tailwind of market growth there, too, particularly in emerging markets. And I think in addition to margin expansion, there's a growth expansion expectation that I expect to see here over time as we fill out the product offerings and the product lines in the given geography. So I think this business has an awful lot of opportunity for us going forward here.","Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just on the gross margin guidance, I guess, given the pending split, perhaps you could tell us a little bit about more where the margin expansion is coming from, whether it's the pharma side or the diversified side first.","Thomas C. Freyman","I'd say the pharma side is relatively stable. You have HUMIRA continuing to grow, which is a solid product, and we do have the kind of the slowdown in the lipids, so fairly neutral on pharma and better progress in the diversified businesses.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And secondly, this \u2013 I\u2019ll apologize in advance; it might be a tough question. But Miles, I was wondering if you could comment on what you intend to do with your shares in the pharma company post the split. Would you intend to hold them? Or would there be potential conflicts of interest there that -- or other reasons that might prevent you from doing so?","Miles D. White","No conflicts of interest. I intend to hold them. I'm confident for both companies.","Operator","Our next question is from Barbara Ryan from Deutsche Bank.","Barbara A. Ryan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So maybe as you talk about -- and I can understand the huge undertaking of splitting the 2 businesses. But can you give us some sense of timing beyond later this year and just in terms of seeing numbers for the different businesses? And how would you envision that coming out? Would it come out with a quarterly earnings release? Any more color on that would be really helpful.","Thomas C. Freyman","Sure. So I think the next big data point will be the submission of the Form 10, which we expect by the later part of the first half. As you know, that's where we basically carve out the proprietary pharma business historically in a way that -- as if it had been an independent company during that period. That's a pretty extensive process. To go through that, we have to obviously -- we're just finishing the closing of the books for 2011. We've now completed that, and now we are in the process of going through a carve-out and audit procedure to come up with that Form 10 information. So that would be the first data point. And in the meantime, we'll be refining our outlook for the remainder of '12 and going into 2013 for the 2 businesses, and we'll be able to talk more prospectively about them. And you can expect increasing investor relations activity in the second half of the year in the timeframe consistent with completing the separation by the end of the year. So Miles and Rick and the various management teams will be out interacting and talking about the future outlook for these companies in that timeframe.","John B. Thomas","Yes. Barbara, the only thing I'm going to add there is on the Form 10, I would just caution everybody that, that is going to be a historical document. And as we work to separate the businesses and the products and so forth, you\u2019ll have to be a little careful at the time of that document that you don't extrapolate that forward too much and draw too many conclusions. Separately, when we do the roadshows for these businesses, we'll talk about outlooks and things like that. So just be a little careful with that information. We can help you at the time of it. It serves a purpose, but it shouldn't be misconstrued in the wrong way about forward-looking projections and...","Barbara A. Ryan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, I guess, part of that is the capital structure that each company would have going forward versus the past.","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes. To John's point, the historical capital structure of the 2 businesses in the Form 10 will be quite different than what the capital structure of these companies will be in the future. That's just one example of the types of things we're going to have to help investors through.","Operator","Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Miles, I wanted to ask one question to you and then one for Tom, if I may. You've given some lofty guidance or some thoughts around the Molecular Diagnostics business in the future. And if you take away 2012, can you help us understand how that business is going to grow? Is it organic or will there be external adds to that business? And moreover, if it's true that Roche happens to consolidate some sort of sequencing business, do they get an edge in the molecular side? Or is that really irrelevant to your vision of Molecular Diagnostics in the future? And the second question again for Tom is I think you made a comment about resuming share repurchases in '12. What is the existing authorization?","Thomas C. Freyman","I'll take the second question first. We have about $3.4 billion remaining under the authorization, so we're in good shape to execute what would be appropriate during 2012.","John B. Thomas","And as far as the molecular business, Tony, as you know, that's been a great business for us. We're definitely an emerging leader in that business. It's about $450 million in sales in '11, growing to what we expect will be more than $1 billion by roughly 2015. And we factored in all of the different situations there in products and so forth that you're talking about. So we expect continued strong double-digit growth here in 2012, as well as over the LRP for that business.","Operator","Our next question is from Sara Michelmore from Brean Murray.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the EPD business. I'm just wondering that, I guess, that mid single-digit growth trajectory you're expecting for '12 struck me as maybe a little bit on the low side. And I was just wondering if you could help us kind of compare and contrast to kind of what the underlying growth was in 2011. Is that a similar rate of growth or an uptick? And then Miles, you have talked a lot about all these filings and that, that should improve the growth prospects going forward. Is that something that we could see kind of come to bear in the second half of this year? Or is that more of a 2013 or even a 2014 type of event?","Miles D. White","Yes, I think you got 2 things happening here. In the mix of the EPD business or Established Pharmaceuticals, there's a chunk that is generics in Western Europe. And that business has been under the kind of pressure, austerity pressure we've seen in Europe. And so the kind of growth that we've seen in pure emerging markets has been pretty significant double-digit, and that's with only a modest number of these registrations done. So you've got 2 things happening here. Over the course of 2012, there will be, in addition to the couple of hundred that were filed in the second half of 2011, a lot of filings in a lot of these countries that are our targeted geographies around the world, particularly in emerging markets. And as you would imagine, it will take some time to establish those. So I think you'll see some of that late in the year, but I think probably you'll really see the impact of it moving into '13 and beyond. So while we'll be watching for it, do we get the filings done and do we get them done on time and do we get them done in the mass that we intend to in the various countries and so forth, the real financial impact of that will be as they take hold and grow beyond that, which is probably more likely to be visible to you in a '13 timeframe. And at the same time, we're going to have to, by growing those markets, dilute, we'll call it, the austere impact of that chunk of business in Western Europe.","Thomas C. Freyman","And I'll just add. I think if you were to look at normalized growth rates in 2011 versus '12, you'd see roughly mid single digits in both. And one thing to keep in mind is this organization's been in place a little more than one year. They're just in the very early innings of execution and driving additional growth out of the portfolio, and as Miles said, adding more and more products to the portfolio. So you're going to see decent growth this year with very strong emerging markets and accelerating, we believe, as we go into 2013 and beyond. And as we said back in October, we think that overall, probably mid- to upper-type growth is what you should see in this established business over the longer term.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then Tom, you did say that the company would again be in the market doing share buybacks. And I get that there's a lot of management resources being spent on the spin right now. But I was hoping if just you could -- you or Miles could comment on kind of your thoughts on M&A. I look at that diversified medical products business in particular, and think there's a lot of tuck-in or other type of asset acquisitions that you could do that could further enhance what you have there. So just curious if M&A is off the table for 2012 or if you're still out there kind of actively looking at things.","Miles D. White","Yes, okay. I'll take that, Sara. I don't think I'd say it's off the table per se. But I would say this, philosophically, I'm not looking for -- we're not looking for big significant things. I mean, I'd point out to you, we did the Reata transaction or deal after our announcement of split. I think we're always vigilant, looking, analyzing, et cetera, in all of our businesses. We'll always be focused on pipeline enhancements for pharma because I think you practically always have to be. I don't think there's a particularly robust opportunity set out there today. I think it's pretty limited, and I think valuations are, let's call it, stratospheric and difficult to justify at this point. So I think it's very easy to be selective right now on the pharma side. But I know that Rick and his team and our organization are constantly looking for additional enhancements to our pharma portfolio. On the device side, I think you characterized it well. You might call it tuck-in or you might call it geographically opportunistic. There's a few very targeted things that we're interested in. I would call them focused and smaller. As a matter of generality, I'm not looking for big deals. And I think, to be realistic -- and I agree with our investors on this point. I think our investors would say look, unless you got some really great boy-you-can-hardly-stand-it opportunity, husband your cash. There's better things to do with your cash. And our investors in these kind of economic times value cash return or holding and accumulating some cash, and we are. So I'm not looking for places to go spend it necessarily unless something is really compelling. And I'd say right now, my push in the organization is a much greater focus on organic performance, on organic execution. We were very busy in M&A activities for the past several years. As Tom was answering about Established Pharmaceuticals a few moments ago, they've gone through a pretty significant integration of our legacy Abbott business, Solvay, Piramal, our arrangement with Zydus in India. And in the process of integrating that into a single division, they also separated it from the proprietary pharma business. So that was a pretty big effort in the organization. It's important in all of these businesses to make sure that they're operating at their best organically and particularly in R&D. And I think philosophically, every now and then, it's good to pause, soak it up and make sure that everything organically is working well, whether it's your R&D system, your innovation, your gross margin performance, et cetera, and we're very focused on that. I think when that's all in good shape, you're well integrated or separated. As the case may be, the foundation for your M&A activity is stronger. And so right now, I'd say our focus is very much internal, very much operational. But if the right circumstances come along for whether it's tuck-in or nice adjunctive add, we'll respond to it. But I think in that long, rambling answer, you can kind of hear that we're being very selective.","Operator","Our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 here. First, I was encouraged to see that you guys settled the AndroGel patent cases with Teva and Perrigo. Should we assume that the terms are similar to the Watson timeline, I think 2015 or so?","Miles D. White","Yes, Larry, we did have settlements with both of those parties, but the terms of those are confidential.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So no update on kind of when we should assume kind of a generic launch?","Miles D. White","In October, we talked about 2015, and we feel good about 2015.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And lastly, on emerging markets, the $2.5 billion for the quarter, what was the year-over-year constant currency growth rate? I mean, the last time you gave that number for emerging markets, you had $2.6 billion, I think, in the second quarter of '11. The growth rate would be helpful.","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, there definitely was currency affecting all sales in the quarter. But on a constant currency basis, for the diversified companies, it was up in excess of 10%, so double-digit growth there. And again, we define emerging markets pretty broadly. And in the proprietary business, there were some tender ins and outs between the third and fourth quarter. So it was little less robust in the proprietary business in the quarter.","John B.

On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today I\u2019ll discuss our results for 2015, as well as our outlook for 2016. For 2015 we achieved our financial objectives for the year reflecting strong double digit EPS growth when excluding the impact foreign exchange and almost 9% growth on an absolute basis, excluding the same sales grew over 9% including strong double digit growth in emerging markets and we continued to expand our growth and operating margins.","Overall, we made good progress against our strategic objectives. I would like to highlight few two key achievements from the past year. In established pharmaceuticals, we completed the sale of our developed markets business and successfully integrated CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia.","The integration of CFR provides the scale, manufacturing and portfolio of breadth to establish Abbott as a top 10 branded generics company in Latin America and actually number one in many of the markets in Latin America. And Veropharm had a similar impact in Russia positioning Abbott among the top branded generics companies in this key market.","We also made significant progress improving our commercial execution, expanding our local product portfolios and driving awareness of our Abbott brand with patients, physicians and pharmacies.","In Nutrition, we achieved double digit growth and share expansion in China with the portfolio of Pediatric Nutrition products that are customized to meet local preferences. In the U.S. we expanded our product offering in the tolerance and up-age categories with the portfolio of non-GMO products providing parents with additional formula choices.","Our international adult nutrition business achieved another year of strong growth as we continue to bold and shape this category globally. And we achieved another year of significant margin expansion.","In Medical Devices, MitraClip achieved sales of more than $250 million and we further solidified our leadership position in the transcatheter mithral valve repair market with the acquisitions of Tendyne and an option agreement to acquire Cephea Valve Technologies. Along with MitraClip, these technologies position Abbott well to sustain our leadership position in this attractive segment of the market.","In medical optics, we continue to launch a number of innovative products that are driving growth and share expansion most notably in the premium len segment. And in diabetes care, we introduced our revolutionary flash glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre in several countries throughout Europe. Consumer response for this product continues to be very positive and we recently expanded capacity to meet the growing demand.","We also made the progress during the year to bring the Libre technology to the U.S. with the regulatory submission for approval of Libre Pro, our professional use device in June of last year.","And finally in diagnostics, the combination of commercial execution, high quality platforms and customer focus solutions resulted in another year of above market growth across those developed and emerging markets.","This business also achieved another year of margin expansion, while simultaneously investing in the development of next generation system platforms across all three of its segments including the Core Lab, Molecular Diagnostics and Point of Care Diagnostics.","So we\u2019re entering 2016 with good underlying momentum. Our businesses have well aligned with favorable long term trends including the continued expansion of healthcare and emerging economy. While there has been some softening in this economies on a macro basis, national policies focused on expending access to care and feasible demographic trends, or driving growth in healthcare which is outpacing overall economic growth in these markets.","The fundamentals in the market and geographies where we compete remains strong, and we expect to deliver another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth in 2016.","However, a couple of items are impacting our growth outlook on an absolute basis and you\u2019ve heard this all weak, most notably foreign exchange. The rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several emerging market currencies beginning in the third quarter of last year means that foreign exchange will again be a growth headwind in 2016.","We're now entering the fifth year of this dollar bull cycle, while we actively worked to mitigate the impact of currency on our results, the impact of exchange on our bottom line would be more pronounced in 2016 due to the mix of currency movements and certain timing effects.","In comparing our 2016 forecast, we were mindful of finding right balance between managing through these transitory currency dynamics in the near term while concurrently making the right choices in appropriate investments to drive sustainable long term growth. ","The other notable impact to our 2016 outlook relates to Venezuela, which has been a good market for us for many years. As many of you know, market conditions in Venezuela have become more challenging including high inflation, increasing price and margin controls, regulations on import, and slowing demand.","As a result, our forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuela operation in 2016. Brian will provide more specific details on the impacts of currency in Venezuela in a few minutes.","So for 2016, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 reflects another year of strong double digit underlying earnings growth offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and a lower contribution from Venezuela that I just mentioned.","In this environment, we remain focused on what we control. Our commercial and operational execution, our innovations and our efforts to expand margins. In nutrition, our R&D organization continues to be highly productive and is now developing new products closer to our customers than ever before. We will be opening up several new R&D centers in Asia over the last several years.","We expect continued growth and share expansion in China, Latin America, and other priority markets including another year of strong international adult nutrition growth. And while we've made great progress expanding margins in this business, margin improvement remains a key priority and we continue to see opportunities for steady expansion going forward.","In established pharmaceuticals, our execution has improved significantly and we\u2019re focused on strengthening our capabilities in key channels and geographies, and building a well-recognized added brand with consumers take a permanent role in making decisions about their healthcare.","Internal development programs and local product acquisition are driving a steady cadence of new products in our established pharma business to strengthen local portfolios. In 2015, our productivity of new product launches increased versus the previous year and we expect another strong year at new product launch productivity in 2016.","In medical devices, we expect continued growth and share expansion in our cataract business driven by the ongoing launch and market uptick of our premium intraocular lens product across multiple geographies.","In diabetes care, we recently expanded capacities as I mentioned, to meet the strong demand for FreeStyle Libre in Europe. And we expect to bring this technology into a number of new markets in 2016 targeting in the multibillion dollar global blood glucose monitoring market. And in vascular, we continued to drive uptick of MitraClip and expect to bring it Absorb to new markets through the year.","Finally in diagnostics which remains one of our most consistent growth businesses. We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to drive above market growth at both developed and emerging markets. And as we progress through the year, we look forward to providing more specifics regarding our next generation diagnostic systems platforms as we get closer to launch.","Before turning it over to Brian, I\u2019d like to comment briefly on capital allocations. You always ask me about that and you know that we take a very balanced approach here which rest includes increasing our dividend, share repurchases, and M&A activity.","Last month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend marking the 44th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend. That is only one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency.","Share repurchases have and will continue to be part of our capital allocation mix. And lastly, while 2015 was relatively quiet for us on the M&A front, adding to our business with good M&A remains a key priority. We see plenty of opportunities and we will continue to remain active on this front.","As always, we remain disciplined and focused on finding the right balance of strategic fit and measures of return that will benefit for long term shareholder. I'm sure you\u2019re going to have a question for me later on that topic.","But overall you can see, cash flows remain strong, margins remain strong, the underlying growth of our businesses remain strong. In summary, the fundamentals of the market and geographies in which we compete, all remain strong. And we continue to focus on what we can control.","For 2016, the impact of foreign exchange and the Venezuela dynamics I mentioned earlier are offsetting double digit underlying earnings growth. These impacts while significant are transitory in nature and therefore we remain focused on making the right decisions, drive long term growth for our shareholders.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss 2015 results and 2016 outlook in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay, thanks Miles. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operation of $0.62 in line with our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased 4.9% on an operational basis, driven by strong performances in our branded generics, diagnostics and adult nutrition businesses.","Reported sales declined 3.1% in the quarter including an unfavorable impact of 8% from foreign exchange. The negative impact from exchange was approximately 1.5 percentage points higher than previous expectations due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies in the quarter.","The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.2% of sales, up 130 basis points over 2014, driven by continued margin expansion in diagnostics and nutrition. In the quarter, adjusted SG&A was 29.6% of sales and adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales, reflecting investments in development programs across the businesses including several next generation diagnostic system platforms.","The fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was somewhat lower to previous forecast due to inclusion of the impact of U.S. tax legislation inactive in December. Overall, as we look at 2015, we achieved our financial objectives for the year despite difficult environment. And we delivered strong underlying growth, while continue to make significant progress on our margin initiatives.","Turning to our 2016 outlook, today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.10 to $2.20. While this forecast reflects another year strong double-digit underlying earnings growth, foreign exchange in the Venezuela dynamics that Miles discussed are impacting our 2016 absolute growth outlook.","Let me take a moment to provide more detail on each of these items. As you know in the third quarter of 2015, several emerging market currencies weakened rapidly relative to the U.S. dollar and have continued to steadily weaken since that time. Based on the geographic mix with currencies that weakened and the rapid pace at which these currency decline, foreign exchange will be a greater offset to our underlying earnings growth in 2016 versus 2015.","Additionally in 2015, our hedging programs served to mitigate some of the underlying foreign exchange exposure and volatility. While our program remains in place for 2016 and it anticipate to deliver some offsetting impact to our exposure. The benefit of our hedges have naturally lessened over time.","So the follow through from translational foreign exchange combined with these hedging dynamics, negatively impact EPS growth in our guidance by little more than 10% for the full year of 2016.","Lastly, as Miles mentioned, due to challenging market conditions in Venezuela, our 2016 forecast assumes a significantly lower contribution from Venezuelan operations. This impact lowers our 2016 sales growth rate by almost 2%. And excluding this impact, the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range would reflect adjusted earnings per share growth in the mid single digits even with the more pronounced foreign exchange impact I discussed earlier. As the year progresses, we will provide any relevant updates on our business in Venezuela.","I'll now provide more specifics for our 2016 outlook. For the full year 2016, we forecast operational sales growth in the mid single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we'll expect a negative impact at around 4% on our full year reported sales, which would result in reported sales growth in the low single-digits for the full year 2016.","Scott will provide more detail on 2016 outlook wide business in a few minutes. The forecast in adjusted gross margin ratio around 57% of sales, reflecting the negative impact from exchange was partially offset by underlying gross margin initiatives across our businesses.","We forecast adjusted R&D investment are somewhat above 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 30.5% of sales for the full year. We forecast net interest expense of around $125 million, up over 2015 primarily due to higher U.S. interest rates and lower forecasted interest income in certain countries.","We forecast a loss of approximately $25 million on the exchange gain-loss line of P&L for the full year. And we forecast around $10 million of non-operating expense for the full year of 2016.","We forecast adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% for the full year of 2016, similar to 2015 and reflect in the effect of the U.S. tax legislation inactive in December.","Before I review our first quarter outlet outlook, I'd like to provide some context for our forecasted pattern of quarterly earnings growth in 2016. We forecast underlying adjusted EPS growth in double digits for each quarter of 2016. However, in absolute terms for foreign exchange in the Venezuela dynamics, we'll will have a more pronounced impacts on our results in the first half of the year.","We expect the pace of both sales and the adjusted EPS growth to progressively accelerate throughout the year. So for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share $0.38 to $0.40 cents reflecting double-digit underlying growth, which is more than the offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the lower contribution to the Venezuela operations.","We forecast operation sales growth in the low single digits. And our current exchange rates, we expect a negative impact of exchange around 6% resulting in a reported sales decline in a low single digit. The Venezuela dynamics that I discussed lowered our first quarter operations sales growth forecast by around 3 percentage points.","The forecast in adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 57% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat above 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 34% of sales in the first quarter. And we forecast net interest expense of around $25million in the first quarter.","In summary, we achieved strong growth in 2015 despite a challenging environment. Our business at end of 2016 with good underlying momentum and we continue to execute well on our margin expansion initiatives. Our underlying earnings growth forecast is to remain strong in 2016, very similar to the underlying earnings growth we saw in 2015.","With that, I'll turn it over to Scott to review the business operating highlights now. Scott?","Scott Leinenweber","Thanks, Brian. Today, I'll provide an overview of the fourth quarter sales performance in 2016 outlook by business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.","I'll start with diagnostics where sales increased 7% in the quarter. In core laboratory diagnostics, international sales increase nearly 8% driven by double digit growth in emerging market.","And in the U.S., we continue to achieve above market performance with growth of more than 6%. The molecular diagnostic sales grew 3%, led by strong growth in our core focus area of infectious disease testing. As expected, U.S. sales were impacted by the planned scale down of our genetic business.","And lastly, point of care diagnostics where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter. U.S. and international growth were driven by continued market adoption of i-STAT, our hand-held device which provides critical information at the patient's side helping healthcare providers choose the best treatments in a variety of care setting when minutes matter the most.","In 2016, we'll continue to leverage our best-in-class model and provide customers with a full offering of solutions to help them most efficiently operate their businesses while improving care. We expect global diagnostics sales to increase mid single-digits on an operational basis with both the full year and the first quarter of 2016.","In Nutrition, global sales increased 5.5% sales in the quarter. Pediatric nutrition sales increased approximately 4% and were led by continued market uptake of Eleva in China and Similac Advance non-GMO in the U.S. As expected, international pediatric nutrition were all impacted by a difficult comparisons versus the prior year when sales increased more than 25% driven by market uptake of product launches in China and South East Asia.","In adult nutrition, sales were led by 10% international growth, including double digits operational growth in several Latin American countries. U.S. performance was led by growth of venture in the retail and institutional segments of the market.","In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on capturing share with locally relevant pediatric nutrition products and growing and shaping the adult nutrition category globally. For the full year 2016, we expect global nutrition sales to increase mid single digit on an operational basis.","It's important to note that the Venezuela dynamics that Miles and Brian reviewed most significantly impact our forecast for nutrition and established pharmaceuticals. Excluding this impact, we forecast operational sales growth for our global nutrition business would be mid-to-high single digits for the full year 2016. For the first quarter, we are forecasting global nutrition sales to increase low to mid single digits on an operational basis.","In medical devices, as expected vascular sales was relatively flat for the quarter. MitraClip, our first-in-class device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation once again grew strong double digits. And Cephea, our innovative endovascular stent continued to perform well. This growth is mitigated by market dynamics and the coronary stent market.","In 2016, we'll continue to drive market uptake in MitraClip and Cephea and expect to bring Absorb, our fully dissolving stent to the U.S. market. For the full year and first quarter of 2016, we expect global vascular sales to decline whole single digits on an operational basis.","In diabetes care, sales growth was again driven by strong international sales of FreeStyle Libre in Europe. In 2016, with the recently completed capacity expansion, we look forward to bringing this breakthrough technology to more consumers around the world.","For the full year 2016, we expect global diabetes sales to increase double digits on an operational basis. For the first quarter, we\u2019re forecasting global diabetes sales to increase mid-single digits on an operational basis.","In medical optics, global sales increased 2% has strong performance in the cataract business, notably in the premium lens segment was partially offset by dynamics in refractive markets. In 2016, we'll continue to drive updates of our innovative premium intraocular lenses and we expect global medical optic sales to increase low to mid single digits on an operational basis for both the full year and first quarter of 2016.","And lastly, Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales again increased double digits. Sales growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in several markets, including Russia, India and China.","For the full year 2015, EPD sales grew double digits operationally with and without the impact of recent acquisitions. In 2016, we'll continue to broaden our portfolio with globally relevant in products, remain focus on successfully building our presence and scale in key countries are focus.","For the full year 2016, we expect EPD sales to increase mid-to-high single digit on an operational basis. As I mentioned earlier, Venezuela has a significant impact in our forecasted EPD growth rate. Excluding this impact, we would forecast operational sales growth for EPD in the low double digits for the full year 2016.","For the first quarter, we're forecasting EPD sales to increase mid single digits on an operational basis reflecting double digit operational growth excluding the impact of Venezuela.","In summary, we achieved another year of strong underlying sales and margin growth, and are well positioned to maintain that type of momentum for the full year 2016.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","Mike Weinstein","Let's start with Venezuela and maybe you could just give us a bit more in terms of what you're doing, one, with your operations there; and two, the change you're assuming it sounds like you're marking to market the business basically at different exchange rates. So can you just walk through financially what you're doing? And again, why that's blowing the business as much as it is in 2016?","Tom Freyman","Hi, Mike. This is Tom. I don't \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about what's going on for us in the country, but I want to make it very clear that we're not changing our exchange rate assumptions for the country. This is really about what's happening to the market through economic activity of those markets, and really demand and ability to pay for products.","The oil price was high at the beginning of the year, it declined throughout the year and the top markets became more challenging and we would talk as Scott talked about and Brian talked about significantly lower volume as we exited 2015.","And as Miles indicated in his remarks with price controls, very high inflation. And when we look at the remainder of 2016 going forward, we see very challenging conditions and much lower volumes in the country.","So we're focused on supplying the market, more focused on medically critical products. Our products are important to the market, but just the profitability of what we would expect for the year from that activity is a very low contribution compared to what we experienced largely in the first half of 2015.","So that is a situation and I think it will basically take some volatility out of our forecast, but reflects the reality of the market we're dealing in.","Mike Weinstein","So two more fundamental follow-up. So one, the Pediatric Nutritional business had a tougher comp in the fourth quarter internationally on optimum product launches and particularly in China. Can you just separate out for us the tough comp versus the underlying growth and degree to what you think you're seeing maybe slowdown in any of your markets?","Brian Yoor","Sure Mike. I would say in international, as particularly and the slow down we\u2019re seeing on the surface, nothing has changed about our underlying momentum here. If you go back to fourth quarter of 2014, that was the period where we were launching our innovations particularly, Eleva and QINTI into the market. And as you know, Eleva has had great success in the portion of the market that it's playing in.","So there is a little bit of a tougher comparison, fourth quarter '15 over '14. If you blend it out in China there on the average, Nutrition business grew over the mid teens for the full year. And so that's more reflective of the performance for this business for a year and it's still ongoing. We still have the momentum there. We still have plans for further opportunities of how we compete and how we've been priced to the various channels. So nothing has changed about the momentum and it continues in the 2016.","Mike Weinstein","So Miles bringing you in here. So all this discussion, the underlying business if we can pull out Venezuela and we can pull out may be one or two other smaller items. The underlying business hasn't changed, but the environment has changed in some places and the price update for prices for assets has changed. Have your priorities on the capital allocation and the M&A question, have your priorities changed at all in the last six months?","Miles White","No. Let me go back, Michael and paraphrase that for you. The frustrating thing and I think it's frustrating for a lot of multinational companies that are U.S. based is the underlying market dynamics remain strong in a lot of places. Every morning we get up, we see CNBC. Everybody brings their hands about China, but whether China is 7% growth or 6% growth, 6% is way bigger than the rest of the world. It's a fundamentally strong market for us as our practically all of these emerging markets.","Now, the oil-based economy, the ones we were extremely dependent on oil, take Venezuela \u2013 okay, there are different stories. And the volatility, unreliability and sustainable market there is different than just about anywhere in the world.","So okay, there was an outlier. And every year there is going to be some outliers somewhere. And I think if you're in a broad mix of currencies and a broad mix of countries and geographies as a multinational, somewhere something is not going to be great. But the fundamentals of the markets particularly for us in healthcare are good.","And yes, translating that back during this period it's unusual, it's frustrating. I mean none of this have seen this kind of oil price in couple of decades, none of us have seen this kind of currency pile on in a long time.","So okay, that said, we all know that every multinational CEO has said in the last two weeks in his earnings calls and we all see it, we all experience it.","Now, going back to your next question, has my expectation of our underlying momentum changed? No. Has my priority changed in terms of M&A activity? I'll tell you one thing about it that's changed a little bit. We've been looking at properties largely internationally. And I'd say, I'm probably balanced in that a little bit back in other way. I don't think in the past it was pretty hard in a lot of expansion opportunities in branded generic pharmaceuticals.","And I think there are opportunities there. But I think as you and others, we've watched those valuations over the last year when deal heat turned and I can tell you that there was still one particular one that we were involved in an auction for and the valuation that that property went for, we did not win it.","But the valuation that property went for was non economic. I mean just plain non economic. I would challenge the buyer to explain where the economic return was in that particular deal. They obviously have their reasons and they obviously saw something rest of us didn\u2019t appreciate. I\u2019d say is an understatement but the evaluation are at a level in some cases that you have to question prudence.","And I think at the end of the day while we got strategic reasons we want to expand our footprint in different places. Those valuations when we redeploy the capital on behalf of our shareholders have to make some sense. And I don\u2019t think that we are anymore, and I think we are prudent, I think we\u2019re disciplined, I think we\u2019ve made good deals in the past.","I've gone through so much of this where I've heard we paid too much, we didn\u2019t pay enough, we got a good deal et cetera. But I think some of things I saw last year said but I don't think I mind of losing that one. I don\u2019t think I've minded not participating that one.","So I think right now, first of all I don\u2019t see a lot that people are offering up for sale in effect and you know the old maxim; everything is for sale at some price. Well the price of some of these things would be for sale at isn\u2019t prudent, it just isn\u2019t prudent.","So I think you have to step back and say we\u2019re not in that zone. We\u2019re not going to be that irrational in some cases and that\u2019s me, I mean I hate that I\u2019m going to see some of this in print later but I think that.","So, you look at some of the currencies and some of the weakening of the currencies, we would do a lot of those deals in local currency, in fact almost all of them in local currency and I\u2019d say based on where those currency rates are today you could say it\u2019s time, this is the time because there is not as much currency rift in a purchase in that particular market et cetera.","But I think if I would think about mix of geographies and the mix of currencies and so forth that we currently have, I'm not sure investors would applaud further wading toward it just now. I think there is a prime issue here.","I\u2019d tell you, having said that if there was a right opportunity and the right place and I believe that we are strategically very important to us or real opportunity for investors and you know the balance of what we first saw in both of that market in the position, currency and so forth. They are all lined up and the valuation looked good, I\u2019d probably do that deal but that was a step up of a lot of ifs right now.","So you\u2019d say what's changed? I\u2019d say where I\u2019m looking and what I\u2019m considering it hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s just shifted in some of its balance. I think, I\u2019ve got all the same sort of pharmaceutical opportunities on my radar screen but I\u2019m prioritizing some others now that are maybe more important I think in this market, this environment in terms of strengthening our businesses.","Now I\u2019ve heard other CEOs say the same thing, I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say actually, I\u2019ve mostly heard bankers say that it\u2019s a very robust, everybody is out there trying to buy stuff market. I\u2019ve heard it more from bankers than from other companies reporting.","I don\u2019t think there is that many things out there for people to consider in our spaces. I don\u2019t think there is that many properties, I don\u2019t think there is that many assets, I don\u2019t think there that much to consolidate. So I think it\u2019s fairly predictable particularly for an analyst in this space as you are to predict the kind of things that people are going to be looking at there is not a lot out there to consider.","So I think for us we know what our strategic priorities are. We know what can help our business. We know where there's real plusses and opportunities and the question is whether or not the other parties whoever they maybe see the same sort of opportunity and we can come together on an overlap of valuation and make something happen.","I know that sounds like textbook platitude but that\u2019s really what it is. There is a lot of people at the dance looking at each other and trying to decide whether they want to dance but I don\u2019t think there is that many opportunities to be made and everybody is in the same environment where they think their own evaluations are low and they are looking at evaluations from last year that will turn a high and I think you\u2019re in a zone where people are adjusting to what's my value.","And so having said all that, am I any less focused on it? No, I\u2019m probably more focused on it if anything. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re also pretty analytical about what we can do with the businesses and what's the right valuation and what's the right timing and so forth because you know we don\u2019t get swept up in deal heat. We\u2019re fairly strategic about it and I know that a lot of people think that a lot happened last year and we should have been in the midst of it but I didn\u2019t see anything go by that I felt particularly bad about not being in the mix of it.","I mentioned there was one particular one we were in the hunt on and the evaluation at the end was so high, I don\u2019t mind missing it at all. So I realize that\u2019s a long ramble for you Mike but that probably gives you a fair degree of insight into how I\u2019m thinking about it. We\u2019re definitely not inactive that\u2019s for sure.","Mike Weinstein","Listen, I have follow-ups, but I'm going to let some others jump in. Thanks, Miles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to kind of follow up, I guess, along Mike's line of thinking, I know you talked a lot about more from a geographic point of view. I was just wondering if you could talk more about the balance of Abbott from more of a business mix point of view. Has the way that you've looked at the mix of Abbott from that perspective changed over the last kind of year or so, really since the spin of AbbVie?","And if I look at the growth rates for this year, medical devices, the growth operationally was 1.5. If that division were to be separated out, I just look at Abbott as - it would be even stronger as a company and how do you think about that franchise and strengthening it, or just kind of the composition of Abbott today and the future.","Miles White ","Well I think I\u2019d start with that would be all about strengthening rather than separating out, but we're committed to all four major segments that we have in the company. One of the important things about those segments is they are in relative balance in terms of size, sales, profitability et cetera. They have all got you now somewhat different dynamics and they have also got a lot in common, because the EPD and nutrition globally, they share a lot of channel dynamics and so forth devices, diagnostics, I mean there is a lot of different things going on with these businesses.","But I\u2019d say first is balance matters in the mix with the investment identity of the company for a investor because we want to be reliable performer steadily over time. And as you know our proprietary pharma business avaricely grew to a terrific size and based on one product in particular. And so we were out of balance as a company and so we split into two companies. But we got balance in these businesses.","That said, you know I\u2019d say from an M&A perspective and the places where we are looking to be perfectly fair, we are not looking to do anything with regard to M&A in our nutrition business today. I mean if something came along opportunistically we would look at everything but the fact is that business is - that\u2019s an organic business for us and all of our performance objectives and things we want to do in the nutrition business globally are organically driven and we think we\u2019re in a good position for all of that.","So the kind of investments that we make in those businesses and we\u2019re a capital plant et cetera in the right market for the world and managing supply chains and so forth.","The other three businesses are each a different tale, you know diagnostics I\u2019d say we got a very strong business here. It\u2019s actually a diverse business. It\u2019s wanted in a segment of diagnostics and if we opportunistically could add to it we would. Obviously all the criteria you look at have to make sense but that\u2019s a business where we don\u2019t really have to but if we had opportunities we will. ","EPD similar, you know we\u2019ve got a gem of a business there and having done a lot of things to shape that business in the last several years, we are in the right growth markets, we\u2019re in high growth markets, we\u2019re in markets where the profitability and the market development, the retail facing, all the structural and channel dynamics for a brand of generics are good.","We\u2019ve identified like let\u2019s say in priority 15 countries in particular that meet our criteria and we\u2019ve got strong positions and most of those particularly important ones and we\u2019re always looking to enhance our footprint in those markets if we can and expand our brands in those markets.","Latin America was a great example of that and so there is still many geographic opportunities to do so, but I always make the distinction to investors and others that it\u2019s really where we can distinctively differentiate branded generic pharmaceuticals which means retail and channel and so forth right till the end, other Latin American countries and so forth.","And so when we have those opportunities it\u2019s great to add on but what we\u2019ve got is core business now, a very strong branded generic international largely focused on emerging market business where there is tremendous tailwind of market growth.","So that\u2019s one that\u2019s opportunistic. And then devices, I\u2019d say it\u2019s some of both. We look at that, we\u2019d always want to strengthen that business, we do wish to strengthen that business, there are a number of ways for doing that and obviously there is organic in-house and then there is our venture organization where we're building a number of small companies who are investing in other early stage companies and so forth and building our pipelines for the future.","And then finally, opportunistically, there are available opportunities where it fits our market segments and so forth, and then there is always M&A. So we are always mindful of those opportunities. It gives you a sense of how we think about each of those segments. Would you think about something completely unrelated difference? Probably not. There are too many opportunities to build or strengthen the ones we have, and their needs from a strengthening standpoint vary. Some have more need to have more breadth of product than others and some are purely opportunistic.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then just thinking about -- I know one of the areas that you've highlighted earlier was building out the capacity for FreeStyle Libre. What about the U.S. timing for that and is that going to be a consumer product, or is that just going to be more of the physician product?","Scott Leinenweber","Well, I think it depends on what timeframe you're asking. And it's going to be both, eventually. I mean, right now, I want the fastest regulatory path possible. This product has been exceptionally well received in Europe. Spectacularly well received I should say. Consumers and users and diabetics and so forth have just given us an over whelming positive response. So that's good and we're just in the process now to releasing all the new capacity we invested in, in the last year.","And we got the next way to capacity expansion underway. So it's kind of one of those great challenges where I want to play from my own perspective. The diabetic community in United States wants this product. And it's a regulatory pacing issue here. It wasn't so in Europe. And I would say no more about that, but I'm in a hurry because we know the value of the product. We know the reception of the product. We know what the physician community reception of the product is. We know all of that and the value proposition of this product on top of the medical proposition is just fabulous.","I have great expectations for it. I'm excited about it. And there is sort of two dimensions to that. One is enough capacity, which for a while we'll have and then we'll have another tranche coming on. And the regulatory process for how fast we can go.","Kristen Stewart","Any sense on when the first product could hit market in the U.S.?","Scott Leinenweber","I'm one of those superstitious people that no matter what I tell, I'm going to be wrong. And so I don't want to jinx anything. So I'll say, I would optimistically hope towards this year, but I don't know.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much for question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning, guys. Miles, first question is on the Mylan stake. I'm wondering if you'll give us an update on this stake. What you're thinking is -- in the past you've said you're not going to be a long-term holder. Are you any closer to selling that stake? And will the sale be associated with some M&A? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, good news. You're right. We're not going to be a long term shareholder of Mylan. But the good news is, we don't have to sell it right away. We have the freedom to sell it. We just don't have an immediate reason to have to. So I'd say we can leave it in Mylan shares or we can leave it in cash, either way. And you ask if it had something to do with M&A. Well, obviously that might trigger it. I think it depends on what the price of Mylan is in the market and the manner in which we might market our shares and so forth. There is a couple of dynamics there, but I would confirm.","No. We don't intend to be long-term Mylan holders. And well, we don't think holding this back is probably trigger of M&A activity. Maybe a little evaluation, but we're not particularly hung up on value right now. We did watch the entire Perrigo process and hoped for a path and we though until that stabilize and was finished, there was no point in being in the way of that. So that happened, that stabilized, that's finished. There is a stable market now for Mylan shares. And we'll just wait and see what triggers it. But we otherwise have no reason to move one way or other until there is some trigger like M&A, I would guess.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Let me just follow up --","Miles White","If the price were to rocket north, we'd probably view that as a trigger too, to be obvious.","Glenn Novarro","Let me ask a specific question on your vascular business because, if you strip out currency, I think over the last 12 months, even going forward, most of the businesses are on track, at least performing in line with our expectations. But the vascular business continues to come -- at least relative to our expectations, continues to come in below. And I know you highlighted Absorb, but a lot of our channel checks are not very positive on Absorb.","So I guess my question is what's the commitment to this vascular business? Is this a business that you need to build up through M&A and the reason why we haven't seen a lot of M&A, is it because the targets have still unrealistic valuations? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I'll say couple of things. First of all, we're committed to the business. And I think these are the bigger market conditions here. If you look at the markets around the world, not just the U.S. but literally every major country in the world, the markets have stabilized among competitors. Share doesn't move a lot. It does moves a little. The provisions in these spaces -- they take a new product and they experiment with it a little bit and that's about it.","The innovation here is at a point where I'd say, the incremental value recognized by the healthcare system is limited. If you think about what drug code it stands for and so forth have done in the vascular space, it's been a tremendous boon in the treatment of patients. But I think now what we see is this market is far more driven by cost and prices in either countries or hospital groups and others, trying to manage the overall cost of healthcare.","So I think all of us see the same dynamics where we're increasingly challenged on more value proposition than just innovation. And I think increasingly the payer, whether it's government or purchasing people or insurer, whatever it is are increasingly more influential here than preference of physicians.","You say, well, those aren't very good dynamics. Well, they are not bad dynamics either. We have to compete in this business just like we compete in a lot of other businesses. And I think we and our competitors in this business are all broadening our product lines or innovating in other surrounding spaces and broadening those offerings in the space. And there is still a lot of room to innovation, but it may not be specifically just on the stents.","So that - what behooves us is to expand our business and to some degree, or to a large degree, that is M&A. And in our case it's been a lot of small-ball M&A and look to expand around those businesses might require to Absorb those kind of things or incremental. Well, MitraClip is very significant that way. We look at expanding into structural heart or heart failure or other categories, and we're trying to build our breadth in those other -- let's say, surrounding spaces that way.","I don't think that's very different for any of the companies in this business, worldwide. I think it's been difficult for any market that have been kind of a robust-innovation driven growth that this one did back in early 2000s. It's a different market today. It's a different market everywhere, today.","So is it a slower growth market? Yes. Is it still a very attractive market? Yes. It's still a very profitable market for all participants. And it's why it gets a lot of pressure from a cost standpoint from payers, etcetera. I don't think that's a secret to anybody. So while other make it a --performance of the business and say, gee, it's a little lower expectations. I'm beginning to think its just robust adjusting our expectations to sort of a reality of the value propositions in the market today.","And so I think it's a very strong business, it's a very healthy one in recent that respect. We still invest quite substantially in R&D and innovations there, and clinical trials and so forth. We get innovations that are in R&D and in the clinical space and a lot of investments around it. So would it benefit from a much broader footprint?","Well, it probably would. The question is how to get to that broader footprint. And I think the current medical device space broadly defined today, there is either a bunch of big companies or bunch of little companies. There is not much in the middle. And the couple of things in the middle are extremely highly valued relative to their current performance. And I think there is a lot of speculation or question about whether or not that kind of value will play out.","So it will just evolve in little time. We've made a lot of investments in a smaller companies or segments, as you know, whether Tendyne or Cephea or others to expand our footprint here. So I think -- I believe in medical device space right now and long term, but I don't think it will be the same kind of space it was10, 15 years ago.","Glenn Novarro","You had mentioned priorities. Is vascular higher up on your priority list now?","Miles White","Well, that implies it wasn't before. I would say the device space has always been high on my priority list. And whether its -- the vascular space or the optic space or whatever, this has been high on priority list for a while.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Great. Thank you, Miles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It's just a one clarification question and then two real questions. On the emerging market growth in Q4, can you give us the trend of the organic constant currency growth for this quarter, please?","Brian Yoor","Yes. Larry, if you look at the quarter and you take out the impact of what we talked about a little bit slow in Venezuela throughout the year, we are in the double-digit range for emerging markets across Abbott's businesses. The emerging market momentum --","Larry Biegelsen","Sorry, Brian, that was for Q4 2015?","Brian Yoor","Q4 2015. And for the four years as well, double-digit growth to the underlying momentum continues in the '16 as well.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay. Thanks for that. And then so for my two real questions, one is on deal size. Miles, you've talked about in the past a sweet spot of $5 billion to $7 billion. That's one thing you haven't touched upon this morning. Any color on that? Is that still the case? And then I had one follow-up. Thanks.","Brian Yoor","In reality, we've got a lot of capacity and it just depends. We've obviously done a lot of small things and small can be measured in a lot of ways. I can remember when I thought a $1 billion dollars was huge. Now people seem to think of that as dinky. We've done a lot of things smaller than that and also mid size -- I don't feel constrained at $7 billion. I don't feel constrained at $8 billion or $10 billion. I don't feel constrained. So I'd say look if the opportunity is right, the strategic fit is right and the valuation is right, I don't feel constrained by size right now.","Larry Biegelsen","That's very helpful. And then I hope you understand the spirit of this question, because it's kind of a question that we'll probably get today. But I was struck by your comment earlier, Miles, when you said every year there is some outlier somewhere when you were talking about Venezuela. And I think, in the past, Abbott would absorb those outliers. So I guess why not now and what can you do to kind of mitigate that in the future? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I think that's a good question. And I'd say what we always do everything we can to mitigate. Here is what's different this time. Last year exchange was a strong headwind for any U.S.-based multinational across the board. And I recall at this very time last year from December to now, you'll recall both oil and exchange kind of hit, kind of sudden hit accepted the oil price drop at that point was a very high level -- much higher level than where we are today.","But there was this sudden hit in sort of late fourth quarter '14 and then in early '15, and everybody scrambled to readjust their ETF guidance for the year to try to deal with what they saw coming as currency and was already happening. And a lot of companies dialed back to single digit or whatever and laid it on exchange and so forth, which was valid.","In our case, we said -- we think we can navigate through it and we did. And we had extremely strong underlying growth in our market as we still do. And it wasn't just double digits. It's been healthy double digits all year long. And so in our case, we were able to mitigate and off of lot of that exchange all year long and still deliver what was frankly very differentiated higher growth than many, many of our peers, even multinational peers not in healthcare.","And what we got now is another year on top of that, okay, same sort of thing. And if you look at the exchange rate graphs, who would have thought these exchange rate could in a lot of cases, be even bigger. Even bigger exchange rates -- how we want to translate it to have stronger philosophy on the other side. And then on top of that, nobody predicted $25 to $30 oil. Now, that's a curve ball for the whole world.","As so when you throw that curve ball in there, it dramatically unbalances the mix of their currencies because of the oil-based economies where lower oil prices really affect the underlying performance of the country.","So you take a country like Russia or Venezuela or Saudi Arabia. Now these are countries, they are all strong countries for us. And to different degrees they\u2019ve been impacted by their own oil revenues and therefore their own ability to pay for products.","Now, having said that, is Russia still a strong market for us? It is. Do we have the same kind of difficulties in Russia that we have in Venezuela? We don't. It is a fundamentally good market, strong underlying market et cetera. The only thing it\u2019s not strong is the Ruble which is dramatically weaker versus the Dollar than even a year ago.","And so there is this disproportionate imbalance in the pressures in the currency basket if you will from a little handful of countries where they already had currency translation, challenges just like the rest of the world. Except that they have oil dependence on top of it which amplifies it even more.","And when you start to stack up all of those things, you\u2019ll say, okay, could we navigate through this? And the answer is, we could. I can cut a lot of expenses, I can delay a lot of investments. There is a lot of things that frankly, I have the discretion to do. We, as a company have the discretion to do.","And I could then say to you, we\u2019ll either have 5% earnings growth or high single digit earnings growth, but in our judgment, this year is so unusual this way with the ongoing depth of currency walls and the unusual circumstance of oil prices and its impact on its economies, that I would look out and say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to compromise our ability to the laughter all this underlying growth for one year. In suspect it\u2019s more prudent to take out Venezuela out of the assumptions.","It\u2019s more prudent to take that one out and keep right ongoing, and I think if you believe in the underlying strength of economies around the world, the ones that are delivering growth, and if you believe in the underlying growth of healthcare and those economies, and you believe in the underlying growth of all our products, if you believe in Abbott\u2019s ability to continue to access all that growth, then my judgment was okay, I\u2019m going to roll out of the pocket here, take Venezuela out of the assumption. If I hadn\u2019t taken Venezuela out of the assumptions, I'd be telling you right now that you are going to have mid-single digit growth on the top and bottom line.","And you know something you think that was terrific in this environment. And if you compare this to all the other multination in our phase or, frankly, other multinational species, they\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s right now with everybody else. ","So in this case we said, if don\u2019t want to artificially compromise our investments in a lot of these businesses, whether it\u2019s an SG&A investment or R&D or whatever, because of Venezuela. So I think I\u2019m going to take that one out and keep right ongoing because I believe in the longer term growth prospects of these economies in these businesses, and I\u2019m not going to compromise that for couple of quarters in Venezuela, so at the end of day, could we manage through it? Yes.","And you know this. If you look back at even 10 years of track record of Abbott, it\u2019s absolutely been reliable at double digit bottom line and high single-digit topline unlike almost any other large, diverse multinational out there.","We\u2019ve been a very reliable performer that way in a very diverse world. So I don\u2019t say all that defensively, even though it might sound like it. I look at the world and say man, this is like a total different circumstance that anyone of us have ever seen. And that\u2019s going to make a judgment of how far do I go to push off what we ought to be doing to sort of wait out this oddball storm we\u2019re in.","And I think there\u2019s a lot of people who project oil prices are going to stay down for a long time. And yet everyone says, yes, but what is down. And At what point do these oil driven economies start performing better, 60 bucks, 70 bucks, 50 bucks?","There is different thresholds where the performance of economy change dramatically through a lot of different businesses in the world, not just us. In our case, healthcare is pretty good, no matter what the oil price is. The dynamics of Venezuela are unique. They are unique. And even the Saudis. Do they still spend on healthcare? Yes, they do. It\u2019s still a very strong important market for us and so is Russia and so on.","So I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a long round of a way of saying, we made a deliberate decision. It was discretionary. Could I have made the decision to say, I\u2019m going to deliver high single-digit earnings no matter what? Yes probably, but I\u2019d have had to compromise the underlying momentum and whereas I didn\u2019t think it was prudent.","For exchange, yes we can manage exchange. Venezuela, I think it\u2019s more prudent to just take Venezuela out of the mix in terms of what our expectations are and that\u2019s an unusual anomaly. I challenge back to 2015, we lived through exchange, can we live through exchange again? Yes we can. And the single biggest in difference in our guidance for this year is actually Venezuela.","I don\u2019t know if that answers your question but that was my judgment you know it\u2019s not an inability, it\u2019s more of a decision. If you look at our spending rates and stuff in our go forward guidance our spending rates are healthy.","Larry Biegelsen","Very helpful, thanks Miles. ","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Rick Wise of Stifel Nicolaus. Sir your line is open.","Rick Wise","Thanks for the question. Miles, hard to resist just asking one more question on Venezuela, and I totally understand the point you were making there. But you sort of said in your last comment that maybe a quarter or two of headwind. Wouldn't it be more prudent to think this might be a couple of year issue and might be structural? And then just as part of that, maybe for Brian, is the simple monkey math on this - you're really growing mid-teens, some of that 15%. If Venezuela is a 5% hit to EPS growth and FX is 10%, that's what you're really growing on a sustained basis.","Miles White","Yes let me deal with your Venezuela question first and then I'll let Brian wrap up with, close on what he just said about our growth rate. You know you could be dead right about Venezuela, I don\u2019t know but here is the difference for us. We\u2019re healthcare company and among our businesses there are products that are medically necessary and we have to pay attention to medically necessary.","We don\u2019t have to lose money all the time, we don\u2019t have to be irrational, for whatever reason but we\u2019re mindful that we\u2019re a healthcare company. We\u2019re mindful that we have medically necessary products. We\u2019re mindful that we\u2019ve been in Latin America and in Venezuela for decades and a lot of times in the past in decades, foreign companies have exited those countries immediately when the economics turned sour.","And the long term commitment to that continent, the governments of those countries and the healthcare systems of those countries, they know that and they recognize that. Abbott has never done that in 90 years in Latin America and we are a fundamentally large healthcare provider in Latin America. So our judgment was to make these decisions one step at a time as we see how circumstances develop.","It\u2019s a pretty big decision that we\u2019ve taken just to say we\u2019re going to take the sales and profit expectations out of our expectations for the year so that our investors, frankly you\u2019re getting news today that we\u2019re taking it out of our expectations right, and yet all I\u2019m trying to do here is de-risk your expectations, de-risk your riding the roller coaster volatility here with that particular country, because that one\u2019s unique.","And so we just chose to take it out of the estimates because we know we\u2019re going to continue to have medically necessary products there but that\u2019s going to be in our view at a much lower promotional level even in the past.","So for right now I think that\u2019s the right prudent place to be for that change I suppose anything to change. I hope the change is more favorably frankly but I\u2019m not listening through the graveyard, I just know that they are in a very tough circumstance as a country and they are volatile, they are unpredictable and it\u2019s not a very reliable market as markets go.","So I think this is the right step, you could say we shouldn\u2019t just go a lot further and I\u2019d say you know you could say that if you were just in some common industrial consumer or whatever good but I don\u2019t think as an healthcare company you can quite do the same things.","So, I think we have to be a little prudent here about the medically necessary part, that\u2019s why we\u2019re where we are. And Brain you can address Rick\u2019s final comment about underlying growth rate.","Brian Yoor","Sure. Rick, when you think about Venezuela and a decision to derisk this and just assume for a second if that\u2019s your reality, your growth rate it doesn\u2019t change. Your growth rate will actually become better as you move through time, so nothing\u2019s changed about Abbott\u2019s growth perspective, they may even become better.","When you think about what I\u2019ve said and what you\u2019ve modeled in '15, you know that we had mid-teens underlying growth not for the impact of foreign exchange and we take these things that we talked about into account be about the de-risking of Venezuela on what it means to our earnings, as well as the FX, you are going to get right back to the mid teens.","Miles White","Rick, I think you did a better job summarizing than Brian did ","Scott Leinenweber","Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions.

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Scott Leinenweber","Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","Please note that third quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjust the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current year and historical results for Abbott's Medical Optics and St. Jude's vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude's historical sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott's presentation.","Earlier this month, Abbott completed its acquisition of Alere, given there are only three months remaining in the year. I'd note that comparable sales growth guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay. Thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.66 at the high end of our guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. We also raised midpoint of our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $2.48 to $2.50 which is at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year.","Sales increased more than [technical difficulty] in the quarter led by strong performance in established pharmaceuticals and medical devices. At the beginning of the year, I commented that we were entering a period where innovation and new product launches when enhance our competitiveness and fortify our leading market positions. We're seeing this play out through the first three quarters of the year with significant growth contributions from several recently launched products and important advancements across our innovative new product pipeline. I'll highlight several examples as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Brian.","I'll start with diagnostics where we achieved sales growth of more than 5% in the quarter which was led by strong international performance during the quarter. We continued the initial European launch of our Alinity family of systems, which now includes five recently launched instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening, hematology and Point of Care testing. As we've stated previously, our primary focus during this initial launch period has been to convert a number of long tenured Abbott customers to Alinity and we continue to make progress on that front across all of the major European countries. We continue to anticipate CE Mark for our Alinity molecular diagnostic systems in the coming months and expect to begin the launch of the Alinity instruments in the US in 2018.","During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Alere establishing Abbott, is the global leader in Point of Care testing. This combination creates the broadest Point of Care testing portfolio in the world with leading positions across cardio, metabolic, infectious disease and toxicology testing.","In nutrition, sales grew very modestly in the quarter. And pediatric nutrition continued above market performance and the US was led by recently launched infant formula products and strong growth of our PediaSure toddler brand. Internationally, we've seen some market stabilization in China and we prepare for the pending new food safety regulations that are set to go into effect on January 1 of next year. Outside of China as expected, we continue to see soft market conditions across few international markets and then adult nutrition international growth of 5.5% was led by our market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.","In established pharmaceuticals or EPD double-digit sales growth was led by strong performance across our key emerging markets including double-digit growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China. As expected and contemplated in our third quarter guidance, we saw a modest level of channel restocking in India after the implementation of a new tax system in that country on July 1, which contributed approximately 2.5 percentage points of growth in the quarter excluding this impact total EPD sales would have grown around 12% in the quarter. With our unique geographic footprint and business model as well as our scale and leading positions in several geographies, EPD is well positioned for sustained above market performance.","And in medical devices sales growth was led by double-digit growth in heart failure, electrophysiology, structural heart, neuromodulation and diabetes care. In addition to strong growth we achieved several important new product approvals and clinical trial milestones across our portfolio during the third quarter.","In heart failure, we received US FDA approval and launched our HeartMate 3 pump which provides crucial support for advanced heart failure patients as they wait for their treatment including heart transplants. HeartMate 3 offers a number of advantages compared to existing options and further strengthens our global leadership position in this area. During the quarter, we also received US FDA approval of our MRI compatible ICD or implantable defibrillator which follows FDA approval of our MRI compatible pacemaker earlier this year. These approvals significantly enhance our competitive position in the US Cardiac Rhythm Management market.","In structural heart, double-digit growth was driven by continued global uptick MitraClip. During the quarter we achieved several important clinical milestones including completion of enrolment in our US trial for Portico, our TAVR product and we began enrolling patients in a new tricuspid valve disease trial which utilizes our market leading transcatheter valve repair system. In Neuromodulation, we achieved growth of approximately 50% for the third consecutive quarter driven by recently launched products that offer improved relief for chronic pain patients and help for those suffering from movement disorders. With our broad portfolio of innovative solutions, we continue to advance our leadership position in this fast growing market.","I'll wrap up with diabetes care, where international sales growth of nearly 35% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. Libre now has more than 400,000 users internationally and during the quarter we obtained national reimbursement status in Japan and the United Kingdom which represent two of the largest diabetes markets in the world.","In the US during the quarter, Libre received US FDA approval as a replacement for blood glucose monitoring. This revolutionary technology is the only system available that comes factory-calibrated thus eliminating the need for daily finger sticks that are required to calibrate other systems currently available.","So in summary, we exceeded expectations for the quarter and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance which is now at the upper end of the range, we said at the beginning of the year. Our sales growth increased sequentially and recently launched products are contributing significant growth across our portfolio and we're particularly pleased with the productivity we're seeing across our new product pipeline which is delivering a study cadence of approvals and launches of innovative technologies.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more details. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on a comparable basis and do not include Alere, which is consistent with the guidance methodology we've utilized since the beginning of the year.","Turning to our results, sales for the third quarter increased 5.6% on an operational basis. Exchange had positive impact on sales of 0.6% resulting in reported sales growth of 6.2% in the quarter. The favorable impact of exchange rates on our sales this quarter was driven primarily by strengthening of the Euro and other developed market currencies which considering our European cost base and hedging program have a relatively modest follow-through impact on our earnings. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.9% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.4% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, today we narrowed and raised at the midpoint our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.48 to $2.50. Before reviewing our outlook in more detail, I'd note that Alere which we acquired earlier this month is expected to contribute around $475 million to our reported sales and we forecast a neutral impact on adjusted earnings per share this year. We continue to forecast full year 2017 comparable operational sales growth in the mid-single digits and based on current exchange rates, would expect exchange to have a positive impact of nearly 0.5% on our full year reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 7.5% and SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 to $0.74. We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the mid-to-high single digits and at current rates would expect exchange to have a positive impact of somewhat above 2% on our fourth quarter [technical difficulty] sales.","Before I open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter operational sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecasted double-digit sales growth. In Nutrition, we forecast low single-digit sales growth. In Diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits and in medical devices, we forecast sales to increase mid-to-high single digits which reflects continued double-digit growth in diabetes care as well as several areas in our cardiovascular and neuromodulation business.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Mike Weinstein","Miles, if we could touch on two topics. First is Alere now that it's closed and second is Libre, now that you have an FDA approval. First Alere, can you talk now about how we should think about the outlook for Alere both topline growth and in accretion obviously or it is familiar what you initially were expecting from accretion with $0.12 to $0.13 year one, including [ph] $0.20 in year two, but a lot happened to your business over that time. You renegotiated terms, you've divested some assets. So I think everybody would appreciate an update on how we're viewing that business and then we'll circle back on Libre. Thanks.","Miles White","Yes, I think it's premature Mike to give real specific about Alere. We closed the deal a couple of weeks ago, literally. And our new management team is taking over the business, but obviously very rapidly getting up to speed, meeting all their employees and going through all the things you do to start integration and so forth. And I'd say first of all, that's gone very well. The management team we put in place has moved very quickly and I'd say very deliberately to get their hands around everything, but that takes some time. As we've said the people given the timing of when we close it, we expect no accretion this year. So I wouldn't look for any particular impact on the bottom line in 2017 and with regard to 2018, since our initial estimates of accretion that were quite some time ago, as you know when we first announced this deal because it's taken a very long time close. There have been a number of changes including divestitures and so forth. So I don't want to give you a specific number. I'd say it's fair to think that the accretion will be much more modest and what we have initially indicated for the first year. We will get a full year, we'll get a quarter's head start. And obviously our intent is to be accretive to our company and our business and we believe that with the acquisition we've positioned ourselves as the leader in Point of Care testing worldwide and all of that has the intent of good solid growth and profit growth for our investors, but I'm going to be cautious about what I communicate for 2018 at this point until we've really had a chance to assess it more thoroughly.","Mike Weinstein","And do you think the business as you own it and they call it the proforma that we're under Abbott, does that business grow in 2018 and is low single digits an appropriate expectation.","Miles White","I think it's a good target. I don't know that we know yet, but that's certainly I think an expectation we Abbott ought to have and the question is, how rapidly we can do that. Look I think it's a fair expectation and if I was and I'm totally honest with you. I wouldn't have a lesser expectation.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, all right. Let me switch to Libre, if I can. And maybe try and ask, get couple questions in. So one, obviously everybody is excited not only based on all your success outside the US with Libre that now that you had this opportunity in the US. What would you view as a successful launch for Libre in 2018? Is there something you could characterize or wrap in a number, is it a $50 million, is it $100 million, if you wanted to take a stab at that? And then second, what is your expectation commercial payers. Can you tell us about the conversations you've had and the willingness and the timing of you think commercial payers getting onboard? Thanks.","Miles White","Well I'd say couple of things. Your estimate is - let's just say your estimate I'll take. And you gave me a nice range there, so thank you. And I think that you can assume that we'll be looking at this from a lot of perspectives because we've got a lot of data. Having had a run rate in Europe, we launched in Europe and it basically went country-by-country. We started as full patient pay and we had really terrific uptake in consumer interest and that was the first introduction of Libre to the market. The fact that there was no reimbursement early on, was an unknown to us and it was a new concept and a new way for diabetics to test. And we experienced tremendous demand. Our first year, we were capacity limited and yet, we had a fair bit of demand. Second year, obviously has gone exceptionally well and so as I indicated we've got over 400,000 customers. It was remarkably well embraced for reimbursement by government bodies in Europe and regions in Germany etc., that's extremely gratifying that the value proposition that we see with Libre is strong and it's intended to be.","And consequently we believe that part of the appeal is not just, what Libre can do and the information that it provides to a diabetic was a very informed patient and a very self-managing patient. It provides them tremendous information, tremendous guidance in the management of diabetes and I know that first-hand, I wear one. And I got to say it's just a phenomenal device, it's a super product. I can see why consumers like it as much as they do and that's true for both Type I and Type II's and we're seeing that universally across the board, they use it in different ways or at least the information mean something to them in different ways. Whether they're managing insulin or whether they're managing diet and exercise and other things.","So I'd say first of all, I expect demand to be pretty strong. Secondly, the US market knows about Libre, it knows a lot about Libre because of all the experience that we've had in the last year in Europe. So I do expect a more educated, ready, prepared, anticipating, demanding market in the US as it relates to payers, which I would call the second dimension of this. I think our value proposition is quite strong. The product is priced at a very economic and affordable level. The intention there is as much and broad access as possible and as rapidly as possible. And I think that value proposition is stunning compared to competitive offerings and I think that's going to be making it strong. We are in discussions with payers and we're in discussion with payers about that value proposition and I believe that will all go very well.","I know that's not as much detail as you'd like to have, but it's as much I'm willing to share at this point because right now I would tell you we expect a good strong out of the block performance like you described and beyond that. I mean right now, Mike we're adding about 50,000 patients a quarter and that's across a continent that we had to go at one country at a time, one reimbursement system at a time. Of course the US is quite large, and Japan and UK as additions to this are also quite large. So I mean, we have a fair amount of optimism and trying not to get too far ahead of ourselves.","Mike Weinstein","And obviously I've a lot more questions, but I'll let someone else jump in. Thank you Miles.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matt Taylor","First thing I wanted to ask about was, certainly it was encouraging that you got MRI-conditional labelling for your ICD in the quarter, so just hoping we could get an update on how things are going in Sylmar and then when we might expect the approval for CRT-D and maybe the ICM as well.","Miles White","Yes, I'd say a couple things Matt. First of all let me back up and give a bigger context to this. Over the course of the year, there was a lot of scepticism on the part of analyst end or investors about all the things that we had to get accomplished, that were back end loaded. A lot of third quarter, fourth quarter things and depending on how you're looking at it, it looks pretty daunting and we all know everything doesn't go right. And the Sylmar inspection put some of that in doubt. Now having said that, we stuck to our guns on what our estimates were and our projections were about when we would get product approvals and claim approvals, licensure approvals and so forth. And the third quarter alone here has been pretty gratifying in that.","We basically got every approval we forecasted and let's call it, within 30 days or so of what we forecasted and I think that's been pretty gratifying, that what we said is what happened and that includes Libre, that includes the high voltage MRI claim, that includes HeartMate, it includes the closure of Alere, it includes Libre, it includes lot of things. I don't generally like being backend loaded because it feels like a lot of risk that everything has to go right, but everything did.","And our progress with Sylmar is no exception as I've indicated on prior calls. Our team that has been working with the Sylmar team and so forth has done an exceptional job that we have provided all information, taken all actions, done all remediation, everything basically done on time, delivered to FDA, discussed with FDA etc. And at this point and we're just experiencing those new systems populating with new experience, new data, new decision making etc. and all of that is going exactly as planned, exactly as forecasted, exactly as communicated with the FDA and thus far without a hiccup and I think that's recognized by the FDA. I think it's recognized, they have discretion, they don't have to license new products out of that facility, but they have.","And I think that is evidence of how we're progressing with Sylmar and the fact that the FDA is giving it all the scrutiny that they would and should and what we've submitted to them for approval has been given fair and objective consideration and we've gotten our approval so far. With that said, the remaining ones, I'm not going to change my estimates on. I'm not going to change what we forecasted. I have no reason to believe otherwise. They clearly have the discretion not to, but that's not been our experience and so consequently I remain optimistically that we're on track that we'll deliver what we said.","Matt Taylor","Thanks. And I wanted to turn to another thing that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. On China you said you were preparing for these regulations to change the Nutrition in the New Year and did improve a little bit sequentially. Could you talk about, what kind of opportunity you could have in China, if that comes to pass on time with regards to being able to maybe soak up some of the capacity that gets lost at local players have to shut down or change their operations.","Miles White","Well I'll tell you what, I'm not sure. I would tell you this. First of all, we have product approvals we need. We're ready for the transition. Building inventory for such etc. So as far as responding to the new law and I think this is true for at least the large multinational competitors. I think most of us, if not all of us have our product approvals. We are ready for the transition etc. How we all manage that, who knows. But I think at least we are and I think others are, ready with new approved replacement products etc. as we've been required to do. So I think we're all ready for the transition on January 1. What you can't know very well, at least about everybody else is how much inventory everybody has in various channels? How long that transition will take for any given competitor and so forth.","We are comfortable with our inventory levels were comfortable with our inventory levels both on current product and post January 1 product. So we're comfortable what we think we have to do with our own transition. What's hard to project is not just multinationals, but all the hundreds of other Chinese competitors that are faced with the same regulation. So I'd say we've seen a stabilizing of China, it hasn't been as choppy as it was in the last two years. I'd say our estimates around market growth are hard to pin down. We were more conservative on market growth than recent data we've seen. The market growth is better than we indicated or better than we believed or better than we thought and we're looking pretty closely at all the sources of our market data because there are many and they're not all perfectly comprehensive across all channels and then all sources of products or even all geography, so it's a hard win.","China is a particularly difficult one to pin down because there are a number of channels, there are a lot of competitors, there are a lot of data sources, it's not like going to AC Nielsen in the US or something. So I'm cautious about it. I think we've seen the tough part and I think we're going back into a phase where it's the same kind of hand-to-hand competition, we've always had across multiple channels, I like that. I think that's better because at least then whether we do well or don't do well is a function of our execution, I haven't been particularly pleased with our execution and I don't exclude a number of other countries where we do see soft market conditions, but I also see less than great execution on our part. So this business is getting a lot of attention from us and from all of us top to bottom and it will get some attention. I think it's probably the one soft spot in our release. That make a lot of things you know are going awfully well as I just commented to you in the device area. But this one is going to get a lot more attention. I feel that China is at least reasonably stable or predictable. We haven't been right about the market growth rates. Those looked better than we expected, so that's a plus and I guess I would just leave it at there.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thanks Miles.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","So first, I just wanted to clarify something now as you said on Alere. Obviously I heard you that the accretion for 2018 will be lower than you originally thought, that's not surprising. But I just wanted to confirm, do you still think it will be accretive in 2018 and is roughly half the original accretion reasonable placeholder?","Miles White","Yes, I expect it to be accretive. We've got a lot of work to do, to identify our synergies and identify growth opportunities. We're going through reorganization of the business right now and I think that's actually going to be a plus. I don't want to describe how it was organized because I think that's kind of waste of time and it will take a long time, but we went through a restructuring of the old structure of St. Jude and we did it within six months and as you know organized in integrated business units that I'd say organization is still kind of setting, the glue is still kind of setting, but we move to within six months that might have been aggressive but the organization is very stable. The restructuring activities that we had to go through and a lot of synergizing as far as people go, we've gone through, changes and management we've gone through etc., that all got done. But about the six month level at St. Jude it all got done in Alere in six days. So that's a running start.","And we've announced what we're moving to, I think it's an organization like all organizations all people want to do well. They want to achieve, they want to grow, they want to be proud of the businesses they're running, they want to do well and I'd say, our early days with the employees of Alere have been positive and we announced that we're going to go to that kind of structure, we've announced how we're going to do it, why we're going to do it etc. and I think that's well received at this point. So as far as we look into 2018, I think your question about was half of that, a good placeholder. I'd say, yes it's a good placeholder. I can't tell you with any precision that that's what it will be, but I think it's a good placeholder.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then I'm sure there will be a lot of other questions on Libre but I want to focus on the rest of pipeline for a second because there are number of other things in addition to Libre that could help in 2018 and you touched on the MRI safe approvals, but I just wanted to kind of ask specifically on some of the other things that you've got in the pipeline and just to make sure that the timelines and your thoughts on those, haven't changed at all, relative to what you've been saying previously. And so, that would include things like the new stents that you've talked about Sierra that [ph] Confirm implantable cardiac monitor that's entering what is a very attractive market and so I'm just curious on those couple of things, the timeline is still the same as what you've been saying previously.","Miles White","Well couple of things, first of all with regard to Sierra the same schedule, no change that will be first quarter of the year, we think. And with regard to Confirm, it's partly approved already. As you may understand it gets approved in pieces and so far, so good. There are some peripheral pieces we're waiting for approval on, but the first and very critical portion of that is approved. So yes I think that's - so far everything we've seen is very encouraging and no change.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, so Confirm can be a full launch in 2018?","Miles White","Well right now, that's what I bet on.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. That's all I had.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Miles, just after a solid quarter again coming out in the 2017 to the upper end of the range. I know it's early on to put all these pieces together in 2018, but as I reflect on it. And 2018 was multiple large new product opportunities launching St. Jude, Alere working shouldn't we expect at least similar topline growth and potentially better, if not accelerating topline growth against especially when you think about some of the headwinds you've faced in and worked through 2017, is the right way to think about it?","Miles White","I'm trying to think about how to sound conservative to you. Look, we got our acquisitions closed. We're going to have a number of product approvals that happened in the third quarter and fourth quarter that obviously should hit their stride. I mean ideally you look at 2018 and you'd like to have your product approvals exactly where we got them, going into next year. We've had a really good 2017, we beat all expectations not just in the numbers, but in the approvals. You all have to admit you had a lot of scepticism about some of this and maybe rightly so after 2016, but look we hit every target, we had for this and with all those approvals, one ought to think that, should bode positively for 2018. That said, when we go through our budgeting every year it's kind of negotiating tussle with our managers around the world, about what's possible in their given market and so forth. But I think we ought to have pretty good momentum going into 2018","What can I say, all the organic R&D projects and system projects and launches and approvals and so forth, they're all happening. And the Alinity products probably most miraculously five of those began their launch process in Europe and they'll start in the US next year, that's been a huge, huge undertaking, we're extremely excited about Libre, we're excited about all the medical device products, everything that St. Jude represented to Abbott about its pipeline has come to fruition and is coming to fruition and so, we're very, very bullish about all that. And I think we're - and I think there is an awful lot of validation in this about that acquisition. We don't know as much about Alere yet, but we will. And whether it's a big impact for 2018 or if it's beyond 2018, either way I think we're pretty happy to have that business. So you know Rick, I think your assessment is right. It'd be kind of hard for me to say, no it's going to be a tough year.","Rick Wise","Miles, that's a great answer and I'll take it. Another big picture reflection. One of the concern is obviously with two major acquisitions was balance sheet, cash flow, but my sense is in the first half at least you ran ahead of your cash flow generation commitments and goals. Maybe, can you give us any feeling how the third quarter went, remind us where your targets in terms of leverage and just again as we think about next six, 12 months or where do you think you can, where do you think you'll be from leverage and cash position? Thank you. Any color would be welcome.","Miles White","Okay, well first I'd tell you that, this got great leadership and attention from our CFO and our EVP's and SVP's from day one and I'm going to let him answer that question because they've exceeded all of our targets not just by a little, but a lot. The cash flow is strong and I'll let him tell you that.","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Miles. Rick, we continue to make great progress in our programs. If you recall, I talked about operating cash flow being around $4.5 billion for the full year. I won't quote you an exact number for Q3, but I think you'll safely assume that when you see the quarter filed, that we're well on track to that and I will say ahead of it. So we're going to continue to make that progress. As you talk about some of the ratios, I think it's important to keep in mind both debt and net debt. So at the end of the year, we projected a debt to EBITDA ratio of around four, however when you look at the cash flow programs and look at our net debt position, we'll be closer to three when you look at the net debt as a ratio to EBITDA. So we're in great shape and we want to keep the momentum going because this is number one priority to build back strategic flexibility here.","Miles White","I think [indiscernible] commercial out there. This all gets even better if there is tax reforms. I'm hopeful. I wouldn't put odds on any more than anybody else watching our government but we're extremely hopeful of the territorial system that and it gives us access to our cash flows and earnings around the world at a reasonable rate and at a competitive rate and that does make it difference to us, in addressing current debt and cash flow, but cash flow itself, super good.","Rick Wise","Appreciated. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","I just had two. One it was noteworthy that you didn't mention the impact from the weather. You still had a strong quarter despite the weather. I imagined it had to have to some impact. So is there any color, you can provide and I have one follow-up.","Miles White","Yes it did. I would comment a couple of things. First of all, it was a strange quarter for us in that, multiple hurricanes whether in the Texas Gulf Coast or across the Puerto Rico impacted, anybody who had operations there. The earthquake in Mexico impacted us. The brush fires and forced fires in California actually impacted us the day after we closed Alere had a key Alere facility there. And to be honest, it was more impact on our employees than on our plant operations. We had a little bit of roof damage and a little water leakage here and there, but it would appear the hurricane effected different companies, different ways going across Puerto Rico because I've noted that some competitors have indicated more damage or more impact than we've experienced. It took up a super human effort by a lot of our people to try to address some of that, which we did. The biggest issue was access to power generation in Puerto Rico and our folks address that really rapidly and we're very happy about that.","Our plants, I guess back up and running, is the right way to say it. There is one that we're starting this week and we're back up, is what it amounts to. And so there is - I would call it a modest impact, it affected us, I'd say in a modest level, not a material level. Our first priority was to find all of our people and aid them, which we've done. And so in Puerto Rico, we have not experienced the kind of disruption that some others have. I noted that, another large healthcare company yesterday I think had similar comments that they've been able to address it. We're kind of large in Puerto Rico, so it could have been worse, but it wasn't and the St. Jude facilities that we inherited there with the acquisition. St. Jude were not particularly impacted, I mean they were but not to the degree we might have expected I mean everything is been more about power generation than damage.","And unfortunately that's not true for our employees and it's not true for some other competitors and I wouldn't wish that on anybody. But we've been pretty fortunate to get everything back up and running. So we don't have an impact to report for the fourth quarter that we haven't somehow managed or absorbed already in our estimates. The facility that was threatened in California was not damaged. We were able to move things out of that facility and prepare for damage, but there wasn't damage and so we'll be back up and running soon, we did have employees who unfortunately lost homes and so forth and we're dealing with that as a company. But from the standpoint of the operation of the business, we are in good shape relatively speaking and to the extent that there is any impact, we've already included in our estimates for this quarter and absorbed it.","Larry Biegelsen","That's good to hear. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about with management. That's the one business where if you improve that dramatically that really impact positively your growth. So I'm just curious what your expectations are for that business going forward, could it be potentially flat in 2018 and just a few to clarify at Confirm or X [ph] is going to be booked in that line or not? Thanks for taking the questions.","Miles White","Okay, I'm going to have Scott answer that one for you.","Scott Leinenweber","As you know on the MRI safe [ph] side, we continue to see good progress on the pacemaker. We received approval for the ICD very late in the quarter, so that certainly didn't have an impact this quarter here and the third quarter. But we do expect to have an positive impact in the fourth quarter. So yes I do think you'll see a nice step up in growth starting quite frankly next quarter and then as we move into 2018.","Miles White","It's gratifying that our experience with the pacemaker has matched our experience in Japan and Europe with the MRI approvals in terms of share recovery and so forth. So I think that bodes well for the ICD as well.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glen Novarro","Miles, you guys are doing a great job in terms of cash flow generation, you're going to get to your targets faster for 2018, but it sounds from Brian's commentary that 2018 is not going to be any type of deal here. It's going to be more about paying down debt, is that a fair assumption? Or do you actually have more flexibility there. If something does pop up, that's really interesting that you can do it next year. That and just some housekeeping questions after that.","Miles White","Well let me answer it, this way. I don't really want the organization focused on M&A right now. I think I would give you that answer regardless of what Brian said about debt and cash flow and so forth. And secondly, I wouldn't forecast it even if I had it in my gun sights. Most of the - my experience with you guys over the past 19 years has been you liked to have some indication on what's coming, usually that surprised you more acquisitions or other things that we've done that hasn't always been particularly well received but they've always turned out pretty well, but I generally don't like the forecast where we're going or what we're doing until we announce it and so I probably wouldn't tell you anyway.","Glen Novarro","But is there some powder [ph] for next year or is next year really let's focus on St. Jude, let's focus on Alere, before we think about anything else.","Miles White","Honestly I think there is focus on St. Jude and Alere and right now that is paying off. Look the focus on St. Jude it's clearly paying off, the focus on Alere will pay off. The focus on the internal product launches of Alinity and so forth, these things will pay off. These are fundamental drivers of sustained growth. I mean it's the hallmark and the identity of the company is sustained growth and we target double-digit earnings growth every single year, your organic performance both in terms of R&D, pipeline, commercial performance etc. has to be sustainable that is where the focus is, and we've acquired a couple of businesses that initially were criticized that's not growth and I beg to differ and I think that we're demonstrating so far with St. Jude that there is a terrific pipeline and growth and share gain, etc. and I think you can see that. You can see that in the initial couple of quarters here, so yes I think there is going to be a lot of focus on not just St. Jude and Alere, but the fundamental organic performance of all of our businesses. You know it took a while for analysts and investors to appreciate the uniqueness of our strategy in established pharma and I think it sort of called out that there is a segment of pharma that's not commodity generic, that's branded generic, that's higher margin, higher growth, etc. in pretty key markets around the world and right now that's our fastest growing business other than neuromod. And neuromod's hard to touch, but we're growing that business at double digits. The team is doing a terrific job. Those markets represent the kind of opportunity we said they did and those kinds of growths from an operating standpoint growth rates out of the business that's what you want.","So to some point if we can add to our footprint and add to our strategies, we want to be in a flexible position to do that. We obviously want to get to a position where we have the strategic flexibility that we always felt we had, so I don't think it's a bad idea for us to focus on the operations. Keep pushing our cash flow, keep pushing that debt down. So that's where the focus will be next year and I think we get ourselves back to strategic flexibility quicker that way, which is a good thing.","Glen Novarro","Yes. Okay and then just I agree with everything you said, just some housekeeping. Maybe for Scott. You said Portico you finished in ruling next to US trial, would that put you on pace for 2019 US launch. And then I think you talked about Mitro [ph] which is the Tendyne program and I think you said you started enrolling, is that enrolling in the European trial and then is there an update on the start of the US trial? Thanks.","Miles White","I'm going let Scott answer that.","Scott Leinenweber","Sure, Glen. On Portico, we would expect to file in the US in the first quarter of 2019 to your question, so then you have the regulatory process after that. With respect to the Tendyne in Europe, we expect to complete enrolment here in the first quarter. It's a one-year endpoint so you can kind of do the math after that, but we're in the 2020 range or so on approval on the Tendyne product. Really great opportunity though, really it's structural hard portfolio here in totality is really come together what Abbott brought - almost St. Jude brought [indiscernible] so we're excited about it, longer term.","Miles White","It's a really good to know, that's one that came out of our own venture group from our own investments and so forth and we've been able to combine these things, with St. Jude in a way I think is pretty synergistic, pretty favorable so we're pretty excited about that one.","Glen Novarro","Any update on when you start the US trial for Tendyne?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, we could initiate US trial here in 2018.","Glen Novarro","Okay, great. Thank you.","Scott Leinenweber","Okay, thanks. Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Miles, I thought I'd end on couple of questions on growth, I guess I'm little surprised that neuromodulation has not come up in this call, given it's been biggest growth driver for St. Jude this year, 50% growth through the first three quarters. I think every single quarter we expect that growth rate to come in a little bit. It's been extremely durable across the three quarters. Can you just give us a sense of factors that are driving that growth and sort of how you think about the sustainability of that growth in due 2018? And I have a follow-up after that.","Miles White","I mean I think anybody that claimed 50% growth rate was sustainable will be an idiot, but so I'm not going to be one. Look we're very pleased with the performance in Neuromod. I think it's obviously driven by the fact, we've got three great products there. They're being exceptionally well received by the market. They have an impact in real life on patients in their P&L levels. We're seeing great with real world results from Burst and DRG. I think it's a really great group of products and a strong organization. I think the products hit a segment that's in kind need of improvements for patients and particularly the time when pain drugs and so forth are a national issue. So I don't know, I think the new products are driving the growth and the execution is been strong, the uptick is been strong. We've got three quarters in a row, 50% better growth. How long will it be like that? [Indiscernible] lap it, with all big numbers we'll start to diminish the growth rate, but the actual raw growth will still be pretty strong, so I don't know, I like what we see but it's hard for me to hold it up with an example to all the other business, so you should do this.","David Lewis","Sure, very clear. And then I think Brian or Scott just to wrap up here. Into the fourth quarter because I think you can set the tone for investors as we think about next year's growth rate. You're certainly guiding to sequential acceleration sort of mid-to-high. Can you just kind of run through kind of sequentially what are those key components that get that acceleration because as I said, I think it sets the tone for 2018? Thanks so much.","Brian Yoor","I'll take this. I think it's just - Miles had talked about the continued growth of brand and generics business, it's been performing at a double-digit range. I think you should expect more of the same there. If we look in diagnostics just sustained what you're doing, we do expect improvement at that business overtime as we continue rollout out our Alinity platforms across the globe. Diabetes care you know that story, it's growing very strong and we're excited to bring that here to the US. And most notably, I mentioned this in my guidance on the medical device side, that's where the step up is, where I talked about the mid-to-high single-digit and Scott caught a broad color to that, by saying you should expect further sequential improvement on the CLI side of the business because we've always said the magic formula is just bring that back to flat and the double-digit growth of all these high growth areas will shine through and deliver 5% or 6% on our medical device business. Those are really the key catalysts here, so we look forward to have good fourth quarter here.","David Lewis","Okay, thanks so much.","Scott Leinenweber","Very good.

Welcome to Abbott\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.","Scott Leinenweber","Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","Please note that second quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Thank you, Scott. Good morning.","Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.82, above our previous guidance range and reflecting double-digit growth. Sales increased 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter with all four businesses exceeding expectations. I'm particularly pleased with our ability to consistently achieve these types of strong results. Over the past two years, our quarterly organic sales growth has averaged more than 7%. And importantly, we're well positioned with our portfolio and new product pipeline for this type of strong growth going forward.","Based on our performance and momentum in the first half of the year, we're raising our full-year outlook and we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of $3.21 to $3.27, reflecting nearly 13% growth at the midpoint on a reported basis, and even faster growth when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. While we achieved broad-based growth across several areas of our portfolio, I'd like to highlight just a few areas where we continue to perform exceptionally well.","I'll start our medical devices business with FreeStyle Libre, where we achieved sales of $430 million and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth of more than 70% in the quarter. We also continued to make excellent progress expanding reimbursement and access in the U.S. where Libre is now reimbursed for approximately 75% of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance.","Libre offers a unique value proposition and that\u2019s by design. It provides great clinical benefits and we priced it to ensure affordability. Payers recognize that value and are increasingly providing reimbursement coverage for Libre, which helps lower out of pocket cost even further for patients.","As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we\u2019ve been investing significantly to expand our manufacturing capacity for Libre to meet demand. The first wave of that expansion will come online in the next couple of months followed by cadence of incremental capacity after that. There\u2019s a massive population that needs help managing their diabetes and our intent is to make Libre broadly accessible to all of them.","Turning to our Structural Heart business where we achieved mid-teens growth. This was led by MitraClip, our market leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, which had global sales growth of more than 30% in the quarter. And MitraClip grew more than 50% in the U.S. where we recently received the new expanded indication.","Earlier this week, we announced U.S. approval of our fourth generation MitraClip device, which builds on this leading platform with enhanced features and new clip sizes, providing physicians further options when treating the disease.","We\u2019ve been building our position in Structural Heart for more than a decade and have a deep pipeline of technologies and development including Tendyne and Cephea, which are minimally invasive devices to replace faulty mitral heart valves. TriClip, a first of its kind of device for the repair of a leaky tricuspid heart valve, and Amplatzer Amulet, our left atrial appendage device to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.","With the rapid adoption of MitraClip in a highly underpenetrated market as well as a pipeline of technologies targeting new growth areas that we\u2019ll launch over the next several years, our Structural Heart business is well positioned for strong, steady growth for years to come.","Next diagnostics, where we remain focused on the global rollout of our Alinity suite of instruments for every area of diagnostics in which we compete. We\u2019re making great progress with our systems for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing in Europe where the launch of Alinity is helping to drive double-digit growth in our international Core Laboratory business. We\u2019re now also in the early stages of launching Alinity instruments for hematology and molecular testing in Europe.","In the U.S., we\u2019re making steady progress, achieving regulatory approvals for our broad menu of core laboratory tests. And just last week, we announced FDA approval of Alinity S for blood and plasma screening. Abbott screens the majority of the world\u2019s blood supply. And this system is designed to be faster and more efficient within a smaller amount of space while maintaining the highest levels of accuracy. The global rollout of Alinity is an ambitious undertaking that positions our diagnostics business for sustainable, strong growth going forward.","So, in summary, all four of our businesses exceeded expectations in the quarter. Our growth is strong, it\u2019s accelerating and it\u2019s sustainable. We\u2019ve strategically positioned ourselves in some of the most attractive areas of healthcare, and our key growth platforms are delivering impressive results. And today, we\u2019re adding to what was already a strong growth forecast by raising our outlook for the year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Miles.","As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 7.5%. Sales in Medical Devices grew 10.5% with double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care.","In nutrition, sales increased 5.1%, led by strong growth in Adult Nutrition. Sales in Established Pharmaceuticals grew 6.1% with 8% growth in our key emerging markets. And sales increased 6.2% in diagnostics, led by high single-digit growth in Core Laboratory Diagnostics and sequential improvements in Point of Care and Rapid Diagnostics.","Exchange had an unfavorable impact on total Abbott sales of 4.6%, which was approximately 0.5% more unfavorable to our expectations at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.9% of sales.","The second quarter adjusted tax rate was 13.7%, lower than our previous full-year guidance of around 15%, due entirely to continued implementation of and adaptation to the U.S. tax reform regulations. Our second quarter tax rate reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2019 with our revised full-year effective tax rate forecast of 14.5%.","Turning to our outlook for the full-year. We now forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 3% on our full-year reported sales, which is in line with the expected impact we had at the beginning of the year. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales for the full-year. This is modestly lower than our prior forecast and reflects the temporary effects of investments to support the unprecedented ramp-up and market adoption of our Alinity diagnostic systems as well as investments in Libre capacity expansion.","We forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat less than 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29.5% of sales. And as I mentioned previously, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 14.5% for the full-year 2019.","Turning to our outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.85, which reflects strong double-digit growth. We forecast organic sales growth of 7% to 8% and at current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 1.5% on our third quarter reported sales.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of a little less than 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of around 29% of sales.","Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our third quarter organic sales growth outlook by business.","For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid to high single-digit growth; in Nutrition, we forecast mid single-digit growth; in Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott\u2019s legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of Core Laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care to grow high single digits and in Rapid Diagnostics, we forecast low to mid single-digit growth. And finally in Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit growth, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Congrats on the quarter and the guide. Miles, I have two questions for you, the first on diabetes, second on the outlook for the year. So, just starting with diabetes. ADA, Miles, [ushered] [ph] in some concerns around Libre 2 iCGM designation. Should investors read anything into the lack of approval? And what's your confidence level in iCGM approval? And what does the trend in BGM this particular quarter tell us about the Libre adoption?","Miles White","I'm going to give a couple of answers. So one, no, we shouldn't have concern. We're confident that we're going to have the approval what we expect and what we applied for. So, I know that there's always uncertainty until the day comes and questions from investors that know we\u2019re confident. And actually, let me ask, our COO to give you a little bit of more background and detail on that.","Robert Ford","Yes. I mean, we filed as an iCGM. We made that comment in our last earnings. And we filed this as an iCGM. The standards and special controls for the iCGM, they\u2019re very clear, and they're very transparent as it relates to accuracy thresholds, alarms, sensor shutoffs, et cetera. And we wouldn't have filed an iCGM, if we felt that we\u2019re going to fall short of those special controls. In fact, we were encouraged by the agency to file Libre 2 as an iCGM. So, I know, people want to speculate and kind of tie it to the exact date. We're not behind our timelines. So, we're not going to expect speculate on exact date here, but we expect it relatively soon. ","David Lewis","And then, the second thing Miles for you is just guidance for the year. So, the guidance range suggests, you obviously see 2019 as a year of acceleration over \u201818. I'm just really curious, what gets better into the second half of the year? And if you think about the middle part of the range versus the upper part of the range, what are the key success factors in the back half that gets you to that top end of the range? Thanks so much.","Miles White","Well, I'd say couple of things, first of all about the guidance. We are seeing strength in our growth drivers. We've got a lot of launches going on in all segments across the board. We're going to be opening up the capacity and new manufacturing and so forth to supplement Libre; the Alinity systems are obviously successfully rolling out; MitraClip is picking up momentum. A lot of the businesses that I've been sort of chronically dissatisfied with from time-to-time, have also in sequential improvement, which I'm happy to see. I'm never quite satisfied with that. But, the pharmaceutical business, the cardiac rhythm management business, the stent business, neuromodulation, the point of care diagnostics business, the rapid diagnostics business, which is primarily the Alere acquisition, they're all showing sequential sales growth improvement, which is what we planned, what we've worked for, et cetera.","So, based on the strength across the board of all that, we feel comfortable that frankly, our growth rate on the top-line going forward, we sort of see in that 7% to 8% range. And I challenged the team, I said, is this temporary for the quarter, the half year thing or do we feel fairly sustainable about this, and we feel sustainable about it. So, I think, that\u2019s all good, and then, with record earnings. There\u2019s a step up in earnings here in the second half earnings growth rate. And it\u2019s just unusual quarter. I mean, we always target, as you know at the beginning of the year double-digit growth. We always set kind of an aggressive or at least ambitious target for ourselves going into the next year. That\u2019s no different now. So, in the second half, our earnings remain strong.","I don\u2019t know -- I\u2019m kind of -- I feel pretty good that we do the numbers we say and we never fall short. So, it\u2019s 18% on the bottom-line right now. So, you\u2019re asking me about what do we do to get the high end of the range? I\u2019m thinking, geez, isn\u2019t that good enough. It\u2019s a pretty healthy growth rate. So, 7 to 8 on the top and high double-digit teens on the bottom I think is probably best in class in the peer group that we\u2019re compared to and several different peer groups that we\u2019re compared to. And quite frankly, with the breadth of products launching and rollouts, obviously there\u2019s always challenges somewhere in the world in some way, but we seem to be doing pretty well across the board here in all areas. And I think that\u2019s a pretty good investment.","David Lewis","Great. Well said. Thanks so much. Congrats again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Robbie Marcus","Great and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe two product questions for you. I want to hit on MitraClip and Alinity. Maybe you could comment on the status of CMS reimbursement in MitraClip. It doesn\u2019t seem to have hindered your growth at all in the quarter. But maybe just give us some update on the timelines and then maybe some considerations for the trend line of uptake going forward there, once you do get approval?","Miles White","Okay. I'm going to have Robert answer that question for you, and I\u2019ll come back to Alinity.","Robert Ford","So, Robbie, so, you saw, we had a great quarter in MitraClip global sales over 30%, really driven by U.S. over 50%. The majority of that growth in U.S. will be coming through increased productivity in the existing accounts. So, we -- obviously, we\u2019re constantly doing market development, opening new accounts but majority of that growth coming through increased utilization. So, we continue to invest in clinical and field sales expansion. And when you do this, they have this direct impact in account utilization and productivity. International was up also double-digits in the quarter. You\u2019ve got Japan where we believe there is a significant opportunity for us long-term there where we\u2019re building our capabilities in Japan and Europe saw a rebound in Q2 versus where we were in Q1. I think, the teams there, the clinical and medical teams have done a really good job at putting into context and framing some of those conflicting trials that came out in the second half of the year. So, we think there\u2019s a lot of sustainability here, not only in the U.S., I mean, our penetration rates here in terms of the opportunity are still kind of low single-digit. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of runway here.","Regarding your question on CMS, I mean, there\u2019s obviously a lot of coordination that\u2019s been going on between CMS and the physician societies. We expect the NCD to be opened up very soon as part of that coordination. As I say, I\u2019m not going to forecast the exact timeline here. But, we anticipate getting through the process around year-end early next year. As you said, the process hasn\u2019t really kind of impeded our growth. We have seen a dozen or so flight of commercial insurance companies already reflect updates to their decision -- to their coverage to include the new indication. Obviously, the larger segment there is the Medicare segment. But it\u2019s good to kind of see that traction in the private segment. So, very good quarter, we continue to see this expansion in the second half of the year and towards the end of the year, looking at achieving CMS reimbursement.","Robbie Marcus","Great. And then, following up on Alinity, this is one, it hits all of your different product lines and diagnostics. So, it\u2019s hard to really pick out. But, maybe you could just give us a status update on the progress of the launch in Europe and the just starting launch in the U.S. And maybe any competitive data points you could give us, we see some of your competitors struggling, both on the top line and the margin side as it relates to competitive systems. Anything you are seeing out in the market that could be useful? I appreciate it.","Miles White","Well, so first, you made the comment that it touches every part of diagnostics, that\u2019s true. And these are six different systems, the immunoassay system, the clinical chemistry system, obviously a smaller point of care system for that market, there is a dedicated blood and plasma screening system and then of course hematology and molecular. And they are all at various stages of rollout. The one that is the furthest along would be the rollout of our immunoassay and clinical chemistry systems in the core laboratories of Europe. We're also in the process of expanding menu approvals in United States and China and Southeast Asia, where customers want to have a certain critical mass of menu as they make the conversion from whatever they are using to these new Alinity systems.","So, I\u2019d say, we're running as fast as we can, I think at this point in Europe, and that\u2019s going pretty well. There is over 3,000 systems placed now, running test, generating revenue, et cetera. We do measure not just the deal, the close of the deal et cetera, we measure what we call test of record when the account is up and running, generating results, generating tests et cetera. And so, I\u2019d say, that process is going well. That\u2019s going to begin the pick up more momentum in the United States as we're getting more and more menu breadth, same with China, we're tracking all of that pretty closely as we build those menus. We're talking hundreds of tests.","We did recently get approval for the Alinity, as the blood and plasma screening system. Today, we screen about 80% of the world\u2019s blood supply as it is. This is -- it\u2019s an important transition product that labs I think will find more efficient, more economic et cetera. But that\u2019s a plus. We closed and started up with Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization, and we took that from a longstanding Japanese competitor. So, that was a big win for us.","So, there is just a lot of success that way. Hematology is in the very early stages of rolling out, the molecular system in the earlier stage of rolling out and -- which is why this will be I guess a slower moving launch that\u2019s got sort of years of growth and momentum in it, as we look over the next, call it five to seven years to completely replace an existing installed base and add a lot of new share, new volume. And to that end, I think we\u2019ve quoted you before and remains true, in accounts where we already have the business, we're winning about 95% of the time; and in accounts where we do not have the business and there is an entrenched competitor of ours, we're winning about 60% of the time. Those win rates and penetration rates and share gains and so forth in our experience so far over now what I said is over 3,000 instruments, tell us that we\u2019ve got a very competitive system. We do run into, on the occasional accounts, heavy duty price cutting. We've got a very-disciplined system of our pricing and contracting in accounts. We have not had to do that. I think that speaks to the superiority of the instrument and assay offering. So, we're feeling like our offering is uniquely competitive. It\u2019s borne out by the win rates, no matter what type of account. It's unprecedented to launch this many systems across the board in all areas. So, I think this only picks up momentum and gets better as the assay menu expands and as there's some experience in the field with the analyzers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Bob Hopkins","Just two quick questions, one for Miles and a big picture and then one quick financial question, if okay. Miles, if okay, I want to ask a question on the management team additions that you announced recently. Congrats on hiring Lisa to run devices. I guess, my question is, when Robert was promoted as COO, back in October of last year, Abbott said that Robert would keep devices. So, just wondering if you could comment on kind of the reasons for the change. What Robert will do with all his newfound free time? And investors are always curious about your long-term plans. So, it's a question on the recent hire.","Miles White","Okay. Well, I can tell you, he\u2019s not playing golf. I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we anticipated that for the time being, we wanted him to stay directly on top of the medical device business because he's been responsible for bringing on-board St. Jude. As we acquired that, he was integral to that entire integration. We went through with St. Jude, a reorganization of the business to align with the way we like to run a business at Abbott. And I guess, I would describe that as we like to have a fully integrated business, meaning the general manager of that business, president of that business has responsibility for commercial -- the commercial people, commercial sales, customers, et cetera, but also manufacturing R&D, technical support, service, et cetera. We like all those functions reporting to one GM. So, we realigned St. Jude. We did the same with Alere quite frankly, when we took them over. And so, each of the business has full integrated general management responsibility, and that was a transition. And Robert led that. It's all in place. That meant that we added a number of experienced general managers, we replaced some who had left us as part of the St. Jude or earlier acquisitions and so forth. So, we went through a management transition.","And at the same time, there's been a little bit of a general regional change happening here. Quite certainly, there have been an awful lot of people that have been part of my management team for a long time, and a lot of our managers are long term Abbott groomed and grown management teams. But we've also been thinking about making sure that with all the growth we've got, the new products, the new organization and the new structure of that organization, that we're always looking at the talent and the experience of our management team as we look forward now toward, let\u2019s just call it, a decade of what I think is going to be pretty robust growth.","So, in that, we needed to replace the EVP role that Robert had held previous to the Chief Operating Officer role. We did that. We went outside for that and of course sourced Lisa, who we think has a terrific background and experience for that. We're very pleased to have brought fresh perspective and great experience and great energy level into the company. So, we\u2019re very pleased with that. We went through a little further, I\u2019d say organization change, to kind of break up what had gotten big and perhaps unwieldy in some cases into slightly smaller units, because we are managing some pretty aggressive growth, capital improvement, plant building et cetera in a number of these businesses including diagnostics. And to give us more focus around it, we\u2019ve done some of that adjusting. I feel like that\u2019s gone very smoothly and very well. Obviously, we read into Robert who\u2019s in his mid-40s moving up into the COO role that we expect him to be in a key leadership role at the Company for a long time, read between the lines.","And so, there\u2019s a preparation process going on. And I think one of the most important things I can do after leading the Company for so long is to make sure that when the transition comes, nobody knows this, and the best legacy to leave is that the momentum of this Company, its growth and its prospects are every bit as good going forward as we think they are now. And from my perspective, a smooth leadership transition which is not just me, it\u2019s literally right down through the upper ranks of all management is key and important. And I feel like of all the sort of track record, or legacies that I can give this company I think a transition that way is probably the most important of all. So, you can read into it that we\u2019re preparing for continuity of leadership, what I would call it with no speed bumps. And I think that actually is going exceptionally well. Will I give you a timeframe? No. Do I think we should be nervous about it? No. I think that this Company is poised to perform well across the board for years to come that I got great confidence in that continuity and the management team because we got a nice mix here of very experienced and trained Abbott people and people we brought from other companies from the outside like Lisa. And I think the mix we\u2019ve got in that team is exceptional. Robert\u2019s been with the Company over 20 years. I\u2019ve known him every bit of those 20 plus years. And I think he brings to his job right now tremendous experience, perspective, everything you would look for in a leader, in the COO of a company. So, from my perspective, I think this is nothing but good and just keeps getting better.","Bob Hopkins","Very, very helpful. Thank you so much, Miles. That\u2019s great perspective. And it just seems like an odd transition, but I do have a little question on the tax rate, just quickly for Brian. You guys have been doing a great job over the last couple of years of kind of slowly and steadily bringing the tax rate down. And I know you made comments on the year. But, maybe, if you could just talk bigger picture, is -- where are you in that process and are the current rates that we\u2019re seeing here today sustainable down here in the kind of lowish teens? Thank you.","Brian Yoor","Yes. Bob, we always set the tax rate to where we think it\u2019s sustainable. We don\u2019t like it to be bounced around; we want it to be steady. And we assess the rates as they come out. We have a series of rates come out just recently and digested those, we\u2019re always adapting to that and adapting to the situation to be as efficient as we can here. 14.5% is where I call the sustainable rate right now as we look forward. I will say and we can\u2019t predict the future but there\u2019s another series of clarity around rates that will come out in Q3. And when that happens, we will digest that and adapt accordingly as well. But as we sit here today, we\u2019re happy with the efficiency of our tax rate and continue to manage it for sustainability. And we just don\u2019t want to see it bumping around on you or us.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Your line is now open. ","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Congrats on a great quarter and thanks for the question. Miles, I was just wondering if you could just talk through your thinking on just the level of investments in the Company and just how you think about how much of this really impressive top-line you let flow through. And then also just from a capital allocation prospective, how you are just thinking about going forward with the Company, just given the growth dynamics that you have and\/or opportunities you could see to maybe strengthen some of the other business lines that maybe offer little bit more lackluster growth of the medical devices? Thanks.","Miles White","Well, I\u2019ll give you a couple of perspective. First of all, the great thing is, we\u2019ve got a lot of things to invest in. From a capital standpoint, obviously, it was important for us to pay down debt, we did. We paid down a significant amount, going on $10 billion at this point. And as we\u2019ve said before, we're in a comfortable position of strategic flexibility. But, that doesn\u2019t mean, we're dying to go use it. So, the next need was obviously we\u2019ve got some capital to put into plant and expansion. And we put a fair amount into both Diagnostics and Libre at this point. We're investing in expansion of plant manufacturing for MitraClip and other products. So, given that we\u2019ve got an awful lot of growth happening and the potential for more, obviously, we\u2019ve got to support that growth from a plant and capital standpoint in a timely fashion and appropriate quality and so forth, and we're doing that. And so, this capital use et cetera there. Will we continue to pay down debt? We will. We\u2019ll be prudent and careful about making sure it makes sense, it\u2019s the right debt, right time and all that good stuff. We will maintain a healthy, strong dividend. We increased it substantially at the end of last year; we will continue to grow our dividend. Given where the PE is now, I\u2019ve been told by a number of shareholders that trying to get that yield rate, upward dividend funds are happy as difficult, but that\u2019s a nice problem to have. We will continue to grow our dividend, it\u2019s been the hallmark of the Company for decades, and it will continue to be.","And then, it\u2019s not only that prudent to buy back shares, the timing matters, the return matters et cetera. Is it an option? Yes, it is. Probably won't get too carried away because frankly we're able to grow and return cash to shareholders a number of different ways and return -- good return to our shareholders. So, it\u2019s always an option as it presents itself, we just got a lot we can do.","If you're asking about M&A and other things, we don\u2019t feel like right now that we need something, nor do we think we see something that we can add sufficient value to, to make it worth it to invest in. And we\u2019ve got so many organic growth opportunities that while we continue to monitor and we're always tracking opportunities in all of our businesses, I can't tell you that that\u2019s real front runner right now. We don\u2019t ignore it, we don\u2019t -- we try to maintain our currency on the things that we might be interested in. We just did a small acquisition in Germany that\u2019s a nice adjunctive thing to our diagnostics business in terms of automation and so forth, things like that that I think are valuable for us. But, we have so much growth potential and opportunity in devices, diagnostics, even nutrition and pharma that we\u2019re just not outcut and real hard on M&A front right now, nor do I foresee that being through for quite a while.","So, that\u2019s the capital side. On the expense side, we're always trying to balance the voracious appetite of investors for growing earnings with investing in the growth of the business. And I doubt that there's a general manager or business at Abbott that wouldn't claim that if we gave them more money, they could spend it effectively and efficiently to grow our products faster. So, we're always trying to find the right balance of how much gas that\u2019s thrown in the fire of the growth of the products with returning a healthy return to the expectations of our investors. I think that's always a balance, because there's always some investor who thinks there is -- there must be an extra penny in the quarter. And I was speaking to somebody this morning who asked about that very issue, another penny. So, the issue here is much bigger than a penny. We've got tremendous growth, our top-line we\u2019re accelerating is strong, it\u2019s sustainable. This isn't about penny in a given quarter. This is about pretty healthy sales growth rate and a commensurate healthy growth rate on the bottom-line that's unusual in our sector, and particularly unusual for companies of our size to be able to sustain such a healthy growth rate with so much new products, richness for the coming years, and it's not coming quarter, it's coming year. So, you raise the right question is how do we keep investing in the spending and R&D and the sales and marketing expenses to drive that growth. And we're trying to find that right balance as well by putting enough fuel to fire here to drive the growth rates even higher.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Then, just one question on how do you view -- the medical device business growth was phenomenal this quarter. How do you just think about the ability to sustain that level of growth? It seems the Medical Devices has a bit of a tale of two cities with several businesses reporting really nice strong double-digit growth, but a couple of obvious businesses kind of still lagging around that flattish growth. How do you kind of think about the longer term dynamics there? Thanks so much for taking the questions.","Miles White","Yes. You've got a mix of businesses here. You've got some that are a little more mature than others, some that have brand new products that are terrific innovations. In general in medical devices innovation is what drives the growth. And over time, that's the case. And different businesses are at different stages of either maturity or new innovation.","We believe there's still a lot of opportunity there. I remember in my discussions with Dan Starks when we were negotiating over the acquisition of St. Jude, Dan felt pretty strongly that the pipeline at St. Jude was underappreciated and that in their own internal models that the growth rate was out there in the high single-digits. The street didn't agree with that at the time, because it didn't see it yet, et cetera. But Dan was right. And I think that we've seen that in the performance of the medical device business we acquired from St. Jude, because it's been performing at sort of a 9% to 10% level as new products have gone to the market, either replacing older products or just simply brand new products altogether.","So, I'd say, the first thing about medical devices is you got to keep innovating in new spaces, MitraClip\u2019s new space, Heart Failure and HeartMate and so forth. These are new spaces, new technologies, et cetera. Libre is that. Libre is unique. It approaches a mass market, not a niche market, most medical devices address niches of therapy. But diabetes is something that affects more than 80 million people around the world and would benefit from Libre in a about a 50-50 of type 1s and type 2s, and that is massive. It's unlike anything seen before in device or diagnostic businesses. And so, there's just an enormous, enormous opportunity there. To be honest, traditional medical device companies aren't used to having to deal with at that kind of scale. And so, we\u2019re addressing that by investing very heavily in manufacturing expansion so that we can go after the mass market, not a niche. And so, I think the sustainability of the growth is driven not only by the innovation but the ability to go after much bigger markets at a much more affordable level. More people will have access, there will be more growth as we make technologies and products more and more affordable.","And then, finally, you asked about some of the businesses that aren\u2019t growing that fast. And I\u2019d say well, I'm always disappointed that they\u2019re not growing as fast as we\u2019d like them to. But, I am pleased that we\u2019ve seen sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter in almost all of them. We\u2019ve seen that in CRM, we\u2019ve seen it in neuromod, we\u2019ve seen in it in even in EPD and stems and so forth. We\u2019re seeing incremental improvement. Some of these businesses as more mature businesses may not see strong, -- or high single-digit or double-digit growth, but I think they\u2019re still capable of pretty strong growth in the low to mid single-digit area and there\u2019s still lot of upside. If we take a CRM business from what is flat, slightly negative to 3% or 4%, that\u2019s a pretty big bump in growth. If it was going from 10 to 14, we\u2019d be all excited about it. So, the same incremental growth improvement I think is possible, it\u2019s just the lower level. So, I think that there is a lot here to sustain the kind of growth we\u2019re seeing. There\u2019s always going to be new products like Libre or MitraClip or a HeartMate that singularly for a period of time disproportionately drive the overall growth. One of the benefits of having many businesses in the device arena is there\u2019s always going to be somewhere that\u2019s growing that way in other places where we\u2019re innovating for the future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking the question. I\u2019d like to spend a little bit of time on nutrition, particularly international nutrition and the adult piece of that really did well in the quarter. Is there anything you can give us an update on that particular franchise?","Robert Ford","Yes. So, we had, as you noticed, sequential improvement in our nutrition business. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance. We continue to see kind of above market growth in several of the countries. We\u2019ve made a lot of enhancements and changes in people and strategies to enhance our competitiveness over the years, new products execution and we get to see that. We do think it is sustainable, we are executing well. We kind of see the market in that 3% to 4% range. So, we\u2019re always driving for something above that and you saw that again in this quarter with a 5% kind of growth and good execution in our adult business specifically coming out of Asia. ","Miles White","The OUS business, Joanne, was up little over 10% in the adult -- OUS adult business, and a lot of that is new product innovation, new formats, expansion in given markets like Vietnam and other places where we\u2019ve got pretty strong holds but also a lot of opportunity for further growth. So, we\u2019ve put a lot more attention on some of those. I\u2019d say, historically, in this business, the U.S. and China always get all the attention but there\u2019s a lot of opportunity. And as Robert said, Southeast Asian markets and others where there\u2019s a lot of growth, India and the like, and particularly in the adult segment.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. And as my second question, one of the \u201cproblem children\u201d in medical devices is in neuromodulation. Can you walk us through the pathway to the recovery in that? Thanks.","Miles White","Yes, sure. So, we saw an improvement in Q2. Obviously, that\u2019s not our landing spot, we\u2019re obviously not -- where we want to be, but an improvement there. We completed the sales force expansion that we\u2019ve been talking about. We increased the sales force by about 40%. And when you go through something like that, Joanne, there is some disruption that occurs in terms of cutting the territories and the trading et cetera. So, we\u2019ve completed that and now obviously the focus is improving the productivity of that sales team. And we saw that in the second quarter. If you look at some of the KPIs, if you look at whether it's trials or trial to permanent implant conversion rates, we saw definitely sequential improvement versus Q1, and we expect that to improve as we go into second half of this year. A big portion of this also is, I\u2019d say, product innovation life cycle. You\u2019ve seen a couple of quarters now where there really hasn\u2019t been any kind of launch from competitors in this space. That\u2019s a key driver also, so sales force productivity and execution. We will start to see some of our innovation output. We made double the investment in that R&D business over the last couple of years. We will start to see some output of that in the second half of this year, beginning of next year in terms of new products that will I\u2019d say provide more for the sales team to kind of work with.","Scott Leinenweber","Thanks. Operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Matthew Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.","Matthew Taylor","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on Libre on two points. So, the first is that you mentioned that you're working on increasing the capacity. There was an article yesterday and Reuters that said that you're expanding capacity by three to five times. So, if we think about Libre this year, it\u2019s approaching maybe $2 billion, based on consensus. Does that mean that ultimately you think it could be $6 billion to $10 billion type product as you go mass market? And can you talk about how you can step on the gas in the second of the year with that additional capacity and the approval of Libre 2 to more rapidly expand use?","Miles White","Matt, you are one aggressive guy. I remember I got this call -- or this question last quarter, can\u2019t recall if it was you on whether we thought we could get the $5 billion and how soon. And gosh, three months later, it\u2019s 10. I\u2019ve got the same ambitions, to be honest. I just wouldn't have expected of 90 days later. But to answer your question, I think that kind of potential is there. I think, it\u2019s awfully hard to speculate about a number that big. But, will we -- do I think we will get the $5 billion and do I think we will do in a reasonable time, $5 billion of sales over? Yes, I do. And I think it\u2019s -- the growth rate here is reflective of not only the size of the market but the need and utility and affordability of the product. And I think, it\u2019s just as I said many times, it\u2019s a very different market where affordability and the utility, the access, all those things make this a mass market product, now the niche and its design for that, its price for that, it\u2019s a very profitable product. And we're going through the large scale, scale-up of addressing that kind of growth, which is unprecedented for products in our space.","So, do I think it can grow to that sort of level? I won't jinx anything by trying to make some prognostication about $10 billion but I would say that I think it's got enormous potential, and it's got potential beyond glucose. It's got potential as a wearable and in other analytes and other products over time. We have R&D programs underway, not only for the repeated enhancement improvement, expansion of Libre, but also in the other categories beyond diabetes and other analytes and so forth. So, I think that there's just a lot of things that will evolve over the coming years here that today people aren't even contemplating with the product. We're going as hard as we can at the glucose opportunity, which is enormous. But there's so much more beyond that that I think, at least your aspirational consideration, to be honest, has validity. I'm not ready to put any numbers around it.","Matthew Taylor","And then, maybe one last follow-up, that was a great answer. But just wanted to get your feedback on what you think is misunderstood about Libre today, when you get feedback from investors that bubbles up to you? Where do you think that the internal view of Libre really differs from the Street\u2019s perception or people's perception?","Miles White","Let me ask to the COO. He is been living within it a long time.","Robert Ford","Yes. I think, when we went up about this several years ago, the challenge here, Matt, wasn't to get an accurate reading of glucose from the interstitial fluid. Navigator, when we had launched it back in 2008, we were able to do that. It was very accurate and we were able to get an accurate reading. The challenge that we went about with Libre is how to do that in a way that is cost effective for the health systems and for consumers and for -- and for all of that. So, that was what we really went after is how could you get the accurate reading at a cost position at the core of Libre. And you might remember the time Navigator at the time was considered the most accurate sensor. In the core of leverage is that chemistry, is that core technology of Navigator, which provides accurate reliable readings. But we're able to do that at a cost position that now makes sense for the insurance and for the payer community and the health systems to cover it.","It wasn't a question of whether the outcomes were right, or whether the outcomes were enough. They were convinced that the outcomes were there for sensor-based glucose monitoring. It was just, can I now do it in a way that makes sense for me to do it on a mass scale. And Miles has talked about this about mass scale. That's what we went after 10 years ago. And that's at the core. I think maybe that's misunderstood, because a lot of this discussion that\u2019s focused on well, accuracy at this level and accuracy at that level. And the reality of accuracy is obviously important. But, our goal here is to make this massively available without having to sacrifice accuracy. And the fact that we priced it at a different price point I wouldn't say necessarily imply that it's somehow missing something, we just had a different strategy and different view of what we can do.","Miles White","The only product out there that the Street has been able to compare it to is expensive and high cost and aimed at niche in the United States. Ours is not expensive, and it's not high cost. It does not lack for clinical performance, accuracy, or any of the like. But because manufacturing is so sophisticated and automated, we are able to achieve a pretty low cost and what is a pretty sophisticated product. It's a highly profitable product. So, we haven't compromised that it\u2019s a product is successful in terms of profit; that\u2019s not been comprised at all. It has a completely different design and approach and cost structure, it relies on scale for that cost. And we\u2019ve actually seen improving gross margin. We told it before, the gross margin is over 60%, it is and rising. And that\u2019s with the heavy capital investment, so that we can produce the kind of volume that is broadly available.","So, I think among the misunderstandings out there, I think people say, well geez, how do you make money? Oh, we make money. We do just fine. Thank you. And the product is designed to be affordable and accessible. I guess, there are some days when we think if the healthcare market community, insurers, payers, congress, patients whatever, I always say, it\u2019s got to be lower cost, healthcare\u2019s got to be more affordable. Here\u2019s your example, and it is, it\u2019s massively so. And so, we\u2019ve gone at it with that approach to make it broadly available, broadly in this case means 80 million people worldwide that\u2019s unprecedented.","So, I'm not sure that the device community has totally understood it because it\u2019s so different. But we keep saying so. And I think now as the new capacity comes on line, we\u2019ve also staged the capacity so that literally every 90 days we\u2019re adding another increment, significant incremental capacity. We will not be capacity constrained. And that kind of release is a lot of freedom to market and put some product forward and even open up markets we haven\u2019t opened yet. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity here. And I think too there\u2019s opportunity for a number of things like this is. I mentioned earlier, in what\u2019s called the wearables market, the more affordable and accessible technologies make products like this, then I think we\u2019re going to see a very different market expansion.","Scott Leinenweber","Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions.

With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs.","John B. Thomas","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on today's call will be Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations. Tom will review the details of our financial results for the quarter, as well as our outlook for the year. Larry and I will then discuss the highlights of our major businesses. Following our comments, we'll take any questions you may have, as always.","Some statements made today may be forward-looking, including the planned separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas C. Freyman","Thanks, John. As you can see from our earnings news release this morning, we had a very strong first quarter, delivering double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth and beating our original forecast. We're very pleased with our start to the year and our outlook for the remainder of 2012. As a result, today, we are raising our ongoing EPS guidance range for the full year 2012 by $0.05 on both the bottom and the top of the range, reflecting another year of top-tier performance.","For the first quarter, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.03, an increase of 13.2% over the prior year. Sales increased 5.9% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable 1.3% impact from exchange rates, which was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses. Reported sales increased 4.6%.","In emerging markets, broadly defined, sales increased more than 10%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, with double-digit growth in key emerging markets across the businesses. We also saw meaningful improvement in the adjusted gross margin ratio, up 260 basis points from the prior year to more than 61% as a result of the many margin-improvement initiatives we're implementing company-wide.","In the quarter, we drove better margin performance across our major businesses, including Proprietary Pharmaceuticals, Vascular, Nutritionals and Diagnostics. We delivered more than 13% ongoing EPS growth and a 150 basis point improvement in our adjusted operating margin while continuing to invest in the businesses.","Ongoing R&D investment was 10% of sales, reflecting continued progress across our new product programs. We also accelerated SG&A investment behind many of our key products and businesses to drive future growth.","In the non-operating section of the P&L in the quarter, the net foreign exchange (gain) loss line was unfavorable $58 million compared to 2011. Other income in the quarter included a $60 million favorable resolution on a contractual agreement. These 2 items, therefore, offset the quarter with neutral effect.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2012, we're raising both our ongoing earnings per share guidance range $0.05 on both ends of the range to $5 to $5.10. With our planned separation on track for completion by the end of the year, the guidance we've provided continues to reflect a full year outlook for the company in total.","Regarding sales growth for 2012, we continue to forecast operational growth in the mid-single digits. Based on current exchange rates, we continue to expect a negative impact of exchange on sales of approximately 2.5% for the full year. As a result, reported sales growth is expected to be in the low single digits, in line with the forecast we've provided in January.","Also for 2012, we're forecasting continued improvement in our adjusted gross margin ratio, which we continue to expect to approach 62% for the full year. This reflects efficiency initiatives and favorable mix, partially offset by the expected decline in U.S. lipid sales and promised royalties.","We're forecasting continuing investments to drive growth in 2012 and beyond, with full year R&D of 9.5% to 10% of sales and ongoing SG&A somewhat under 28% of sales. Overall, we continue to expect to expand our operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2012. We're forecasting ongoing net interest expense of approximately $425 million, and we continue to expect an ongoing tax rate of 14.5% to 15% for the full year 2012.","Turning to the outlook for the second quarter. We're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.22. We forecast specified items of $0.07 in the second quarter, primarily reflecting costs of previous restructuring and integration actions. This forecast excludes future one-time costs related to the separation.","Our operational sales growth in the second quarter, that is growth before exchange, is expected to be in the mid-single digits. At current exchange rates, we expect a roughly 3.5% negative impact from exchange in the second quarter, resulted in -- resulting in reported sales growth in the low-single digits. We're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 62% in the second quarter, an increase from the second quarter of 2011.","As mentioned, we remain on track with our plans to separate Abbott into 2 leading health care companies, one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals. We believe this separation will provide 2 unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders. Our transition organization has been fully engaged in this separation since our announcement last October. This is the same organization that executed the separation of our hospital products business and successfully integrated our key acquisitions. We're currently working through the many details of separating the 2 organizations. There's a significant amount of work to do, but the process is going well and is proceeding according to plan.","Last month, we announced that the new research-based pharmaceutical company will be called AbbVie. The AbbVie name connects the new company to Abbott and its heritage of pioneering science, and the \"Vie,\" which suggest the Latin root for life, calls attention to the vital work the company does. During the second quarter, we expect to file the initial Form 10 with the SEC for AbbVie. The Form 10 will provide historical results for AbbVie on a GAAP basis for the past 3 years and for the first quarter of 2012. These historical results will include an allocation of certain costs previously held at the corporate level to the business. Amendments are typically made to the Form 10 disclosures after the initial filing as more information becomes available for disclosure, including future quarterly results. We'd expect amendments to our filing as well until it's declared effective, which is expected to occur later in the year.","The historical balance sheet is not expected to include an allocation of debt to AbbVie such as debt -- as such debt was incurred for the total Abbott operations and was not associated with specific AbbVie entities. The final or effective Form 10 will, however, include pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of debt levels, cash balances and interest expense for AbbVie as an independent company.","The Form 10 is one element in our communications plans for AbbVie and for Abbott post the separation. We will also have comprehensive industrial relations efforts throughout the year to provide investors with information on the 2 companies as we progress towards the separation.","So in summary, we're off to a great start in 2012, beating expectations for the first quarter and raising our outlook for the full year. This outlook again reflects strong and top-tier performance as we execute the steps necessary to separate Abbott into 2 leading health care companies by the end of the year.","With that, let's turn to the business operating highlights. John?","John B. Thomas","Thanks, Tom. I'll start with the diversified medical products businesses, and then Larry will discuss the Proprietary Pharmaceutical business. Sales for our diversified medical products businesses increased mid-single digits in the first quarter, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. We also continued to expand operating margins on the quarter across our diversified medical products businesses including Nutrition, Diagnostics, Vascular and Diabetes Care.","Let's start with Nutrition, where global sales in the quarter increased more than 10%, driven by strong growth in both the U.S., as well as international. In the U.S., sales increased 11% as we continue to maintain our strong market positions in both the Adult and Pediatric Nutritional segments. U.S. Pediatric Nutrition sales increased more than 15%. We continued to gain share and maintain our strong leadership position in the U.S. infant formula market with Similac. We expect continued strong growth of this brand throughout the year as we launch new products to support Similac in the prenatal segment of the market.","Our toddler brand, PediaSure, continues to grow at a double-digit pace. U.S. Adult Nutritional sales increased more than 7%, driven by double-digit growth of both Ensure and Glucerna. We expect Ensure and Glucerna collectively to generate roughly $2 billion in full year sales this year, globally.","Earlier this week, we initiated construction at a new liquid manufacturing facility in Ohio that will primarily support the growth of our U.S. Adult business. Abbott is the worldwide leader in adult nutrition. And as the baby boomer demographic ages, we expect continuing market expansion of the Adult Nutritional segment.","Outside of the U.S., sales increased approximately 10% on an operational basis in Nutritionals, including the negative impact of foreign exchange, reported sales increased more than 9%. This growth was driven by 13% growth in Pediatric Nutritionals, with double-digit growth in Infant Nutritionals, as well as PediaSure.","In the first quarter, we initiated more than 10 new product or geographic launches, each of which is helping to drive market share gains. Emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of our total nutritional sales, and they increased double-digits this quarter. In addition to driving sales growth, the key priority for our Nutrition business is the expansion of operating margins. We've implemented an improvement plan to expand our Nutrition margin from the low teens that we saw last year in 2011 to our target of more than 20% by 2015. We have numerous efforts across the business, with 4 main drivers of margin improvement.","Those are: product costs, where we're reducing packaging cost, ingredient costs and material costs; manufacturing, where we're building plants closer to our customers, particularly in fast-growing emerging markets; distribution, where we're going direct to customers in key geographies; and customer mix, where we're improving both our product and geographic mix to focus on more profitable segments. We're implementing the majority of these improvement initiatives here in 2012, which are expected to drive significant Nutritionals operating margin expansion in 2013 and beyond.","As we look ahead to the second quarter in our global Nutritionals business, we expect high single-digit growth on an operational basis, and mid to high single-digit growth on a reported basis. In the U.S., this includes high-single growth; and internationally, this includes high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid single-digit growth on a reported basis.","Let's move on to our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, which includes international sales of our branded generics portfolio. Sales in the quarter increased 2% on an operational basis. Including a 3.5% negative impact of foreign exchange, reported sales declined low-single digits. Emerging markets now represent nearly 60% of total EPD sales, where many of the pharmaceutical markets are growing at a strong double-digit pace. We're growing faster in these markets as we continue to expand our presence and launch new brands, packaging enhancements and new formulations.","In the first quarter, EPD's operational sales in key emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Russia and China increased collectively 17%. Our large and growing portfolio of more than 500 Established Pharmaceuticals consists of trusted, well-known brands that have broad use throughout the world. Over the next several years, we expect to bring the benefits of these medicines to much broader patient populations through registrations across multiple geographies, as well as launches of improved formulations to enhance efficacy and improved convenience.","So looking ahead to the second quarter in EPD, we expect low single-digit sales growth on an operational basis and a low single-digit decline on a reported basis, which includes, for this division, an expected negative impact of foreign exchange of more than 6% in the second quarter.","In our global Diabetes Care business, worldwide reported sales declined 2.4%. U.S. sales increased more than 7% as we continue to execute on our strategy to drive share gains among the insulin-using patient population. We also recently launched InsuLinx in the U.S., which is our new blood glucose meter specifically for this segment. InsuLinx has a touch screen interface and several personalization features designed to improve the diabetes management experience for patients.","International sales in our Diabetes Care business declined 7% on an operational basis. Including the negative impact of exchange, reported sales declined 8.7%, due in part to certain reimbursement changes in Europe, as well as overall market softness. The negative impact in Europe was partially offset by stronger growth in emerging markets. So looking ahead to the second quarter in Diabetes Care, we expect low to mid single-digit sales growth on an operational basis and low single-digit reported sales growth.","In our Core Laboratory Diagnostics, which includes immunoassay, hematology and blood screening, global sales in the quarter increased more than 6% on an operational basis. Reported sales increased 5%. In the U.S., sales increased nearly 13%. This strong growth was driven by continued uptake of our PRISM blood screening system and good momentum that began in the latter part of last year with several key account wins and continued strong commercial execution.","Outside of the U.S., operational sales increased 5%, and reported sales increased 3%. We delivered strong growth in emerging markets, with sales in China, Brazil and Russia collectively increasing 25%. In each of these markets, we continue to expand our presence with numerous new account wins internationally, including the largest private laboratory in Latin America.","In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide operational sales this quarter increased more than 19%. And in Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide operational sales increased nearly 8%. Reported Molecular sales increased 6%.","Looking ahead to the second quarter in our global Diagnostics business, we expect mid to high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid single-digit reported sales growth.","So moving on to medical devices and our Vision Care business, where global sales this quarter increased low single digits. This was primarily driven by mid single-digit growth in cataract, our largest, most profitable and fastest-growing segment within Vision Care. We also saw a continued, strong double-digit growth in emerging markets such as India and China. Looking ahead to the second quarter in our Vision Care business, we expect low single-digit sales growth on an operational and reported basis.","In our Vascular business, excluding certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues, worldwide Vascular sales increased nearly 4%, and U.S. Vascular sales increased 8%. As expected, reported sales decreased 5% this quarter as a result of a more than 50% decline in royalty and supply arrangement revenues, including PROMUS. As a reminder, the third-party distributor for PROMUS is transitioning away from this product as we approach the end of our distribution agreement this year. Our Vascular business also delivered strong growth in key emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil, which all increased at strong double-digit growth rates.","Sales of our XIENCE drug-eluting stent franchise this quarter were a record $404 million, representing global growth of nearly 7%. Abbott holds the clear global leadership position as the world's #1 drug-eluting stent company. U.S. XIENCE sales increased more than 19% this quarter, driven by the recent U.S. launches of XIENCE nano and XIENCE PRIME, as well as share gains from key account wins in the U.S. as we further penetrate competitor accounts and broaden our overall footprint.","More than 60% of our drug-eluting stents sales occur outside the United States. In Japan, which is our second largest geographic segment, we hold market share of more than 40%. We recently received approval for XIENCE PRIME in Japan and now have the exclusive position in the long-length Everolimus Eluting stent segment.","Also contributing to Vascular sales growth this quarter was endovascular sales, which increased nearly 5%. In the past year, we've launched 7 new endovascular products, including, most recently, U.S. approval for Absolute Pro, our new self-expanding stent for peripheral artery disease. In our Vascular pipeline, we recently presented 2-year data on our ABSORB Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold, or BVS, which demonstrated impressive efficacy and safety results for the treatment of coronary artery disease. We also have 2 clinical trials underway, studying BVS for peripheral disease. We continue to expect a full commercial launch of ABSORB in Europe by year end, and plan to initiate our U.S. clinical trial later this year.","MitraClip, which is our product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, continues to see strong demand outside of the United States, with sales of $25 million this quarter. So as we look ahead to the second quarter on our global Vascular business, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange as well as certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues, we expect sales of our underlying business to grow in the high single digits.  Including the expected decline of royalty and supply arrangement revenues, as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, we expect reported sales to decline low single digits in the second quarter. As a reminder, the PROMUS transition will be completed by the end of the year, positioning our Vascular business in 2013 for stronger reported sales growth.","Finally, as Tom mentioned, the adjusted operating margin in the first quarter for the total company increased approximately 150 basis points over 2011. Nutrition, Diagnostics, Vascular and Diabetes Care contributed to this expansion, with most of the diversified medical products businesses each delivering at least 100 basis points or more margin expansion in their businesses.","In Nutrition, as I mentioned, we expect to expand the operating margin from the low teens today to more than 20%. This quarter, we saw a good progress towards that goal. In Diagnostics, in addition to strong sales growth, we continue to expand our operating margins following a record year of profitability in 2011. As a reminder, this business has had a high single-digit operating margin just a few years ago. This quarter, we delivered an operating margin in the high teens. We're applying many of our key learnings from the work we've done to improve profitability in our Diagnostic business to our efforts to improve profitability in our Diabetes Care business, where we continue to see good improvement on the bottom line. And in Vascular, despite the decline in PROMUS revenues, which were expected, we delivered operating margin in the high 20s in the quarter. We expect continued steady margin expansion for our diversified medical products businesses over the course of the year and going into 2013 and beyond.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Larry to cover our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business. Larry?","Larry Peepo","Thanks, John. Worldwide Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased more than 8% before the negative impact of exchange. On a reported basis, sales increased 7%, including growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and nearly 8% internationally.","In immunology, global sales of HUMIRA increased more than 19% before the negative impact of exchange. Performance was driven by international sales growth of 17.4% before exchange and U.S. sales growth of 22.7%, consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter. HUMIRA continues to hold the #1 global share position. We continue to see strong market growth both in the U.S. and internationally, with HUMIRA demand outpacing the market.","We're continuing our development efforts for HUMIRA, including the study of new indications. We recently received approval from the European Commission for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, making HUMIRA the first and only self-injectable biologic therapy for this disease. The approval also marks the seventh major indication for HUMIRA in the European Union.","We also have a number of other indications currently in late-stage development, many of which are unique to HUMIRA. HUMIRA's utility across a growing number of diseases is one of the many attributes that set it apart from other agents. HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the product in 2012.","Moving on to AndroGel where U.S. sales were approximately $230 million, up more than 23%. AndroGel holds the #1 market share position in the testosterone replacement market, where growth is being driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment. AndroGel 1.62, our new low-volume formulation, has quickly become the second most-prescribed therapy in the market, second only to our older formulation AndroGel 1%.","U.S. sales of CREON were nearly $70 million. CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market, where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. U.S. sales of Lupron were $140 million. Our 6-month formulation, approved last year, continues to perform well, driving share gains and expanding our category leadership.","U.S. sales of Synthroid were approximately $130 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago.","Moving on to our more mature lipid franchise, where U.S. TriCor\/TRILIPIX sales were $254 million and sales of Niaspan were $190 million. Our lipid franchise has been impacted by softness in the overall branded cholesterol market, as well as continued impact from last year's ACCORD and AIM-HIGH study results as we've previously discussed.","So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, we expect mid- to high-single digit operational sales growth and a forecast for approximately 3% negative impact from foreign exchange.","Moving on to our Proprietary Pharmaceuticals pipeline where we continue to make good progress. We currently have 30 compounds in human trials, including numerous medicines in development with breakthrough potential. Let's start with immunology, where we have a number of next-generation programs underway, all with an objective to raise the bar with differentiated efficacy and safety. This high bar is important as we believe the success of new compounds will be based on their ability to offer incremental efficacy and safety benefits beyond what's currently available to physicians and patients today.","Our DVD-Ig platform holds promise in the treatment of RA, as well as other conditions. This proprietary technology unites 2 antibodies into a single molecule. Last year, we initiated a Phase I study in RA for ABT-122, which combines the established mechanisms, anti-TNF and IL-17, with the goal of elevating efficacy and improving the overall clinical profile.","Our anti-CD4 biologic, BT-061, in development in partnership with Biotest, is currently in Phase II clinical trials for RA and psoriasis. The way we've structured the collaboration allows us to evaluate Phase 2b data prior to co-funding the Phase III program. And the product will need to demonstrate a clinically meaningful efficacy benefit, greater than currently available therapies, to clear the hurdle for advancement.","Our recently announced agreement with Galapagos to develop and commercialize a next-generation oral JAK1 inhibitor is structured similarly. We believe this molecule, which preferentially targets the JAK1 pathway, differentiates it from other JAKs in development and may lead to a better overall profile. The Galapagos compound is currently in Phase IIa development with the potential to start Phase IIb next year. We are also evaluating a number of other oral candidates including an internal JAK1, a SYK inhibitor, as well as next-generation anti-inflammatory modulators, or AIMs through our collaboration with Reata.","Moving on to chronic kidney disease, which is also on the rise, driven by higher rates of diabetes, obesity and an aging population. Bardoxolone is a promising treatment in Phase III development for CKD with our partner Reata. Bardoxolone is a nerve 2 activator, a novel mechanism that improves the kidney's ability to filter and remove waste from the body. Results from the Phase IIb study of Bardoxolone were unprecedented and showed a significant and sustained improvement in kidney function. No other treatment to date has demonstrated the ability to reverse the progression of this disease. The Phase III study called BEACON is an outcomes-based study designed to assess Bardoxolone's ability to forestall or prevent chronic dialysis, kidney transplant or cardiovascular death in Stage 4 patients, a group that is just pre-dialysis. Enrollment has been very brisk, which reflects the significant need for new therapies in this disease. We expect results from this 2,000-patient global trial in 2013.","Also in development for the treatment of kidney disease is atrasentan. Results from a Phase II dose-ranging trial showed atrasentan reduce protein in the urine, a symptom that is often predictive of renal function. We would expect atrasentan to be complementary to Bardoxolone within our portfolio. A Phase IIb study is currently underway, with results expected later this year.","Moving on to neuroscience where we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, pain and MS. Daclizumab is a next-generation biologic in development for MS. Last year, Abbott and our partner company announced promising results from the first of 2 registrational studies. The first -- the Phase III study called DECIDE is ongoing. In this study, we hope to confirm the findings observed in the Phase II trial. If successful, we believe a significant reduction in disability and annual relapse rate against an active comparator will be data that is unique to this promising and highly active treatment. Results from the Phase III study are expected in 2014, with potential commercialization in 2015. ","We're also developing an intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. The gel, currently in advanced clinical development in the U.S. and marketed as Duodopa in Europe, consists of 2 compounds with proven efficacy in this disease, levodopa and carbidopa. Through a unique delivery system, the intestinal gel is infused directly into the small intestine via a portable pump. Yesterday, we announced the results from a Phase III trial, showing patients treated for 12 weeks reported significant improvements in disease symptoms versus the oral forms of the products. The results from the study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting later this month. We expect our U.S. registration submission to occur this year.","Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a number of symptoms, including pain and infertility. Our partnered compound, elagolix, has a unique profile that provides symptom reduction while avoiding the adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments. The Phase II clinical program for fibroids is currently underway, and the Phase III study in endometriosis is expected to begin this quarter.","Moving on to oncology where we're focused on developing targeted treatments that inhibit tumor growth and improve response to common cancer therapies. Elotuzumab is being developed with a partner company for the treatment of multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer. Phase II data suggests the potential for improved efficacy versus current treatments. The Phase III study for Elotuzumab is currently underway. We also have active PARP and Bcl-2 inhibitor programs, as well as a number of other early-stage oncology compounds in development.","And finally, turning to our rapidly advancing HCV program where we have a broad portfolio with compounds spanning 3 mechanisms of action, including protease, non-nucleoside polymerase and NS5A inhibitors. Recent data suggest the combination regimen will likely prove to be the most effective approach, and we're well positioned in that regard, given our portfolio.","Earlier this month, abstracts for the upcoming EASL meeting were published online, including results from 2 of Abbott's Phase II interferon-free HCV studies, Pilot and Co-Pilot. In the Co-Pilot study, 2 different doses of our protease inhibitor, ABT-450; plus our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, ABT-333 and ribavirin, were administered for 12 weeks. The results showed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment in 93% and 95% of treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1 patients. In these patients, response was independent of HCV subtype host IL28B genotype or dose level of ABT-450.","The Pilot study evaluated treatment with ABT-450 plus another of our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, ABT-072, and ribavirin for 12 weeks. The results showed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment in 91% of genotype 1 treatment-na\u00efve patients. Both regimens were well tolerated, and the most reported adverse events were mild in severity. Full results with longer term follow-up data from these studies as well as a number of other abstracts will be presented at the EASL meeting this week in Barcelona, Spain. We're building on the Pilot and Co-Pilot results with data from our larger global Phase II clinical trials. These studies include various combinations of all 3 compounds in our portfolio, both with and without ribavirin, as well as evaluation across various HCV genotypes. Additional data from these studies, which are planned for presentation later this year, will shed further light on our promising program. We have a high level of confidence that our HCV compounds in development will dramatically change the treatment landscape. We expect to start Phase III studies in 2013 with commercialization in 2015, putting us in a very competitive position from a timing perspective.","So in summary, this quarter, Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of more than 13%, and we raised our ongoing earnings per share guidance for the year. We remain focused on the process of separating Abbott into 2 leading healthcare companies, which is on track to be completed by the end of the year.","And with that, Tom, John and I will be glad to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","As we think about operating margins, Tom, I mean, clearly, in particular on the Nutritional side, John laid out very thoroughly and clearly some of the drivers there. Can you talk a little bit more, just over the next -- looking ahead over the next couple of years and as the company separates, what are the bigger -- biggest margin drivers beyond this Nutritionals program? Is it diabetes? What's next? And is this going to be -- are these similar programs that you laid out for Nutritional? Or is it more about cost? Just, again, any perspective would be welcome. Where do we go from here?","Thomas C. Freyman","Well, I think what John said in his remarks is a good representation of the way we're approaching it. And I think our experience in diagnostics really helped a lot in this regard. And we talked about this in the past. What that team did is they didn't limit their analysis of their business to just the cost area. They really looked comprehensively at their P&Ls, all the way from the top to the bottom line. They did a lot of thinking through mix, product mix, customer mix, profitability by customer segment. And they did some very good analytics and addressed some of the challenges there that really weren't evident as we looked at these businesses differently, prior to their -- to the work they did in that area. And we've really taken that approach and that template and brought it over to the other businesses and very comprehensively looked at each. So -- as John described in his Nutritional discussion there, it's a pretty broad range of things beyond just the cost area. And our other businesses have done similar exercises. In terms of what's going to drive operating margin improvement for the diversified company, certainly, the biggest opportunity over the next 2, 3 years is nutrition. I think that's where we see the highest ramp. We were -- in the 13 range, I think an operating margin couple of years ago, and we see a very good path to 20 here the next 2, 3 years, and we have a very thorough plan to get there. So that clearly is the biggest mover. But every single business is continuing to execute on their programs, again similar to what Diagnostics did. And we see steady improvement in each business, including Diagnostics. While we've gotten that business up into the upper teens, we clearly see that getting well into the 20s in the next couple of years as well, as they continue to execute. So it's a way of doing business. It's a continual process. And I think, across the businesses, it's going to contribute to a good margin expansion element of the diversified company as we move forward.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And follow-up with 2 product or division-related questions. Core Lab U.S., up 13%, an excellent performance. Maybe highlight some other pipeline products and how sustainable. And last, on ABSORB, given the EU launch later this year, maybe you could update us in terms of just some basic expectations about the penetration the product is likely to get in the first year or so post-launch?","John B. Thomas","Yes, let me take the first part. So ABSORB has been doing well in a limited clinical setting, as we've described before. And then we expect full commercialization launch later this year. The reaction has been very good from clinicians around the world. And as you know, the data results that we've showed so far are similar to what we have seen with XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME in terms of the safety profile and the efficacy. So very encouraged there. And as I mentioned, later this year, plans to start the U.S. trial remain on track there. So it's a good story there. In Core Lab, it's been -- it's interesting because it's a business, frankly, that we haven't talked a lot about, the different products and tests like we used to. But there have been a number of new products that have been launched, new assays. PRISM obviously has been important as that expands. We had good growth there with both of those systems, particularly in some emerging markets around the world where -- markets like China, we've grown in excess of 35%, grown twice the market. Brazil, we've had very good traction with our Vitamin D and Chagas test. Russia is growing, excess of 30%. It's off a smaller base. But we're really investing in some of those emerging markets, and leveraging our overall global leadership position is definitely making a big difference. And then as I mentioned in my remarks, we did win the largest private laboratory in Latin America in the first quarter this year. So those are the good things. The European market has been a little challenging, I think, for everybody. Other competitors have talked about that, but that's one of the things that you have to deal with and we plan for. We also have had some specific tests in the pipeline last year, for example, the Vitamin D test that I mentioned; launched a number of new assays this year, include diabetes and cardiac markers. And then we have other things that we've done in that business, as you know, with our acquisition of STARLIMS. That was the first -- our first entr\u00e9e into informatics. And we've launched what we call OneLab, which is an offshoot of the STARLIMS system. That's gaining some good traction and giving our customers some options that they didn't have before.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first one -- let me ask on Hep C. So what are we going to see additionally at EASL that we didn't see in the abstracts?","Larry Peepo","Most of our abstract, Mike, this is Larry, contain the information that we have at EASL. So when they posted earlier this month, that pretty much encompassed all of our data. And again, the key data there for us would be the Co-Pilot data, which showed very strong SVR12 rates of 93% and 95%. And then Pilot also was very strong. SVR rates, SVR24 actually, at 91%. But most of the abstracts that have been released back in early April will be comprehensive of what we have at EASL this weekend.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One of the questions that people have had has been bounced about on the Street post the release of the abstracts, is the difference in the response rates between the non-CC na\u00efve patients and those that are non-CC treatment failure patients, interferon failure patients. Do you have any thoughts as to why there's such a difference in response rates between those 2 groups? Obviously the N is small, but there's a pretty strong difference there.","Larry Peepo","Well, people who are non-responders are certainly the most difficult to treat, right? And this data that we have right now is kind of our first foray into that group, and it does only include 2 of our agents, the protease inhibitor, as well as the polymerase. And so, as you know, we've got additional studies underway, CC, as I mentioned, later this year, that are inclusive of the NS5A, which we believe to be a much more potent group. But that 47% SVR rate within that non-responder group is actually better than just about anything else that's been put forth to date, including some pretty low-level response rates from the new class that we've seen here over the last 6 weeks. So I would say that 47% looks very good relative to anything else that we've seen. And I think we'll see more again later this year when we put together a more potent agent NS5A in combination with this tough-to-treat patient population.","John B. Thomas","Yes. And then, of course, Mike, the other data that we showed in the most prevalent form of the virus in developed markets, the GT1 treatment-na\u00efve patients, that's where we saw the cure rates in excess of 90%. So those were unprecedented types of results. It's obviously, as Larry said, early data, and we expect to have more data later in the year on a broader patient population. But clearly, I think that put us in a leadership position in HCV.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Good. Let me ask one question on EPD. The performance this quarter was a bit light of our thinking. I think it was up 1.8% constant currency. At the Analyst Meeting, you guys had talked about EPD growing mid- to high-single digits going forward, and I know emerging markets are close to 60% of the revenues. So help us out there, what is going on in EPD? It's important because it's 1\/3 of the profits for new Abbott, so it's going to be a key driver. So why is growth in the low-single digits right now? Why isn't it in that mid to high single-digit range you guys talked about?","Thomas C. Freyman","Well, obviously, that mid to high was a bit of a longer-term target for this group. And the results in the first quarter were very consistent with the guidance we provided in January. And what's happening -- this organization has been in place for a little more than the year. There are a number of their geographic expansion initiatives and products expansion initiatives, which are just in the early stages. Programs such as the Zydus collaboration, which will bring new molecules to the market, and some of the payback on some of the commercial investments that have been made over the last -- over the first year or so are still a bit further out. So I think we're on track in the first quarter. We do expect the growth rates to improve later in the year. There's been -- as you know, there is a base part of this business that is the developed world that is growing a bit more slowly. And in the first quarter, we were working through a little bit of a headwind in some of the European countries there as we progressed through the year. But I think the comps will get better, particularly in the third and fourth quarter. And as we exit the year, our forecast show that we'll be much closer to that range we talked about at the Analyst Meeting as we progress into 2013. So we expect better growth. I think you'll see it. And we'll just have to keep monitoring it as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a few questions, Tom. TriCor, what are your expectations for revenues going forward? Just given the settlement that you've reached with Teva, and Teva's commentary that the FDA has issues with their formulation and won't be launching this year, do you anticipate that there will be other generics on the market? And does your settlement agreement allow for other generics to reach the market? And then I have a follow-up question on HUMIRA growth, which has been quite remarkable in terms of the re-acceleration we've seen, with HUMIRA growth in the U.S., along with the entire anti-TNF class. And I'm just wondering what you think is going on. And as you know, there will be a JAK inhibitor potentially reaching the market in the second half of this year and if your guidance for the full year incorporates a competitive dynamic, and if you could just share with us what you're thinking is.","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, so this is Tom. On TriCor, I mean, I've heard some of the comments you mentioned from Teva, but we can't make assumptions on what they're going to do or not going to do. And clearly, they have a right to enter the market in the second half. And so we continue to model that. I think even if there was somewhat of a delay there, over the -- even the near term or the medium term, that's not real meaningful for us because clearly, as we move into 2013 and '14, these lipid products are in their last phases, and we don't have expectations for sales for those products. So that issue may be a little more meaningful for the other company than it is for us, and we'll see how it plays out in the second half. John, you want to take -- or Larry, you want to take the HUMIRA?","Larry Peepo","Sure. This is Larry. The market growth has been very strong for biologics overall, and I think you'll see that our growth from a prescription trend basis is growing even faster than the market. I think, from an overall market, maybe we're seeing a little bit more contribution from the dermatology side, which, as you know, has very low levels of penetration currently. I think that's lifting the overall biologics market. I think unique to HUMIRA has just been some very strong commercial execution across all the categories. We continue to see very good share momentum, particularly in dermatology relative to Enbrel, as well as in the gastro space relative to the Cimzias of the world. We continue to see really nice market share gains there. And room has held in there quite nicely for us as well, despite an increased level of competition from smaller players who have garnered, I would say, pretty low levels of share overall. Now you asked about our contemplation of a potential launch of Pfizer's tofacitinib product. We pretty much as -- almost like in the TriCor situation, we have to assume that they will be successful with their ultimate approval on a PDUFA date, which I believe is in August. And so we've factored that into our outlook for the year. And certainly, we feel very good about our position, the strength of HUMIRA relative to that product's launch. But to your specific question, yes, we have factored that into our outlook for this year.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just, Tom, very quickly on your tax rate guidance for the year of 14.5% to 15%. Does that contemplate an R&D tax credit? Is that already in that number?","Thomas C. Freyman","No, we do not assume that at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Tom, just wanted to come back to EPD for a second. So it does appear that the key emerging markets with NS7 are performing actually quite well. So I wonder, is the performance today, which I know you hope to get better, is that more a function of the BRICs not growing as fast as you want or expected? Or is it a situation with the non-BRIC markets that may be more developed in nature are being pressured for economic reasons kind of at this current time?","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, it's -- well, it's the non-BRIC. But all -- we, frankly -- as we look at this business not really on the long term, the medium term, we have factored into that mid to upper expectation on sales growth, the fact that this base business will not grow as fast. But as the emerging markets grow as fast as we expect, and as it becomes a higher percentage of the business, I think it's going to support growth in the range that we have targeted. I will say, as a part of the latter part of 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012, there still is some residual austerity effect coming through in the developed world element of this business. And that's a little bit of what you're seeing in the first quarter, a bit of headwind. But in the BRIC areas, very strong double-digit growth, and we're really pleased with how the business is executing in those areas.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a quick question for Larry on Hep C. Larry, have there been any decisions made about, if you look at the regimens in Pilot and Co-Pilot, about which of those regimens, if any, are going to be brought into Phase III?","Larry Peepo","No final decisions on Phase III at this point in time. I would say, one thing that we learned from Pilot\/Co-Pilot, though, is that we used ABT-072 in Pilot. That's our, again, the polymerase inhibitor, and we used 333 in Co-Pilot. As you can see, in the Phase IIb studies that we've described on clinicaltrials.gov, we are moving forward in Phase IIb with the ABT-333 polymerase. But I think, more importantly, is the data that's coming from our broader Phase II program, Aviator and Navigator, that really combine and have various arms that have, again, various combinations of these 3 compounds with and without ribavirin, that will really be the guide to what we move forward with into Phase III. And again, right now, we're talking initiation of Phase III in 2013. But as you can imagine, we're working very hard to have that occur as soon as we can. But that's our guidance today.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one quick -- I'm sorry, for John or Tom. You talked about nutritional opportunities, obviously, a significant driver of what -- of DMP growth. You talked about 2 different opportunities: the first, which is a cost-driven opportunity; the second is mix. I guess I'm just curious, can both of those opportunities move forward simultaneously? Or should we think of them as sort of a phase -- a phased effect?","Thomas C. Freyman","No. I mean, all of the margin initiatives are being addressed concurrently as aggressively as the organization can do it. So it's going to -- there's no reason to phase things. And there are numerous, numerous -- literally over 100 programs that the business is executing on as we speak.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. One on HUMIRA, the o U.S. strength. Can you comment about -- I can't imagine it's entering new markets, so it must be indications. So maybe discuss what's driving the international growth? Then my second question is on U.S. stents. Can you give us a sense of what pricing has been doing in the market sequentially and what DES penetration was in the first quarter?","John B. Thomas","Yes. Let me take the last part first, Glenn. So stent pricing actually has moderated nicely from what we've seen, as you know, last year, throughout the year. And I think the competitors saw this as well. It was declining in the high-single digits. It's moderated to mid-single digits price decline. And that is a function of a number of different things. One, on our end, is the launch of both nano and PRIME. So getting into the short lengths and the longer lengths -- small vessels and longer lengths, excuse me. And that -- those are premium products, and I think that's helped stabilize as well, and some other competitive launches in addition. So that's one thing. DES penetration has been around 80%. And with PROMUS out of the mix as you know, too, that helps our overall pricing situation now that they're no longer part of that third-party revenue line in our overall numbers. So DES penetration is good. PCI volume has been up nicely, particularly outside the U.S. and certain emerging markets, it's growing in the mid-teens. So the dynamics there are good for the underlying business, despite the noise and as I mentioned on the call. And it's really about setting up the business for much stronger growth in 2013 as we get through this transition year, with PROMUS coming out of the numbers for us.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can I ask one follow-up, just U.S. PCI volume is -- that's been kind of tracking flat to up a little, down a little. Any indication what that was in the first quarter? And the 80% DES penetration, is that better than what we've seen in the second half of last year?","John B. Thomas","Yes, it is slightly better. We were seeing -- pushing upwards of 80%, 79%. That's the first time that we've gotten to 80% in a while. And the U.S., you're right. PCI volume there has been relatively flat and down just very slightly sequentially. But as I mentioned, up kind of in the mid-single digits worldwide. And then certain international emerging markets been up quite strongly.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just the international HUMIRA growth?","Larry Peepo","Sure. Yes. I think it's a combination of factors, Glenn. Certainly, HUMIRA has a leadership position and, as a leader, grows probably in excess of the marketplace most quarters. That leadership extends across, as I said, now 7 indications. So it is somewhat driven by new indications. It's also driven by some expansion in geographic presence. Japan continues to move forward nicely. We've launched in China. But I think, in general, the overall driving factor is just market growth. We continue to see, across the major markets, growth rates anywhere from 14% to 20%, just based again on the benefits that the product brings relative to the downstream cost that can be incurred for not treating the severity of these diseases. So market growth is probably your primary driver there in the international side, and we're growing a little bit faster than those markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And that 14% to 20%, should we assume it's closer to 14% in Europe and 20% outside of Europe? Or is it a little bit slower in Europe?","Larry Peepo","The Europes are in that range.","Operator","Our final question today is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on EPD. I think you guys reported in 2011, pricing was minus 1 to 2. Is that still kind of the run rate you're seeing for that business?","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes, that's probably about right. A little -- probably closer to 2.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And I guess just following up on HUMIRA x U.S. I know you don't want to get too specific on this, but is it reasonable to assume a double-digit ongoing constant currency-type growth for that product, again in international markets over the next few years?","Larry Peepo","Yes, it's always hard to project out that far, Rajeev. But again, here we are in 2012, and those markets continue to grow in the range that I just indicated. That's pretty strong growth. Now certainly, our product gets bigger and bigger every year. So dollars of growth can continue to be quite strong. The percentage, just based on the way the numbers work, starts to come down a little bit, but we foresee good growth there internationally.","Thomas C. Freyman","Yes. I mean, you'll recall from the October investor meeting, Rick Gonzalez talked about $1 billion-plus in raw dollars of HUMIRA growth over the next few years. So certainly, as a percentage, that would be double digits in '13 and probably '14. But that gives you an idea of what we think the continuing growth potential of the product is as we look out 2, 3 years.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. No, that's very helpful. It just seems like the product just continues to move ahead at a -- such a brisk pace. I appreciate the color.","Thomas C. Freyman","Well, the performance has been good, and we think the durability is very strong as well over the long term.","John B. Thomas","Yes. And don't forget all the indications that we have. And we just got another one, as you know, in Europe. So the utility of the product has been amazing, and it's a great, great, well-positioned product for the long-term. Okay? All right.

With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.Brian YoorGood morning, and thank you for joining us. Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide his opening remarks in our 2013 outlook. Tom will then provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance as well as some additional detail on our 2013 outlook and guidance. I will then provide highlights and guidance for each of our major businesses. Following our comments, Miles, Tom and I will take your questions. Please note that our discussion of 2012 performance will include results of what is now AbbVie. However, AbbVie will provide additional highlights and details of their 2012 performance and 2013 outlook on their call Next Wednesday, January 30.Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the planned separation of the research-based pharmaceutical company from the diversified medical products company and the expected financial results of the 2 companies after the separation.Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1a, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and in the interim reports filed on form 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measure in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our website at abbott.com.With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.Miles WhiteOkay, thanks Brian. Good morning. This morning I will review our 2012 results and our outlook for 2013.Abbott reported another year of strong performance in 2012 and executed on a number of key actions that will drive future growth for the company. On January 1, we launched AbbVie as an independent Fortune 200 biopharmaceutical company. The creation of AbbVie is a significant event in Abbott\u2019s history and our ability to change is the reason that Abbott has endured as evidenced by the fact that in 2013 we also enter our 125th year well positioned for future success.As we announced this morning, we expect to deliver another year of strong performance. We issued ongoing 2013 EPS guidance of $1.98 to $2.04, representing double digit growth over 2012. I\u2019ll talk more about the year ahead in just a moment. As Brian mentioned, our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results are for total Abbott and include the proprietary pharmaceutical business.So for the full year 2012, Abbott delivered ongoing EPS growth that exceeded our initial guidance range. We also generated record operating cash flow of more than $9 billion, returning more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. We\u2019ve increased our dividend payout for 40 consecutive years. Abbott is one of only a handful of companies to deliver with such consistency.Since our separation announcement in October 2011 to the end of last year, Abbott stock price appreciation and dividends generated a total shareholder return of nearly 30%, compared to the S&P 500 return of somewhat above 19%.Before I review our business results, I want to spend a few minutes on the longer term outlook for the company, with the expectation that Abbott will be one of the largest and fastest growing diversified healthcare investments. Over the last several years we recognized the significant economic and demographic shifts that are changing the healthcare industry, including the development of healthcare systems and improving economic conditions in emerging economies, a global population that\u2019s growing older and living longer, resulting in an increase in age related and chronic diseases, and the increasing focus on the type of innovation that reduces costs for payers in addition to improving outcomes for patients and delivering value to customers.Abbott is well positioned to become a leader in this new environment. We\u2019re balanced across four business segments; Branded Generics, Medical Devices, Diagnostics and Nutrition. These businesses also provide us with a diverse customer base and payer mix. We are more weighted to the growth that\u2019s taking place in emerging economies, with the expectation that 50% of our sales will occur in these faster growing economies and geographies by 2015.We hold leadership positions across all of our major businesses. We have many opportunities in our broad based pipeline. This includes next-generation diagnostic systems, medical devices in coronary, endovascular and structural heart, as well as innovations that are important to our customer facing businesses in branded generics and nutrition. These businesses have more rapid R&D cycles focused on brand enhancements, local solutions and improved formulations and packaging. And we remain focused on financial discipline and operational execution as we expand margins and continue to generate very strong cash flow, upwards of $4 billion this year.Moving on to our 2012 results and outlook for the businesses that comprise the new Abbott. Full year 2012 new Abbott sales increased mid-single digits operationally, adjusted for the transitional items we have discussed before. The impact of Promus royalty revenues and our direct distribution initiatives in nutrition. Emerging market sales for new Abbott which represented nearly 40% of sales continued to drive growth increasing double-digits operationally. As we have discussed over the past year, going forward Abbott will be comprised of four roughly equal sized businesses and I will provide a brief overview of each.In our established pharmaceutical division, or EPD, we are generating in international sales from a large and growing portfolio of hundreds of branded generic pharmaceuticals that have broad use throughout the world. 60% of EPDs sales are in emerging markets and 40% are in developed markets. While full year 2012 sales in developed markets were impacted by austerity measures, sales in emerging markets generated strong growth. EPD has a number of early stage geographic and product expansion initiatives underway, including more than 150 registration approvals and new product launches expected in 2013.As these initiatives generate new growth opportunities and as faster growing emerging markets become a larger percentage of EPDs sales base, we expect to see steadily improving growth. Our medical device businesses include diabetes care, vision care, and vascular devices. In diabetes care in 2012, we continued the global rollout of our FreeStyle InsuLinx glucose meter. It\u2019s the foundation of our diabetes pipeline where we are focused on addressing the needs of insulin users. In 2013, we are planning on several new product and software launches as well as initiating our pivotal clinical trial for our next generation sensor that we expect to first bring to the European market by the end of 2014.In vision care we launched several new products in 2012, primarily in our cataract business which now represents nearly 65% of our vision care sales. We have outpaced the growth of the cataract market driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets and share gains in the premium intraocular lens segment led by our TECNIS brand. Cataract surgery remains the number one surgical procedure in the world and it\u2019s a market that will continue to grow as the world\u2019s population ages.And in vascular devices, we are seeing this business grow most rapidly outside the United States where we now have more than 60% of vascular sales. We launched several important new products last year that solidified our position as the number one vascular device company globally. And as we look to 2013, we expect to accelerate growth by first gaining share with our leading drug-eluting product portfolio. We launched our new Xience Xpedition drug-eluting stent in Europe in August, and in the U.S. this month. We expect to launch Expedition in Japan mid-year.Second, building on the 2012 international launch of ABSORB, the world\u2019s first and only bioresorbable vascular scaffold, which is now available in more than 30 countries including most recently India. Our pivotal clinical trial for U.S. approval is also now underway. Third, accelerating sales of our structural heart device, MitraClip, in international markets. We are planning for an FDA panel in the first half of this year as we work to bring this important product to the U.S. market.Four, expanding our market share in endovascular, where we are applying our expertise and developing best in class coronary devices to increase our penetration of this faster growing market. And finally, driving continued strong growth in emerging markets where interventional procedures are growing double-digits and penetration remains low. This geographic segment comprises more than 20% of total vascular sales and has been growing at a strong double-digit pace. We expect this type of growth in emerging markets to continue in 2013.Diagnostics had another impressive year in terms of both sales and margin growth. Full year 2012 operational sales increased more than 7% and operating margin approached 19% of sales. We expect another year of strong performance in 2013. Core Laboratory Diagnostics delivered 7% operational growth for the full year. 80% of this division sales occur outside the United States with more than 35% of sales in emerging geographies. We are focused on China, Brazil and Russia, which combined have grown 30% year-to-date. China is our largest growth opportunity where we have seen an increasing demand for industry-leading systems such as ARCHITECT and PRISM, as this country continues to invest to improve its healthcare system.Molecular and point of care round out our diverse portfolio of diagnostics offerings. We\u2019re growing both businesses as we increase penetration of systems and tests in the developed world and expand in emerging markets.We also plan to launch several new instrument platforms across our diagnostics portfolio over the next several years. These systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed, scalability and shorter turnaround time. Lowering cost is also a major design objective for these programs.While we\u2019ll invest in diagnostics R&D at a somewhat higher level in 2013 to deliver these future growth opportunities, we expect continued steady expansion of diagnostics operating margin over the year ahead. We remain on track to well exceed our original target of 20% of sales over the next few years.And finally, our nutrition business had a very strong fourth quarter, with worldwide operational sales growth of 10%, building continued momentum for 2013. Nutrition is the fasted growing business in our portfolio and has the most opportunity for margin expansion.In 2012, we had a number of key achievements that continue to position us well for future growth. In the U.S, we saw strong growth across our key brands, maintaining our leading infant formula share with Similac and delivering double digit growth of both PediaSure and Ensure.Outside of the U.S, emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of our nutrition sales and they grew double digits for the full year for both pediatric and adult. We\u2019ve seen outstanding productivity from our R&D organization, with 80 product launches in 2012.We made good progress on the expansion of global capacity in the U.S, China and India. Our three new manufacturing facilities are expected to come online by early next year. And we exceeded our 2012 expectations for operating margin improvement and remain on track for our goal of exceeding 20% of sales by 2015.So in summary, New Abbott is a diversified, differentiated, large capital care investment opportunity well positioned to deliver top-tier growth and as we look to the future, we see significant opportunity ahead. We hold leadership positions across our major businesses and we\u2019re delivering customer focused innovation. Our portfolio is aligned with favorable demographics that are driving growth in healthcare. We have a large presence in rapidly growing emerging markets. We\u2019re focused on expanding margins across our businesses and we have strong cash flow generation which will provide ample resources for investments in future growth and returns to shareholders.I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom who will review 2012 results and the 2013 outlook in more detail. Tom?Thomas Freyman","Thanks Miles. Before I review our financial performance, I\u2019d like to explain how we\u2019ll handle the transition from pre-separation Abbott results to post-separation Abbott results. In our remarks today regarding 2012, our results reflect all of the pre-separation businesses, including the proprietary pharmaceutical business. Our 2013 guidance and outlook will reflect only the new Abbott businesses.","Regarding 2013 comparisons to 2012 for New Abbott, we plan to provide investors with a post-separation base line of the quarterly income statement on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations prior to our first quarter earnings release in April. This will be for 2012. In order to provide this information, we must first complete in the coming weeks the so-called audited carve out of AbbVie results from Abbott\u2019s combined fourth quarter results.So while we don\u2019t have the final 2012 baseline established as of today\u2019s call, we understand that investors are looking for perspective on 2013 growth rates on both the top and bottom line. With that in mind, today we\u2019ll provide you with our projections of full year sales and ongoing earnings per share growth in 2013 over an estimated 2012 baseline. Please keep in mind the growth rates against the actual 2000 baseline may change somewhat once the final 2012 carve out is completed.Let\u2019s move on to our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results for the total company. We\u2019re very pleased with how we ended 2012 as we exceeded our initial expectations for ongoing earnings per share for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.51, in line with our previous guidance range.Sales for the quarter increased 5.6% on an operational basis and 4.4% on a reported basis, that is including an unfavorable 1.2% impact from foreign exchange. These results are in line with the expectations we provided on our third quarter call.We continue to see strong growth in emerging markets particularly as Miles mentioned in those businesses that will comprise New Abbott, with these sales growing double digits on an operational basis in the quarter. As we discussed in previous quarters, sales growth trends for New Abbott businesses have been affected by two factors that are transitional in nature. First, the phase out of Promus royalty revenues in our vascular business. This impacted year-over-year sales growth in 2012 and continues into the first quarter of 2013 for Japan sales. And second, the shift to direct distribution in certain markets in our international nutrition business. Adjusting for these transitional factors new Abbott operational sales growth would have been in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter and the full year 2012.The fourth quarter adjusted gross margins ratio for the total company was 63.3%, in line with expectations including a negative exchange effect of 130 basis points. Recall from our third quarter call that we expected the trend of favorable foreign exchange impact on the gross margin ratio that we had seen through nine-months to reserve in the fourth quarter and continue into 2013. This is what\u2019s occurring as we anticipated. Excluding the impact of exchange, our underlying ongoing gross margin ratio improved by around 80 basis points.Overall, as we look at 2012, we delivered a strong ongoing earnings per share growth despite a challenging environment and a foreign exchange headwind on sales of almost 3%. We generate record full-year operating cash flow of more than $9 billion in 2012, exceeding our initial expectations and our forecast for the fourth quarter. And we delivered these results while we successfully launched AbbVie.Looking ahead to 2013, as of January 1, Abbott and AbbVie began operating as independent companies. As indicated, all my remarks for 2012 were for the entire pre-separation results of legacy Abbott, the guidance I will now provide reflects the outlook only for new Abbott. The AbbVie management team will discuss its outlook on a separate conference call next week. Today we issued full year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04. As previously discussed, our non-GAAP ongoing EPS metric going forward excludes the impact of intangible amortization expense forecasted at $0.40 per share in 2013, as well as other specified items discussed in our earnings news release.We believe this metric provides a meaningful measurement for assessing Abbott earnings power and growth. The mid-point of our guidance range represents double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth based on an estimated 2012 ongoing EPS base line. Sales for those businesses comprising new Abbott approached $21.5 billion in 2012. Consistent with financial profile expectations we communicated on our third quarter call, we expect 2013 full year operational sales growth, that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the mid to high single digits.While the impact of exchange varies across our businesses, based on current exchange rates we would expect exchange to have a slightly negative impact overall on our full year reported sales. Brian will review our growth outlooks by business in a few minutes. From a geographic perspective, we expect continued double-digit full year operational sales growth in emerging markets for 2013. As we have discussed before, approximately 70% of Abbott sales are generated outside of U.S. and approximately 40% of sales are in emerging markets, which we expect to continue increasing as a percent of Abbott\u2019s total sales overtime.We are forecasting a full year ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio, again excluding intangible amortization expense of approximately 55% consistent with the modeling guidance provided on the third quarter call. We are forecasting continued investments in R&D to drive long-term growth in 2013 and beyond with full year ongoing R&D of 6% to 7% of sales. We forecast ongoing SG&A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full year 2013. We expect this ratio to decline as we progress through the quarter this year and it reflects meaningful leverage over 2012 -- the 2012 estimated base line.I would note that SG&A includes the estimated impact from the medical device tax under the U.S. Affordable Care Act that begins in 2013. Overall, we expect to expand our full year ongoing operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013. We are forecasting net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013. Non-operating income of approximately $20 million and around $50 million of expense in the exchange gain\/loss line of the P&L. We are projecting the full year tax rate in 2013 at around 21%, which now includes the 2013 U.S. R&D tax credit enacted into law at January 2.As we move into the post-separation period, 2013 will also be the first year we report quarterly results for New Abbott. Certain items that span both 2013 and 2012 are expected to affect the quarterly comparisons to the 2012 baseline. These include the impact of exchange rates on sales and margin between the years, a line down of Promus revenues in Japan in the first quarter of 2013 and non-operating income recorded in 2012. We expect these anomalies to result in less ongoing earnings per share growth in the first half of the year and more in the second. However, after adjusting for these items, the underlying earnings growth for New Abbott each quarter is forecasted to be strong and more in line with our full year outlook for double digit ongoing EPS growth.Today and as we progress through the year, where significant, we will communicate in advance these types of items that would affect upcoming quarterly earnings comparisons to 2012. So specifically, with regard to the first quarter of 2013, today we\u2019re providing ongoing EPS guidance that is before specified items of $0.40 to $0.42 per share. We forecast specified items of approximately $0.17 in the first quarter, reflecting intangible amortization expense, separation cost and cost reduction programs.Our operational sales growth in the first quarter is expected to be low to mid-single digits off of 2012 baseline approaching $5.3 billion. At current exchange rates, the first quarter is our most difficult sales comparison with almost 1.5% negative impact from exchange which would result in reported sales growth in the low single digits. We expect the last quarter of the winding down of Promus in Japan be a sales headwind of somewhat less than 1% in the first quarter.We\u2019re forecasting an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio, again excluding intangible amortization expense, that approaches 55% in the first quarter, ongoing R&D at around 7% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense of a little over 32% of sales. Finally I\u2019d note that we had around $40 million of non-operating income in the first quarter of 2012 related to a contractual settlement which is non-recurring in 2013.At this time, we\u2019d also like to provide an early view of the ongoing P&L profile of the system as we see it in the second quarter of 2013. At this time we forecast operational sales growth in the second quarter in the mid to upper single digits off of 2012 baseline of around $5.3 billion. We currently expect the second quarter gross margin to be negatively impacted by year-over-year effects of exchange. So at this point, we forecast the adjusted ongoing gross margin ratio at around 54.5% of sales in the second quarter. We forecast ongoing R&D expense at around 6.5% and ongoing SG&A expense falling below 32% of sales in the second quarter of 2013.So in summary, we delivered a strong ongoing earnings per share growth in 2012, which exceeded our initial forecast, while at the same time executing the steps necessary to launch AbbVie as an independent company. Our 2013 outlook for Abbott reflects strong performance on the topline and double digit ongoing EPS growth as we continue to build Abbott to be a top-tier performer in the years ahead.With that, let\u2019s turn to the business operating highlights. Brian?Brian Yoor","Thanks Tom. This morning I\u2019ll provide a brief overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance for each of our major businesses that comprise the New Abbott. I\u2019ll also review our 2013 sales outlook by business. My comments will focus primarily on operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.I\u2019ll start with our established pharmaceuticals business or EPD, where sales in the fourth quarter and the full year increased in the low single digits on an operational basis. Full year 2012 sales in the emerging markets grew high single digits on an operational basis, with the BRIC and key emerging markets growing mid-teens. This growth was largely offset by mid-single digit declines in developed markets where austerity measures impacted performance.In 2013, we expect to accelerate operational sales growth from the low single digits into the mid-single digits by executing on a number of product and geographic expansion initiatives. We\u2019re also moving a large number of registrations through our pipeline and regulatory approval process. This includes increasing the breadth of our product offerings by launching new and improved formulations of our current trusted brands such as Creon and Brufen as well as launching new products, such as Amitiza which we recently launched in Japan; expanding geographically, including registrations of numerous productions across multiple geographies such as Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. And accelerating and capturing new sources of growth through select licensing agreements. Through our agreement with [Noble] in Turkey, we are expanding our cardio-metabolic offering and through our agreement with Zydus we are launching new products into key Eastern European markets.We expect to deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets in 2013 growing faster than the market in many key countries where we have strong positions. We are particularly focused on the BRIC markets as well as several additional key emerging markets. We expect our total emerging markets sales base to increase to approximately 65% of total EPD sales in 2013, up from 60% of EPD today.So for the full year 2013 in EPD, we expect mid-single digit operational sales growth with continued strong bottom line performance. At current exchange rates this business would be relatively more impacted by exchange in 2013, so we would expect full year reported sales growth in the low to mid-single digits. For the first quarter of 2013, we expect low single digit operational growth with higher sales growth in the second half of 2013. Including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect a low single-digit decline in EPD sales in the first quarter.Moving on to medical devices. In diabetes care, global sales in the fourth quarter increased more than 4% on an operational basis. In the U.S. in the retail segment of the market, we continued to grow faster than our competition and moved into the number two market position during 2012. Outside of the U.S., sales growth was driven by share gains in key emerging markets and continued uptake of our FreeStyle InsuLinx meter. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect sales to be relatively flat on an operational and reported basis. While we expect continued growth in key emerging markets, the 2013 implementation of CMS competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact sales in the U.S.In vision care, global operational sales increased in the low single-digits for the fourth quarter and the full year. While our LASIK business continues to be affected by economic conditions, we have seen a steady acceleration in the growth of our cataract business which now represents nearly 65% of our global vision care sales. We also saw continued strong double-digit cataract growth in emerging markets including strong performance in India and China. For 2013, we expect low single-digit operational and reported sales growth in our vision care business driven by continued growth in cataract sales and continued emerging market expansion.In our vascular business, adjusted for the impact of non-commercial revenues including Promus, full year worldwide vascular sales increased 3.5% on an operational basis. As a reminder, while the impact from the U.S. Promus transition was completed last year, the impact from the Japan Promus transition will continue into the first quarter of 2013. Global sales in the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted for the impact of non-commercial revenues and foreign exchange, increased modestly. International sales which comprised more than 60% of total vascular sales, increased 8% operationally. This was primarily offset by the expected decline in U.S. XIENCE sales reflecting drug-eluting stent market dynamics as well as the difficult comparison to the fourth quarter 2011 when XIENCE PRIME was launched in the U.S. market.International sales represent nearly 70% of our drug-eluting coronary product portfolio which now includes both our market leading XIENCE stents as well our new bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB. International DES sales increased nearly 13% on an operational basis in the quarter. We expect to increase market share in 2013 with the continued global launch of our new more deliverable XIENCE Xpedition drug-eluting stent and our BVS ABSORB. Since our launch of both new products last year in Europe, we have seen meaningful share gains, solidifying our deliverability advantage with Xpedition and establishing a new path forward in this market with ABSORB.In endovascular, sales increased in the low-single digits in the fourth quarter and on an operational basis, including continued strong growth internationally. In structural heart, MitraClip, which is our first in class treatment for mitral regurgitation, continues to see strong demand outside of the United States with sales of nearly $30 million in the fourth quarter. We have nearly doubled our 2012 sales over 2011 and plan to nearly double sales again in 2013.Starting this month, MitraClip will receive formal reimbursement coverage in Germany which is where the majority of MitraClip procedures occur today.Looking ahead to 2013, we expect low to mid-single digit operational and reported sales growth for our vascular business, driven by several new product launches as well as continued strong growth internationally, particularly in emerging markets. For the first quarter of 2013, including the impact from the wind down of the Promus transition in Japan and foreign exchange, we expect reported sales to decline in the low single digits. Adjusting for both of these items, we expect first quarter sales to increase in the low single digits.Moving on to Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, operational sales increased nearly 6% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. As Miles mentioned, emerging market sales represent 35% of total sales, an increase in the mid-teens for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We expect the emerging markets to represent more than 40% of Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales in the next several years.In addition to delivering strong sales growth, we are also delivering on our pipeline. We recently launched two new tests on our architect platform that continue to broaden our menu and differentiate us from the competition. In the coming months, we\u2019re also launching a next-generation automation solution to improve efficiencies in the lab.In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased more than 14% on an operational basis. And in Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 5% on an operational basis for the fourth quarter. For 2013, we expect our worldwide diagnostics businesses, including Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Point of Care and Molecular to generate mid to high single digit operational and reported sales growth, with double digit growth in both Point of Care and Molecular Diagnostics.And finally in our nutritionals business, global sales increased 10% in the fourth quarter on an operational basis, driven by high single digit growth in the U.S and double digit growth internationally. In the U.S, pediatric sales increased more than 8% during the quarter, including strong double digit growth of both our PediaSure and Pedialyte toddler brands.U.S adult sales also increased double digits, driven by continued strong growth of Ensure where we\u2019ve continued to launch new innovations to drive sustainable growth. Outside of the U.S, pediatric sales increased 14% on an operational basis in the quarter. We launched several new products in the fourth quarter in key global markets, including the continued rollout of our Similac, Total Comfort infant formula brand, as well as other specialty toddlers\u2019 products. Adult nutrition sales increased mid-single digits driven by continued strong growth of both Ensure and Glucerna.We also made significant progress during the year on our margin expansion initiative in nutrition. For the full year 2012, our operating margin improved nearly 250 basis points over 2011. Key drivers of improvement in this division remain focus on driving down manufacturing costs, reducing freight and distribution costs, focusing our products and geographies on profitable growth and optimizing our supply chain.So as we look ahead to 2013 for our global nutrition business, we\u2019re forecasting sales to approach double digit growth on an operational and reported basis. This includes low to mid-single digit growth in our U.S business and double digit growth in our international business.So in summary, in 2012 we completed our planned separation into two leading global healthcare companies and demonstrated strength through our financial performance. As we move into 2013, Abbott is well positioned to deliver durable, top-tier growth as a diversified healthcare company, one with a broad and balanced portfolio of leadership businesses that are aligned with favorable demographic and healthcare trends.We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JP Morgan.Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.I have a bunch of questions. Let me start with, could you just spend a minute, Tom, on the spread between the GAAP and cash guidance for 2013. It\u2019s obviously more than the amortization expense. So are you just assuming certain charges that will run through over the course of the year and that\u2019s why the GAAP numbers are off?Thomas Freyman","Yeah. There\u2019s two basic things happened beyond amortization. There\u2019s a little bit of post-separation. I call it residual separation cost and there\u2019s some previously announced actions we took in areas of cost reduction, particularly in areas that impact manufacturing that do carryover into 2013. So that\u2019s the difference.Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.Okay. And then can you -- two questions, one, do you have, Tom, a new Abbott EPS number at this point for 2012. And the second, can you aggregate up all the divisional revenue guidance to what your organic revenue guidance is in reported revenue guidance for 2013 for the total company.Tom FreymanOn the second point, we provided mid to upper overall operational growth as guidance for 2013 and if you were to go through all the details that Brian outlines in his remarks, those details will build up to that type of growth. So I think you will find that certainly this all hangs together. With regard to the 2012 base line, as I spent a few minutes in my remarks, we need to provide investors and we plan to do so before the first quarter call with the adjusted 2012, effectively continuing operations base line for new Abbott. As I indicated in my remarks, we can't really do that until we have completed this carve out work which we still need to complete the fourth quarter which we are going to do in the coming weeks.And once we do that, we will be provide you detailed quarterly GAAP and non-GAAP reconciled P&L base line, if you will. But of course we have done some modeling, and as we model it and based upon this guidance range and if you take the middle of this ongoing range we have provided, that would be double-digit growth plus over what we believe the 2012 base line will come in at. So I think things are very consistent with what we have been saying and it just kind of takes us a little bit of time to come up with the precise numbers.Among the challenges we will have when we present that is just effectively normalizing capital structure between the year. As you know when we look at the carve out of AbbVie, AbbVie did not have debt in the carve out. They do have debt going forward. Abbott will have less debt than what we have had historically in the implied carve out of the Abbott side. So there will be some adjustments in those areas where we will build a 2012 base line that\u2019s meaningful relative to how we are growing the business in 2013. Hopefully that answers your question.Michael Weinstein \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.Yeah. And then maybe, Miles, I want to zip it on this last one. But EPD is probably the business that people have probably the least amount of visibility into and probably the least amount of conviction in terms of sustainability of mid to high-single digit growth which you guys have talked about. Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy to accelerate growth of those, what looks to be a subpar year in 2012?Miles WhiteYeah, I think you are right. I think people do lack a certain understanding or visibility to the business, Mike. And I think it comes from two major dimensions. One is, there is a lot less, call it publicly available sources of data for a lot of the countries that make up this business, at least for you know analysts and investors to have an independent look at. And there is a lot of countries here as you know. But I think the first thing is that the absence of that and the second is, this is a business that\u2019s a segment business. Meaning there is a proprietary pharma business in a lot of countries, there is a commodity generic business in a lot of countries, and there is a branded generic business. And they are all three different. They are different.And this branded generic business is quite large and much more like our nutrition business. It\u2019s very consumer facing and a lot more like that in terms of consumer choice, consumer pay etcetera. And that\u2019s why some of the lack of complete understanding and so on. The business however is quite attractive. It\u2019s very profitable, it\u2019s quite attractive. It\u2019s growing very nicely. But it\u2019s a story of really two geographies and maybe two market segments.60% of the business now is in what we will characterize as emerging or growth markets and 40% of it is in developed markets. And those developed markets as you know, have been under a fair amount of austerity pressure. So if I were going to [do you] an upgrade, so we get a tale of two different segments here. The BRIC countries and the other emerging markets and so forth depending on which markets, are either growing very high single digits or mid-teens, double-digits etcetera on the sales line. And so the emerging markets collectively grow in double-digits, very healthy. But Europe, in particular, is experiencing the kind of austerity pressure on pricing and utilization that it\u2019s experiencing for many products, even outside of healthcare. ","So the developed markets have been down in the last quarters mid-single digits and sort of two steps forward, one step back for a while here. So there\u2019s a couple of things that will evolve, that will drive EPD\u2019s growth. We believe very strongly in the growth in the various emerging markets. That will be driven by the launch of new products, of which there are many this year, new registration. So, the expansion of our product lines and the launch of new or improved products that have significant potential in these markets. So that will drive some of it. We\u2019re still rolling out geographic expansion. That will drive some growth and then we\u2019ve got good momentum in a number of these markets. So I think certainly on the emerging side, it\u2019s all going, I\u2019d say pretty much according to what we would expect.The European piece or developed market piece, in effect we\u2019re talking about Europe, I\u2019d say if that can stabilize and that\u2019s getting an awful lot of attention from us from a stability standpoint, that would help. If you can stem the bleeding in Europe, that would be a tremendous plus. It is a profitable business. It is a cash generating business, but from a growth, when you meld the two together, the appearance of growth appears to be diluted of course as you point out and what we\u2019ve got to do is I think break out on an ongoing basis here and communicate for investors so they can see both pieces because they\u2019re really two different tales.Operator","Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.David R. Lewis - Morgan StanleyGood morning. Maybe one quick question for Tom and then for Miles. Tom, when we think about the first half of the year where you gave much better visibility, if we think about the acceleration from first to second quarter, I think it sets up nicely for the acceleration story for the whole year. So I wanted to come back to the first half of the year. I think if you think about the first quarter to second quarter, is it really two components? First, the headwinds are fading which are largely vascular as well as the nutritional distribution and that gets you from low singles to mid. I guess what I\u2019m really asking is to get from mid to that upper end or upper single digit part of the guidance, what are the key growth areas that get you from mid to high? And if you could just confirm that to get from low to mid it\u2019s more the vascular and nutritional distribution.Thomas FreymanWell, there\u2019s a lot of things going and as I\u2019d remind you from my remarks, the first quarter and really you\u2019ll be looking at dollars and the Yen. The first quarter is the one quarter where we\u2019re still getting a pretty tough exchange comparison of around 1.5 points on the topline. So that\u2019s certainly part. You\u2019re correct that this lapping of the Japan piece is probably the biggest anomaly. The second after that is the direct distribution getting better as we go through the quarters throughout the year. And just frankly, a lot of the execution we are expecting across these businesses, in businesses such as EPD and really the momentum we\u2019re starting to see as nutrition exits 2012 is what\u2019s going to continue to build throughout the year. So I think it\u2019s a matter of building momentum.","Vascular, we shouldn\u2019t dismiss the potential second half benefits of ABSORB and MitraClip doing better in Europe, the expedition benefits we think we\u2019re going to get in the market. Vascular we\u2019re expecting to see a nice pickup in momentum as we move from the first quarter on through the year. So there are a number of elements of it. Just to remind and I want to be sure from your question that it\u2019s clear to investors, our full year estimated growth over the baseline is mid to upper single digits growth. So I think that level of growth across the quarters with maybe a little bit better in the back and as we said, a little bit softer in the first quarter is the way to think about the year. So I think there are a lot of things going on that are going to accelerate the growth and we feel confident about that.David R. Lewis - Morgan StanleyVery clear, Tom. And then Miles, maybe more of a strategic question. You\u2019ve been very clear about the growth objectives and the growth potential of New Abbott. If you think about capital allocation, what should investors be prepared for over the next couple of years? You have a dividend, an extremely clean balance sheet that\u2019s likely to get cleaner by the end of the year. So in the first two years of the development of the New Abbott growth story, is this more dividend share repurchased or is this more dividend with selective M&A? What should investors be prepared for over the next couple of years as it relates to capital deployment?","Miles WhiteWell, I think we've been clear that there is a certain level of dividend and share repurchase that investors have come to expect from us on a relatively reliable, steady, even growing basis. We've not been one to do big spikes of share repurchase, et cetera to \u2013 we believe more in a steady return to shareholders over time. And I think it\u2019s important that we live to that steady and reliable return to shareholder identity. I got some feedback from investors in the fall both positive -- more positive I guess about dividend. People like the reliability of income but they always want more income. And the payout ratios between the two companies now in the split are different. They are combined greater than what Abbott paid up through the end of last year on a percent of EPS basis.But AbbVie pays proportionality higher as a percentage of EPS, we now pay proportionally lower as a percentage of EPS. But both are growing dividends. And I got feedback from some thoughtful investors about that and I always listen to investors, but I would say at this point we have communicated at least and opening philosophy of the dividend payout. But frankly, could that change with time, it could. But I would tell you that the change is, it\u2019s likely to increase not do anything else.So because we actually believe in a cash return to our investors in a dividend like fashion. Now buried in your question there was that secret little, what about M&A thing. And we have had a track record in the past of occasionally adding pieces to our business when it made the most economic sense for us etcetera. And while that hasn\u2019t been an area of high focus in the last one to two years, that\u2019s been largely because I don\u2019t think there has been as much that was attractive to us and we were consumed with the work required to split the companies.As I communicated with a lot of our investors in the fall, we are always kind of paying attention and tracking what might make sense. But my criteria are always the same, it strategically has to fit. What we are doing, where we are headed, what we are trying to accomplish and so forth. And it\u2019s got to make economic sense. Got to make economic sense, deal sense for us, it\u2019s got to make economic and deal sense for our investors. And I would say, our track record is such we have been pretty thoughtful and pretty careful about that, been fairly selective etcetera.I don\u2019t rule it out, but I would tell you that the projections that we have right now for the business going forward for 2013 and beyond, don\u2019t require it. We don\u2019t have some gap in there where we are projecting returns or projecting growth that we don\u2019t know that we can deliver with what we already have. So I look at the M&A opportunities or licensing opportunities as opportunistic. And if you ask me, are there some of those are on our radar screen, I would say, yes, and I had communicated that you know the categories that have attraction for us tend to be in device areas or some geographic expansion, perhaps in some selective categories of pharma etcetera, that we have communicated. But they are fairly defined. I mean they are real broad.And beyond that I almost never project what we are going to be interested in or what we are watching or what we are doing for all the competitive reasons that you can imagine. The press seems to do a pretty good job of speculating on just about everything that comes to market that Abbott might be interested in. More often than not, we aren\u2019t. We have got in our own minds what we know will fit well with our business, suppose it makes for great media to speculate from time to time. But in any case, we like to keep some of our powder dry so that we are prepared if a good opportunity comes along. So we like to keep some liquidity in our hands and we don\u2019t like to let too much liquidity sit in our hands and earn little. So we keep a balance of dividend in there.And frankly, if we accumulate a lot of cash and we just don\u2019t seem to finding opportunities for it, than we buy back shares and give it back to investors. I know that\u2019s a long winded answer but that\u2019s really kind of it.Operator","Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.David Roman - Goldman SachsAs I look across the number of the businesses in the fourth quarter, there was a nice acceleration versus a slowing in Q3. And I guess more specifically I would point out nutritionals, molecular, diagnostics, diabetes, and medical optics. Can you maybe just talk about some of the dynamics underpinning that uptick in growth? And I guess the reason I asked that is that a lot of the guidance that you are providing for certain segments also does point to growth improving throughout the course of 2013. So maybe you could just provide some perspective to the yearend turnaround? And then what are the drivers to allow that to continue and hit the numbers that you're putting out there?Miles WhiteDavid, I'll take a little crack at framing this and then I'll let Tom and Brian chime in here. I'd say, first of all, while we like nice sequential smooth quarters, the world doesn't actually provide us that. The world doesn't act in smooth fashion. And our third quarter tends to always be, I guess I'd say the slowest of the four of the year because of obvious seasonal impacts and so forth. Whether it's exchange or any of the temporal events that Tom talked about earlier during the course of the year, that obviously has some impact too. Over the course of the year, there were a number of programs or projects that we undertook that you'd begin to see the fruition come to you in the latter part of the year to jumpstart 2013. So I'd say a lot of that is at play here and some of it's just plain old economy in some places or the launch of products taking hold.As we look at 2013, Tom indicated, we're still lapping some of the one-time events of the early part of the year, particularly exchange and so even '13 won't look particularly beautiful in terms of smoothness. It will look like the tale of two halves; a slower first half and a much more robust second half, and that's not really a hockey stick in there as much as it\u2019s comparisons. The underlying true growth of the business is nice and solid, and the launch and timing of products and so forth, solid. So one of our challenges for the year is giving you good visibility to that quarterly gating and what underlying momentum is. Mike called out earlier there's a need I think too for analysts and investors to know what the baseline is they're comparing to.And so we've got to be able to give you here, I'd say, by the end of the first quarter or in the first quarter call what the quarterly breakdown is of Abbott separated from AbbVie, which this carve-out completion will give us, and then we'll be able to more precisely show you, here's the underlying momentum, here's those one-time or bigger offsets like exchange that swing so much. And then I think underneath that you'll see \u2013 we've got to breakdown as I said when I was answering Mike's question about the branded generics business, you\u2019ve got to look at the components. You\u2019ve got to look at the emerging market piece, you\u2019ve got to look at the European piece, and we can show you that separately so that you can see what parts of the business are truly driving growth and where we've got our challenges with austerity measures and so forth.So I think all of that plays in. We've got to sort it out for you, because as we know going forward this is not a business where we're tracking HUMIRA and everything else. We've got to give you some insight into all the individual pieces. I would say the underlying growth of the businesses, as we say, is significant and promising and we think it\u2019s mid-to-high-single, and there's some events that happened over the course of the year, including product launches and so forth that drive us toward that higher single that we want to see. Brian, Tom, you guys want to add to that?Thomas Freyman","Yeah. David, I think Brian will just cover a couple of the business as you talked about where the momentum did pick up in the quarter and give you a little more color on that. Why don't you go ahead, Brian?Brian Yoor","Hi David. Let me start with Nutritionals. As you saw in the quarter, we performed at double-digits. We were up double-digits year-over-year, and we had strong performance both in the U.S. as well as our international business. We've been seeing strong performance out of the U.S. all year. In this quarter we saw particularly continued strong performance from our up-age toddler brands and we have PediaSure and Pedialyte there that have been performing double-digits; PediaSure, most notably consistently throughout the year. We also maintained as you know the share leadership there in the U.S. market as far as our infant formula market, where we have a commanding share lead. As we move into 2013, this may moderate a little bit, but we're up against the market in infant formula. That\u2019s relatively flat. However, we have a lot of momentum from our PediaSure and Pedialyte that will continue into next year that will help offset that.Also we have on our adult business has been growing very strong. It's been growing double digits in the Ensure business for the U.S. and a lot of this comes from new product launches. We've launched a lot of products across our Ensure line, most notably Ensure Complete and we're seeing that these innovations matter. And as Miles mentioned, we had 80 product launches this year across nutrition. So that's been a real differentiator for our portfolio. If you switch over to international, and you take out what we have been talking about these headwinds on the distribution, as we change how we distribute to our end customer, we have been growing double-digits in our Nutrition business. This quarter, we didn't have any headwinds from the distribution programs that we are working through, and what you're seeing is now the results coming through on a peer basis. We have very nice momentum in China, where sequentially we're gaining share and we continue to plan to do so as well into next year. And then if you take a lot of the key emerging markets in nutrition, we are growing double-digits and consistently have been.David Roman - Goldman SachsOkay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow up to that and maybe, Miles, you could help me think. Just on a longer-term basis where you think conceptually about the growth rate of the business and the top line, that it\u2019s sort of a combination of emerging markets growth driven by strengthening of those economies, lab build out, higher healthcare consumption. And what drives the acceleration in the over top line is really EM becoming a larger percentage of total and the higher segments like nutritional starting to comprising a bigger part of the business. And then a backstop on that new product launches in things like vascular and medical optics and diabetes to at least keep those businesses stable. Is that a fair way to think about the long term growth rate?Miles WhiteWell, I think about the long-term growth rate in a couple of ways. First of all you are right, the emerging markets have their own tailwinds. You know their own wave, if you will. And in those markets I want a bigger surfboard to ride that wave and I think that\u2019s a question of expanding product lines. Whether it\u2019s registrations in the pharmaceutical business or more product innovations in the nutrition business, or taking our device businesses more thoroughly into those markets, which we are doing.We are seeing great opportunity for all of them as those economies and those healthcare systems develop and the sophistication of medicine practice there expand. We are seeing the impact of that on diagnostics, we are seeing it in our coronary business, we are seeing it in our medical optics business. They are all benefiting from that. And the Abbott presence there and the Abbott brand there is actually a big boost to that. I would tell you that -- I recall a consultant telling me about five years ago that there was no point in diagnostics being in China. Five years later I am glad we ignored that. You know it\u2019s a fantastic market for us. We fit well there. It\u2019s great growth and great profitability on top of it so we are in a nice position there.So those markets that have their own tailwind of expansion and growth are great. And it still behooves us to expand and tailor our product lines and so forth to those markets which we are doing. Developed markets are still of very high importance and interest to us. And I think that to be forthright about it, it\u2019s a little different story. You are not relying on the tailwind of growth, you have to take share and you have to do it by demonstrating to the payor and\/or the customer that your value or your cost position relative to what you deliver is valuable and worth it.And hence our offerings in diagnostics, we will pay a lot of attention to that going forward. I think we have got great opportunity in diagnostics in these markets, in core diagnostics, that I think our business today is demonstrating already with its high single-digit growth rate, mid to high single digit growth rate in Europe and other developed countries and economies. So what we know is, in our next generation products and systems, they need to be even more cost effective for us to have a good value proposition in those markets on a sustainable basis.So I think the developed markets are still awfully attractive to us. I think the nutrition business has shown that even in markets where birth rates are declining, we are taking share. The U.S. stent is just a prime example. And we can grow and expand and create an adult nutrition market because we can show that it\u2019s got merit and value and in a lot of cases we are putting the clinical evidence behind our products to show that.So there are opportunities. Our EPD business, as you know, will struggle for a while in developed markets. And we are looking at all the ways that we might staunch that. But I think -- and in our devices I would say, as has been pointed out many times by those people who followed the device markets, particularly the coronary device markets or vascular device markets. This is no longer a market where you just bring a new innovation out or a new technology, price it higher and the market expands to absorb the cost.Today, whether it's countries in Europe or hospitals in the United States or anywhere, they've got a fixed budget. They've only got so much to spend and they are trying to make that fixed amount of money cover as much innovation as they can. And I think that means that companies like us change our strategy. We've got probably the most thorough and powerful product line, top-to-bottom, in the stent category. And our job is to take share out of a fixed revenue pool, fixed profit pool out there, and I'd say that probably forecasts a change to our strategy. And we think we've got the wherewithal to alter that strategy and take share and grow in our business and actually achieve the returns for the innovation we've invested in.So, I think those developed markets are ones where competition is such you got to take share, and in the emerging markets you're going to ride a wave of tail-winded growth. And from our perspective, we think that the leadership positions we have in each of our businesses, the product lines we offer and the things that we have on the board for our pipeline are all well-defined and well-designed for exactly that and that we'll see lower growth rates out of developed markets, higher growth rates out of emerging markets and what I would characterize as very durable growth on ongoing basis.David Roman - Goldman SachsOkay. Let me just take one real quick one here, since you didn't put numbers out on HUMIRA. Any perspective you can provide on inventory build or price versus volume growth in the quarter? It looked like a pretty good number there?Thomas FreymanWell, I can tell you that Rick Gonzalez won't want me answering any of his questions. I'm going to leave it for him next week to ask him about HUMIRA, because I now live in a no-HUMIRA world here.David Roman - Goldman SachsI had to try. Thank you very much for the perspective and detail.Operator","Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS ResearchGood morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the U.S. Nutritionals business and specifically the adult segment. The growth there was pretty robust and I know you've provided guidance for the U.S. Nutritionals business overall, but maybe talk about what your \u2013 what we can really anticipate over a longer period of time for the U.S. adult business and what kind of opportunities you see there? Thanks.Thomas FreymanAs Brian indicated in his \u2013 when he answered the question a bit earlier, we've just \u2013 even though the infant side of this market is a little tougher because of birthrates and the like, we've just had outstanding brand execution on the PediaSure and the Ensure and a number of our brands really across the portfolio and it does come down to innovation. When we can bring out a differentiated product that delivers value for customers, we're finding we can take share in the various markets, and I think the team did a truly outstanding job at that in 2012. For 2013, we have a little bit lower growth expectation in that business and to the contrary a little bit higher growth expectation on the international side. So overall higher growth for the nutrition business overall and really it's just continued brand execution and more or less offsetting a flattish instant market that we've been experiencing. That's an area where clearly we'd like to continue to take share and gain some growth and the team is focused on that. So I think in the U.S., more of a mid to upper sustainable growth rate is probably more in the range, but I think that team aspires to push towards upper single growth and that's what we'll continue to target longer term as we build this business.Rajeev Jashnani \u2013 UBS ResearchAnd I did \u2013 this follows on to Mike's question earlier about getting to EPD and the performance in Western Europe in a little bit more detail. You talked about perhaps taking some measures to improve the performance there in Western Europe with respect to EPD. Could you go into a little bit more detail as to what your options are to change the trajectory there?Thomas FreymanAs we've talked about before on EPD, this team is really moving into its full execution mode after coming together from the disparate businesses, a lot of focus on commercial execution in this market. And then there has been some cost management as well in this side. So we're trying to be sure that the costs are in line with the revenue opportunities and I'd say those are the two key things. We're open to product opportunities coming out of the various product pipelines, including areas like the collaborations we've had, et cetera. To the extent we can bring those to the market that should offset some of the austerity measures. The last thing I'd say is while the last 12 to 18 months have been tough from an austerity perspective, as we exit 2012 and as we go into 2013, I think we are seeing a bit of stabilization there and I think the comps in the second half of the year relative to the austerity measures should be better and hopefully the government won't be quite as aggressive as we go forward as they have been, as they've gone through this very, very difficult period the last couple of years.Miles WhiteThe irony of Europe is, depending on the country, but sometimes the price pressure is greater on the generic or branded generic products than the innovative products. And it depends on the country because they do protect innovation and they do protect the patented products. But once of course it\u2019s off patent, then it's a different story. But I think we have felt a fair amount of pressure there and to some degree the impact on the business is a lot less than probably what it could have been. And I think that the innovations that we put into our products, improvements in our products, expansion of the registrations and products on the shelf or adding new products, all of that helps. And it's sort of a -- it's hard to be specific within detail because it kind of depends locally on each market, each country and the mix of product in that country, and I'd say scale that we are on the shelf in that country. But I think Tom has answered it. It's one that we're paying a lot of attention to and in the meantime while we deal with the headwinds in Europe we try to manage cost and expense very tightly.Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital MarketsTwo questions, one for Tom. I wonder if you can help us with the quarterly earnings split for the year. You've given us guidance for 1Q, $0.40 to $0.42. Should we assume 2Q is in that range and then 4Q we get a big hockey stick with EPS north of $0.60? And then any commentary on share count, share repurchase? And then I had a follow-up on nutritionals?Tom FreymanYeah, I'll say just a few things. First of all, when you look at the baseline of the new Abbott businesses, the patterning we're seeing in 2012, there are couple of anomalies as I talked about in my remarks. But overall in general and it's been in this way in this company for number of years with or without the pharmaceutical business, that the second half is generally a more profitable year, growth is driven harder, generally stronger, and margins are a little bit better as we are leveraging that expense base. So, I don't think the patterning you are going to see here is that much different than what you really have seen at Abbott over the years and it's just a function of the business, and as Miles mentioned for example, some of the seasonality factors.So, I think that's one piece of it. And then when you're talking about the second quarter, I think the best thing to do is just to take the profile information I've provided in my remarks and that should give you a good sense of at least this point where we see the quarter coming out and obviously when we get into the first quarter call we'll provide a more specific guidance range. But the intention of trying to give you an early look at the second quarter was to help you kind of build that quarterly gating before we get this final baseline out in front of you. So, I think it's -- and as I said in my remarks, when you cut through the anomalies you're going to find that the year-over-year growth quarter-to-quarter is pretty consistent across the year.Miles White","You're not going to have to wait for the fourth year to see it, Glenn, fourth quarter, rather.Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital MarketsOkay. And then any commentary on share repurchase or shares outstanding?Tom FreymanWell, we had a pretty active year in 2012 and we are definitely planning a level of share repurchase for 2013. Obviously with the separate company our relative amounts perspective changes, but I think it will be meaningful and at this point we're just not going to provide forecast on what that will be.Miles White","We continue to have robust cash flow.Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital MarketsOkay. And then let me ask you just a follow-up on nutritional, and specifically on China. That's one area of concern that I hear with investors and that is, China in the nutritional market is slowing. And I think the investors hear that because that's commentary coming from Mead Johnson. So, Miles, can you talk about the size of your China nutritionals business and how you see that market? I'm assuming your growth is accelerating, but commentary would be helpful?Miles WhiteChina is an important market for us. We're not as concentrated solely in China. We're fairly-- we're in 100 countries in our nutrition business across the board, but clearly China is an important one for us, number one. Number two, investors have asked me all during the late fall, gee, are we seeing a slowing in China? The answer is no, we're not. We're actually seeing acceleration and expansion and we're expanding and our growth rate in China is pretty healthy. And I think China, I would tell you, is a very difficult market for investors, analysts, and even the manufacturers to measure from time-to-time. I did see that one of our competitors in the industry there acknowledged inventory challenges in China. It's hard to measure inventory in China and it's hard to keep track of inventory in China. ","We know that. I think the large multinationals that are extremely well established have a better view of that than many. It's one of the reasons to be out of distributors and go direct. You can have a greater control over inventories and so forth. I\u2019ve seen that some competitors have indicated that they may have inventory challenges in the market and it's a hard \u2013 if you got too much inventory in the market you might think the market is slowing. I would tell you the underlying fundamentals of that market don't appear to us to be changing of slowing. So I think that any of us from time-to-time go through little ups and downs of the absorption of our products in that market. It's such a healthy market, such a good market that I think measuring it quarter-to-quarter isn't always that informative. ","You\u2019ve got to look at it over the course of the year and I think our competitors will probably acknowledge the same that it's a very healthy market, still robust and we're all still expanding into more cities. It's intensely competitive. It\u2019s obviously drawn a lot of competitive attention of the large four multinationals, which includes us, Mead, the Europeans do very well in that market and there's some local Chinese manufacturers in the value segments that are also growing and doing well. I don't have much to say about the market except that it's really robust, good and we're not experiencing a slowdown there, Glenn.","Brian Yoor","We have time for one more question. ","Operator","And our final question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Tom, let me start with a financial question. The midpoint of the old guidance that you gave was about $2.03. The tax rate came down a little bit, gives you about $0.02. So that gets you about to $2.05 and the midpoint for today's guidance is $2.01. So am I doing the math right? What changed? And the baseline operating margin -- so I think the midpoint of the operating margin guidance for 2013 in the last call was about 18.5%. What is your best guess as that what that was for the new Abbott in 2012? And then I just have one follow-up.","Thomas Freyman","I'd just like to clarify something. Obviously, this was the first time we\u2019ve provide guidance. On the third quarter call, as we moved into our discussions on the two new companies, we felt it was appropriate to provide some meaningful profile perspectives on both companies, which we did on that call and certainly -- and I think the key message there was from a New Abbott perspective was that given the topline growth and our ability to grow the bottom line and expand margins that we saw this as a double digit grower. So this was the first time we provided guidance. Now, if you look at that profile information, a lot has changed in the world since October, but not a lot has changed in terms of our forecast. We're still very close to that profile that we provided. Tax is a little bit better because of the R&D tax credit which obviously we didn't know about back in October and we've gone through a budgeting process. ","We've looked at final exchange rates, which in a number of countries have moved significantly since October and it\u2019s just a function of completing our budget process, which is why we didn't provide guidance in October because we knew we needed to go through that process before we could provide you a meaningful guidance number. So I think what we're providing today is very, very consistent with what we've talked about in October and anything that \u2013 $0.01 or $0.02 up or down is really a function of just the process we've been going through. So I think that hopefully answers your question there, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Tom, and the R&D tax credit for 2012, did you pushed that into 2013? And then I just wanted to ask, on the Established Pharma, the potential impact to the new drug pricing list in India, can you talk a little bit about that? We've gotten some questions on it. I think you guys have roughly $800 million to $1 billion of exposure in India, and I'll drop. Thank you.","Thomas Freyman","Yeah. So the 2012 R&D tax credit, which as most investors know who have been following the story, very odd for all companies, the way this has to be handled. Since Congress didn't approve the law until after the 31st of December, the accounting impact of getting the 2012 credit actually becomes a 2013 accounting event. That is not reflected in our ongoing guidance. We're planning to call that out as a specified good news item, if you will, in our quarterly reporting in 2013 and that is not reflected. What is included in the guidance is the regular 2013 R&D credit, which is now law, which we can count on as we move through the year. With regard to your question on India, obviously there has been a fair amount of discussion with various ministries on the pricing environment in India. ","As one might expect, this has gone through a quite a range of discussion. The most recent feedback on this was more of a market-based model, which is much more consistent with the way we view the appropriate approach towards balancing innovation and customer needs within the market. And if you look at the result of that conclusion, it's very consistent with our planning assumptions for 2013 for the established pharmaceutical division. So, at this point in time we feel good about our assumptions. I know there are additional discussions going on and there is not a final approach towards this, but all information we have at this point is that our assumptions are solid for 2013.","Brian Yoor","Okay.

It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Brian Yoor","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Joining me today on the call will be Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Tom and I will discuss our performance in more detail. Following our comments, Miles, Tom, and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today maybe forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2013. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are disclosed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Good morning. This morning we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.46, exceeding our previous guidance range and we are confirming our full year 2013 EPS outlook for double digit growth. Sales increased more than 4% operationally, led by continued strong performance in emerging markets as well as Diagnostics and Nutrition. Abbott continues to deliver on its expectations despite the recent depreciation of several foreign currencies and a mixed global economy.","Before I comment on our results, let me address at a high level some of these dynamics. Our earnings performance was strong despite a more negative impact from foreign currency than we had forecasted in April. As you know, the yen depreciated further over the last few months and was the primary driver of unfavorable exchange. Several emerging market currencies also weakened late in the second quarter. This resulted in an unfavorable exchange impact on sales of 1.7%, more than our forecast of 1%. The underlying fundamentals are good however, especially around gross margin improvement and expense management, which all are progressing ahead of schedule.","As we look at total company's sales, our results were strong in our growth markets and in line with our expectations in developed markets. Sales in developed markets declined about 1% in foreign exchange, which was less of a decline than we saw in the first quarter. Our businesses in these markets are generally more subject to reimbursement and austerity pressures. However, in Diagnostics, one of our most durable growth businesses, sales in developed markets increased 3% for exchange.","While these markets continue to be challenging, we do expect better performance in the second half. Emerging market sales were $2.3 billion this quarter, increasing 13% before exchange similar to our first quarter growth rate. We built a broad emerging market base that helps to offset volatility that can occur in any one market.","With more than 40% of our business in emerging markets, we are well positioned to benefit from the long-term demographic and economic trends that are taking place. While we can't perfectly predict the macro environment, we can manage our business to deliver durable and reliable results for shareholders. We've done that consistently for years and we are able to do that, because we have flexibility. We plan for contingencies and we often times drive outperformance in other areas of our business.","This quarter, we exceeded our gross margin forecast of 54.5%, delivering gross margin of 55% as a result of continued progress on our margin improvement initiatives. We now expect our full year gross margin to exceed our original guidance. This was the result of continued momentum from margin improvement in Nutrition and Diagnostics, where we are ahead of our initial targets.","With that as context, I'll provide a high level high-level review of our four business segments before Tom and Brian comment on the details of the quarter.","The Medical Devices second quarter performance was in line with our expectations, driven by mid-single digit international growth across vascular, diabetes care and vision care, and as expected, global vascular results improved sequentially, compared to first quarter. We've seen good momentum for many of our recent medical product launches, including OptiBlue cataract IOL in Japan, as well as ABSORB, MitraClip and XIENCE Xpedition expedition, which received approval in Japan last week.","On Monday, we also announced two acquisitions, IDEV which expands our endovascular product portfolio, and OptiMedica, which gives us an immediate entry point into the laser cataract surgery market. While organic growth remains our top priority, these acquisitions bring Abbott leading technologies to capitalize on growth opportunities.","IDEV's SUPERA stent is on the market in Europe and under FDA review to address the challenges of treating the superficial femoral artery or SFA. Treatment of the SFA is the largest and fastest-growing segment of the peripheral market driven by the rising rates of diabetes and obesity. This acquisition rounds out our endovascular portfolio with the best-in-class technology to further penetrate this market segment. Our endovascular business is approaching $500 million in annual sales and increased 4% operationally this quarter.","OptiMedica's state-of-the-art laser system provides Abbott access to the rapidly developing laser cataract surgery market. Most cataract procedures are performed manually today, but a growing portion of the cataract market is moving to a laser-assisted surgery, especially as the market shifts to premium IOLs. The acquisition of OptiMedica will allow Abbott to have broader reach in the growing cataract segment, cataract sales represent more than 60% of our vision care sales and this quarter increased in the high-single digits as we build momentum with several new products that launched in the first half of this year. We expect to complete both of these acquisitions before year end.","In Nutrition, worldwide sales increased 8.5% with equally strong performance in both, pediatric and adult nutrition. International sales increased 18.5%, driven by strong double-digit growth in emerging markets. We have broad reach around the world and have prioritized a group of markets, where we are expanding our footprint. This includes localizing R&D and building out local manufacturing. Our three new facilities in China, India, and U.S. remain on track to come online later this year or early next year.","Abbott's scientific heritage and new product development is critical to our success and leadership in the Nutrition market. As I mentioned last quarter, we are on track for approximately 70 new product launches this year and have completed more than 40 through the first half.","It's not only new products but the world of clinical data that allow us to grow, to shape and further penetrate these markets. For example in our Adult Nutrition business, results from a health economic study announced last month demonstrates that supplementing with Oral Nutrition such as Ensure can decrease hospital length of stay, reduce hospitalization costs, and readmission rates. With healthcare systems facing unprecedented budget pressures and challenges, these results are encouraging and represent an opportunity in both developed and emerging markets.","Nutrition operating margin also increased significantly again this quarter and we are on track to exceed 300 basis points of expansion for the full year. Our initial target of 20% is well within our reach and we intend to continue to look at ways to exceed that goal.","In our established pharmaceuticals division, sales were below our expectations. Global economic growth forecasts are lower than when we began the year. Last week the IMF reduced its growth outlook driven by lower growth expectations in Europe and emerging markets, and while we are seeing some impact from these market developments, we also need to improve our commercial execution.","To that point, we recently created two new commercial leadership positions that have separate responsibility for emerging and developed markets. This will sharpen our focus on the very different market specific needs in this business and enable us to achieve the growth targets that we have set.","We have some work to do to improve how we promote the Abbott brand through various channels, whether at hospitals, pharmacies, or the consumer. We are continuing to build our product portfolios through registrations targeted for specific markets, and geographically we will see a shift in sales to more high growth emerging markets from 60% today to 75% over the next several years, which will also accelerate growth.","While we continue to expect EPD sales growth to pick up in the second half, we now have more modest expectations for the pace of that acceleration. We are positive about the growth prospects for EPD and its strategy as we move forward. We obviously have some things to do here.","Diagnostics continues to deliver on its expectations with worldwide sales up 7.5%. Sales in emerging markets, which represent 35% of total diagnostics sales, were up more than 15% in the quarter. This was led by Core Laboratory Diagnostics, where we continue to outpace market growth in our priority markets; China, Brazil, and Russia.","In Molecular Diagnostics, we returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter with sales up 13%. In June, we also launched the first FDA-approved Hepatitis C genotype test, which allows physicians to match patients to the best treatment option based on their genotype. This is especially important as patients will benefit from many new pharmaceutical treatments over the next few years.","The Diagnostics operating margin also came in ahead of our expectations as we continue to execute on our gross margin improvement plan. Despite the R&D investment we have been making for six new system platforms across our three diagnostics businesses, we are well ahead of schedule to reach our initial operating margin target of 20%.","In summary, despite currency headwinds, our performance exceeded expectations. We are executing on our strategic priorities and confirmed our double-digit EPS growth target for the full year.","I will now turn the call over to Tom to review our second quarter results and the 2013 outlook in more detail. Tom?","Thomas Freyman","Thanks, Miles. Today, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.46, exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales for the quarter increased more than 4% on an operational basis, that is excluding an unfavorable impact of 1.7% from foreign exchange. The impact of foreign exchange on sales was 70 basis points more unfavorable in the quarter than the estimate we provided in April, reflecting further depreciation of the Japanese Yen, and weakening of several emerging market currencies late in the quarter.","Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses, including growth of more than 13% in emerging markets. Reported sales, which include the impact of exchange, increased 2.5% in the quarter. The second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55%, ahead of our previous guidance due to the impact of margin improvement initiatives in our Nutrition and Diagnostics businesses as well as a lower headwind from exchange relative to previous expectations. In the quarter, ongoing R&D investment was 6.5% of sales in line with previous expectations and ongoing SG&A was around 31% of sales, somewhat lower than previous expectations.","Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2013. Today, we are confirming our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04, which reflects double-digit growth over 2012 at the mid-point of the range. We're forecasting operational sales growth, that is excluding the impact of foreign exchange, in the mid-to-high single digits for the second half of the year.","Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full-year reported sales, which was 1.5% more negative than previous expectations. At current rates, we would expect a 3% negative impact on sales in the third quarter and 4% in the fourth. Brian will review the growth outlooks by business in a few minutes.","We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 55.5%, which is favorable to our previous guidance, primarily due to strong performance in Nutrition and Diagnostics as these businesses continue to execute well on margin improvement initiatives.","We also continue to forecast ongoing R&D of 6% to 7% of sales and ongoing SG&A expense somewhat above 30% of sales for the full-year 2013. Overall, we project our full year adjusted operating margin to expand by more than 100 basis points in 2013, somewhat above our previous guidance.","We continue to forecast net interest expense of around $110 million in 2013, non-operating income of approximately $20 million and around $50 million of expense on the exchange gain-loss line of the P&L.","Turning to the outlook for the third quarter of 2013, which we are providing for the first time, we are forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.51 to $0.53, which would represent strong double-digit growth at the mid-point of the range. We forecast specified items of $0.20 in the third quarter, primarily associated with intangible amortization expense and cost reduction initiatives resulting in GAAP EPS guidance of $0.31 to $0.33.","Our operational sales growth in the third quarter is expected to be in the mid-to-high single digits. And, as previously indicated, at current exchange rates, we expect roughly 3% negative impact from exchange on sales in the fourth quarter. This would result in reported sales growth in the low-to-mid single digits.","We forecast an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55.5% of sales in the third quarter, which includes a negative impact from exchange of somewhat more than 1%. We also forecast ongoing R&D for the third quarter somewhat about 6.5% of sales ongoing SG&A expense of around 30% of sales and non-operating income of around $50 million.","With that, I will turn it over to Brian for the operating highlights by business.","Brian Yoor","Thanks, Tom. This morning I'll provide an overview of second quarter performance and our outlook for the third quarter. My comments will focus on operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. I'll first discuss Medical Devices, which includes our vascular, diabetes care vision care businesses.","In our Vascular business, worldwide sales were flat on an operational basis, a step up than first quarter performance and consistent with previous guidance. International sales, which comprised more than 60% of total Vascular sales, increased 4% operationally. Growth was driven by new product, including our XIENCE PRIME, small vessels stent in Japan, XIENCE Xpedition, ABSORB and MitraClip.","Last week, we announced the approval of XIENCE Xpedition in Japan, which we expect to drive further share gains. This approval follow the initiation of our ABSORB randomized clinical trial in Japan, reaffirming Abbott's commitment to developing truly innovative treatment options for coronary artery disease. U.S. vascular sales in the second quarter were down nearly 7%, impacted by market declines, partially offset by year-over-year share gains as a result of the XIENCE Xpedition launch.","For the third quarter of 2013, we expect our global vascular business to increase in the low-single digits on an operational basis. We expect to improve our performance in the second half of the year with the uptake of XIENCE Xpedition in the U.S. and Japan, and continue penetration of our new products MitraClip and ABSORB.","In Diabetes Care, global sales in the second quarter were relatively flat in line with our expectations. International sales growth of 4% was driven by double-digit growth in the emerging markets, as well as the continued uptake of our FreeStyle InsuLinx Meter.","Abbott was recently selected as the exclusive supplier for the National Diabetes Awareness Program in Saudi Arabia, a country where 40% of the population has diabetes today. In the U.S., we saw continued share gains in the hospital and retail segments, where Abbott maintains its leadership position, offset by market pricing and reimbursement pressures. We continue to invest in the next-generation sensing technology which we expect to initially bring to market in Europe in the second half of 2014. We project third quarter diabetes care sales growth to be relatively flat on an operational basis. As we have previously discussed, while we are forecasting strong growth in emerging markets, the 2013 implementation of CMS competitive bidding for Medicare patients will impact our U.S. sales this year.","In Vision Care, global operational sales increased approximately 2% in the second quarter. Cataract sales, which represent about 60% of our global vision care sales, continued to outpace the market in the quarter led by strong double-digit growth in emerging markets and our TECNIS brand of intraocular lenses. We expect to see continued growth in our cataract business driven by several important new product launches this year.","This includes the recent launch of TECNIS OptiBlue in Japan, which provides Abbott access to the largest segment of the Japan market and TECNIS Toric in the U.S. which gives Abbott access to the faster growing premium segment of the IOL market. The anticipated launch TECNIS Preloaded IOL in the U.S. will also contribute to accelerated growth in the second half of the year. For the third quarter, in our global vision care business, we expect mid-single-digit operational sales growth, an improvement versus first half of the year as we continue to drive cataract growth with new launches and execute in emerging markets.","In Nutrition, global sales increased 8.4% in the second quarter on an operational basis. International nutrition sales grew 18.4% in the quarter, including strong double-digit growth in emerging markets, which now comprise more than 45% of total nutrition sales. Global pediatric nutrition sales grew 9% operationally in the quarter. International pediatric sales grew 19% as we continue to execute on a number of geographic expansion initiatives and launch new product innovations including the global rollout of our specialty tolerance formula products. U.S. pediatric sales were down modestly largely due to lower infant formula share in the WIC segment. Abbott remains the market leader in non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market.","Global adult nutrition sales was comprised nearly 45% of total nutrition sales increased 7% operationally in the quarter. International adult sales grew 17%, driven by strong growth of Ensure and execution in market expansion initiatives. U.S. adult nutrition sales were negatively impacted this quarter by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin improvement initiative. Excluding the impact of these exits, U.S. adult sales grew low single-digit.","As Miles mentioned earlier, a recent health economic study published in The American Journal of Managed Care found that nutritional supplementation in the hospital setting decreased hospital length of stay and total episode cost by more than 20% and reduced the likelihood of being readmitted to hospital within 30 days by nearly 7%. As the clear global leader in adult nutrition, we are working to expand the market by raising awareness of the role that proper nutrition can play in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect our global nutrition business to grow double digits on an operational basis with strong international sales growth led by emerging markets and continued uptake of recently launched products.","In our established pharmaceutical business or EPD, sales in the quarter were flat on an operational basis as growth in emerging markets was offset by decline in the developed markets. We continue to expand our presence and build local portfolios in 14 key emerging markets. Sales in these markets grew approximately 4.5% in the quarter and was somewhat negatively impacted by timing of product deliveries in certain markets, as well as implementation of the drug price control order in India which caused some delays in customer purchase late in the quarter.","We expect growth in our 14 key emerging markets to improve in the second half of the year with strong growth in a number of emerging countries, including Brazil and India. As expected, growth in other markets which includes Western Europe and Japan, was negatively impacted by overall macroeconomic conditions in these countries, including European austerity measures.","In the third quarter, we expect low single-digit operational sales growth from our established pharmaceuticals' business as we see improving growth in emerging markets due to portfolio expansion and execution of recent tender wins. Lastly, in our Diagnostics businesses, Core Lab diagnostics continued its durable growth with operational sales increasing 6% in the quarter. About 80% of our core laboratory diagnostics sales are generated outside the U.S., where we saw more than 8% operational growth in the quarter.","Sales in emerging markets increased double digits, led by China and Russia, both growing more than 30%. In Molecular Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 13% on an operational basis in the second quarter, in line with our expectations for accelerated growth versus the first quarter. International sales increased nearly 18% on an operational basis, led by strong infectious disease growth, particularly in emerging markets driven by the impact of new tenders, as well as the continued global expansion of our ALK gene test for non-small-cell lung cancer.","In June, we received approval for the first FDA approved hepatitis C virus genotyping test in the U.S., which will enable physicians to create a personalized, targeted diagnosis and treatment path to improve clinical outcomes, further expanding Abbott's diagnostic testing options in infectious disease area.","In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 15.5% on an operational basis, driven by continued growth in the U.S. Hospital segment, further penetration in the U.S. physician office labs and strong double-digit growth in emerging markets.","For the third quarter, we are forecasting our global diagnostics business segment to generate high single-digit operational sales growth driven by continued strong double-digit growth in molecular and Point of Care Diagnostics, and mid-to-high single-digit growth in core labs.","So, in summary, we are pleased with our financial performance through the first half of the year. We delivered earnings per share in the second quarter that exceeded our previous guidance range. And, despite a challenging global economy and recent fluctuations in currencies, we are confirming our 2013 ongoing EPS guidance.","We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Let me start with a couple of questions for Miles. Can you hear me okay?","Miles White","I hear you fine.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","So, Miles, how do you view the broader macroeconomic conditions and dynamics, both in the developed world as well as the emerging markets, including the impact of currency and maybe some color on how this impacts Abbott and your performance in the quarter and beyond?","Miles White","Well, I will take the macro environment first. I think whenever the economies of the world, wherever they may be go into some recession or phase into some kind of adversity, at least as businesses and investors look at it, I think the natural tendency is to always forecast they are going to recover faster than they do. They recover gradually, and I think that's what we are going to see here.","I mean, I think, if you look back over the last few years and listen to all involve the pundits and analysts and everybody else talk about the macro environment and the pace of recovery and so forth, I think, optimism and hope and so forth have driven a lot of wishful thinking that it is going to happen faster than it does, but frankly the problems of Europe or even the U.S. have been more serious and deep. They don't recover that fast, so that rolls through to markets and it obviously rolls through to emerging markets too, because they are so integral to now the global economy.","So, I guess I would look at it and say I think it is all getting better. I think it is going to get better, but it's going to be at a measured pace, and I don't think it's going to just suddenly be better and sometimes the trading in the market for the Dow everyday certainly doesn't reflect that. We have great days of exuberance and others days that aren't so exuberant, but. overall I think it's pretty steady. Now, as I have said in the past, there's a pretty big difference here and we can see it in our business between, call it, emerging markets and very developed economies.","You take the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, et cetera as the developed markets and call the rest of the world evolving or emerging growth markets. There is a big difference here. We can see it in our various businesses as we look down the list of our businesses and we look at developed market growth and emerging market growth, it's dramatic. It's consistent. It's consistent for us except for one business and that one business is a pretty good measure of market health and market performance and that would be our branded generic drug business where it's frankly more our performance than anything else of our own execution.","So we look at those businesses and in almost every case, the performance in emerging markets is either very high-single digit or frankly really healthy robust double-digit growth, and if you look across the developed markets, it's at best, single-digit and in a lot of cases, flat and declining. I think we are in a phase where those developed markets are absorbing all the austerity measures and other things that they had to absorb. So, there is a pretty dramatic barbell here between the robustness of emerging markets and the sluggishness of developed markets and we happen to be indexed in both, I think that\u2019s a good thing, and we are broadly represented in the emerging markets. As I said a couple of times, a bad day in emerging markets is a lot better than a good day in developed markets often.","While those developed markets are very important to us and we have a lot of share, a lot of customers and frankly, make a lot of profit there, as far as growth goes, the emerging markets are more robust. They are volatile sometimes, which is why it is good to be in a broad cross-section of them and not over indexed in a couple, and we are. We are very broadly represented across these markets and in a broad group of businesses. So I would tell you, every day there is something concerning some market, some country somewhere, but overall in the kind of the market basketball, that is a pretty strong overall economic picture and performance that I think has great long-term longevity.","Now, having said that, it translates this volatility in currency too. As a lot of these countries become a bigger part of our sales or other multinational sales, we are adjusting to less obsession about the Euro and a lot moresession about a whole basket of currencies that aren\u2019t nearly as predictable and often aren\u2019t as widely traded and so forth. So, this year, the Yen has been a significant driver of negative currency, as I think is understood by all of our investors and shareholders and analysts and yourself and so on. In addition, some of the more or larger emerging markets like the BRICs have also contributed lately to that, but I have to say this year it is pretty much dominated by the Yen.","So, in any given year, it\u2019s a different currency that could impact our sales, and because the company is 70% or more international, that\u2019s something that we have to expect to manage and navigate all the time. I would tell you that our shareholders and investors don\u2019t expect to ride that curve with us, they expect us to manage that for them and manage the overall durable performance of the company, and we do and as we are this year.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","It's helpful. Just one follow-up for you, Miles. So your performance in nutrition continues to be strong, particularly in emerging markets. How should we think about the dynamics taking place in China around the infant formula market? Secondly, the sustainability of the extremely high growth this quarter for adult nutrition outside the U.S.? Thanks.","Miles White","I would say it is, there\u2019s anomalies all the time in comparisons and so forth in any given segment of our business, but I would tell you that the demographics and the underlying market factors around our adult nutrition business are all good and they are all positive. While I would never even let myself think that some extremely robust growth rate is sustainable indefinitely, I would tell you that the growth rate of our nutrition business internationally, I think, is pretty sustainable for a long time because all the underlying demographics, whether the adult and pediatric business are all pretty good right now and I think for the foreseeable future.","With regard to the China, I would say I think most investors and most observers understand what's going on here, what's happening here. The government is stepping in to say this market, perhaps, has become a little too robust in a number ways and one might even speculate to the disadvantage of Chinese companies, and I think the government has been clear that it wants to improve it's dairy industry and improve the circumstances in that market.","As you know they had some issue several years ago with the quality of dairy product and so forth, and you got to admire the fact that they make it a point to say, \"Hey, we're going to pay attention to this.\" And at the same time, they are paying attention to how these markets are developing. I mean, they are looking at not only Nutrition, they are looking at pharmaceuticals, they are looking at packaging companies. They are looking at a number of things. I think, China is an unbelievably impressive country, and I think it's an impressive government that's managed its economic development incredibly well.","I think, this is a small piece of that. In fact in almost any way, you kind of look at it and say, off all things you think that the government would pay attention to, infant formula wouldn't make the top of most industries or businesses or list, but in this case along with pharmaceuticals, packaging, and a number of other industry segments, it did. So, I think, we can manage this, I guess, is the way I would put it. My sense of prospects for the Chinese market haven't changed, opportunity remains strong, opportunity remains robust.","I think all the companies that have been mentioned as part of this investigation, have all responded very cooperatively to the Chinese government. I don't know that from talking to anybody, but I have read the press reports and so forth. I know that we've cooperated with their investigation and this too shall pass and I think the market dynamics remain robust.","Fortunately for us, China does not represent a disproportionately large portion of our Nutrition business or even our pediatric nutrition business. It's a big business for us there and we are big there, but we are so broad across so many countries that it does not disproportionately impact our performance, so our prospects and forecasts haven't changed, our EPS forecast haven't changed. We've obviously modeled all that in great detail to the degree that we can. And to the extent that there is any impact on us financially, we believe it is manageable in other ways.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Miles, just a quick question on (Inaudible). It probably was the only business this morning that is performing, that's not a point at or above expectations and I wondered if just give us a sense of whether that you think that is more developed market pressure. Is that more just Abbott's delays with emerging market registrations and I think over the last three to four months a lot of your peers saying this is not a particularly interesting business and maybe you can just comment in terms of the quarter and your views have they changed at all about the ability to drive growth in this segment?","Miles White","I would tell you my over views haven't changed at all. I am glad our peers don't think it's interesting, because we don't need no peers. There's plenty of competition in these markets today. I think these markets are developing exactly as we forecasted and I think the opportunity is what we forecasted.","I think the biggest distinction here, and I don't think it's very well understood by a lot of people is that the branded generic pharmaceutical businesses around the world are different than commodity pharmaceutical or generic pharmaceuticals and they are very different than proprietary research based pharmaceuticals. And, I think one of the execution issues we've had is more of a cultural or philosophical business approach issue, because we have been so dominated by our research-based pharmaceutical business in the past.","You have a business mindset around how you execute against that business and I think it's one of the reasons why few companies have succeeded at having proprietary pharmaceutical businesses and generic pharmaceutical businesses in the same company and I have said in the past I admired them to sell off or be one of the first pioneers of that at Novartis, but we separated them into Novartis and Sandoz and I think rightly so, because the way you operate those businesses the whole marketing approach is just very different.","If I had to say there is one particular thing that has been a shortcoming for us, I think we or our management team have approached this too much like proprietary pharmaceutical and not enough like the different kind of business that it is. This is a business that's very consumer-facing in a lot of countries very brand-dependent, very product line-dependent, meaning breadth of product line and so forth. It's very different game. And, I don't think we have made that transition yet as well as we should happen and I think that's where we would diagnose ourselves as not having executed as well as we should have.","Part of that's registration timing, part of it's the mix of product therapeutic areas and so forth, available, part of it's just our own knowledge and expertise in those areas. So we have separated the markets into two big segments but the fact of the matter is that the countries are all quite different. In any case, the developed markets have common characteristics, emerging markets have common characteristics and we have got to do a much better job of making the adjustment to a branded generic pharmaceutical business.","I would say that while a lot of our peers don\u2019t view this as attractive, there are some of our peers who do and I think we know who our longer term competitors are and who they will be. We think the opportunity is robust. We think we are underperforming and by any measure whether we look at competitor performance, our performance, market performance, share, et cetera, we are underperforming. It pains me to say it but we are.","The good news in that is, I think we can change that and we are taking the steps to change that. So I think our development of this business is going slower than I might like and it sticks out like a sore thumb relative to everything else but nevertheless, expectations of the business and what I think it could do for us remains the same. It\u2019s a very profitable business. Gross margins in the close to 60% range. So it\u2019s a very attractive business, I think, executed like. There hasn\u2019t been a long historic track record in these markets in this kind of a business as we have developed. So there is a lot of pioneering going on here and pioneering by us and Santa Fe and some other great companies that I think understand these markets and are all trying to position themselves properly for the growth of these healthcare systems. So I remain pretty enthusiastic about it.","You asked me about developed markets and I would tell you, that part of this business is declining and it is experiencing all the same pressures that all the businesses in Europe are. Europe, in particular, is tougher with generic products, whether branded or commodity or otherwise and so we are certainly experiencing that too. If there is any part this I am most disappointed about, it's our performance in the emerging side. I expect what's happening in the developed side to keep being that way for a while. I think we can mitigate that to some degree too. But the bigger issues here for us is how we are doing in the emerging markets.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Miles, that\u2019s very, very helpful. Then just maybe a quick follow-up. Either persistent investor, a question (inaudible), in order for Abbott to transform their growth there seems to be the view that you need transformational acquisitions and I guess in your guidance, the mid to upper single-digit growth in the back half of the year which is ahead of your peers, you could choose small incremental deals. So, can you talk to us about the deals that you have done in the last June in recent days, is that more indicative of the kind of deals that we should see and does Abbott need, frankly a larger multibillion-dollar transaction to transform the growth rate?","Miles White","I love the question. If you watch me or us over the last 10 to 15 years, one thing I think you can consistently say is I have never forecasted to anybody what we are doing or what we are looking at or whether you can expect us to be interested in M&A activity. So, I am going to waffle here and not give you a clue.","I wouldn\u2019t want to indicate that there is a trend here of what we are interested in any way, shape or form. I would tell you that I always remain vigilant and watchful about what opportunities may exist for us from a lot of perspectives, both conventional and unconventional and you have seen that over 10 to 12 years. There are times when smaller, what you call bolt-on or whatever supplemental acquisitions fit, and they enhance the given business, then there is other times you make a bigger move. Whatever it is, the timing of those moves tend to be driven by opportunity, valuation, circumstances in the markets and so forth.","One of the things that I think has been a hallmark of our success, at least on the M&A side, it has been that we have done a lot of study, we followed businesses, we follow the market, and follow various things that we are interested in the target for a long time, done a lot of due diligence and so forth and by the time the opportunity drifts into the radar screen in the right way, with the right stars aligned and circumstances, we generally are pretty ready with a fairly well-developed point of view on valuation and so on and will act on the opportunity. The problem is, you can't always predict when that\u2019s going to be.","We can't predict it any better than you can so we can certainly can't forecast it to you, but if you ask me, is there a set of opportunities that we are always watching or always looking for, that might be enhancing the business, the answer is yes. As I have said many times in the past, I am mindful that investors are not looking for things that dilute the current performance of the company and it's also a hurdle for us that we have to know we are going to do with the business and do better with it if we own it and earn and incremental positive return for the investor over and above what it might do standalone.","I will tell you there is a number of things we've looked at out there, where I think valuations are just out of this world stratospheric and unrealistic, and that we've walked away from a lot of things, because we thought valuations were unrealistically high, or expectations were unrealistically high and I don't think there's a particularly robust, shall we say, opportunity set out there in a number of fields today.","There might be a lot of things for sale, but they may not be for sale at a reasonable valuation and I think investors who are interested in that sort of part of us should know, we are careful buyers. We buy when it make sense and when it adds to our business and when we can meet our criteria and when we can do it right for you. And if valuations are too high or we can't make a strategic argument to you of why it's worth whatever it may be, then we don't make the move and that doesn't mean we are only going to do the review as you just saw, the fact that they both had announce the same day was pure coincidence. And, we respond optimistically when the opportunity presents itself, but it's not reacting reviews have been pretty well prepared, so I don't know if that gives you some context, but we always remain vigilant in looking. And for those who think, we need something transformative, my e-mail is public. You can send me those ideas.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Mike Weinstein from JPMC.","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Good morning, Miles. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Miles, if I just kind of step back and talk about the first half of the year, your accounts were a little bit difficult, but I think you would agree that 3.8% of constant currency is kind of not your target for overall Abbott, so other than better execution in the EPD is there anything else that you think is kind of key to getting you to kind of what you originally were hoping which was more mid-to-high single digit?","Miles White","Well, you know there's two businesses that have been a drag on us. One is our performance in EPD and one has been the entire vascular market, which you know because you watch pretty carefully and know better than anybody, but I would say those two things have been a bit of a sluggish drag. No question. And, I think, we are improving both of those. The evidence of that remains to be seen in EPD and I understand the skepticism of investors or analysts on that one, but I am reasonably confident of EPD. I am just frustrated with the pace here.","On vascular, the sequential improvement here is pretty good and our share positions in our core markets is pretty good. I mean, we've got leadership share positions in core stent businesses and so forth.","I think, as it's been pointed out a number of times, our ambitions here are frankly to expand product lines in areas and geographies and so forth and drive a little better growth profile of that business in what is clearly and austere market. However, that still isn't going to be some high double-digit rate or something as you know. So, I am pleased with the progress there, but it's not going to look like it did five, six year ago.","So, we look at expanding and growing in new segments there and you saw a little bit of that earlier in the week with the acquisitions admittedly modest in size. The comment you make about the comparisons in the first half of the year, first half of the year comparisons, they were tougher. Not even modestly tougher, we had difficult comparisons in the first part of the year and just as difficult as those were I would tell you the comps in the second half of the year are equally sort of robust and the opposite direction. I mean, we've got really comps in the second half, so the growth rates that we are going to see here on the bottom line, I look at and they pretty heady and pretty high and we'll hit them, but I certainly wouldn't want you to [trend] line them for the long-term in some respects. They are not one-time, but they more accurately reflect I think the underlying performance of the business.","The underlying performance that grow perform of the business is better than we saw in the first half. And, for the long-term, probably not quite as robust as the mid-20% range you are going to see in the second half here. I am talking on the bottom line. Because, if you look at the guidance and so forth, we know we modeled. We understand what things we've lapped in the comparisons that get better or disappear and so forth and so EPS growth rate in the second half mid-20s.","So, that's pretty heady and I fear that you will say, okay, then we will just take that and straight line it through 2014 and you will just keep delivering at that level. Somewhere in there is the reality and I think the reality is quite healthy. We always target double-digit earnings growth and in fact if you look over a lot of the last 10 years, whatever it has been, we set our guidance in that range practically every year. We set a high hurdle. We set a robust hurdle. We set a hurdle of being reliable double-digit EPS growth, and then we do our best to beat it and generally speaking, I would say, we have done about 90% on the time, that beat part.","So I think those kind of dynamics still exist. At the beginning of the year, I told you we did not rely on the markets improving for this to better, and we have not. We have the same questions a lot of other people, how much to rely on market improvement to factor into our business. I think if these markets improve a little bit, we improve a lot but I think right now what we are looking at is pretty good growth rates that are a lot more reflective of the identity of the company, its growth, the mix of its businesses and so forth going forward as we communicated last year and early this year. And we knew the first two quarters will be tough, at least tough from a comparison standpoint and they have been. Unfortunately they don\u2019t reflect, what we think the company is going to look like on an ongoing basis.","Now, that said, all of us look at the top line too, the measure of sustainability overtime of the businesses and I think Nutrition, Diagnostics, even EPD and the improvements they will have in some of these businesses are going to drive a lot of that growth and then the extent that we have any supplemental opportunities in M&A, we will look at that. But we don\u2019t factor that in because unless you have got it in your hand, you cannot count on it.","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","I just want to follow-up on the vascular piece, if I could. So there is really two questions here. So one is could you just talk about the evolution of the absorb strategy relative to that product and where it fits in the marketplace. If we really went back a year plus ago, the thought was with prices had a super premium and trying to make it become 10% of the market on a volume basis, the 10% volume might mean 30% from revenue. Now last year, obviously that has changed a lot. It is still priced at a premium but nowhere near what we were talking a year ago. Is the goal for that to be a workhorse product? If so, where are you on tracking towards that goal?","Then the second question is on this week's acquisition which really would be just from a strategy standpoint, why does Abbott and developer of XIENCE and IDEV Technologies need to go outside to buy a stent platform? Thanks.","Thomas Freyman","Okay, let me talk about the drug first. Your characterization is exactly right. I think initial entry or strategy of that product was priced as a very new technology which I think niched it in to selective use. There was a very intentional decision on our part to drive it toward workhorse use, just as you characterized. To do that, I will take Europe as an example, most governments, frankly the U.S. is the same longer-term, but if most health institutions, hospitals, governments, payers et cetera are operating pretty much on fixed or pressured budgets making room for technology that cost more than what it replaces is not high on their list. So I think that what we have to acknowledge is if we want that product in broader workhorse use, then not only do we cannibalize ourselves but we take share from the competition. But the only way we do that is not to be an incremental burden to the budgets that have to pay for those products, as a philosophy.","So, quite frankly, intentionally, the price of that product has come down and its share and its penetration and its use is broadening. It is our intent to move it into workhorse status. I would say we are seeing that in increased volume, increased usage, increased pickup, increased account pickup and so forth and that we are seeing it in the sequential sales performance of the product and its position in our portfolio. So that\u2019s exactly what we intend and we were moving that as fast as all the circumstances will allow without artificially distorting the markets. So I think you characterized it quite right.","Remind me again what was the second question?, IDEV, the position of that in the business. Why would you go out and spend? Quite frankly, we like their product. We like their product a lot. We wanted to enhance our own offering and surely. You know, can you do it yourself? Yes. You could, but clearly thought we had the activity going in that area but this is quicker and we think better and we like the product, so it made sense to us to enhance our product line and accelerate the business and fill it out, because the endovascular businesses is core standalone business and needs a strong position in this place, so we think that what IDEV gives us, so we think that not only helps us in that little space, we think it helps the endovascular business strategically as a package.","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Okay. Thanks, Miles.","Miles White","Did I get all your questions there mike?","Mike Weinstein - JPMC","Yes. You did. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","Just wondering if you could help out on the EPD business, and I think you mentioned that the market growth rate is still relatively healthy and I was wondering if you could provide what the rest end of the market growth rate is and help us understand what price volume is that's driving that. Thanks.","Miles White","I can't give you a specific market growth rate, because it's different for every country and every market. And, one of the difficult for this business, Rajeev, is, we think of a given geography as sort of three different segments. There is a proprietary pharma segment in our market, there is a commodity generic segment in the market and there is a branded generic segment in the market. And those different segments exist in practically every country. The question is, dominance or prominence in given economics strata in those markets. I mean, India is just a great example to point at, because you've got all three there. It's very much a branded generic market, even a branded market at a lower price points in rural settings. For that reason, we've got two brands in India. We've got True Care and we've got Abbott, and True Care is a world brand and at different price points, different product and different mix of product and the Abbott brands tend to be in the major urban areas and so forth.","So, it depends. And, generally speaking, around the world, there aren't many data sources for us to get breakouts that way of those markets. So, we know we know, we know for being in the market, we know from the way we can segment. So, we don't even quote percentages of share, because quite often it's contaminated with patented product or other, so I can't really give you that, but by country or overall, I think the segments are easily mid-to-high single-digit market growth and our growth over that considerably higher where we get the strategy right and we have the breadth of the product line and brand position right and so forth and our history and experience here has been, we grow much faster than the underlying market when we got those conditions in place and then the price trade off is such that it stratifies like a lot of markets, there's low priced product, there's mid-priced product. I can't say high priced. There's nothing high priced about it.","We are pretty good value in every market, but the consumer does make a distinction or the pharmacist makes a distinction between the brands he believes in and the quality, the breadth of offering or the configuration of the offering or whatever the case may be. So, we tend to get a premium for the quality, the breadth of the brand and the offering that we have. So, it's very much as I have said in the past like our Nutrition business from the standpoint of the mix of consumer-facing and medically recommended or prescribed and a branded product that comes from quality or international source or multinational source tends a get a pretty good share of the market at a pretty good price point.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS","Thanks. And, just a follow-up, I think Abbott has been pretty good operators of those in the markets that participate this one as you mentioned probably not where you wanted to be at this point in time, but what's the reasonable expectation for folks to have, or this business to get to more of a market rate of growth.","Miles White","Well, I am little gun shy about forecasting one, because I have been wrong thus far, but I think this is going to get to a mid-to-upper single digits sort of performance rate. The question is how fast and then I have got my own ambitions which I am already late on. So you always think as soon as you change management, you put new strategies in place that somehow next quarter it is going to look better and I think this is going to take a few quarters before we start to see the green shoots come up and the new growth come. I am impatient about that but I think we are not going to see what I would like to see in terms of the sequential momentum, hopefully until sometime next year.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","I wanted to follow-up Miles on the comment about the two new heads that you hired in EPD and maybe talk a little about where they are located, what they are charged with and when you think they may be able to have an impact on the businesses?","Miles White","Well, I think they are having an impact already. One of the people we hired was from outside the company with a strong background, frankly, in generic and branded generic product marketing and he has got a broad experience, absolutely fabulous experience and pedigree and track record. He is going to be responsible for the emerging market part of the business and we are changing out, call it the marketing team and branding team that will support him in that business. So he is already in place, already pretty much up to speed. He is already familiar with us. He knows the markets well. Te knows the channels well. He knows the brands well and so forth, and I think that is going well.","The other position we elevated from internally and one of our experienced and frankly, I would say excellent performing managers who has a developed side and I would say, given the background of his experience, has the right balance of, what I would say the characteristics of European and developed markets in the pharma and generic spaces but also the background and experience to understand how to transition where we can to branded generic consumer facing type marketing. We have taken some of our experienced people from that background, like we have seen in emerging markets and supplemented his team with that. Because I think we have got a transition going on in some of these emerging markets to much broader branded generic marketing, more consumer related.","So we are supplementing their teams that way. All of them are located in Europe together at the company or division headquarters which is (inaudible) and they are all working there together so that they are with each other every day and whether it is emerging markets or developed markets, they share quite a bit from the standpoint of the marketing, branding and commercial teams but the commercial teams and the support are all dedicated to each of their specific segments so that they are able to customize what we are doing either strategic or from a marketing standpoint for each of those segments.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","You firmly have to go down paths, whether it is acquisition path or build internally to enter new emerging markets. But does this strengthen the ability to maybe use the latter if the pricing on the former is too high?","Miles White","Well, I think, first of all, we have to get our house in order, which we are doing and getting our strategy straight and the right people in place and so forth which we have done. I would say, okay, so far so good. Let's get our strategy working internally here the way we want to before we complicate life with an acquisition or something else.","If an acquisition or an opportunity presented itself that fit and fit well with what we wanted to in a given geography, well we would certainly look at it. I would tell you, and I think all us know this, but I would tell you that today the valuation expectations for most of those are just out of sight. The acquisition we made of Piramal in India was a pricey acquisition but it give us the number one position in the market by far in a profitable growing key large market. That was worth something and when we look at that long-term, that\u2019s worth a lot.","But a multiple valuation like that in markets where all you can be is fit or safe or something isn\u2019t that kind of multiple. I think today what you see out there is valuation expectations that are frankly just unrealistic. If that doesn\u2019t change, we will be doing this organically. I think you have to be balanced or disciplined about the returns you expect and the hurdles you expect. The old adage that anything is for sale, as long as it is an overwhelming compelling price and I think if its an overwhelming price, it better have a good returns for our shareholders, or they are not think we did a good thing for them. So, it's not like you can just go out and create M&A activity. It's got to have the right intersection of valuable for both side, and today I would tell you in this particular space you don't see and that is why you do not see very many deals getting done by anybody, buying anything to expand their footprint.","I mean, our peers may say, gee it's an unattractive market. I don't think the markets are attractive all. I think, some of the M&A's are unattractive, but that just means you got to go at it more organically over time. And, frankly, if that's how it is we'll go at it organically.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Okay. Then one quick topic change, but going back to China. This is second time in two, three years that we've seen a pricing disruption whether it's market based or government based. How do you think about that in terms of investment.","Miles White","How do I think about that? I think about that, but we're probably going to see it again in a couple of years. I think you are going to see it over and over again, like I don't know, I have a lot of things I could say about I suppose, but I think you see this stuff all the time. I think, if you are over obsessed about China, you would over obsess about China. If you are over obsessed about Brazil or India, or Russia or somewhere else, you get over obsessed about any one of them. Is there a headache every day? Yes. Somewhere.","Overall, we're in a lot more than China, so I look at this and I think I suppose we should learn to deal with these sorts of things and rolling ongoing basis, because I don't think they stop, but I think what it does say is, you don't necessarily want to be disproportionately indexed in a given geography if you can't take the volatility of ride. And, so for us, we're in a lot of geographies purposely and we know that the balance of that mix of geographies is what stabilizes that volatility, because it offsets to some degree and that overall we can deliver much higher growth, more reliably on a sustainable basis. But, in the backroom here we are managing volatility every day.","So, the way I think about it is we are going to be managing volatility every day and I stress to the management team, we got to be always kind of preparing plan B and what are you going to do and contingencies and so forth and that is a fundamental part of our whole planning and budgeting process all the time. And, if you look this year, six months, seven months end of the year, has the year gone like you would expected? The answer is no. Have we delivered the earnings we committed? Yes. We've exceeded them. So, I think you got to kind of plan that way every year.","Ben Andrew - William Blair","Sure. The only question, Miles, is really what's the risk that other countries start to follow the model? We saw in Japan historically every couple of year big reimbursement cut, China is now taking up the mantel and canister and other countries as their healthcare cost rise, they say worked over there, why not here? So, how do you think about that exposure maybe over the five-year window? Then (Inaudible) incremental given kind of that risk of the broadening.","Miles White","Possibility I guess exists, but the circumstance has tend to be pretty unique in given country. There is regimentation in Japan around price management from the government or price control from the government that every year or every two years depending what are devices, pharma or what are the segment and it tends to be a fairly predictable regimen. And, what it tells you is, you want to be very close to your markets, you want to have your medical affairs, government affairs, regulatory affairs people in country, in markets. You can't have those relationships from Europe, or U.S. or something and expect to be into markets every day.","So, I think it's possible that similar philosophies could exist other places but what it basically boils down to is kind of that age old. They want to buy it for less and we want to sell for more. And, life's a negotiation and it just keeps going that way whether it's Europe, or China, or Japan, or India or anywhere else, the ability to earn a return is always subject to certain negotiation of what a payer can pay or will pay for the service of product you provide. I think that's just part of the business.","Brian Yoor","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","Hi, Miles. Good morning and thanks for taking all these questions and give us some really useful color. I do have a couple of questions.","Miles White","I think, one could ask Tom or Brian one or two, it would be okay.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","No chance this morning. I have got a couple of questions, but I would like to just lead off on margins, because I think it's the most important thing that hasn't been talked about yet on the call. I mean, it's a very nice quarter evidencing that the two lines of [Abbott] one is great broad top line growth. And, the second point, we've got some great underlying margin expansion to look forward and that's what seem to really help out this quarter. I was very encouraged by the commentary around nutrition and the margins there. I wondered if you could just give us a bit better view here, is the cadence of delivering, I know there is margin improvement or can you give us a bit more color if it is going to run longer or shorter in terms of timeline and how much further beyond the 20% of sales do you think right now we can get to given that you seem to be overdelivering there?","Miles White","I would say, first of all, that the performance in nutrition is the result of fairly detailed comprehensive plan with literally over 100 different initiatives and so forth. Some of those are quick and easy and some take more time. Some of it's mix of products. Some of it is manufacturing process. Some of it, whether we make our own product or source it from a third party manufacturer. There is literally hundreds of things. We have made great progress and I think there is frankly a lot more to be made. We have commented in the past that we are fortunate to have some early public comparisons to some of our competitors for some of our segments that give us some benchmarks to sort of judge how we are doing in given places. But I think there is more here. This is what I would say.","As much as you would like to get even greater forecast out of me, I am always trying to get it out of the business too because there is that caution of let's not fully commit all of it to Miles and Tom and the corporation. So we leave ourselves a little cushion because as I just explained to this question, everybody is thinking about contingencies too. But the fact is the organization has got a cultural mindset around cost management, investment management, expense management. We do make a distinction internally between that which will drive improved gross margin before discretionary spending and the management or proficiency of discretionary spending.","A lot a lot of times you can go out and just cut SG&A but to make a quarter but frankly I think that is kind of quite shortsighted. In our case, on the discretionary side, if we look there for efficiency or cost management, we are looking at primarily G&A or we are looking at where spending is valuable versus where it is not so valuable. Bang for the buck, hit rate, et cetera.","So Tom and I, over the course of this year, and partly as the exercise out of split and the transition service agreements and the back office stuff with AbbVie, we are looking at the manner in which we support all of our businesses and the cost of that support and how we do it and so forth to make ourselves more efficient and I think when you go through an exercise like the split, it\u2019s the time to do that. It certainly allows you the ability to do that to look at whether you can spend your general and administrative expenses better and more efficiently and so on and we are.","Because I wouldn\u2019t want investors to misthink that somehow we are shortchanging the businesses or starting the businesses from the standpoint of R&D investment or sales and marketing because we are not and we don\u2019t have to. So we do make a distinction about moderating spending and where and how so that we don\u2019t harm the longer term prospects of the businesses but the longer-term sustainable improvement in profits, frankly, tend to be above that gross margin line and the real cost or pricing, the mix of your products, how you manufacture, all those sorts of things.","But that\u2019s where this is coming from in nutrition. This is not because they are raising price. This is all fundamental cost and structure management about the way they conduct that business. This is very durable and long sustainable profit improvement. And there is a lot more here, I think. And we think and we know the plan to get and I am going to let Tom add to that, if you will, for a minute.","Thomas Freyman","I would just say that (inaudible), to your original question, I think things are ahead of schedule and you are seeing it in the gross margin. We are delivering above expectation and it really is a function of executing programs I have more quickly, more efficiently and getting more savings sooner than what we might have expected a while back. So that\u2019s primarily what's happening and obviously the closer we get to the 20% initial target that we have for each division, then the focus is going to be on what s more and how much better we can get beyond that and we are making very good progress getting towards those initial targets and we are going to keep working on improving beyond that.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","I will just try one extra last quick question if I can. I know the time is short, but in terms of the M&A, you said you don't want to be very specific. You did mention in EPD, product breadth as being one of the issues now. A lot of the large cap pharma companies are looking to separate or breakout many of their established pharma businesses. Do you see opportunities in some of those reorganizations to potentially and augment what you have in your EPD business?","Miles White","I can't comment on what any of the other companies may have or what they intend to do with their assets, but I can tell you this. It would be of interest if it stood geographically. It's not that we lack products or lack breadth. We have breadth. We've got tremendous breadth in our EPD business that the value primarily to any kind of M&A addition to EPD is geographic footprint or share footprint in a market. You know how larger share position or brand position may be in that market.","So, for us it will more likely be a consideration of geographic enhancement or geographic fit that it will be breadth of product line, because we are not challenged from a breadth standpoint. The opportunity is really in bigger geographic footprints, so that would be kind of how we look at it. And, to the extent that those assets out there that may sit back, we'll have a look, but today I cannot I should say I don't really have a point of view, because I haven't seen those assets yet.","Brian Yoor","So, thank you, Elan, and thank you all for your questions.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.","With the exception of any participant\u2019s questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott\u2019s express written permission.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations.","Scott Leinenweber","Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance in more detail. Following their comments, Miles, Brian, and I will take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2017. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1(a), Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","Please note that first quarter financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.","On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to comparable operational sales growth, which adjust the 2016 basis of comparison to include results for St. Jude Medical and to exclude the impact of exchange, as well as current and historical results for Abbott\u2019s Medical Optics business and St. Jude\u2019s vascular closure businesses, which were divested during the first quarter of 2017. Comparable growth also reflects a reduction to St. Jude\u2019s historic sales related to administrative fees paid to group purchasing organizations in order to conform with Abbott\u2019s presentation.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay, thanks, Scott. Good morning. Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.48 exceeding our previous guidance range. Sales increased 3% in the quarter, which is at the upper-end of our expectations. Our full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 remains unchanged and reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint.","As you know, we completed several important strategic steps during the quarter to shape our company for sustainable long-term growth, including the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which establishes Abbott as a leader in the medical device arena.","The combination with St. Jude positions Abbott with one of the strongest new product pipelines in the industry, including several recently launched products that are setting new treatment standards and contributing growth today. The combined portfolio has the depth, breadth and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to customers and payors.","In terms of the integration of St. Jude into Abbott, the team has made tremendous progress over the first few months of the year when we\u2019re on track to meet our objectives. The newly formed leadership team reflects a blend of Abbott and St. Jude leaders, and importantly, the team has remained focused on achieving its new product milestones, synergy targets, and financial objectives for the year.","Additionally, last week, Abbott and Alere announced that the companies have agreed to amend the existing terms of our agreement to acquire Alere. Point-of-care testing remains an attractive growth segment within the in vitro diagnostics market and the acquisition of Alere will significantly expand our diagnostics presence and leadership in that space.","I\u2019ll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I\u2019ll start with diagnostics, where we achieved sales growth of nearly 5% in the quarter in line with expectations. Growth in the quarter was led by continued above market performance in core laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics.","During the quarter, we initiated the launch of our new Alinity systems in Europe with the ongoing roll out of four new instruments in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point-of-care. Later this year, we plan to launch two additional Alinity instruments in Europe in the areas of hematology and molecular diagnostics, which will be followed by the initial roll out of the Alinity suite of instruments in the U.S. during 2018.","In nutrition, sales declined 1% in the quarter. As expected, challenging market conditions in China impacted the results of our international pediatric business. As we previously discussed, we expect these market challenges to persist throughout the year that continue to hold a favorable outlook on the Chinese and infant formula market on a longer-term basis. With the pending new regulations in China, we remain confident that our supply chain and product portfolio is well-positioned to meet evolving customer preferences and purchasing channels.","In the U.S., we continue to achieve above market performance in pediatric nutrition with a portfolio of innovative product offerings for infants and toddlers and in adult nutrition where Abbott is the global leader, high single-digit international growth in the quarter was led by continued expansion of Abbott\u2019s market-leading brand Ensure across many international markets.","In Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales growth of roughly 6% was led by double-digit growth in key emerging markets including above market growth in Latin America, China and several markets in Southeast Asia. Our continued focus on enhancing local capabilities and expanding our product portfolio within core therapeutic areas targeted specifically to address local market needs continues to strengthen Abbott\u2019s unique position in these markets.","And in Medical Devices, which comprises our new cardiovascular and neuromodulation business, along with our diabetes care business, sales grew 4.5% in the quarter. Sales growth in cardiovascular and neuromodulation was led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and neuromodulation. In electrophysiology, we initiated the U.S. launch of our Ensite Precision cardiac mapping system, which provides physicians with improved automation and three-dimensional images to better treat irregular heartbeats.","Growth in structural heart was led by continued double-digit growth of MitraClip, our market-leading device for the repair of mitral regurgitation. And in neuromodulation, growth was led by recently launched products including Burst for the treatment of chronic pain and deep brain stimulation for the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease.","During the first part of the year, we also achieved several important new product milestones across the business including U.S. FDA approval for MRI compatible pacemaker, European launch of our Confirm Implantable Cardiac Monitor and submission of our MRI compatible ICD device for FDA review.","In diabetes care, international sales growth of 29% was driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. Now available in more than 30 countries outside the U.S., we continue to see strong demand as consumers, healthcare professionals and payors recognize the cost, comfort and convenience advantages Libre offers.","So in summary, our first quarter results reflect a strong start to the year. The integration of St. Jude is going well and we\u2019re on track to achieve our projected synergy targets. And as we continue to execute on our key business priorities, we expect to deliver on our double-digit ongoing EPS growth target for the full year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and our outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay, thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on a comparable basis which is consistent with the guidance we provided back in January.","Turning to our results, sales for the first quarter increased 3.2% on an operational basis. Exchange had an unfavorable impact of 0.6% on sales, resulting in reported sales growth of 2.6% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.5% of sales.","The over delivery in the first quarter EPS compared to our guidance is primarily due to timing of spending and certain non-operating items. I\u2019d note that while exchange rates eased somewhat since our call in January, a follow-through impact on our first quarter results is fairly modest, taking into account our hedging program and the lag time that it takes for rate changes to work through our product costs.","Before I review our financial outlook, I\u2019d note that our sales and adjusted EPS forecast do not include any contribution associated with the Alere acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2017 subject to certain closing conditions. We will provide an update regarding the expected financial impact of this transaction at a later date.","So, turning to our outlook for the full year 2017, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the mid-single digits and based on the current exchange rates, exchange would have a negative impact of around 1% on our full year reported sales. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full-year, which reflects the profitability mix of Abbott and St. Jude, as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&D investment of somewhat about 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of St. Jude.","Turning to our outlook for the second quarter of 2017, we forecast an adjusted EPS of $0.59 to $0.61. We forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits and at current rates expect exchange would have a negative impact of around 1.5%. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio around 60% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately 30.5% of sales. Finally, we project specified items of $0.55 in the second quarter, primarily reflecting intangible amortization and expenses associated with acquisitions.","Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter comparable operational sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit sales growth. In nutrition, we now forecast low single-digit sales growth for both the second quarter and the full-year. In diagnostics, we forecast sales to increase mid-single digits.","Turning to medical devices. In diabetes care, we forecast double-digit sales growth. And lastly, in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation business, we forecast relatively flat comparable sales growth in the second quarter, which includes a difficult comparison versus last year when sales were favorably impacted by the resolution of a third-party royalty agreement in our vascular business. Excluding this third-party royalty comparison, underlying sales growth in the second quarter would be low single digits.","With that, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning, everybody. And Miles, I was hoping I could start with Alere. You didn\u2019t update on the potential financial impact of Alere. But I was hoping that you could talk about your view of the math on the company\u2019s earnings power today versus the time that you announced the transaction and how we should think about that assuming that we go forward to a deal closing here?","Miles White","Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m prepared today to give you a lot of detail on that Mike. But I can say this, look, the company had some challenges, we all know that, and it\u2019s a bit of a fixer upper and we know that. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pleased to have the resolution of this matter behind us. We want to go forward and close this deal. We want to close it in the next few months. It\u2019s going to be a little unpredictable, because they\u2019ve still got to file their 10-K and they need that in order to do a proxy statement to do a shareholder vote and so forth.","So there\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s some steps to get through here before we can close. And we\u2019ve got to finish the divestiture of a couple of businesses that will have to divest because of the regulatory approvals and anti-trust approvals. And I know what I would say is, we\u2019re committed all of us to get all of that done in the next coming months here. So I\u2019m looking to close this hopefully, and I\u2019m \u2013 this is just a guesstimate by end of summer, allowing for enough time for, what Alere has got to do with the shareholders and so forth.","But I\u2019d say, look, if it remains on strategy, we really like the space. We like this point-of-care space. We like the expansion to our diagnostics business. We like the businesses. We will divest a couple of pieces. When we first announced the signing of the deal, that wasn\u2019t clear and wasn\u2019t known. So and they had issues with a couple of pieces of businesses as we know.","So, I wouldn\u2019t say that the same sales will be there. Obviously, the businesses that have had problems will either be gone or smaller. And the ones we divest won\u2019t be in the portfolio. So the amount of sales and profits that we add to our models will change. As far as earnings power and all that sort of stuff, I\u2019m just not prepared to give at this point. I\u2019d tell you that I think that the resolution of the matter between us is fair and it\u2019s behind us and we move forward.","And beyond that, I think we\u2019re going to have to wait till, first of all, we\u2019re in possession of the company and obviously, it\u2019s going to take us a bit to get our hands around that. So I\u2019d say, we\u2019re not going to really be in a good position to give a lot of detail guidance until minimum fourth quarter and probably normal guidance time. And I know, you\u2019re going to all of our analysts and investors are going to want guidance before that at some level.","And I think we\u2019ll be able to give it at some level within ranges. But I can\u2019t do much detail today.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Let me switch to St. Jude and that\u2019s what the question people have is relative to the Sylmar warning letter. So can you give your thoughts on how that warning letter impacts the business? Any guess at this point on how long you think it will take to resolve? And I assume that that means that the MRI compatible ICD approval timelines to push out. So given that, are you able to stabilize the business while you\u2019re waiting for the warning letter to lift and for those devices to get approved?","Miles White","Well, I want to be careful not to make assumptions about things that the FDA gets to decide. I would say this. First, the warning letter clearly a disappointment, but not unanticipated. We\u2019ve been aware of the circumstances here for sometime and we\u2019ve been working with our St. Jude colleagues for sometime even before close on GMP matters at the site.","So, we\u2019ve got a pretty good head start here on the issues and a fair amount of dialogue with the FDA about the issues. So having said that and being clearly disappointed in the outcome, I\u2019d say, the impact will depend a lot on our response, how thorough, how effective that response is. And I can tell you, we\u2019ve got an excellent team of people on that. We\u2019ve basically taken everybody that is exp0ert in the field in our company and then we have a lot of very good people in the area focused on and working on not only Sylmar, but we\u2019re doing a full valuation across all the sites and make sure that we understand everything here in detail.","We\u2019ve got a very strong track record ourselves in GMP performance, et cetera, the FDA is aware of that. So I\u2019d say, the effectiveness of our response, the thoroughness and so forth will determine a lot of this. Now, in the mean time, how fast they will resolve? Can\u2019t really predict, but I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve got a pretty, pretty good sized head start on this. It\u2019s not like we received a letter and said, go. We\u2019ve had a pretty good visibility to all the issues and matters at the site starting last year. And so, I think we\u2019re well along here.","And with regard to the timing of approvals and all the new products that we have under review with the FDA remain under review. We know that they\u2019re continuing to review those submissions. So that\u2019s a good thing. And so I don\u2019t think we can draw any conclusions from that that are negative or positive. I think that it\u2019s going to depend on the quality of our response here, and I\u2019m very, very confident in our team. So, at this point, I\u2019m not going to change our launch dates, our assumptions on approval dates and so forth, because I don\u2019t see a reason to do that yet, or a direction to do it in.","And so I think right now, I\u2019m just going to leave it where it is. And we know that there\u2019s some uncertainty around that. We know that this will depend on our actions at the site and we\u2019ll see how that progresses and then I\u2019ll have a stronger position or point of view about that probably later this year.","But right now, we\u2019re focused on what needs to be done in terms of corrective actions and improvements at our site, and that\u2019s where the focus ought to be. And then was \u2013 is that makes clear progress and shows clear effectiveness and all, I think it\u2019ll be time to try to figure out what impact is going to have on launch dates of new products.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Let me ask one last question, if I can, Miles. The discussion on the street right now really, I would put it in two buckets on. It\u2019s a question of okay, what is ultimately Abbott\u2019s earnings power post this deployment of capital in the acquisition of St. Jude and ultimately Alere here? And what does that look like? And okay, what is the ease for the company?","And then the second discussion is really what I was hoping to have you comment on which is, okay, well, what do we pay for Abbott going forward? And the discussion essentially ends up centering around this question of well, is Abbott\u2019s mix of assets today post the acquisition of St. Jude and Alere and the change in the outlook for the Nutritions business as good as it was two to three years ago, and effectively what should we be paying for Abbott today? Can you give us just your own thoughts on that in terms of the overall quality of the portfolio today versus two to three years ago?","Miles White","I think the quality of the portfolio today is clearly strong and improving better. I think that\u2019s an easy one, geez, did you tee that up on purpose? You know if I look back two to three years ago at \u2013 I\u2019ll just run through the portfolio. I love the nutrition business, yes, it has its ups and downs occasionally, but it is a strong solid grower, driven today obviously by emerging markets in a lot of cases, but it\u2019s been a great profit and cash flow generator, solid business et cetera, challenges occasionally in China notwithstanding.","The pharma business, our branded generic business, I think is in a much stronger position than it was several years ago. We\u2019re focused on the markets where high double-digit growth exists, we\u2019re seeing it. We are seeing the execution of that strategy being, I\u2019d say, beautifully executed by our team. The only headwind we\u2019ve seen in that is exchange and you know when I can control exchange and predict it for you, you know we\u2019ll do even better. But I think the EPD business has been a true gem among branded generic pharma companies and it\u2019s proving it with its growth rates and its performance. You know we just keep expanding the product lines and expanding our footprint in countries and we keep growing at strong singe or low double-digits there, I\u2019d have nothing, but good things to say about that business.","Diagnostics is in the process of launching the biggest range of new systems and new products that\u2019s ever been done in the entire space in history. I used to run the R&D in that business years ago and I know the challenges and the complexity of developing big mainframe systems for diagnostic laboratories and this team has just launched four of them into the market at the same time. These are new systems with full menus, and you know it will be a rolling rollout, but I think when you look at two more systems coming, six systems across the board, a complete redo of the entire product line, I think the strength of that to drive the growth of our diagnostics business, gosh, for the next decade is unprecedented, absolutely unprecedented. And designed not only for their size, their efficiency, their cost, I think there is nothing, but good there and nobody has done that, so I\u2019m extremely enthusiastic about that.","And then Mike, you yourself have challenged us on the breadth of our medical device business for a number of years and I think that the addition of St. Jude here is powerful. I mean, arguably, we\u2019ve got the best stent in the world and it\u2019s challenging for everybody in this space to incrementally improve on the efficacy and quality of stents today. We have a lead position in the stent business and now we\u2019ve broadened that across six other major cardiovascular categories. And I look back at the last few years in the medical optics business, which you know frankly I think J&J has acquired at a particularly opportune time, because it\u2019s taking share in the intraocular lens space at a pretty nice clip, but they\u2019ve got leading technology and that business had its own struggles when we first acquired it.","So, you know if I look at Alere and St. Jude or even parts of Abbott that need you know improvements or whatever, I think we\u2019ve got a very strong track record of improving performance in businesses that needs some improvements. And I look at KMO, I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re very proud of how AMO has performed over these last six years. And I think that was proven in the sale and value and so forth that J&J saw in it and I think they\u2019re very happy to have that business, we\u2019re very proud of it and we wish it well, because we\u2019re pretty happy with how low it did.","So I look back three, four years and I think we\u2019re much stronger today and have a much more robust and strong portfolio across the board. You can say, well, now aren\u2019t there challenges to fixing the business? I think any large company with diverse set of businesses is always going to have some defects. We\u2019re always going to have something that\u2019s not up to our standards or that we want to improve on and then there\u2019s always going to be currency or something going on somewhere in the world. If you are in a 130 countries, there\u2019s always going to be somewhere and something.","So, I look at it and I think, yeah, I\u2019m very pleased with how we\u2019ve done and I think that for the growth prospects going forward are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been. And to be honest, we start every year with a target of double-digit earnings growth. I mean, I \u2013 there have been, gosh, in the last 10 or 11 years, maybe two years that we\u2019re high single-digit, but otherwise we target double-digit earnings every year almost without exception and that\u2019s unusual in our space, and I think you know that.","So at some point, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re the same company, but with a much better portfolio. And we live to the investment identity that we\u2019ve been and creative and that\u2019s our intent, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the moves we did with both St. Jude and Alere. And even though that we\u2019ve got to put sometime and investment into these businesses to help achieve the growth aspirations we have. We just look at the strength of the portfolios across the Board. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had rich new product portfolios coming like we see across these businesses today. So thanks for the question, that was kind of an easy one.","Mike Weinstein","Thanks, Miles.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Taylor","Hi, thanks for taking the question. A couple of areas of the portfolio I wanted to ask about. The first was on diabetes, you had a really strong quarter. We actually saw some acceleration in that business outside the U.S. And I was hoping you could make some comments on, I guess, A, how FreeStyle Libre is doing? And what your expectations are for that in the U.S. you could give us an update there?","Miles White","Yes, no problem. Look, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re pretty excited about FreeStyle Libre. It\u2019s doing very well, doing really well across Europe. As I mentioned, I think in my opening remarks, we\u2019re in about 30 countries now. The expansion within those countries is going well. I think we\u2019re at about 300,000 patients. I mean, you can compare that to a like competitor, and I think that stacks up really favorably.","We\u2019re getting reimbursement across European countries, that\u2019s unprecedented. And even within Germany and other countries, the reimbursement is expanding, that\u2019s helping. In some cases, where it\u2019s patient pay, we\u2019re still growing very well, patients accepting it. So we\u2019ve got both great patient acceptance, great value proposition.","And then as we said payors, governments, sick funds and so forth are all giving a lot of support to the product because of the not only what it does, but the value proposition represents relative to what patients can do today. And it makes a heck of the difference in the care and treatment of diabetic patients and their care for themselves.","So, I think, we\u2019re pretty excited about this product and the pace at which it\u2019s growing and expanding nothing, but good. As far as the U.S. goes, still working with the FDA to get approval in the U.S. and submitted, waiting, excited anticipating, in patient.","Matthew Taylor","Okay, great. Well, and then just on the St. Jude side of things, so there\u2019s a few areas that we\u2019re pretty strong. But you continue to have some negative growth in Rhythm Management and heart failure. I guess, my question is, can you stabilize that business before you get ICD approval? And what are the things that would help that? Maybe you could comment on the pacemaker launch and how that\u2019s going?","Miles White","Well, pacemaker launch is going fine. We\u2019ve got about 75% of our accounts are contracted about 25% to go. And because it\u2019s a new product, new leads, there\u2019s a little bit training and re-contracting involved, because it\u2019s not the same old product. So, yes, I\u2019d say that roll out is going well. It\u2019s interesting you always wanted to be instantaneous and it takes a little time to roll it in.","So I actually expect to see improving sequential quarters in terms of its growth, or decline. We\u2019re comparing to last year when it lost some share, while it waited for approval. So I expect to see that improve steadily through the year, obviously, it will be helped when a high voltage is approved.","But, as I said earlier, I can\u2019t make predictions about that right now. We\u2019re hopeful that we will be able to resolve matters sufficiently, or show enough progress with the FDA that we can stay on track with that. But I can\u2019t predict that just yet, but I think that will make a difference as well. But I\u2019d say everything is going very well with low voltage.","Matthew Taylor","Okay, great. And one last follow-up. I just wanted to clarify on the Alere timeline as a few steps here. Do you think that it\u2019s going to basically take kind of through the summer, what\u2019s the soonest ticket close and kind of what are the key uncertainties in that timeline around FTC?","Miles White","Well, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to speak for Alere, because that\u2019s \u2013 right now they and their auditors working on their 10-K and so forth. I can tell you they\u2019re just as anxious to get finished as we are. So that aside, I think we just arbitrarily sort of say end of 3Q, or third quarter, but it\u2019s kind of an arbitrary date, you know do I think it\u2019ll take longer than that? No. And I would tell you that both companies will get there as soon as they can. You know we got a couple of pacing items, I mean obviously we got our divestitures to finish up, but they will not \u2013 I don\u2019t think be the long pole in the tent here, I think it\u2019ll be the shareholder vote, but I don\u2019t know that. I just think that we both got actions to finish up here in parallel and you know we\u2019re going to act as I think we practically can.","Matthew Taylor","Okay. Alright, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus, your line is open.","Rick Wise","Good morning, Miles.","Miles White","Good morning.","Rick Wise","Let me start with China, in China nutritionals, no surprise you know the issues you called out. Maybe help us \u2013 you know maybe talk us through some of the steps you are taking now to set the stage for a better 2018? How confident are you that 2018 will be better? Obviously you are going to have some easy comps, you know whether it\u2019s product or management or other initiatives, help us sort of frame the outlook as we look ahead there?","Miles White","Yes, I\u2019m thinking how to characterize that because we\u2019re talking about one of the most dynamic markets of any market I\u2019ve ever seen in the world. Would you have new management? I like the management a lot, very impressed with the experience, the background, the understanding of the markets, the actions taken et cetera. I\u2019m pleased with the actions that we\u2019ve identified. We\u2019re not completely in control of what happens in China as you might guess, so you know we know that there\u2019s a lot of inventory in that market. We know there\u2019s a lot of channel shift happening in that market that takes time to play through.","We believe we\u2019ve refocused on the appropriate channels, the digital channel in particular has exploded and sucked a lot of the activity and energy out of traditional modern trade channels and so forth and that\u2019s been a pretty big shift to us, because we have historically been heavy modern trade, but we have reacted to that, I think, now well. I wish we had been quicker, but we weren\u2019t, so I think that the team there is making all the right adjustments in terms of where we promote, how we promote, where we ship, how we ship, product benefits and value propositions. I mean literally across the board I think our nutrition business has put a lot of attention on adjusting to what is frankly a fascinatingly dynamic changing market.","We still like the long-term prospects of China. We look at the growth rates and so forth and there is not any big underlying detriments to how strong that market has been, it\u2019s been \u2013 you know a lot more the reaction of competitors and all of us to pending regulation changes and what the government will allow in terms of number of SKUs competitors in the market and so forth, we\u2019re actually in a very strong position for that given the number of different plans we have, different products and so forth. But we\u2019re focused on only a few, very strong products and we\u2019re focused on the \u2013 let\u2019s say the differentiation that moms in China wants in their products. Some of them want European products, some of them want New Zealand products, some of them want American products, some of them want local product and we actually have that and all of that.","So, I think it\u2019s an adjustment to a lot of channel, a lot of digital and a lot of product, and then on top of that a lot of government regulation and so in this particular case, there are so many competitors in China, a lot of them have pushed a lot of inventory into that market in anticipation of a lot of that and we have to see that play through. So, it\u2019s made this year hard to predict. You know we think we\u2019re in a good position thus far, I mean I hate to be superstitious, I\u2019ll knock on wood and say, right now China has not been a surprise or an issue for 2017, but I felt that way last year at about this time too. So, you know I want to see a lot more this year play out before I can predict how the year is going to finish or even how 2018 will be, but I think we feel pretty good about China for the long-term, but as the government transitions through these new regulations, I think that\u2019s going to be a little bumpy and it has been, otherwise I like the management team and the actions we\u2019re taking right now and that\u2019s about all I can tell you.","Rick Wise","Okay. Turning to guidance, you obviously beat the first quarter, chose not to raise it full year, I think you talked about the timing of spending and some other issues. And when we look at the second quarter, you sort of basically framed current consensus, as I understand it, with your EPS guidance anyway. Help us understand a little more behind your thinking, is it simply caution as you look at the many moving pieces in terms of the outlook for the full-year and for second quarter, specifically, can you perhaps walk us through the bridge from first quarter to second quarter, $0.48 to $0.60 the puts and takes that that get us up to that kind of ramp in the second quarter?","Miles White","Well, I may have to phone a friend for that last part. But let me address the first part. You\u2019ll recall, well, first of all, we set our targets for the year that healthy double digits. Now, we\u2019ve got St. Jude in the mix there, so there\u2019s extra healthy double digits. But even on top of just last year on a comparable basis, there\u2019s a double-digit earnings growth target here, which again, I would point out is not typical across our peer group, or competitors, et cetera, or even the companies that our investors compare us to many of which are not healthcare.","And so we start the year with healthy double-digit target and guidance. And then the gating of that guidance over the quarters, as you may recall in the first quarter, that the issue was jeez, it looks back-end loaded. And our fourth quarter is always strong and our first quarter is always the low quarter of the year. And so you look at that and you say, okay, the investor tends to think that last quarter, gosh, it looks like such a big hill.","So, we have a strong first quarter that tends to be the case. We tend to have lower guidance then and we tend to beat it each year, tend to be \u2013 tends to be a pattern. And then there\u2019s, I look at each year a little superstitiously. I guess, if you\u2019ve been around long enough, you get to see this. But every year exchange or something happens later in the year, where there\u2019s a change. There\u2019s a political change, there\u2019s an exchange, just a matter of some kind or whatever.","So I\u2019m reluctant to adjust guidance in the first quarter for almost anything, and because I\u2019d like to see the year play out a little more first, because I don\u2019t like the whip around shareholders, particularly when we\u2019re all already, looking at a double-digit growth target, which is annual for us. And so I look at it and say, okay, we\u2019re off to a nice strong start. We have had a bit of favorable exchange. We do know there\u2019s some timing in there, and there\u2019s also some strength in there.","And I\u2019d like to see that strength sustained and I\u2019d like to see the exchange sustain. I\u2019d like to see more than three months play out here. So in the meantime, my view would be, let\u2019s take some of the gaining off the back part of the year, or let\u2019s regain this a little bit more gently, call it, a little smoother, and let\u2019s wait to see another card played in the second quarter. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent at this early point in the year to make adjustments to earnings that are already double-digit targets until we see more cards played. I mean, that\u2019s that\u2019s basically my thought process right now.","Rick Wise","Yes.","Miles White","I mean, we can second-guess me all you want, but that\u2019s how I thought about it. Scott, do you want to, or Brian, Brian is going to help me with your second question on the quarter.","Brian Yoor","Yes, the question gone up from Q1 to Q2 and then we talked a little bit about this on our first call. I mean, as Miles talked about China, while we anticipate pressures to be there through the year, we\u2019re expecting some relief as we move through the year, not a lot. But obviously, that comp becomes a little bit easier for us as we move through the year. That\u2019s one area of nutrition.","One area, Rick, and we talked about this. We expected a lower branded generics sales in Q1 and that \u2013 some of that was around the anticipation around what they were going through a process known as demonetization. Established Pharma and also it was our last quarter of sales of Venezuela. It just so happened and we talked a little bit about that too. This is our last quarter. Established Pharma would have grown a 11% to 12% this quarter had we adjusted for that comparable on Venezuela.","So we expect that to flow through in Q2. You also saw in diagnostics, whereas diagnostics came in the full range. They\u2019d be closer to 6.5% much for Venezuela. So we anticipate all these moves when we projected our Q2 earnings. And also I\u2019d note too, we expected a very modest contribution from St. Jude in Q1. You have the dilution from the shares, but it takes time to ramp the synergies.","And so we move into Q2, you\u2019re going to start to see those synergies ramp in St. Jude as we move through the year, and that\u2019s really the bridge to take you from what you saw the $0.48 to $0.60.","Rick Wise","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Glenn Novarro","Hey, good morning, guys.","Miles White","Good morning.","Glenn Novarro","I wonder if you can provide a little bit more detail on your CRM performance in the quarter. U.S. was down 18%. Can you break it down between Pacing and ICDs? I would imagine pacing did better, given that you have the MRIC for approval. And it seems like from the numbers, ICDs came in worse. So a little bit more clarity on CRM performance in the first quarter. Thanks.","Scott Leinenweber","Sure, this is Scott. As Miles mentioned, we did make some progress there in the U.S. on the CRM side during the first quarter. We\u2019re off to a good start with the pacer, particularly as we exited the quarter and started to add more and more contracts, and we think we\u2019ll wrap up that process here in the second quarter and do better with the pacer throughout the year.","So the pacer sales were down in the mid-single digits and then the remainder would have been obviously the performance of the defibrillation business. We did make some progress there as well. With respect to filing, we filed the ICD in March, and we expect to file the CRTD here in the second quarter. So we\u2019ve made progress in terms of approval milestones on that front as well.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. And then I guess from Miles commentary, you\u2019re assuming pacers throughout the year get stronger, as it fully gets launched, as doctors get trained. So this is a business that will go from down 5 to flat to up throughout the year, is that a fair assumption? And I guess we should assume ICDs continue in this downward trend until MRIC gets approved, is that fair?","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, I think you\u2019ve got it there. Definitely pacers will improve throughout the year.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up for Miles on China. We talked about the challenges in 2017. Once we get through the regulations, as you go into 2018 and beyond, what\u2019s the new norm in terms of market growth for China? When Abbott and AbbVie split up. Miles, you talked about China being a double-digit growth market. So what\u2019s the new norm in 2018 and beyond for growth in China in nutritional? Thanks.","Miles White","This is just a stab in the dark. But I would tell you, I\u2019d probably for right now forecasted it mid-single. I think we\u2019re going to have to see some \u2013 it\u2019s a big number. I mean, first of all China is a big market. So we\u2019re talking about growth on top of a big number. And so you got the lot of big numbers working against us there. But I\u2019d say mid single for now is a safe assumption and beyond that, I think, we\u2019re going to have to kind of see how it goes.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thanks for \u2013 thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start with capital allocation and then product-related question. So I think, Brian, when you announced the St. Jude deal a year ago, you talked about a goal of getting down to 3.5 times debt to EBITDA in 2018. Is that still a realistic goal, given the Alere deal now? And how should we think about your uses of cash priorities? One of the concerns investors have is that with the debt you have right now that \u2013 or post the Alere deal that you\u2019ll be constrained and you won\u2019t be able to do even small tuck-in deals to augment, let\u2019s say, the St. Jude business, or other business. So can you talk a little bit about that and I have one follow-up?","Miles White","Yes, Larry, we see a path to the 3.5 for 2018 in closing Alere. I think something to keep in mind and remember is, we divested a couple businesses and we received full and fair value there. And so that gives us some optionality such that the debt we would take on under Alere is less than what you might have originally modeled in your deal model. So at Alere point in time, we\u2019ll come back and help you reconcile that.","And as you know, we talked about this. Cash flow has been a focus for us. We projected very strong operating cash flow and free cash flow as a percent of net income for this year. And that remains on track, I\u2019d say, in the first quarter, let\u2019s wait till the Q comes up, but we may even be a little bit ahead here in terms of our efforts here to make improvements in our working capital process and also just further strengthen what was also a strong process around our capital expenditures. So we feel good about that. Our priorities go back to strategic flexibility and nothing changes about those commitments we made sometime ago.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s helpful. And then on the product side just two. One is on EPD, you touched upon the demonetization, which doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s had much of an impact based on your Q1 results. But how are you thinking about the impact of the goods and services tax in India later this year?","And just lastly, on the heart failure results this quarter, which were a little week, I think that\u2019s primarily the Thoratec business, which has been strong in prior quarters. Can you talk about the outlook there and why it might have been weak this quarter and obviously you have HeartMate 3 coming in the U.S. later this year hopefully so that that should help. Thanks for taking the questions.","Scott Leinenweber","Sure, thanks Larry, this is Scott. With respect to the monetization, yes, it did have a little bit of transitory choppiness on the overall economy quite frankly in India and we saw a modest impact on our results. That impact is diminishing and will continue to diminish we think going forward.","With respect to the goods and services tax, as you know the government is looking at implementing a new tax scheme. They have been looking at this for quite sometime. The date has moved once previously. So we are certainly going to monitor that decision. At current time, the expectation is that they would implement on July 1. If they do that could have an impact potentially on the way distributors manage inventory before and after that implementation. So, we didn\u2019t make that into our guidance per se, because the timeline has been a little bit fluid here. But if we go through the quarter and that solidifies, we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time.","Miles White","I think it\u2019s important to stress though, it\u2019s hard to predict what the distributors will do to manage inventories and so forth based on this, but that they will at some level. And so we could see some less predictable numbers in the second \u2013 between the second and third quarter. If the timing, what Scott said, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect our overall business. And it\u2019s going to affect all players in the market, you know all manufacturers or all retailers et cetera.","And at the end of the day, I think it\u2019ll stabilize, but we\u2019re just going to go through a lumpy start. And then I think it also depends on whether or not people recover this tax with price or other thing, so we\u2019ll just have to see.","Scott Leinenweber","With respect to your question on LVADs or the heart failure bucket, you know as you know that that market can be a little bit choppy from time-to-time. There is some interplay between LVADs procedures and the heart transplant procedure, so we saw some of that. We did see as we exited the quarter growth rates start to improve and as you mentioned, we do expect to see acceleration in the second-half of the year when we bring HeartMate 3 to U.S. here. So we\u2019re well positioned in that market, we have the market leading product. We are \u2013 although albeit on a smaller base, we are continuing to see some nice strong growth on CardioMEMS as well.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to start, just a follow-up on your comments Miles on the FDA warning letter. Can you just refresh us on whether or not there are any non-CRM products that come out of the Sylmar facility. And then also you mentioned that the warning letter wasn\u2019t completely unanticipated. How are you feeling about some of the other St. Jude facilities and just I think if you could comment specifically on the neuromodulation facility in Plano where there was a historic tribulations with an FDA warning letter?","Miles White","Okay while I don\u2019t have any comments about Plano, I mean I don\u2019t have any update for you there. I would say any time you get a warning letter or even observations, 43 observations on GMP at any facility or any plants, it behooves us to go back and look not only at that plant, but all of our plants across the board. So that the corrective actions we take whatever they may be are consistent and our systems and processes are consistent across all facilities.","So any time you get an observation like this or any observation at a single facility, our practice is to go back and look at all facilities. And I\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019re not sitting here at risking our other facilities, but that said we always go back proactively and preemptively and look at every facility to make sure that whatever we\u2019re correcting in one is something that we\u2019ve looked at checked out, assessed, evaluated whatever you want to call it in all of them. So that\u2019s standard practice.","And frankly I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the track record we have in GMP in our facilities and the reputation we have with the FDA, so I think that\u2019s a good thing. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sitting here with a lot of nervousness about other facilities. We\u2019ve had a chance to look at all of St. Jude\u2019s facilities. We had a chance to assess that. Right now I don\u2019t see an indication of something like this elsewhere. So, but that said, we\u2019re all over everything in this \u2013 with this warning letter everywhere. I can\u2019t remember what I missed in the question, because it was a long question.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, I would say \u2013 yes, I would say with respect to the products, the most significant products there are the defibrillator and the CRM products. There are others that are smaller that go through generally a 510(k) process, but the biggest ones are the defibs that you pointed out.","Josh Jennings","Understood, I was hoping just to ask a follow-up question on just the CardioMEMS product line. Are there any updates on interactions with the CMS and the path to national coverage termination. And just your outlook on that asset, it had been one of the growth drivers I believe when the deal was announced last year and any update would be fantastic. Thanks for taking the questions.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes. Our longer term perspective on CardioMEMS is unchanged and we\u2019ve said that since we announced the St. Jude acquisition, quite frankly that we think that there is a lot of long-term potential here. Near-term, we\u2019ve pointed to the fact that there\u2019s more work to be done. We have had interactions with the respective bodies with respect to CardioMEMS and what it will take to get into a better position from a reimbursement standpoint and those are ongoing, I don\u2019t want to get into too many specifics.","But with what we have today, the product is growing nicely, growing 20%, above 20% quite frankly, albeit again on a smaller base. So we are making progress with it. The real world results that we\u2019re seeing, physicians are seeing with it, are strong. Probably better than expected in terms of what most physicians give us feedback on. So, we\u2019re happy with the way the product is performing. We think there\u2019s great long-term potential and we\u2019ll work through the process here and generate the data we need in the near term.","Miles White","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in, I\u2019ll be quick. Brian, just a quick follow-up on Alere and two fast ones. So, is it safe to assume as it relates to Alere, I know you\u2019re not giving a specific accretion. The way to think about it is, we probably have some less synergies based on operating performance and some of the divestitures, but you\u2019ve got a lot more financing flexibility that helps to make up the difference, is that a decent paraphrase of what we\u2019ll see?","Brian Yoor","It\u2019s a decent paraphrase over the coming year, you know once we bring this business under us I\u2019ll compare the assessment, David.","David Lewis","Okay thank you, and two quick ones. The first is, Miles, maybe for you, you talked a lot about India and some on China. I wonder just for this new two invoice policy in China as it relates to your EPD business and device franchise. Any disruption we should be thinking about this year? Any changes to distributors regarding the two invoice policy? And then if there\u2019s any update on the PHP product within heart failure that would be great. Thanks so much.","Scott Leinenweber","Yes, this is Scott. Within China we don\u2019t see any disruption, in fact our EPD business continues to perform extremely well in China as does our diagnostics business double-digit growth on both fronts. So we expect strong growth going forward there as well.","With respect to the PHP, we did temporarily pause the trial and commercial implants. We continue to investigate that and we\u2019ll give an update at the appropriate time, a very modest financial impact though it\u2019s a small product.","David Lewis","Thank you.","Scott Leinenweber","Okay, well good. Well, thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions and that concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call.

With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Robert Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Brian Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will provide opening remarks and Brian will discuss our performance and outlook in more detail. Following their comments, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2019. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.","Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott\u2019s operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.","Please note that financial results and guidance provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.","Miles White","Okay thanks, Scott. Good morning.","Today, we reported results of another strong quarter with ongoing earnings per share of $0.84, reflecting 12% growth on an absolute basis and even higher growth when excluding the impact of currency.","Sales increased more than 7.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by double-digit growth in medical devices and sequential improvements in established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics.","We also narrowed our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.23 to $3.25 which at current rates would reflect high teens growth excluding the impact of currency and is at the upper end of the range we set at the beginning of the year.","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, following our recent strategic shaping and acquisitions we\u2019ve been completely focused on running the company we built. This focus on organic execution is delivering strong performance on a remarkably consistent basis.","Over the last eight quarters, we\u2019ve averaged 7.5% organic sales growth worldwide with very little variation. We\u2019ve also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products, expanded access and reimbursement coverage and generated new clinical data that further enhances the sustainability of our strong growth outlook going forward.","I am particularly pleased with the continued exceptional performance across several of our key growth platforms including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity which I\u2019ll highlight as I summarize our third quarter results in more detail.","And I\u2019ll start in our medical devices business where sales increased double-digits for the second quarter in a row. In Structural Heart, we achieved 16% sales growth led by MitraClip our market leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation or leaking heart valve.","MitraClip sales increased more than 30% in the quarter including U.S. growth of nearly 50%. During the quarter we received U.S. FDA approval for our next-generation MitraClip device and we initiated the first ever U.S. pivotal trial for the minimally invasive treatment of tricuspid regurgitation which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of our TriClip repair system.","Turning now to FreeStyle Libre, our market leading continuous glucose monitoring system that eliminates the need for routine finger sticks. We achieved sales of $0.5 billion in the quarter and continued to add significantly to our global user base, as reflected by organic sales growth of nearly 70%.","During the quarter, FreeStyle Libre obtained public reimbursement coverage on Ontario and Quebec becoming the first and only transfer base glucose monitoring system to be listed by any provincial health plan in Canada.","We also continued to advance our strategy to develop integrated solutions where people with diabetes can seamlessly manage their condition across devices, including recent announcements that we are seeking to integrate Libre with the insulin delivery technologies of Sanofi and Tandem as well as the digital care platform of Omada Health.","This easy-to-use affordable device is changing the way millions of people manage their diabetes and our ongoing efforts to expand awareness, adoption and access for Libre around the world will drive tremendous growth for years to come.","Turning now to diagnostics where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics. The roll out of Alinity in Europe and other international markets continues to drive strong growth in our core laboratory business outside the U.S.","In the U.S. where we continue to outperform the market with our legacy architect system, we\u2019ve made good progress achieving regulatory approvals of immunoassay and clinical chemistry tests for Alinity and are beginning to ramp up our launch efforts in these areas.","With highly differentiated instruments, and a matrix rollout across multiple geographies and diagnostic testing areas over time, Alinity is well positioned to be a multi-year growth platform for our diagnostics business.","In nutrition, sales increased nearly 4% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in international adult nutrition for the third quarter in a row. In pediatric nutrition, above market growth in the U.S. and several other countries was partially offset by challenging market dynamics in Greater China, which comprises a little less than 10% of our overall nutrition sales.","While consumers continue to trade up for premium brands which is the segment where we compete, we've seen volume in the market decline due to historically low birth rates. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitiveness across the various segments and purchasing channels in China, and given our broad portfolio and global footprint, anticipate continued strong performance across other geographies and long term growth opportunities such as adult nutrition.","I'll wrap up with established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter led by strong growth in several geographies including India, China and Brazil. Sales growth in EPD has now improved sequentially for each of the last three quarters, with leading market positions in several international growth geographies; EPD is well positioned for sustained above market growth in some of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in the world.","So in summary, we're performing well across several areas of the portfolio resulting in another quarter of strong sales and earnings growth. We continue to strengthen our product portfolios and key product platforms with a steady cadence of new product approvals, reimbursement coverage and clinical data and we're well on track to deliver ongoing EPS and organic sales growth at the upper end of the ranges we set at the beginning of the year.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?","Brian Yoor","Okay, thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.","Turning to our results, sales for the third quarter increased 7.6% on an organic basis. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen modestly resulting in an unbearable impact on sales of 1.9% from exchange or 50 basis points higher than at rates held steady since the time our call in July.","Reported sales increased 5.5% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 29.1% of sales.","Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.96 which reflects nearly 17.5% growth at the midpoint. We forecast organic sales growth of around 8% and at current rates would expect the exchange to have a negative impact that\u2019s somewhat above 1.5% on fourth quarter reported sales.","We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of around 7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense approaching 27.5% of sales. Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our fourth quarter organic sales growth outlook by businesses.","For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit growth. In nutrition, we forecast low-to-mid-single digit growth. In diagnostics, we forecast mid-to-high single digit growth, and in medical devices, we forecast growth similar to the third quarter, which reflects continued double digit growth in several areas of this business.","With that we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just a couple of questions from me. Miles, just I want to start off on gross. So I mean this time of the year investors are very focused on sustainability and you obviously said, you've been averaging 7.5% for seven to eight quarters. So a couple of questions; One, guidance for the fourth quarter implies a little bit of momentum, deceleration in the business, anything specific to call out there? And then more specifically, as you think about 2020, what are those drivers that get you confident that you can deliver your growth in that 7%, 7.5% range that you\u2019ve been doing the last couple of years? And then, one quick follow up.","Miles White","Okay, David. Well I'll start with what you said. We have had eight straight quarters averaging 7.5%. Going into the fourth quarter, we actually are going to be close to 8%, and then going into next year, I think where we are in the range we've given, I think we gave a range at the beginning of this last quarter of seven or eight, somewhere in that range. And frankly I see no change to that. I don't see any change to momentum at all here. If anything, we've got pretty strong momentum across the board. We've got sequential growth in a number of areas that we've expected improvement in, and we're seeing that EPD comes to mind. Obviously our growth drivers, Libre and MitraClip and the Alinity systems etcetera are all very strong structural hearts, very strong.","So, as I said -- as I said in the past many times, this is sustainable and strong going forward. I see no change to momentum, no change to progress, no change to growth rates. If anything it gets better. So, and it clearly will in the fourth quarter. So, it's pretty strong. And the earnings flows with it, and we're not going to make any guidance forecasts or anything, but I think directionally, here all fundamentals are strong for us.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful, and just one quick product question Miles. There's been Libre 2 obviously important driver for next year. I just want to get your commentary. The longer this product has not been approved; it's led to a kind of concern about the product, the regulatory timeline. Your view, your Tandem partnership yesterday suggests to us that you're still confident in Libre 2 iCGM. Are you still confident in Libre 2 iCGM and how are you thinking about the timing of potential for that product? Thanks so much.","Miles White","I\u2019d say I\u2019m going to comment myself, and then I\u2019m going to hand it to Robert Ford here to comment as well. But first are we confident? Absolutely. The product is performing wonderfully, the growth is strong, and the expansion is strong. There's a lot to be pretty encouraged about. And while I recognize a lot of people including us are feeling impatience, impatience doesn't translate to concern. We're all impatient, and you know we'd all like everything yesterday, but it's not quite working out as yesterday. And Robert can comment on that here, but there is nothing, but good here looking forward with Libre and we anticipate a lot of experience in with this product including with some of these partnerships that we've announced, and working with the interoperability with various partners for what I think will be the future of glucose monitoring and diabetes management.","I think all of this is not just on plan, but spectacular particularly for diabetes patients. And I have nothing, but confidence in it. So let me turn over to Robert to expand on that.","Robert Ford","Yes. David. Admittedly, it's taking longer than we had expected. We obviously misjudged that. We're currently working through a handful of open items with the agency. And what I can tell you, I'm -- you know I've got the same confidence level that Miles does, I'm confident in the data. I'm confident in the product, right. In the meantime, if you look at Libre in Q3, we had -- we had an exceptional Q3. Sales of just under $0.5 billion, that puts us on a $2 billion run rate here with growth rate over 70%. Our international business grew 50% and that's on a large base.","And in the U.S. sales, sales nearly tripled. So and it's tripled because we're adding new patients at a strong and steady rate, and it's a high rate, and you can see that progression in our tool, our axis. So one of the challenges we've had over the nine months here is, it's really been about how to pulse our demand generation activities with aligning to our supply. And we talked a little bit about kind of some of those supply constraints. So we've now released in the third quarter towards the end of the third quarter our next tranche of manufacturing capacity on plan, on schedule.","And I can tell you the commercial team right now is really feeling excited about not being able to have that constraint over and really start to intensify the commercial promotional efforts, whether that's advertising, whether that\u2019s sampling etcetera, both in the U.S. and international. I think that's, that gives us a lot of a lot of excitement as we as we exit the year going into next year.","The value proposition still continues to be very strong to patients and physicians and to payers. And as Miles mentioned in his opening comments, we achieved reimbursement in Canada, public reimbursement, the only sensor system reimbursed in Canada. And it's important, because it's one of the top five largest glucose monitoring markets in the world. And similar to what we saw in some of these large markets, when we attained national reimbursement, we see a pretty accelerated kind of explosive growth. We saw that in Germany. We saw that in France and U.K. So we expect to see that same trajectory in Canada. An early indication suggests that kind of same curve.","So that'll be also exciting for the team as we move into Q4. And as Miles also said, we're pleased with the partnership strategy that we've -- we've adopted. We've gone through it at a very intentional phased approach first with big foot. As you know, we then moved into announcing our agreements with insulin manufacturers, like Novo and Sanofi that connect Libre to their pen systems and the next phase you start to move into insulin pumps. And that was the agreement that we announced yesterday, with Tandem to co-develop an integrated system because we know this is an important segment also connecting to pumps, and we're now at a phase where we feel that we can start to kind of roll that out as we thought about our partnership strategy.","So I think the momentum here on Libre is exceptional. It is very strong, as we go into Q4. We've got a lot of stuff going right, firing on all cylinders, whether it's commercial, whether it's operation, whether it's our R&D program. So I'm very confident on the sustainability of Libre and Libre going forward.","David Lewis","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So two for me, one on capital allocation, one on MitraClip. Well let me start, Miles with the capital allocation. Now that you have more financial flexibility, how are you thinking about capital allocation and the importance of reloading the pipeline? I think on the Q2 call, you seem to deprioritize buybacks. Yesterday you announced a $3 billion share repurchase authorization. So has your view changed? And I just had one follow up on MitraClip.","Miles White","Well I'd say, look we've come through a period where we've paid down a lot of debt. And I think we find ourselves in a good capital balance. I think we've got gotten to the place where our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio is well ahead of what we targeted probably a year earlier than we expected, and that was with an aggressive pay down strategy etcetera. Our business is performing strong, our cash flows are strong. Can we still continue to pay down debt? We can, can we refinance debt? We can. Can we do things that are prudent, good balance sheet management? Yes. And we're also generating cash. We are generating sufficient cash, more than sufficient cash to invest in a lot of manufacturing expansion for all the new products we've talked about. Robert just mentioned one of the biggest, and that's fully funded and obviously coming on line and good.","So you know you say all right well, then how about the dividend? Well we raised the dividend 14% last December, and we have a targeted range where we like to keep that dividend as a percent of our EPS etcetera. So as we go across all the things you can do with your cash, returning cash to shareholders is also a positive thing to do if the conditions are right, and if the return is good, etcetera. And we want to be prepared to have that flexibility on the table as well. We have not done significant share repurchase as you know for several years, while we focused on the pay down of debt. But now, we wanted to add back the flexibility to do that as well.","So I\u2019d say in general, we find ourselves in a strong cash position, strong performance position, good strong balance sheet position. We can continue to pay down some debt, but we've got the flexibility to do just about whatever makes sense for us on a return basis or return to shareholder basis. We don't have any active M&A on the radar screen, to the extent that we track or follow anything. I'd say, it's you know typical bolt-on\u2019s and tuck-ins and so forth that are additions to already strong businesses. We're pretty happy with our pipeline, we're pretty happy with our R&D pipeline. So our standards are pretty high right now, about what's attractive and what may not be, but I'm not forecasting anything significant at all in the M&A areas. So obviously, we want to keep our options open here with how we manage cash for our shareholder.","Larry Biegelsen","Very helpful. And then MitralClip, you have U.S. reimbursement goes up in October. You hopefully will have coverage for the functional MR indication next spring. So you\u2019re thinking about 2020 as an inflection year for MitralClip, and in Europe, it looks like sales improved, growth improved this quarter. How are you feeling about MitralClip outside the U.S? Thanks for taking the question.","Miles White","Larry, I'm going to toss that to Robert Ford.","Robert Ford","Hey Larry. Thanks for the question. So you know we filed our MitralClip NCD. It was kind of opened in August, so that timeline there is usually takes about nine months. I mean, that's the that's the statutory maximum as we'll say. When we did FMR in MitraClip, that took about seven months, so I think we'll be in the December, January timeframe kind of trying to kind of get exactly what quarter that's going to land in. But in the meantime, you see kind of our growth rate, the reimbursement is going to be important, but a structural heart was up mid-teens, and the big driver of that was MitraClip, up 30% up 50% in the U.S. So reimbursement is going to be important, there will be definitely be an inflection point when we get it. But you know as I said in the previous call, you know that is a component. It's a building block here that we're focusing on.","So opening new centers is another kind of key building block. We have about 400 today and kind of I want to get about 550 overtime. And we've been supporting that with investments, investments in our sales force, our clinical specialists, our therapy development specialists so that we can only train the centers, train the implanters to keep up with that demand that we see, but also to support the demand generation through the development of these patient referral networks.","So that investment is ongoing, on target, on plan, in terms of how we're ramping up the field team. And as Miles said in his open comments, we continue to invest also in the innovation side, on the product development side, so in July we obtain approval for our fourth generation MitraClip which has independent graspers, more sizes, etcetera that, it creates good more options to the position. So I think that you know MitraClip here is in its really early innings where I think this is a multi-year, multi-billion dollar growth opportunity that we've got, and it's going to continue to ramp overtime and we're making the investments to make sure we're going to lead in that.","So as I look into that I think we've got the right momentum, and once we have NCD coverage, yes, I think there'll be an inflection to growth.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thanks and good morning. Just two quick product related questions. First, a follow up on the Libre 2 commentary just to kind of set expectations. Just curious, has there been any new data requests from the agency and is the approval of Libre 2 in the U.S. you think possible the next couple months or could it take a little longer?","Miles White","Listen, we\u2019ve \u2013 what I would say is the fall. We've obviously misjudged that. So I'm not going to sit here and try and pinpoint the exact timeline of the approval. As I said also, we're actively working through a handful of open items with the agency, and that's where we're at.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, fair enough. And then, I also want to ask on pediatric nutritionals in China, and just curious if you could elaborate a little bit more on the -- on the slowdown there. And then, just wondering if you can comment on China more broadly and your confidence in growth continuing in China, so just comment on Pediatric Nutritionals in China please?","Robert Ford","Sure. Let me start off then with the nutritional question here then. So you saw our nutritional business was just under 4%. We had really good growth in the U.S. in pediatrics up 4%, double-digit growth in international adult for the second quarter in a row. So our challenge here really was the international pediatric performance, which was really driven by Greater China and I would say some challenging market dynamics here. As Miles mentioned, we're seeing the consumer trade up into the premium brand segment, but the volume has been declining partly because of these low birth rate.","So this is led to what I would say a much more competitive environment, competitive in terms of pricing, competitive in terms of promotional activities and this has now got our full attention, full attention from the management team here and our key thing is really focusing. And the market dynamics are the market dynamics, but we've got to really focus on improving our competitive fitness, our competitive position here in the pediatric segment.","We're launching a series of new strategies here in the coming weeks regarding media campaigns, strengthening our consumer relationship platforms. We've got some plans to launch the new products for the next several quarters. So I'd say that the key focus of us right now in nutrition really has been at this point here to focus on improving our competitive fitness in China.","Miles White","And I'll follow-up on the rest of the other businesses in China. I'll give you a little bit of context. I think I'll speak as a CEO. We, the multinational CEOs of the world, or we -- if we do business in China, are we nervous about trade? Are we nervous about China? Are we nervous about all this? I think you can't help but be nervous about it, but I'll tell you what's interesting while it's affecting some segments of the U.S. economy and U.S. businesses pretty directly, it doesn't seem to be affecting us or our business.","The nutrition challenge we have is completely separate from any kind of trade or economic or autonomy issues other than birth rates. And the performance in our device businesses or diagnostics businesses and so forth are double digits and strong. There is all kind of ways that people can hypothesize that maybe the Chinese government would intervene and make things more difficult and so forth for U.S. multinationals. But in our business we actually go see that and you know the product approvals are coming in a timely manner. The China FDA is doing everything that they're supposed to do and -- for our products. We haven't seen any of that kind of friction at all. And the demand for our products and the performance of our businesses in China has been strong other than the challenge we got with the pediatric nutrition, all other businesses are doing well. Show no signs of any kind of issues. So, while I know that there are industries and segments that are tied to whether it's automobiles, oil, big industries et cetera that may have challenges particularly agriculture, we're not seeing that. And our China business is good.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you very much. Helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks for taking my question guys. Two from me maybe Miles starting off with that, that last question on the macro of China. I know there are number moving parts, China 4x7 on the drug side, some questions around maybe a CapEx slowdown, diagnostic slowdown. Just to be clear, what is your exposure is on the drug or diagnostics side to China? And maybe broadly comment on emerging markets in general? It looks like some of those markets are slowing down and how is Abbott position to handle some of t the macro slowdown if you will?","Miles White","We're all looking at each other trying to figure out who answers what part of that question. You know, I'd say this. Underlying growth in emerging markets is still good. Has it slowed some? Yes. It has slowed some, but it still good. It's a relative thing. So the underlying growth we see in India, Latin America, China et cetera, it's all good. You can say there's the occasional Argentina. Okay, that's not good. Argentina is its own thing. But there are -- the advancement of health care systems, the advancement in demand for health products, pharmaceuticals et cetera strong.","China in particular for us for our pharmaceutical business, strong. We're doing well. I don't think we have a lot of exposure. I'll let Robert to expand on that a minute. But overall I think the conditions for us in those markets remain strong. As we've said many, many times, single most difficult thing we deal with is the volatile currency, if it's volatile. And sometime it is, sometimes it isn't. And right now, currency isn't exactly working in our favor in those markets. So while we grow at a pretty health rate on underlying basis and typically faster than the market, currency erases some of that. Robert?","Robert Ford","Yes. I'll just, Vijay, on the generic pharma in China, I think you're referring to the four plus seven tendering process there. We haven't seen an impact and we don't anticipate a significant impact going forward. We have a fairly kind of concentrated portfolio here of products, just about 15 products here. Most of these products are more specialized kind of segments in areas where there is kind of difficult to manufacture. So on the generic side of the pharma business we're less susceptible to this. Obviously, we're going to monitor. We're part of this process. We understand how the tendering process is going to work. But if I think about kind of bigger impact, we have a less of an impact here given the portfolio of products we have in China.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful guys. And just one quick one on that guidance maybe for Brian, Brian, looks like the Q4 guidance is implying really strong margin expansion, 200 basis points plus. Just given some of the comments on FX; maybe clarified the FX hit to Q4 in the margin side. And in general when you look at 2020, what kind of headwinds are we looking at from an FX perspective? Thank you, guys.","Brian Yoor","Yes. From a topline next year, I'm not going to talk about next year, but I think there would be natural some flow-through on the topline next year, Vijay, perhaps, Scott can back you on that. But let me circle back. If you look at Q3, you saw, we had gross margin of 59.2%. You are absolutely correct. Foreign exchange had an impact on us of about 50 basis points. Otherwise, it would be at 59.7%. So I feel good about where we're guiding Q4. Q4 tend to be that quarter where we get a little bit more natural leverage as well and you'll see that play out through the bottom line, pretty consistent with how we thought about this at the beginning of the year.","As you know, I mean, gross margin improvement, it just part of our DNA. Its part of what we do and how we think about in additional cash flow and its something we\u2019re going to continue to improve upon across all of our businesses and I think you could expect that to continue in the next year. That's how we'll get the double digit growth that we usually start with it and continue to invest back into our SG&A and R&D for our growth.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Miles, I was hoping you could touch on the diagnostics business. This is one you've called out for many quarters now as a durable, multiyear growth driver for the company. We saw fantastic growth in Core Lab this quarter even without really benefit from Alinity hitting U.S. Maybe you could just update us on the status of where you are in Europe in terms of the rollout? What you're seeing in terms of competition, because we're seeing some negative results from competitors. And then the latest and thoughts on the U.S. launch and how we think that uptake there?","Miles White","Okay. Thanks Rob. I'm going to have Robert to do that. So Robbie, we've talked about how this is a multiyear opportunity and we've been executing on this very focused here. If you think about the Core Lab and the rollout of Alinity program, it's doing very well and you can see that in our topline. The rollout has been particularly strong in Europe where we're winning over 50% of the businesses where we targeted an entrenched competitor. And if you think about kind of the renewal process where we're retaining nearly all of our current business that comes up for contract, so we placed over 3000 -- over 3700 instruments and when we give out number we're talking about instruments that are actually placed in the market, placed in the account, running tests and generating revenue. So that's gone very well.","In the quarter you saw that we also got an approval in the U.S. for the Alinity blood and plasma screening. So this fourth quarter here the teams already kind of rolling out that commercial launch. We had a lot of success in rolling out the blood plasma systems in Europe and in Asia last year. So it's great to see that a little ahead of schedule here in the U.S. And the team has jumped on the opportunity. As relates to the immunoassay side, a lot of our focus here is really kind of ramping up on the R&D side, ramping up the menu and the assay menu, let's say that assay completion rate of what we need to be kind of fully competitive in Europe is getting close to about 100% mark that we need.","And in U.S. it's a little bit behind, but a lot of our focus here is to get those systems, those assay approved and in place and we'll start to see that kind of play affecting our growth rate in the U.S. as we move into next year. So, I think internationally we're doing really well. U.S. got the opportunity here at the assays come onboard to be able to accelerate our growth rates. So I'm really pleased with the momentum that the team has done here. Of course, we feel that we can always do better. And naturally we're going to keep on pushing too.","Robbie Marcus","Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up in Neuromodulation. Numbers came in a little softer than The Street was looking for. I'm assuming a big chunk of that was in the spinal cord stim market. Maybe you could just update us as to what exactly you're seeing on the ground with Abbott and what you think is driving the deceleration in the market here in the U.S.? Thanks.","Miles White","Yes. Sure. So obviously still work in progress here. It's a little longer than we had initially hoped. When we talked about it over the last couple of quarters we talked about the salesforce hiring, the salesforce productivity and it\u2019s a very specific selling process here in devices, and if you're new rep, it takes some time to kind of understand it. So that's been going \u2013 that's been progressing well. We've had some stabilization in the sales force and some of the monthly KPIs that we track them on, they're improving. But we've also seen as you pointed out a little of market decline especially in the first half of this year and it follows a couple years of double-digit growth, right?","So lot of our focus here is got to be on salesforce execution and productivity, the approval of Proclaim XR this quarter, I think really provide a nice addition to the portfolio and provide the salesforce with a new technology to promote. And early signs of the launch, it's only been a couple of weeks, but early signs are positive. We tend to look at our trials and our trials across the U.S. in spinal as our leading indicator. And I'd say, early signs are positive, but there's more monitoring there for us to be aware of.","On the market side, there's really no third-party data source here like we have in stents or pacemakers et cetera, so it\u2019s a little bit difficult to peg the growth rate here. We usually have to wait until everybody reports and can kind of look at added up and kind of see where it's at. So I would anticipate here Q3 to be similar in terms of market growth rate. That's the first half of this year which is in that low to mid single digit decline here.","Robbie Marcus","Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.","Rick Wise","Good morning everybody. Miles, I'm always embarrassed to ask questions about EPD business because I always feel like I don't really understand it, but I understand enough to see that the actually X currency has another solid quarter in many of the emerging markets that you're targeting. Maybe just help us understand some of your high level thoughts there, the outlook as it going as you would have expected growth has slowed a little bit relative to the last few years. But again, seems like on track and sustainably on track. Is that the right way to think about it?","Miles White","Yes. Rick, I'd say, I'm never quite as satisfied as I'd like to be, that's for sure. We've learned a couple of things. I think of the seven or eight years we've now been fundamentally focused on emerging markets and their growing economies and so forth. I'd say, if anything was under estimated it was the degree of volatility of currency which is also heavily driven by the strength of U.S. dollar, while we can't predict those things since this business is 100% in emerging markets that's always a bit of a challenge.","Now that said, the underlying growth in those markets has been steadily strong and it's interesting. One indicator of the attractiveness from those markets is, let's just say the multiples and prices and so forth that anybody who owns a pharmaceutical business in those markets thinks that the company is worth. And as we track those for long time, probably some of the highest multiples in the world than any business -- businesses that make money, you know they're attractive, the markets are attractive and they are the attractive parts of branded generic pharmaceutical worldwide.","They are the most profitable there. They are very profitable markets for good branded products as compared to Europe or the U.S. or something like that if you're in that business. So, we targeted this business for a reason. There's underlying real growth. Brands matter, quality matters, breadth matters. And its kind of all the fundamentals that we think are stable, durable, attractive et cetera and frankly all those economies have progressed as we would like maybe not as stably and maybe not as strongly in some cases, but the growth there are still strong. Our own challenge is the R&D investments to continue to expand product lines and product depth into the markets. We keep our R&D somewhat decentralized by region. India has its own. Latin America has its own et cetera.","We're always looking for greater and greater productivity and greater and greater launch activity out of our teams. Every now and then we're going to run into Argentina, a Venezuela or a tax issue in a country like we did in India couple years ago et cetera that are going to put dent in the growth rate for a given year and we've seen that. But the underlying fundamentals are quite strong, quite good and we keep plugging away at all fundamentals that we know how to manage. And as you can tell this last year, we've had steady sequential improvement in our performance excluding exchange and there are 38%.","I think that's pretty good. That means that we know how to take the corrective actions to get stronger, to get better, to drive business better and I think the fact that the managers of pharmaceutical business are up to an 8% growth rate and looking forward to even improvement in that. I think that's pretty strong. So yes, we like business.","Rick Wise","Great. And if I could follow-up just on two quick things. At TCT, we saw some very solid Portico data. I assume we're still on track for mid-2020 U.S. launch. Any updates there'll be great on Portico? And last just in the U.S. vascular business still seems pressured, not really improving. What are the issues? What you're doing? I know you're still focused on execution. Is it competition? Is it \u2013 how do you turn that portion of the business around? Thank you.","Robert Ford","Hey, Rick. This is Robert here. So on your Portico question, yes, we submitted end of Q3, so we expect a kind of mid-year approval here and launch, and we're getting ready for that. On your question on vascular, as we previously mentioned there are couple what I would call noncommercial items that impact the growth rate here. These are third-party royalties, third-party manufacturing agreements that we put in place is part of the St. Jude divestiture, some of the assets.","So those \u2013 as those ramp down as those manufacturing agreements ramp down, as those royalties ramp down, they obviously impact the growth rate. And we've allocated those agreements into the U.S. line even though they are global agreement. So, if you remove those items that are naturally going down as we transition the manufacturing over to the new owners of those businesses and as the royalties ramp down, you remove that out. Our vascular business was flat. And the dynamic there was really little bit of pricing that we've seen on the stent side. We've continued to grow share in the U.S. actually and maintain our leadership position in the international markets.","And that price pressure was then offset by double-digit growth in our Endo and peripheral business and in our imaging and diagnostic business, and that's part of our strategy which is we know that there will be some pricing pressure on the DS side and we know we need to make our investments to maintain our competitive position there, but we also know that we're over investing in our Endo and our imaging strategy so that those businesses can get large enough and those double digits then can really return vascular to a healthy growth rate.","Rick Wise","Thanks Robert.","Miles White","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping that you might just expand a little bit on the Libre dynamics given the continued strength that you've seen outside the U.S. Could you comment on anything like installed base, mix of Type 1 versus Type 2, our payers are getting involved, do they see value there. Anything like that that could help us understand the sustainability of the growth especially outside the U.S. where you continue to have larger and larger base?","Robert Ford","Yes. So let's talk about that base. I mean, the one way to describe it here that it's pretty large and it's growing. We focus lot on the sales side, but if you look at the user base where we're at the 1.5, close to 1.6 million users at the end of this quarter. As we talk a little bit, there's a little bit a constraint on that user base given our manufacturing capacity. So, as we've now unleashed it, I think we've got the potential here that kind of grow that user base even faster.","One of the things that is important here that we've seen as payers and contract start to look at this is that they're very convinced on the outcomes of using sensor-based technology. There's a lot of clinical data that proves that. We actually have RCT trial that show that Libre reduces hypo, reduces time out of range, reduces the time that patients are in hypoglycemia and we backed it up with some fairly large real world evidence trials showing that. And competitors also have that too.","So the value proposition here is how do you get that outcome at a cost that makes sense for the payer where they can actually expand the use of the product and the technology into a much larger user base versus kind of niching it to, kind of very small segments. And that's been the value proposition that we've adopted. And as I said in the beginning of the call, that value proposition is not only very intact, but it is growing, and we see that in the negotiations we had with Canadian Reimbursement Authorities. We see that expansion of the technology beyond just the Type 1 or insulin users in other markets we start to see it expand into Type 2.","So, we think the value of proposition here is very strong and it's a real an opportunity to provide the benefit of the outcomes that are proven at a cost profile that makes sense for the payer. So and it's ultimately about having the impact on outcome for patients and we're seeing that through our trials and through our real world evidence. If you think about the composition of the patients we're looking at 50\/50. We're getting a lot of Type 1s and insulin users, but we're also getting a lot of Type 2s, Type 2 that are single injections or Type 2 that are on oral medication. There are different utilization rates, but we're getting all those patients.","Matt Taylor","One quick follow-up, are you now completely unconstraint on manufacturing?","Miles White","Yes.","Matt Taylor","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the color.","Miles White","Okay. I'm going to wrap up where we started. We had a strong quarter, exceptionally strong quarter. Our momentum continues. We've got some great growth drivers in Libre, MitraClip, the Alinity platforms. Other businesses, they are all growing, many of them double digits and across the board. So the balance of that performance across all businesses and across all geographies is heartening. It is sustainable. Our topline growth rate was 7.6% this quarter.","We think it will be close to 8% in the fourth quarter and as we look into 2020, I see no reason to change any expectations about the strength of our topline sales growth rate which is I think all of you know for a fairly large company unusual to find the other people that are able to do this for tech companies. And so we got some great strength here owing to the strength of our pipeline, our new product launches, the improvements to access and\/or reimbursements and further capabilities of those products. So we've got a good sustainable road ahead of us.","Obviously, there are surprises or things that don't meet our expectations from time to time or the speed with which we want to accomplish things. But overall I think this is good evidence to all, good performance, super performance really and sustainably. So, we look at 2020 with great optimism and great expectations in spite of a lot of the uncertainties in the world and in the economies around the world. We're feeling pretty strong and pretty bullish about where we sit. So with that, we'll see in 90 days.","Scott Leinenweber","Very good. Well, thank you operator and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 am Central Time today on Abbott Investors Relations website at abbottinvestor.com.
