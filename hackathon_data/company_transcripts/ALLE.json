All participants will be in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which we issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses and charges in current year and prior year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results in comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our second quarter 2017 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results, delivering above-market organic growth and continued margin expansion. We delivered solid organic growth across all regions.","For the quarter, revenue was $627 million, an increase of 7.2%, reflecting organic growth of 6.2% as well as the benefit of acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency. All regions contributed to our solid organic growth. The Americas saw organic growth of 6.1% in the quarter, supported by low-double-digit growth in the residential businesses and mid-single-digit growth in our non-residential businesses despite a tough comparable from the prior year. The Americas business continues to see solid returns on our strategic product and channel investments and continues to see favorable trends in end markets.","EMEIA organic revenues grew at 6.3%, its best organic quarter of growth since the spin, led by strong growth in our portable security business. Our Asia Pacific business saw organic revenue growth of 7.8%, led by strong growth in electronic locks.","Adjusted operating income of $136 million increased 8.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, as we continue to demonstrate margin expansion from incremental volume in excess of investment headwinds.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 increased $0.12 or 12.1% versus the prior year. Overall, I'm pleased with the solid revenue growth and operational performance in the second quarter. In addition, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is now $3.65 to $3.80 and reported EPS guidance is $3.55 to $3.72.","Please go to slide 5. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to take a little time to talk about our organic investments. Since the spin, we've been focused on organic investments to drive above-market growth and these investments continue to pay dividends in the market, while also increasing earnings and providing a superior return on invested capital.","The Americas region continues to benefit from our focused investments in channel segmentation and product innovation. Our teams are creating new value in the discretionary commercial market, where channel partners make decisions every day on which brands to provide to end users. They've also worked to accelerate electronic partnerships, strengthen lead management and expand in vertical focused aftermarket programs, all initiatives that are supporting our growth.","In addition, Allegion continues to drive growth and create shareholder value by investing in new technologies. Allegion culture of innovation and our global footprint positions us to not only lead the electromechanical convergence that accelerated. Doing so allows us to bring better solutions to our customers, increase our vitality index and drive growth at Allegion.","We've also formed and maintained strategic relationships to increase the impact of new product development and ultimately drive more growth. Our open architectural approach to design stimulates the development of other devices for us to connect to, while it also allows the integrators and other trusted third-parties to easily connect to our products into their systems.","From day one, Allegion has been committed to making connected products that are the easiest to integrate and secure the places, people and property where we work and live. In residential applications, we now integrate with leading systems like Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings among others. And we offer solutions for the evolving monitored security market as well.","We strive to provide the best platforms to work with for the consumer and ecosystem partners and while leveraging our unique leadership position in the residential multi-family and commercial markets to identify and redeploy disruptive innovations and solutions quickly to enhance our offerings.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2017 guidance.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Dave. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number 6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 6.2% organic growth in the second quarter. The strong organic growth reflects favorable markets in the Americas along with strong performance in the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.","Pricing was solid this quarter and was favorable in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed nearly 2% growth and foreign currency was a headwind particularly in the EMEIA region.","Please go to slide number 7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $627 million. This reflects an increase of 7.2% versus the prior year, up 6.2% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the strong mid-single-digit organic revenue growth from all regions. The organic growth was driven by strong volume. We also had good price realization in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwinds seen in the EMEIA region.","Adjusted operating income of $136 million and adjusted operating margin of 21.7% increased 8.2% and 20 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage and productivity, which more than offset the impacts of product and geographic mix, incremental investments and headwinds from FX.","As stated earlier, pricing during the quarter was solid and allowed us to absorb and manage through the higher inflation we experienced. The business continues to execute at a high level demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.","Please go to slide number 8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2016, reported EPS was $0.98. Adjusting $0.01 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.99. Operational results increased EPS by $0.13, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. A decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.07 per share increase versus the prior year. The decrease in rate is primarily due to favorable impacts from discrete tax items including a $0.09 per share benefit from the release of a valuation allowance. These discrete benefits more than offset unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions.","A reduction in the number of outstanding shares drove a $0.01 per share increase. Interest and other income were a net $0.04 per share reduction. This was primarily attributable to the positive impact from the sale of non-strategic marketable securities during the second quarter of 2016 that did not repeat in Q2 2017. This impact was partially offset by the previously-announced sale of our equity investment in iDevices, which had a $0.03 per share benefit.","Incremental investments were a $0.05 per share reduction. These investments relate to new product development and channel initiatives, which allow us to grow faster than the market, expand our electromechanical presence, and increase our vitality index. This results in adjusted second quarter 2017 EPS of $1.11 per share, an increase of $0.12 or just over 12% compared to the prior year with the growth driven primarily by operational improvements and organic growth. We have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2017 reported EPS of $1.10.","Please go to slide number 9. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $468.6 million, up 7.4% on a reported basis and 6.1% organically. The strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new products and channel initiatives, as evidenced by low-double-digit growth in electromechanical products. As noted on the chart, we experienced low-double-digit growth in residential products, driven by strength in electronics. Non-residential products saw a mid-single-digit organic growth.","Pricing was strong in the quarter at nearly 3%, as we continue to effectively manage the price\/cost dynamic. This quarter also saw a tough comparable driven by last year's ERP implementation, which was mostly offset by favorable timing of orders and shipments during the quarter as a result of a previously-announced price increase.","On a year-to-date basis, the Americas had first-half growth of 9.6% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Americas adjusted operating income of $140.5 million increased 8.1% versus the prior-year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin was driven by strong price and incremental volume leverage, more than offsetting the impact of inflation, unfavorable mix and incremental investments. The operational increase, while absorbing incremental investment spend, demonstrates continued excellent performance by the Americas team.","Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $129.2 million, up 6.3% on both a reported and organic basis. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in the portable security business, along with solid price performance. Currency headwinds offset the contributions from acquisitions. As mentioned previously, the organic revenue growth of 6.3% is the best organic revenue growth quarter since the spin.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9.4 million increased 1.1% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 30 basis points, driven by unfavorable product and geographic mix along with FX headwinds. Favorable price and productivity offset the impacts from inflation and incremental investments.","Please go to slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $29.2 million, up 9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 7.8%, driven primarily by solid growth in the electronic products across the region. Total revenue was also supported by contributions from acquisitions, and currency had no impact during the quarter. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $2.3 million, with adjusted operating margins down 70 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins were impacted by unfavorable regional mix and an inflation. On a year-to-date basis, operating margins in Asia Pacific were up 80 basis points, reflecting good volume leverage and operating performance.","Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2017 was $42.6 million, which is a decrease of $42.1 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease is driven by the previously-announced $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter, partially offset by higher net earnings.","Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle slightly increased in the second quarter 2017 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements and the timing of revenue during the quarter. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital.","Lastly, we are affirming our full-year available cash flow guidance of $300 million to $320 million, which is net of the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment.","I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2017 guidance.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 13. As noted on this slide, we are raising total revenue growth in all regions, given performance during the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. As noted, we're raising organic revenue guidance in the Americas and Europe, while reducing Asia Pacific. This results in total revenue increasing to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% and organic revenue increasing to a range of 6% to 7%.","If we look closer at the Americas business, we believe that our organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will continue to deliver better than market growth. We continue to see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and expect momentum in single-family construction to continue to support solid residential markets. European markets are being bolstered by general macroeconomic improvements such as the highest consumer confidence rate since 2008 and the lowest unemployment level since 2009. The total revenue and organic revenue growth rates are now the same, signaling that FX headwinds are not what we had anticipated when giving original guidance.","In the Asia Pacific region, electronics remain a key driver of growth. Similar to EMEIA, the FX headwinds we anticipated in our original guidance are not as prevalent, which is why total revenue guidance was increased.","We are raising our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.65 to $3.80, an increase of $0.05 on both the low end and high end. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 9.3% to 13.8%. The guidance includes a reduction of reported EPS related to restructuring and acquisition expenses in the range of $0.08 to $0.09. This brings our updated guidance for reported EPS to a range of $3.55 to $3.72. Included in the revised guidance is an assumption for the full-year tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%. The guidance continues to assume outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million.","Please go to slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, reported revenue growth over 7%, organic revenue growth over 6%, adjusted operating margins increased 20 basis points, adjusted EPS saw just over 12% growth in the quarter. These first-half results position us well for the full year. We are raising our guidance for revenue growth both total and organic, raising our adjusted EPS outlook and we affirm our available cash flow guidance.","Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to...","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","How are you doing? I wanted to hit just on the non-res piece, so mid-single-digit growth, you did have a tough comp, you've really highlighted some of the channel investments starting to pay off. Dave, is there any way to kind of delineate what you're seeing on the light commercial side versus the traditional institutional side where you've had strong presence historically?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We clearly are seeing a positive momentum in the investments in light commercial. Remember, as we talk, Rich, that that's area of the market that we didn't feel that we were as well positions and believe we can use our mid-price point products, our improved position endorsed (21:28) to go in and grow in a marketplace that we weren't as active. So we like our position and think momentum will pick up over the next year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. So it sounds like a little bit better there or we're trending a little bit better than it had been.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yes.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just in terms of investment spending, Patrick, can you just refresh us on the investment spending for this year? And then if we think about 2018 kind of early read on how that should trend in 2018 and then longer term if we get into some sort of meaningful slowdown in the U.S. market, how would you adjust investment spending and what are the toggles there we should be thinking about longer term as the economy hits the cyclical peak?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah, so our full-year guide on investment spending is $0.15 to $0.20 impact. That hasn't changed since our going out at the beginning of the year. We saw a little bit of uptick in Q2 that was planned. I would continue to think that Q3 be kind of a similar level, then taper down a little bit in Q4, again all according to our plan as Dave highlighted seeing some really good benefits relative to the investments both in our channel segmentation as well as new product development. I think a lot of that is helping us drive above-market growth relative to the overall industry.","As we look forward to 2018, it's a little early to tell right now. As we've talked previously, we look at each year independently. Each year comes up with different potential opportunities that we look at in terms of (a) investments, how we are going to manage that relative to expectations and earnings, what's our degree and capability to execute on particular programs, but we will continue to invest in the business and believe that will continue to drive above-market performance in both revenue growth as well as earnings. Will it be higher than this year? I think probably not, but again we'll take a closer look in our planning process in the back half of this year. But your last question, what could we do in a market downturn, I mean a lot of these are variable related to the extent that some is demand creation and you could certainly shut off a spicket related to that if we needed to.","Some of them are head count related. We monitor those, so that's kind of toggled basis of the \u2013 how the market's performing, how we're performing. And so, that's something if, for example, we went into the year with higher incremental investment spend and the market outlook turned south on us, we could shut that down as well. Like any good business, we would manage the cost side of the business basis of the market demand.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. Just a quick question on price and raw materials, I guess. So pricing very, very strong in the second quarter, it's almost 2.5% after 1% in the first. Just wondered how you see the price outlook for the second half, whether you think you'll be somewhere in that sort of 1% to 2% range still like the first half. And also any update on quantifying the raw material headwind, just because obviously the last time, you may have faced a headwind from that, it was back in 2011 before the spin-off. So it's hard to see how the business would perform regarding input costs.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So historically you go back and this business has done extremely well in terms of passing on price from incremental cost related to material inflation. Not seeing any difference. As related to Q2, pricing outpaced material cost. I think we were able to get a quick start on that. We had visibility obviously late last year. The performance was extremely strong, and I would say that's really attributable to many factors. One, obviously, you have strong markets, we're benefiting from that. Two, well-disciplined industry. Three, we've implemented some new tools to help us manage pricing better more specifically, which is helping us get better price realization, particularly in the Americas.","I wouldn't expect \u2013 we had, I think, 2.4%, 2.5% price realization in the quarter. That's going to taper down probably a little bit in the back half of the year, but to your comment, 1.5% to 2% in the second half within certainly the realm of possibility, which is better than what we performed last year. We did announce a price increase in Americas to take effect August 1, which is quicker than what we've normally done historically, and so hopefully that'll have some benefit in the business as we go forward as well.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks a lot. And then just my last one would be around the margin expansion path in EMEIA? I think in the first quarter, you had had a bit of choppiness around aspects like the CISA restructuring and maybe some of the M&A integration. Any update on that, please?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, well, first of all, as we indicated in the results, revenue growth was outstanding organically. It had the best quarter since the spin, so it's really pleased to see that. I think you're seeing a good performance from our business, but the market's improving a little bit as well, which is a good sign. Unfortunately, it didn't pull through incremental margin. It was one of those quarters that kind of had a lot of things working against us, some unfavorable one-time items, unfavorable mix both from a product, geographic perspective. FX was a headwind.","The plant move that you mentioned, I'd say we've made improvements, particularly on customer delivery and performance, not out of the woods yet. It's still going to be a little bit of headwind on the cost side, but again making improvements. Our expectation is the second quarter excuse me the second half of 2017 to show incremental margin improvement both in Q3 and Q4, which will give us a full year-over-year improvement for the year, close to that 10% objective we established earlier.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","I wanted to just add in. I continue to feel very good about the progress that we make over time in Europe. The CISA move more \u2013 has a lot of complexity. There's a lot of SKUs and as we start up those SKUs in our new manufacturing capability, it put some chop into demand, but we made progress in improving customer satisfaction and reducing backlog in the quarter. I expect that to continue over the next 12 months.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So maybe just following on Julian's question there on price\/cost. So, Dave, you think that from a pricing perspective, maybe you can kind of keep that 1.5% to 2.5% in the back half of the year. How are you guys thinking about cost and commodity inflation in the back half of the year? And specifically are you hedging any of your commodity costs?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So commodity prices particularly on steel, zinc and brass, copper will kind of stabilize, if you will, sequentially Q2 to Q1, but still continues to rise, and spot rates are higher today than they were when we ended the quarter. And so we see a continued pressure on the cost side. But again I think relative to the price\/cost dynamic, hopefully we can mitigate that as we move forward on the price increase. So I kind of look at it as continued good price realization performance, cost higher than what we anticipated, but the expectation is we should be able to offset that in the second half of the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. So I mean the expectation then I guess for second half is that this price\/cost is going to remain positive, correct?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yes.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my follow-on question, when I take a look at your balance sheet now, we're at a point where your gross leverage is starting to trend below your typical kind of like 2.75% to 3.25% range that you're typically at. What does your M&A pipeline look like?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So we continue to work the M&A pipeline. I have to reflect here half the time at my own performance in successful acquisitions and disappointed. It's not because of a lack of effort. I would say it's more of a lack of \u2013 it's more driven by discipline. We've looked and put our fingers in a lot of deals, and we've just not pulled the trigger because they didn't line up with our expectations. But I'd say the pipeline is active. There are several files that we're working around the world, and we'll continue to be disciplined and active and believe that we'll pull things in. With that said, our capital allocation policy continues to focus on organic growth, M&A, share buybacks. We bought back some shares in the quarter, and as we see the need to do it, we're going to move on all three of those levers.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rizk Maidi with Berenberg.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yes. Good morning, guys. My first question is really on the organic revenue growth guidance for the full year of 6% to 7%. So you basically achieved 7% in H1. At 6% to 7% for the full year it means that the low end of the full-year guidance implies growth slows down to 5%. Even at the midpoint, it actually implies that growth slows down to 6% from 7% as I said. I'm just wondering why that is the case, please?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah, so I would characterize it as maybe a little cautiousness in the second half of the year. We had better visibility going into 2017, and as you indicated, really strong growth in the first half of the year, still strong performance in the second half of the year is the expectation. We did raise the guide on both organic and total revenue growth, and that's reflective of very strong first half of the year. Pretty strong organic growth in the second half of the year. I'd say a couple of things, a little cautiousness. Order intake has been a little, I'd say, choppy relative to what we saw in the first part of the year. And I think that's more from a capacity, industry perspective, and the ability to absorb all the new construction activity. So, hey, look, still the market outlook isn't changing, and we're still bullish on the market dynamics and what we're seeing in terms of bid quote activity, specification writing activity, et cetera.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I want to weigh in here too. Our organic growth, I think, globally is noteworthy. What we see in the market is variance from month to month in terms of incoming orders, and I think that variance comes from a lack of labor, especially in the Americas across the value stream. This would be our contractors, mechanical labor, wholesalers, installers. And so we think that requires some conservatism in terms of what we view. We believe that Allegion will do better in our markets based on our execution than our competition and remain extremely positive on our end markets as we look out over the next 12 months.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. Thank you. And then secondly maybe on EMEIA, the 6% organic growth you said it's the highest since the spin. Can you just give us a sense what is driving that kind of by country basis and also how large is SimonsVoss today within EMEIA, if you could just give us a sense for that, please?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So the growth is driven through the investments we've made in portable security. We like that. We think we're again executing across the country areas. We're seeing some performance based on investment initiatives similar to what we've done in the United States, spec writing, project-based business. We don't split out SimonsVoss, but we continue to be extremely pleased with the performance of that asset.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And once again, as a reminder, we do ask you that you limit yourself to one question in consideration for the others. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I actually try to probably squeeze in two, even though we just got the rule handed down there. But first, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the mix effects in your business in the quarter. It was negative in all three segments. I assume some of it's kind of the electronic dynamics and the like. But just what's going on there and the impact on margins in the quarter would be interesting.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, not so much on the electronics migration. That is growing faster than the overall business, and as we've talked about previously, that's a great trend for us because of the higher selling price but similar margin, so it doesn't really impact the margin profile of the business, but does contribute higher EBIT dollars which obviously we like. The mix is more a function of the \u2013 particularly in Americas the residential business growing double digit, non-res single digit and some of that's the tough comp we had relative to last year. But as you know, the residential business operates at a lower operating margin, and with a higher growth from that, you have a mix effect there.","Also geographically, Europe had some unfavorable mix just based on the country mix. In Asia Pacific, it was more generated around a specific region, had a couple of one-time orders last year in North Asia that normally carried a higher margin than say in markets like China or Southeast Asia.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And then maybe a little bit bigger picture, just watching this proliferation of do-it-yourself home security, that doesn't directly play to you, right, the voice-activated life to do-it-yourself security systems, et cetera. I mean obviously you're aligned with the big guns with the Apple HomeKit and the like, but do you see any change in just kind of the nature of what's going on in the residential market as new entrants try to find an angle into the home and how are you addressing that?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, Jeff, we would observe that there is disruption and new thinking going on. I think it helps us sharpen our game. The second change that we see is what we call the last mile. Clearly with the growth of home delivery of goods, it changes the way people think about home security. We think there're some fundamentals that are important, number one; open platforms, being able to connect, simplicity, ease of use; third, providing a good product that's reliable that's \u2013 we've thought about our primary role, that's security. We're extremely pleased with our residential electronic growth. We see the market growing at low-double digits and we're growing above that. So we're going to continue to be nimble, think about the opportunity and try to position Allegion to be able to participate in that growth globally.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Tim.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I guess just on the residential business, growing low-double digits, I know the comparison was a little bit easier, but is there a way that you could just elaborate a little bit on what that look like within repair\/remodel or big box and then what that look like in new construction? And then is some of this being driven by some of the investments that you've made in electronics, specifically in resi?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So we feel good about what we did in the quarter across the board. I think we see some of the strongest growth in our Res-Pro, which is new construction. We had good year-over-year growth for that and you see the strength in the new construction part of it. We have made specific investments to serve that new construction market. Second, we get good traction with the electronic locks. We believe that we're gaining share in consumer confidence. Renovation investment is some of the healthy it's been since the crash and we're benefiting from that.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Good luck on the second half, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. I'm doing a study on security integrators and also the specifiers that work with them, and we're finding out that there is a narrowing of those of the use of who the large, who the end users are using in the integration fields, smaller and smaller group. The names are far obviously familiar to you. How does that narrowing of the integration group itself as to who is being used affect your business? Do you have to \u2013 are you tailoring more or less? Is your open platform an advantage do you think for a smaller group of integrators as opposed to the dropoff the smaller and midsized guys as the larger companies and the more IT-oriented integrators in security begin to play a larger and larger role in the market share out there?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Sure. I need to see the study. If you want to share that data that comes out, it'd be helpful, but my observation would be this. You've got customers in that integration value stream across the spectrum. We think it's the higher end homes that weigh more heavily in those integration partners, people that would require high-end security systems. We think they will prefer a superior product, the technical support. I think one of the bigger challenges there, Jeff, is aesthetics. And that's why miniaturization, battery life become important, but we look at that integration of our products with other systems as a growth opportunity beyond what we're doing today, and we'll invest and focus to be able to serve that.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. And just quickly related to that, you were a smaller player in the midsized industrial market. You've obviously come on with a number of products in that area. What new types of things can we expect at some of the tradeshows coming up for you folks? You not give me anything specific, but obviously in general, how are you trying to more fully penetrate that mid-priced market? Is it just new iterations of the same and new product that you had out there or is it actually \u2013 will there be actually new lines of products coming out?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So I think about a building 10 years out, every opening will be connected. And how does that expand the opportunity at the high performance product set, which we do extremely well at, look at our mid-price point products to offer more connectivity, more intelligence and being able to bring that together and supportive. I think the opportunity, Jeff, here as it comes together, I think customers are demanding more Apple esque type systems that where customers have ease of use and connectivity, and those are the things that we think are important that will differentiate Allegion, is making it simple for the end user to operate and integrate with the systems, fire, access, alarms, potentially HVAC in a simple way. And that's where our direction will be and we think it will make a difference for Allegion.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question. I think on their call, ASSA cited a double-digit growth in request for quote specifications when they're asked about the end market strength. What are you guys seeing? Are you seeing something different, something similar? And does that raise a possibility of things actually accelerating in the second half?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Your question is in terms of future demand, quotations is strong. As I go out and meet with customers, demand is strong, our backlog is healthy and we think it's reflective of how we see the next 12 to 18 months. In particular, I spent some heavy time here, I had time working with our economists, and we see good drivers in primary demand. We see this what I call incoming variance. I think the market is somewhat capped on the availability of labor, but it will push this recovery even longer and it's a little bit like a snow pile. The demand is there and we like our position in it.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just another question. You guys are pushing into the door market in North America. Can you just tell us what the experience has been so far as you pivot the strategy towards that market where you're just sort of, not ignored for a while, but were not as active in it for many years and now you're really increasing your level of activity? And what the competitive dynamic is as you are pushing there?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Having to bake the first 24 months around doors, the role that it plays in the marketplace, our competitive positioning, we've invested in both mechanical capability and people to enhance our Steelcraft competitiveness and on-time delivery. We've acquired Republic Doors. We feel extremely good about the position that we had, but we feel you must have regional capability, laid out adaptation capability and the ability to provide that adaptation and local delivery in the markets. We're going to continue to drive that strategy. And we like the growth dimension that it gives, especially in some of these light commercial areas. We had a question earlier about that light commercial. It's helping us grow in that part of the market that was underserved by Allegion.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you very much.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Wolfe Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Josh.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Hey, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Just a couple of clean-ups here since we covered a lot of ground already. I guess, first, on some of the big pushes that you guys have had particularly on the non-resi side on the engaged platform and then commercial retrofit, Dave, can you just kind of remind us how those two were doing, I guess, on the commercial retrofit side, maybe from a share perspective? Where you guys started, where you think you're at today, and then what the growth was on commercial electronic relative to rest of the portfolio?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So commercial retrofit, we'll also refer to it as channel led, we continue to build that out, but if we use a baseball analogy, we're in the sixth, seventh inning, still work to be done because it's a people-led driven thing, continues to exceed our expectations. A good part of the market, good partnering with our channel partners as well as locksmiths, so feel good about that.","In terms of the electronics growth, we like the growth. It's a new market for us. The market does not adapt quickly. We're taking mechanical guys, flipping them to electronic guys and so we're moving much faster on the res, multi-family, and we think that's the opportunity for growth. Clearly, this electronics evolution will grow at low-double digits and we think we're positioned well to be able to grow in that space.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Is that low-double-digits growth reflective of what's happening on the commercial side as well?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","That would be overall growth. Put the commercial institutional side as high-single-digit growth, it will adapt at a slower pace, but it will move over the next strategic planning period.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. And then, Dave, I think people have asked this question a few times now. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get the finer points of it, but relative to last quarter, is price\/cost a tailwind or headwind in your guidance? Did you tweak that up or down? I know that it's still kind of net neutral the tailwind on the overall, but was that toggled up or down versus the last time you guys guided?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, slightly positive in Q2; neutral, I'd say, in the second half of the year, both price improving as well as cost inflation.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Which sounds consistent with what you guys said before, if I remember right?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Right. Right.","Josh Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Rob.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Rob.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. I wanted to clarify the comments on the pull forward activity ahead of the price increase. It sounds like that may have added three or four points to Americas in the quarter.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, as we indicated, we went out with the price increase announced about a month prior to quarter end. We believe that had the effect of bringing forward some orders and shipments, hard to quantify, but there was a spike in some activity. It did have the effect of mitigating kind of the ERP implementation, the effect that we saw in terms of last year. So hey, look, hard to quantify in terms of whether it's three to four points. But clearly, there was some pull forward from Q3 into Q2. But I think, as I think about it, looking forward on a full-year basis, again really strong revenue growth and the outlook up 50 basis points in Americas. I would make this observation with it. We were quick to pull the trigger on that price increase. We would typically give more advanced notice, and it didn't give the pop that may create some drag in the second half. So we needed to react to the inflation that we're seeing, but it wouldn't measure up the historical price increases in terms of pulling a bunch of the volume forward.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. I mean you had set it almost to offset the ERP, which you had quantified at three to four points, so that's where I went with that, but \u2013 so should we expect some kind of payback in third quarter or it sounds like not so much?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I'd say not so much.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then maybe just a couple of housekeeping items on the guidance. Could you just clarify what's changing or what was in the guide and what wasn't vis-\u00e0-vis the iDevices sale, the tax benefit $0.09 in the quarter, I think most of that was contemplated, but maybe not all and then FX kind of embedded in there versus prior?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So you may recall last quarter, we increased guidance, I think, by $0.05 and that was predominantly due to the iDevices gain as well as tax benefit expectations. We guided lower on the effective tax rate. So some of the benefit that we saw in Q2 was already baked in. Now basis of our full-year guide, the 19% to 18.5%, that implies second-half effective tax rate higher, low-20s say, to kind of get at that range. So there is some pressure there, if you will, year-over-year in the back half with the effective tax rate.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And currency?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Currency. We upped our overall reported revenue growth and that's due to favorable exchange rates predominantly on translation, so it is an improvement year-over-year, but not too much flow-through in terms of earnings.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. This is Robert Aurand on for David this morning. Looking at the Europe business, strong organic growth, and you called out strength in the portable security business. Can you give us a sense of maybe how more the core AXA business did there?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","How the core business did?","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Yes.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Strong electronics, this would come from SimonsVoss in our hospitality business. Core business, market performed. We could have done better if our supply chain was running. So you hear us talk about we moved production capabilities to Eastern Europe and we made progress on that, but we left some revenue on the table. It will get better every quarter, as we go over the next 12 months.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that's all the time we have right now for questions. I would like to return the call over to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","We'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's call.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau. Please go ahead.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kaye. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for the first quarter 2016 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide number two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligations to update these forward-looking statements.","Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current-year results and charges related to the devaluation of the previously held Venezuelan business from the prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2016 results which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We posted a solid quarter of results delivering organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all geographies. Revenues of $502 million grew 9.5% reflecting organic growth of 3.6%, as well as the benefit of prior-year acquisitions. Europe and Asia Pacific revenues were in line with expectations from a market and performance level.","I would like to note that the Americas organic growth of 3.4% was delivered despite the implementation of a new operating system at our Indianapolis operation facility. This is part of a natural evolution of an older legacy system that will allow Allegion to continue to deliver best-in-class products and solutions. I am very pleased with the progress thus far and the speed and flexibility demonstrated by our teams to make the continuous improvements necessary to quickly restore our industry-leading delivery cycles at the Indianapolis plant.","We believe the non-residential markets continue to show stable growth as reflected in the strength of our orders and backlogs in the first quarter. Patrick will provide further details when discussing the America's financials.","Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% versus the prior year. Overall operating margin improved by 40 basis points with all regions delivering increases versus the prior-year period. We remain focused on our growth strategies and continue to balance ongoing investments with improved operating performance.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 increased more than 19% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven from improved operating performance and acquisitions. This is our seventh straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","Also in the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares. This is consistent with our balanced capital allocation strategy and goal to offset dilution at a minimum.","Please go to slide four. In the Americas, Allegion's distinctive position as both a non-residential and residential market leader gives our team the capabilities to leverage technology across both markets. Utilizing these unique capabilities, we've implemented a new multi-family strategy to drive profit and grow market share, as well as establish thought leadership as the key implementation of multi-family strategy.","Allegion has created Schlage Control, the next-generation of electronic access for the world of multi-family. The open integration capabilities deliver the ability for property owners to manage both residential and common area doors on a single superior system and from anywhere using cloud or Web-based apps. Schlage Control eliminates dealing with traditional keys while providing residents convenient smart card and phone credentials. Our deadbolts launched in December 2015 and our interconnected locks are set to launch in May.","A number of other multi-family growth opportunities are being pursued including accelerating OEM software platforms, leveraging relationships with market influencers and creating standard specification guidelines. With all these initiatives, Allegion has created a complete solution package to offer multi-family customers. We look forward to watching for more success in the multi-family segment throughout 2016 and beyond.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year guidance.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Please go to slide number five. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 3.6% organic growth in the first quarter with balanced contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization and volume growth was supported by stable markets that performed as expected. Foreign currency remains a headwind but is moderating sequentially when compared to prior quarters. And acquisitions contributed approximately $46 million or 10% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.","Please go to slide number six. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $502.3 million, which is a 9.5% increase versus the prior-year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth given solid price realization, the benefit of acquisitions, and organic contributions from each region. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth and are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives.","Adjusted operating income of $84.6 million increased 12.5% compared to the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year margin and growth. The benefit of acquisitions, favorable pricing, productivity and net commodity deflation more than offset other inflation and investments.","Of note, volume increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix in the quarter most notably related to the mix of products sold in the Americas. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide.","I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 19.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.","Please go to slide number seven. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.47. Adjusting $0.04 for the prior year, Venezuela devaluation and non-cash impairment charge, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.51.","Operational results increased EPS by $0.07 as favorable price, foreign exchange and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Although foreign exchange was a revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs resulting in a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year. Acquisitions net of divestitures added $0.04 in the quarter.","Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of $300 million of senior notes completed in the third quarter 2015. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of non-strategic marketable securities in a onetime benefit from equity investments.","The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.01 per share decline versus the prior year. The first quarter effective tax rate is higher than the full year guidance, reflecting the timing of certain tax positions.","Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.03 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2016 EPS of $0.61 per share, an increase of approximately 20% versus the prior-year period.","Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrive at first quarter 2016 recorded EPS of $0.60.","Please go to slide number eight. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $363 million, up 2.5% or an increase of 3.4% on an organic basis. The residential business continues to perform well, delivering high-single-digit growth with strength across all channels. Our investments in electronic products and style and design solutions continue to deliver strong results.","The non-residential segment delivered low-single-digit growth while implementing a new operating system at our Indianapolis facility. It's important to note that we realized high-single-digit non-residential order growth in the first quarter and associated increase in backlog primarily driven by the system transition. As such, we expect some quarterly timing impacts as we work through the backlog. We continue to believe that the market fundamentals for non-residential construction remain in place for low- to mid-single-digit growth for the year.","Americas' adjusted operating income of $91.6 million was up 3.6% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by favorable price, material productivity and material deflation that fully offset unfavorable mix in the quarter. The unfavorable mix was due to the strength of residential growth as well as a mix of commercial product as impacted by the timing effect on shipments related to the operating system transition.","Please go to slide number nine. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.5 million, up 45% or up 3.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered more than $36 million in incremental revenue. Electronic product growth continues to be strong driven by hospitality and CISA products.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.3 million increased 219% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 380 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 550 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation, as well as contributions from recent acquisitions which were accretive to the region's margins.","Please go to slide number 10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $20.8 million, down 8.4% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $9.9 million reduction in revenues year-over-year. Excluding the system integration business, revenues grew approximately 63%. This reflects the contributions of acquisitions in the region as well as organic growth exceeding 14%. Most sub-regions performed well with notable strength in our China hardware and Australia\/New Zealand segments.","Asia Pacific broke even on adjusted operating income basis, which reflects an improvement of $2.6 million versus the prior-year period. We continue to drive focus on mechanical and electronic hardware solutions, are leveraging the acquisitions made in 2015, and are making good progress in addressing stranded costs related to the system integration divestiture.","Please go to slide number 11. Available cash flow for first quarter 2016 was negative $8.2 million, slightly below prior year. The negative cash flow in the quarter is typical of our historical performance and reflects the seasonal use of working capital. As evident in the increased ratios on the slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed on effective and efficient use of working capital.","Lastly, we continue to guide full year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year.","I will now hand the call back over to David for an update on our full year 2016 guidance.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 12. We are affirming our 2016 guidance for revenue and earnings per share as noted on the slide. Our view of the global markets remain unchanged with better confidence given first quarter performance.","The Americas residential markets continue to perform well especially in big box and e-commerce aftermarket segments. And although U.S. GDP growth projections have moderated slightly, we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core non-residential markets. Within major institution of verticals, we still expect modest growth in education with flat to modest healthcare expansion.","For Americas' revenue, the heavy lifting of our Indianapolis operating center integration is behind us, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve full year organic growth of 5% to 6%. I am pleased with growth delivered in the first quarter from our EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions in support of our full year targets. Our acquisitions are delivering growth and the markets are performing as expected.","Please go to slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm pleased with our first quarter results that deliver organic revenue growth and margin expansion across all of our reporting segments and earnings per share growth of more than 19%. Allegion is executing on our margin improvement in EMEIA, benefiting from our acquisitions and realizing contributions for our new product introductions especially within the electronic segment. Finally, we remain on track and are positioned well to deliver our original guidance.","Now, Patrick and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Josh.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just on the ERP implementation, Dave, if I understand you right, it sounds like the high-single-digit order growth that you saw in the quarter would have been converted, so the low-single-digit sales would have been closer to high-single digit. I just want to make sure I understand that right just to start.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you read that properly. As we looked at the quarter, January orders were a bit anemic. We would have liked to see that come in a little bit stronger, and we accelerated through the quarter.","We turned on the ERP system February 1. With any kind of start-up that reflects \u2013 that ERP system, 25%, 30% of our Americas volume. We had some start-up issues, it got better through the quarter, and we see continuous improvement every day at Indy operations. And today, our output is eating into our backlog.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I guess just as that relates to making up the 1Q difference or backlog build, how does that layer out 2Q versus rest of the year? And how do you tie that out, the high-single-digit you're seeing today, to still that low-single-digit outlook that you guys are embedding in the guidance?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, just a couple of follow-ons, Josh. So, as Dave indicated, it's primarily a timing issue relative to the shipments not a \u2013 what we think is a market share issue. Order activity, probably a little bit north of our full year organic growth expectations that we give 5% to 6% in Americas. The backlog would reflect that.","So, I would say maybe another way to look at it is without this, we certainly would have participated well within that range, probably at the higher end of that full year range. So, as we look going forward, we're making good strides of progress. Production is up relative to year-over-year eating into the backlog every day. And so, the thought would be to make it up as soon as possible to get our delivery cycles back to customer demand quickly, but it's probably going to be a Q2, Q3 fully caught up.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And then, just to follow on to that question, I don't know if you answered already, how does that relate to low-single-digit outlook for the year? It seems like orders are a bit ahead of that.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, order activity is tracking a little bit north of that. The difficult thing to ascertain as it relates specific to our Indianapolis facility is whenever you go out with these changes, you communicate, of course, your customer base. So there maybe some order activity that's trying to get ahead of it, get the products in the queue and so I think it's a little bit too early to adjust our guidance northward. We'll get a better perspective as we progress throughout this quarter.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would emphasize, too, Josh, we would expect acceleration in this time of the year. As we go into the summer construction season, there's a ramp-up. That's why we implement big changes in ERP in Q1, but that ramp-up is positive and we will give you an update at the end of Q2 how we assess that. Is it better than we thought? But clearly positive about what we see from an incoming order rate.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I've got two separate questions. I guess just first on the ERP implementation. Are there any heightened costs associated with trying to get that backlog out or you added more labor, shifts, or anything like that to be aware of on the margin side? And then secondly, could you just comment on some of the treasury proposals around inversions and tax stripping, and how we should think about the ongoing tax rate at Allegion?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, we have added a little extra labor associated with the implementation. You would have that in any case associated with these transitions, so perhaps a lift in productivity. But in terms of affecting our overall operating results, nothing of significance to highlight there. As you know, those products have very good margins so it shouldn't be an issue going forward.","On the proposed legislation, actually a couple of comments there, you're aware that right now, they are \u2013 it is proposed so it's hoping a commentary period. We'll see how it shakes out. But basis of the current proposed legislation, it's all perspective-looking. And so, when we look at the effect on our business, I would say no immediate impact today for 2015 or our planning horizon over the next three to five years.","I would also comment on \u2013 relative to the proposed legislation that it has a lot of documentation requirements. We feel like we're fairly buttoned up in this area. You may recall in 2014, we had some incremental investment associated with some external advisors from both the tax and legal perspective. I think we're on a very solid foundation relative to some of those items that these regulations address.","Going forward, it does require maybe some more rigor and tax planning strategies, but we've got many tools in our toolbox that we'll continue to execute. The regulations, by the way, are specific to U.S. entities or foreign subsidiaries underneath U.S. entities, so it doesn't impact our every entity within our structure. And it doesn't preclude or eliminate debt transactions with a solid and sound business purpose.","So, I just remind you being an Irish-domicile company, I believe we have a very tax-efficient structure. We have a lot of optionality and we have the ability to continue even with these regulations to move cash around the globe tax efficiently. That gives us a competitive advantage.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Well, that was very helpful color. I appreciate it. I'll hop back in queue.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. And, Patrick, thanks for that. That was probably the best answer on the tax question that I've gotten out of all my companies so far, so it's really helpful. More broadly even (25:15).","Listen, on Indianapolis, this is a great plant. ERP implementations now, normal inventory build ahead of that. I see this happen \u2013 I used to see things like that happen very frequently. It's very infrequent in large ERP implementation that I see that across my coverage these days. What really happened such that you, guys, were caught off guard and had shipping problems beyond what is a normal planned-for ERP transition even in a complex manufacturing environment?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, first, we replaced a 29-year-old operating system in our legacy facility. So the change management is huge. We don't underestimate that, but it affects every transaction from order entry to shipment. Some of the challenges were driven by part location and completed product location that has a higher level of rigor than was operated under the old system.","Our configured product is also as complex as anything in the industry. So as we take systems and apply it \u2013 I don't care if it's SAP, Oracle. We chose Microsoft AX, these challenge these systems and that's what we faced.","I couldn't be prouder of how our people responded to make sure that we met the needs of our customers. And as I look at April, we are cutting into the backlog at a very fast pace. And I would say for the size of this conversion, I think it's \u2013 and the complexity of our business, we've done a credible job to upgrade.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. That is helpful. And what was your electronics growth and penetration? Usually, I think you talked about \u2013 I think it was 28% or something last quarter. Where were you this quarter?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, sequentially down low-double-digits if you kind of look across the entire portfolio.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, and year-on-year.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So increase year-over-year \u2013 sorry. The increase year-over-year was low-double-digits, okay.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","But sequential down from the reference you mentioned in the 20%s.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On the margin here, so for Americas, was there \u2013 how much negative impact from the conversion here? I mean, there is certainly on the revenue side, but could you quantify the margin impact?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, as we highlighted a mix impact, some of that being driven from the residential growth, continued strong growth in that business, and that would have a natural mix impact as we kind of experienced a little bit last year but a pretty sizable mix relative to \u2013 within the commercial products. And if you were to look at our volume leverage growth historically \u2013 last year, for example, we delivered 40% for every incremental dollar on revenue. That was way down significantly. I would have expected, again, all things being equal, that we would have been within that range in terms of leverage on incremental revenue. So, pretty big mix impact on our business.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And so, does that moderate in Q2 and then into Q3 so we should see better incrementals also in Q1 level?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. You would anticipate as we eat into the backlog, shipments accelerate, growth, because we're going to make up for some of the difference here in Q2, Q3, you would expect a favorable mix going forward.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then...","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's a timing issue. And as those shipments continue to catch up, then we'll have favorability there from a margin perspective, which we didn't see in Q1.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, Dave, any concern around the customer \u2013 from a customer standpoint with regards to this in terms of lingering impact, not just on getting the orders shipped and whatnot, but in terms of brand management, brand equity, that sort of thing? Any concern around that?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm always concerned. We did extend lead times. We're fighting those back in. The Von Duprin specification capability has huge staying power. I think you understand that when, either in the replacement market or the spec market, it has significant weight. You just can't go and replace it with something else. The engineer-configured is another aspect of that.","I would just \u2013 I got no phone calls, which I think is pretty telling. I'm as available to our customers as I am to you. We communicated of the change that we were going through and they understood the need for us to upgrade our 29-year-old system.","So, this business has a lot of credibility with industry-leading lead times. We're going to return to that and we'll provide features and benefits with the new systems that our customers didn't have in the past and I think net-net, it'll be a positive for us.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Last quick one on Europe core margin. What was the core margin in the quarter ex acquisitions?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, I don't have that information readily available, but the margin accretion, 380 basis points, was driven both from the base business improving as well as the acquisitions which are accretive to the overall European margins. If I were to take a guesstimate here, I'd say it's kind of a 50\/50 split in the quarter.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Just the first question, really, on pricing and how that relates to Europe. Your main peer had seen European pricing get better; I think you have seen that as well. So, maybe give some context around that. And also give any color as to whether you're seeing Southern Europe construction demand improving recently.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take the demand first. Our 3% growth, we feel good about it. I think it's reflective. We've got a Southern exposure and our organic growth reflects better market opportunities.","I'd also highlight better execution by our business, on-time delivery, stronger specification is helping us to gain share in a slightly improving environment. We were able to deliver modest price realization in the quarter, but there's a mix of us being more aggressive, exiting unprofitable business and then just a slight uptick in terms of our overall pricing.","Patrick, anything to add to that?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I think good progress on the pricing. Not only looking at it holistic by market, but within vertical markets and by customer segments so continuous improvement there and it's good as Dave mentioned. The organic growth, 3%, sequentially better than Q4 last year and it's a good sign particularly in Southern Europe.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Then my second question would just be on raw materials. I think since you spun out of Ingersoll Rand, you obviously had generally an environment where raw material prices have fallen. So, if you could give us some context as to \u2013 if the recent rise is sustained, how you think about that affecting your gross margins, if at all? And what the sort of best, in inverted commas, \"net price environment\" for you is when thinking about raw materials?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, as you mentioned, the input costs have come down particularly for us brass, zinc, and steel are large input costs. I think the year-over-year decrease in commodities basis of the current spot rates as you call it around 20% collectively, that was baked in to our full year guidance. We've recently seen a move upward in steel prices so it may put a little pressure there, but you should continue to see deflation in our input cost.","One of the great things about this business relative to your comment on pricing, not a significant impact on our pricing strategy, so believe we can continue to execute on that front. And you're not going to see the full benefit of the deflation in the commodity prices because, again, we lock in the supplier contracts and so over a 12-month period. And so, it kind of worked its way out during the course of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then just what you're thinking, I guess, further back in the business at times when input costs have been rising, again, when you were part of Ingersoll Rand, how was the ability to pass on input cost increases back then?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Very, very good. If you go back, call it after the 2008 recession, you saw a much higher price realization particularly given the rise in the input cost. And so, I think the ability to pass that on to the consumer historically has been good. It depends on particular movements, competition, et cetera, but right now, I'm not anticipating in a rising inflationary situation that we wouldn't be able to do the same going forward.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. Across the security sectors that we cover in integration \u2013 video access, intrusion \u2013 that we've seen some moderation over the course of the last several periods, several quarters. And yet in the locking area of the mechanical and electronic areas that are specific to you, we've actually seen you've not just maintained, but actually increased growth slightly and margins have improved.","Is this something that you are seeing in the marketplace yourselves or also is it your ability to add? If you could discuss this a little bit, new segment such as the multi-family segment to what had been perhaps almost zero in terms revenue, getting \u2013 finding new niches to grow because, again, in other areas where they haven't had those new niches, we've seen some moderation on the more electronic side.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Jeff, I may not be as intimate on some of the video stuff and keep an eye on it, but go back 90 days ago with our core guidance, we led \u2013 or certainly we're at the top end of the industry in terms of the growth that we saw. I think we're intimate with our key market's demands and clearly see what's happening in the market in terms of the segmentation and niches in our business. And I would say this globally, we see good upside opportunity.","I've talked about some of our channel moves. We continue to analyze our market positions and opportunities with \u2013 in our global positioning to go in and better execute and serve growing niches. That would be true for our traditional mechanical businesses, and we continue to see the electronic side of it growing at double to our mechanical markets. And we think things like the multi-family segment that gives customers a perimeter security right down to the apartment door will help us to deliver leading industry growth.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Thanks.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think China, this quarter, is a good example. Yes, we're small but a focused business. Target with our capabilities, shows growth in Europe, very pleased with our performance, and I have to make long-term improvements in the ERP systems for our employees and customers. But you look at what went into our backlog; we would've been right at the top of the group in terms of our growth. There's multiple factors working here.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. I know backlog is not the key KPI in this company, but what are you seeing in the backlog that gives you all the confidence that you seem to be talking about for the second half of the year? What mix is there that is definitely different other than \u2013 apart from the ERP system?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We clearly see quotations, incoming orders supporting the growth profile that we projected in our annual guidance. Stronger in some of the institutional segments, I think it supports our strength in specification. And then, you've talked to \u2013 or I've talked to you about the retrofit market, better service to locksmiths through our channel plays, those investments continue to exceed our expectations.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great. And by the way, thank you. You had a great presentation at the ISC West Conference.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. We'll keep working on it.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Following up on the disruption at Indianapolis, are you anticipating any major systems upgrade at other lost plants in the near future?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our next targeted upgrade would be in France and that would be late fourth quarter so that's \u2013 then as I think about our systems, you need to think about this as an ultramarathon. We clearly created a system \u2013 the Allegion system and our IT systems, our infrastructure was underinvested, but this is not a land race or a rush. We'll very methodically move to a common platform over the next 5 years to 10 years.","We think it's important. But we replaced a 29-year-old system. The next system that we'll replace will be a \u2013 it's called a Bull (41:57) system. Probably only old guys like me remember this, but it doesn't have near the scope. But what we installed in Indianapolis is the platform that will replace the Bull (42:11) system. So, logical steps that I think give our people the tools and our customers the capability to expect in a modern marketplace.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And (42:23) commented on that already on the year, but can you provide an update on your channel initiative and how you plan on rolling this out through the remainder of the year?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, think of our channel initiatives in terms of the retrofit and renovate and better service to partnerships with locksmiths is in year two of a five-year rollout. We continue to strategically evaluate opportunities to extend our specification capability in the commercial segments. So, there's multiple things working here, but remember in the retrofit\/replace market, the locksmith, $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion market that we roll out really over the next three years to five years and pleased with the continued progress.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. And last one for me. Asia, looks like you had a pretty strong organic growth here. Can you comment on where this came from? And also, I was a little surprised not to see a high level of profitability now that the Bocom PC (43:44) got out of the portfolio.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, thanks for noticing that. The growth really comes, number one, with focus. Bocom and the exit of that business was some heavy lifting, distracting in terms of capabilities we have.","Second, especially in China, we're attacking specific niches that we think our capability lines up with. Third is the acquisitions. Brio, Milre, FSH are improving our product capability and we think we have a value proposition that will help us to grow in the region.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. What about the profitability levels? What do you think is holding you back and preventing from having scale margins there?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, you saw a significant step-up in our operating income performance, the acquisitions clearly contributing to that. The region has done a really good job eliminating the stranded cost associated with the divestiture through some reduced head count and really cost containment, those type of things.","So first quarter I think in a long time has been at a breakeven. So, sequentially, it will continue to improve throughout the course of the year. We've always said for 2016 kind of mid-single-digit operating income performance for the full year, but putting a path to kind of get us to 10% over our planning horizon.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks very much. Good luck.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Just a couple more follow-ups on the ERP, I feel like we're kind of beating a dead horse here. But, David, you did say that this effort impacted, I think, 20% to 25% of your Americas sales. Does this close the work on Americas or we \u2013 so, you told us France is next, but is there a lot more work to do in Americas to get to where you want to be?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The long-term goal is a common operating system. You need to think about that five years. We will not do that conversion without a solid business case that delivers a return in productivity. You have to think about aged systems, those types of things. But we believe these systems can enhance our customer capability and our profitability and the business case, in terms of the next steps, got to be there for us to move forward.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And maybe you could address that because we are talking about this as if it's a painful medicine no one wants to take. But maybe you could give us some color on what it means for the speed of product fulfillment, inventory turns, those sorts of things, the reasons you're inherently making this investment.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, historically, we have led our industry in terms of inventory turns, cycle times and profit margin. We think modern tools, Windows-based tools on the floor will continue to give us differentiation on those factors.","I think second, it's important that we look at the end customer. Why would I want a common system? I can't ship today on one invoice from our various manufacturing facilities. And customers want this. It's something I think over the long-term planning horizon we've got to plan for.","Another dimension of the optics of lead time and the change management happened as we turned on the new system, I mean, clearly we've changed some things and are coming back quickly. But we closed the books financially at a faster pace than we had at any ops ever. I'd like to be able to spend less money on financial consolidation and more on analysis, analysis of our profitability, our customers. So, there's multi-dimensions in terms of these systems, but we'll hold them to a business case and we think we'll drive the things that are important to us: return on invested capital, high inventory turnover, and time.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Jeff, so think about it also back office efficiency moving from multiple systems to one common platform. It just provides all kinds of efficiency, better control environment, et cetera, from a finance perspective, order management, so those type of activities, better customer service. So there's a whole spectrum of business benefits not just in the manufacturing floor.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I want to add one other point in terms of benchmarking. As we look on our global IT cost, we're at the upper end of the range. And to get that to the benchmarks that we would like, we think we've got to upgrade these systems. And I'd share that just \u2013 this is how we think in terms of the overall performance of the business. We want superior capabilities, but we also want to make sure that the cost structure that deliver that is in line with other industrial companies.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Maybe one other one question with maybe a lot of elements to it, but just thinking about total investment spend, I would assume the ERP stuff is maybe being capitalized but if you could give us a sense of where investment spending looks to track for the rest of the year. And then I'm also just curious if you do get the related benefits out of ERP that you're hoping for, should we expect that those are actually dropping through to the bottom line? Or is this really a driver of additional investment spending so to speak, that you'd redeploy these savings into something else?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, on the incremental investment spending, so you're right, a big chunk of that would be captured in capital expenditures and as you capitalize things like license cost, design development, those type of things. So, the bulk of that has already been capitalized relative to our global platform.","So, on a go-forward basis, you would have things like any modifications for local, regional requirements or specific maybe to a manufacturing facility, and those would be capitalized. But there's also a core team that's been charged with implementing and executing on the implementation of these that is kind of captured in our corporate expenditure as an ongoing investment. That will continue kind of going forward as we roll out what Dave said on the French implementation and then we'll see kind of going forward.","But all that incremental spend has been captured in our full year guidance. And we'll play one year at a time and it depends upon the speed at which we implement and we'll determine how much more or little on that investment dollars.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. A couple things, just quickly on the ERP. The business that you missed there, the shipments that were affected by the ERP implementation, how would that bucket out between specced markets and distribution markets?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't have any factual data, but I would say 50\/50.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","50\/50? Okay. Thanks. And then, we haven't really talked about the residential business here. I can follow up with you later on some other ERP stuff, but could you talk about the residential business and what you're seeing? High-single-digit growth sounds pretty impressive. Is this kind of where the market is and you're kind of maintaining your share? Are you gaining share in this channel? If so, where and which products?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good market. Forecasting says that replace and renovation is going to increase in the year. Remember that we're extremely well positioned to that. Our suite of electronics \u2013 Schlage Touch, Schlage Pulse, Schlage Sense \u2013 I think are giving us good momentum.","We are increasing our work with the large builders. We think there's opportunity there, but we want to provide that on value. We want to provide that on builders that want to provide an above opening price point products. We think the market \u2013 the electronics and increased spend in the renovation markets are all \u2013 and then style and design, that was one thing I failed to mention. We have put more SKUs out there and they're all factors that are helping us grow.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So, would it be fair to say that within residential that margin performance is improving? I mean, above and beyond just the operating leverage with the volume. But through the style and design and the channel selection, are you \u2013 this is a more profitable business for you now.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say a slight improvement. We've got price pressures in the market, but we also \u2013 if you visited our Baja facilities, the teams there are doing an outstanding job of driving productivity on the factory floor, value engineering, but just straight execution and throughput. Extremely pleased with those teams.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. One last quick one, if I may. You've got a competitor that's publicly discussed the possibility that may sell to commercial security hardware business. Is that creating a customer migration now that's providing you with share gains?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd always like to think that customers would look at the lack of investment in that product set and our aggressive investment. We're providing better solutions. Uncertainty in the competitive world's always an opportunity for a manufacturer like ours.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks, David.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Rob.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just a few follow-ups at this point. On the investment spending, I think $2 million in Americas in the quarter. Is that the run rate we should expect there for the rest of the year?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll speak to it in aggregate. Americas being the bulk of the incremental investment spend. It's probably a little bit lighter in Q1. I would expect it to increase slightly throughout the course of the year, Q2 through 4, to be kind of straight line for those quarters. We gave some guidance I think around $0.15 to $0.16 incremental spend relative to our year-over-year investment spend.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And then on the pricing in Americas, it looks like you got a point this quarter. I think that's up from like 50 bps last year even with the mix perhaps working against you. I mean, do you think you can sustain that, maybe even do better than that as the year progresses in Americas?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, our hope would be to improve upon it. We like the progress that we saw in Q1, as you pointed out, better out of the gate than last year for the full year. Commercial has been performing well, residential kind of tracking to what we had anticipated. So, we'll see as the year progresses, but so far, a little bit better than what we had anticipated out of the gate but in line kind of with our full year expectations.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. And maybe just finally, you have this benefit in the quarter below the line from the sales of marketable securities and then equity investment gains. I think some of that, at least, was in the guide. Can you just refresh our memory how much of that was in the guide and of what's in there, how much might be remaining in the subsequent quarters?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think a good way to look at that question is if you look at the full year, 2015, we had other income of roughly $10 million to $11 million. Our full year guidance assumed a similar amount for 2016. We did have kind of a onetime benefit in this equity investment that came through, so that maybe a little upside there year-over-year. But that would suggest that the majority of our EPS growth, 7% to 12%, all operational performance improvement predominantly. But the full year guide assumed kind of a similar number for the full year that we experienced last year.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I'm sorry, the similar number on other income.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thank you.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","And next, we have a follow-up from Josh Pokrzywinski, I'm sorry, of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just to follow up on the price cost discussion from earlier. Maybe just to parse out the 120 bps you got in the quarter, I think, overall that you spelled out there in the Q, should we think about that as being a similar number into the second quarter and maybe a little narrower in the second half just based on comps? Or maybe just help to dimension out the seasonality there.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Was your question specific to pricing? I'm sorry.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","The price cost delta. I think you called out in the Q 120 basis points of margin benefit on price cost in the quarter. I would imagine you'll get a similar number in 2Q.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Actually, if things hold the way they are today, you'd see a little increase to that because the deflationary benefits would be a little bit stronger assuming commodity prices track where they're trading today. So, hopefully, we see a little bit improvement in Q2, Q3, then it kind of levels out.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And then just a follow-up on EMEIA since some of the businesses there are still new or new and that we haven't seen them for a full year yet. Maybe on the seasonality, how should we think about that normal 4Q bump relative to kind of a flattish pattern for the rest of the year that you used to have that probably looks a lot different with AXA and SimonsVoss?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, actually not too much different. Q4 will continue to be our strongest quarter for Europe, Q1 being the lightest quarter, Q2 pretty good, and Q3 because of the holiday period, a little lighter than Q2. But the seasonality is fairly consistent.","Even with the margin increase year-over-year lower than what you might expect, remember we have flat amortization expense associated with the intangibles during the course of the year. So that, as the business grows, that kind of levels out and you get improved margins going forward. So, you would expect improved kind of double-digit margins going forward for our European region.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Martineau for any closing remarks.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please call \u2013 contact me for any further questions. Have a safe day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau. Please go ahead.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kaye. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for the second quarter 2016 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded on our website.","Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our second quarter 2016 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with the company's second quarter results. We continue to deliver profitable growth that reflects continued execution of our growth pillars as well as the benefits of investments in the business.","Revenues of $584.9 million grew 12.6%, reflecting organic growth of 8.9% as well as the benefit of prior-year acquisitions. The Americas had organic growth of 9.8%, which was driven by strong revenue growth in our non-residential business. This included an anticipated shift in revenue from Q1 to Q2 associated with our ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility.","If you recall, we ended the first quarter with elevated levels of backlog associated with the implementation. I am pleased to say we made significant progress in the second quarter through improved throughput and reduced the associated backlog. We caught up on shipments, and I expect a normal flow of shipments for the second half of the year.","EMEA organic revenues grew at 3%, and our Asia Pacific business had a very strong organic revenue growth of 12.9%. If we exclude the previously divested system integration business revenues from prior-year amounts, the Asia Pacific business achieved organic growth of 23.6%.","Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% versus the prior year. Overall, operating margin improved by 200 basis points. This is the second straight quarter in which all Allegion regions delivered organic revenue growth and margin expansion, once again demonstrating our ability to efficiently leverage incremental volume.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.99 increased more than 39% versus the prior-year period, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisitions and a lower effective tax rate. This is our eighth straight quarter with double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth.","As a result, we are improving our full-year guidance of organic revenue growth to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue growth of 8% to 9%. In addition, we are tightening our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.30 to $3.40 per share.","Please go to slide 4. Shifting a bit from the financials, I'm equally pleased with our safety performance of our business. We believe that excellence in safety is a True North metric of enterprise excellence. And having a workforce committed to safety is crucial for continued operational success and delivering shareholder value.","As you can see from the chart, Allegion has consistently been a leader among our peers and other manufacturing companies for total recordable incident rates. We incorporate safety in our business system and measure ourselves against annual goals.","Year-to-date 2016, we continue to see an improvement of 13% by forecasting on risk and a reduction of injuries at home and at work. Be safe and be healthy is one of Allegion's core values, and providing and maintaining safe work environment is my number one priority.","Patrick will now walk you through the financials and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2016 guidance.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number 5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the Allegion results and then cover the regions in their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 8.9% organic growth in the second quarter with contributions from all regions. Each region contributed to price realization as well as volume growth. Foreign currency was a modest headwind in the quarter, while acquisitions contributed approximately $40 million of incremental revenue or 7.7% growth, which more than offset the impact of divestitures.","Please go to slide number 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $584.9 million, which is a 12.6% increase versus the prior-year period. I was pleased with the revenue growth driven by volume increases, the benefit of acquisitions and organic contributions from each region.","As Dave mentioned earlier, our revenue growth reflects increased shipments following our Q1 ERP implementation at our Indianapolis facility. We continue to experience solid electronic product growth, which was up in the mid-teens, and we are realizing the benefits of our new product introductions and channel initiatives.","Adjusted operating income of $125.7 million increased 24.2% compared to the prior year. The benefit of strong leverage on incremental volumes helped deliver 200 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year. All regions delivered improved operating margins and this reflects the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year margin growth.","Of note, volume increases in our North America non-residential business contributed to favorable mix in the quarter. I will discuss this in more detail when reviewing the Americas slide. I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 24.2%, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter.","Please go to slide number 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2015, reported EPS was $0.66. Adjusting $0.05 for prior-year restructuring and acquisition-related expenditures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.71. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18, as leverage on incremental volumes, favorable business mix, productivity and price more than offset inflationary impacts.","The unfavorable net productivity in equation reflects the quarterly timing of certain expenditures. And although foreign exchange was the revenue headwind in the quarter, this was offset by our foreign-denominated costs, resulting a slight favorability to EPS when compared to the prior year.","The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share reduction versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower rate jurisdictions and the continued execution of the company's tax planning strategies. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $0.03 in the quarter.","Next, interest and other income were a net $0.03 increase to EPS. The higher interest expense is related to the issuance of senior notes in the prior year. Favorable other net items primarily reflects the sale of non-strategic marketable securities. This represents the full liquidation of the securities.","Lastly, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new production development and channel management, as well as corporate initiatives were a $0.01 reduction. This reflects an adjusted second quarter 2016 EPS of $0.99 per share, an increase of approximately $0.28 or 39.4% versus the prior-year period.","Continuing on, we have a negative $0.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring costs. After giving effect to these one-time items, we arrive at the second quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.98 per share.","Please go to slide number 8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.5 million, up 8.6% for an increase of 9.8% on an organic basis. Growth in our electronics products increased 15% versus the prior year, as we continue to see better-than-market growth from this product category in both residential and non-residential markets.","The non-residential segment delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Pricing remains solid, and end markets are performing as expected, with growth in both commercial and institutional areas. Additionally, the second quarter results were inclusive of higher-than-normal shipments at our Indianapolis facility, which underwent an ERP implementation in Q1 and had experienced delays in shipments. On a year-to-date basis, the non-residential segment grew high-single digits.","The residential business grew at low-single digits after excluding the divested Venezuela business from prior-year results. Volume growth in new construction builder channels and e-commerce was partially offset by pricing weakness. On a year-to-date basis, the residential segment has grown mid-single digits, consistent with the original market expectations shared during our February call.","Americas adjusted operating income of $130 million was up 16.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points. The margin improvement was driven by strong volume leverage and favorable mix, attributable to the strength of non-residential growth.","Overall inflation was largely offset by pricing and productivity in the quarter. The higher inflation reflects some quarterly timing differences. When looking at the year-to-date performance, pricing and productivity more than offset inflation. We would expect this to be the case for the balance of the year, although we are expecting to see some additional commodity inflation pressure in the second half.","And as noted in the presentation, investments have been a modest headwind year-to-date. We expect additional investment headwinds to be back-end loaded for the Americas segment.","Please go to slide number 9. Second quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $121.6 million, up 44.9% or up 3% on an organic basis. The organic growth reflected solid price realization and good performance across most geographies. Acquisitions delivered approximately $35 million in incremental revenue.","We have not seen any meaningful impact from the UK EU referendum vote or Brexit. It's too early to quantify any potential impacts for business or industry, but I would note that the UK sales are historically less than 10% of our EMEA portfolio.","EMEA adjusted operating income of $9.3 million increased 116.3% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 250 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 440 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation as well as contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter with year-over-year margin improvement.","Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $26.8 million, down 20% versus the prior-year period. As noted on the slide, the decrease was specific to the divestiture of the system integration business, which drove a $15.2 million reduction in revenues year-over-year.","Excluding the system integration business and prior-year numbers, total revenue grew 46.2% and organic revenues grew approximately 23.6%. Most sub-regions performed well, with notable strength in China hardware and Australia and New Zealand. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income was $2.3 million, which reflects an improvement of $3.7 million versus the prior-year period.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 1,280 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margins improved 830 basis points, excluding the previously divested system integration business and acquisitions. The increase in margin reflects strong volume leverage, cost improvements and year-over-year benefit of divesting the system integration business as well as the acquisitions.","Please go to slide number 11. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2016 was $84.7 million, a $69.9 million increase versus the prior year. The improvement in available cash flow is primarily attributable to increased earnings, decreased operating cash requirements and lower capital expenditures.","As evident in the increased ratios on this slide, we now reflect the impact of recent acquisitions and divestitures in the current numbers. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. And lastly, we continue to guide full-year available cash flow of $280 million to $300 million, an increase of 26% to 35% compared to the prior year.","Please go to slide number 12. You will remember our capital allocation strategy that defines a balanced and flexible approach. The company improved its debt to EBITDA ratio to 3 times at the end of the second quarter, in the middle of our targeted long-term range of 2.75 times to 3.25 times. This represents a 0.5 turn improvement over the ratio at 12\/31\/15 of 3.5 times. The decrease in the leverage ratio is a component of increased EBITDA and normal debt amortization, and demonstrates the ability of our company to de-leverage quickly from profitable growth, low capital requirements and strong cash generation.","Additionally, I wanted to highlight that Standard & Poor's upgraded Allegion to investment grade during the second quarter of 2016. We continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. Supported by our 2016 performance, we continue to believe these investments will enable the company to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market with high returns on invested capital.","We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Trelock GmbH. Trelock, a portable safety and security provider producing bicycle locks, lights and electronic control units, strengthens our global portfolio, security and safety offerings.","We will continue to evaluate acquisitions that are core to our business and can expand our global footprint and product portfolio and provide a favorable return on invested capital. And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases.","In summary, due to consistent high cash flow generation, we have many options to deploy capital to drive value for our shareholders.","I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2016 guidance.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. We are improving our 2016 guidance for revenue and EPS, as noted on the slide. We are increasing revenue growth for all regions, given first half performance and our expectations for the remainder of the year. This results in total organic revenue improving a full point versus prior guidance to a range of 5% to 6% and total revenue improving to a range of 8% to 9%.","If we look closer at the Americas business, residential market indicators still suggest continued growth. New construction starts are approaching 1.2 million, with resilient strength in the multi-family segment. The residential aftermarket is also performing well, given increased home pricing and low mortgage rates. Non-residential markets continue to perform well and we continue to expect slow and steady improvement in our core non-residential segment.","Within major institutional verticals, we still expect modest growth in education and are seeing slight improvement in healthcare aftermarket with an increase in renovation and additions. In the commercial segment, office construction remained strong, driven by employment growth and reduced vacancy rates.","The European markets have stabilized and we continue to see modest growth in our core geographies, which is reflected in the increase of our organic guidance. We are still recognizing the benefits of prior-year acquisitions and are leveraging a broader portfolio to accelerate growth.","In the Asia-Pacific segment, we continue to make progress with a focus on mechanical and electrical hardware solutions in growth verticals; for example, multi-family in Australia and New Zealand and transportation in China.","We are also tightening and raising the low end of EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in achieving the improved top-line outlook. However, we are anticipating some pressure on second half earnings due to the inflationary headwinds, second half weighted investments and a tax rate at the high end of prior guidance. I would also note that our guidance now reflects the inclusion of the Trelock acquisition for the second half of the year.","Please go to slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our second quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue grew over 12%, organic revenue grew almost 9%, operating margin increased 200 basis points. EBITDA margins grew 260 basis points. EPS grew over 39%. These are strong numbers. We have increased our revenue growth expectations for the year and have tightened the range for our full-year EPS outlook.","Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to an organizational change at Allegion. Tom Martineau will be assuming the role of Vice President of Finance for the EMEA region. As you know, Tom has been in the Investor Relations role since the creation of Allegion. During this time, Tom has established the company's investor relations program and has served as a valuable voice of the shareholder community along with the leadership team. This is a great opportunity for Tom and I'm sure you all want to congratulate him on this exciting move.","As we move forward, Mike Wagnes, Allegion's Vice President and Treasurer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Investor Relations. Mike has been with Allegion and Ingersoll Rand for 10 years and brings a wealth of financial experience that will position him well as the company's primary representative to the investment community.","Congratulations to you both. The transition will occur over the month of August with formal transition by the end of August. Please continue to contact Tom during this time for any investor-related questions.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations to both Tom and Mike.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well deserved. Thank you.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","My first question maybe, Dave, just touching on your comments on the inflationary headwinds heading into the second half of the year. It looks like you've got a little bit of a lower pricing benefit this quarter than you did in 1Q. And you have your competitor in Europe that has been talking about putting through pricing increases because of these inflationary pressures, even starting as early as next quarter. And so, maybe just talk about your ability to pass on additional pricing increases as we head into the second half of the year?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we see inflation on the rise. We think the market remains disciplined and we'll pass the higher costs through. Extremely pleased with the global supply chain's procurement organization that we created here at Allegion. It's driving some productivity in the first half and I think that's how you need to think about the inflation, price productivity take-off as you think about our 2016 results.","Patrick has got some comments.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Joe. So, a couple of quick things. As you saw in the results, Q2 sequentially down a little bit and pricing up, still a pretty good traction in non-resi. The pressure there was more on the residential side. Nothing really out of the normal course of business, but some added costs associated with rebates, advertising, merchandising, credits, those type of things.","We would anticipate the back half to improve relative to Q2. So, as Dave mentioned, still anticipate to kind of pass on to the extent we can pricing relative to the increase and inflation. But there is always a lag attached to that. And as it relates to inflation, as you know, I mean the commodity input costs are rising, particularly steel which is up, the last numbers I saw, like 60% relative to the beginning of the year in terms of spot rates. So, that's going to put a little pressure on our numbers in the back half of the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's fair. And maybe one quick follow-up, Patrick. Just on the EMEA margins, still you are continuing to progress there. I think you guys had a double-digit expectation for the year. So I'm just curious whether that's changed at all and just maybe provide a little bit of color around that.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So we're still marching forward to the double-digit expectations in terms of margin performance. I'd say there's a little bit more pressure there in terms of what we originally anticipated, given some of the inflationary headwinds we talked about. We've stepped up some of our investments in the business as well to better position us for growth going forward, particularly as we look at our long-range planning cycle in 2017 and beyond. So, that's going to have a little pressure as well.","But if you look at the business in the quarter, good performance; EBIT margins up 250 basis points; EBITDA, 440 basis points. So we like the progress there. We're executing to our margin improvement plan. But maybe a little bit of delay, but collectively a good story. Particularly when you look at where we started the journey, you may recall 2013 was like a 1% EBIT margin.","So, significant progress, continue to move forward, probably not as quick as we would like, but yet we're not capitulating on our 10% objective.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, I would add to that, fully committed for double-digit profitability in Europe. I think the execution by the team there and the amount of restructuring that has gone on since we created Allegion is noteworthy. And overall, we're confident that we can deliver that.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And congratulations to Tom and Mike.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on your EPS guidance for the second half. As I look, we have positive top-line growth in the second half. But, basically, your EPS guidance implies no EPS growth or EPS decline in the second half. And I'm just wondering if that's how the math has worked out and we're being conservative or we really do think that there is $30 million, $40 million of incremental cost that's you're going to true-up in the operating improvements in the second of the year.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So I think you've got to look at it and break down the P&L in a couple of segments. We do, as we say, anticipate continued growth both organically as well as including the acquisitions. The continued growth in EBIT\/EBITDA margin performance, and that's across all regions in the back half of the year, a little bit increased as it relates to corporate expenditures.","But then when you go below the line, it's when the year-over-year comparabilities get very difficult. So you've got \u2013 you may recall, last year, other income was up on the sale of marketable securities. We had a lower tax rate last year because of some favorabilities from one-time items there that are non-recurring this year.","And so it's the below-the-line items that are putting the comparisons difficult in the back half of the year. But continued growth, as you would anticipate, in each of the regions for the balance of the year.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But let me just rephrase the question. Operating leverage in the quarter was in the high-30%s. Do you see a material step down in operating leverage in the second half of the year because of the investments? Because you're describing investments and cost pressures as marginal, but should we see a material decline to the point where we're not going to see any operating leverage in the second half?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So there's going to be operating leverage, not to the extent you saw in Q2, and for the reasons that you mentioned, higher back-end loaded investments. When we initially gave our guidance back at the beginning of the year, we're anticipating $0.10 to $0.15 of investment headwinds. We're a little bit north of that guidance now. Inflationary headwinds is also affecting the numbers a little bit. So, collectively, those items \u2013 or sequentially, you won't see the margin leverage that you saw in Q2.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would also add, Andrew. We do have a system here at Allegion that helps us to anticipate the future with confidence. I also want the optionality in investments in our business to invest for the long term, and I think this is important as how we guide the company.","I think we've been good stewards of that investment, and I don't want to put myself in a position where we can't make the investments in demand creation activities, the pursuit of electronics which we think are good for shareholders over the long haul.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a follow-up question. On discretionary retrofit market in the U.S., I know you are working to increase your market share there. Any update on the progress as to what you've seen in the quarter and what impact that has had on organic growth in North America in Q2? Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We continue to be pleased with our execution in the renovation and retrofit segments of the market. We continue to learn and invest, and it had an impact on the quarter. With that, as we learn and expand there, we're creating new segments to go after within the channel. So it's an example where we're seeing good growth, but we're also investing in more people capacity to segment the markets and drive growth in the business.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning, and thanks, Tom, for all the help. So my first question would be around the residential business in the Americas. As you said, organic sales growth slowed down a little bit year-on-year in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Was that all pricing or did you see something change in volume as well? And then maybe just give some context around the competitive environment in residential Americas, please.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would say look at our growth on a full-year basis. We're mid-single digits there, about what we anticipated. I think if you look at the broader community of competitors, there is a price pressure on the opening price point. As I look at our business in the first half, we grew and improved profitability, and don't really want to get sucked into the opening price points of the market. And there is growth there. We just have chosen to play at a higher level.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very clear. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up just on the Asia business. And obviously, a lot of change in the portfolio there, an acquisition and a big divestment in the past 12 months. How should we be thinking about the pace of improvement in this business in margins over the next couple of years, let's say?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So we had targeted this year kind of mid-single digits. You saw really good performance in the second quarter, a little bit north of that expectation. The business is somewhat seasonal, so you kind of see, particularly in Q4, stronger margins expectations than Q2.","Going forward, as the business grows, it will continue to show some leverage. And we're targeting in the near-term horizon have a 10% margin opportunity is where we'd like to see the business go with kind of high-single digits to low-double-digit growth in that business.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would add some to that. I think, if you look at our journey in Asia-Pacific, there's been a tremendous transformation in that business. They're focused. They've got the core capabilities of our European product portfolio, our North American product portfolio and are, I think, attacking segments that are helping us drive growth. There's been some smart capital allocation in acquisitions. And I think we've got a bright future as a small player in Asia-Pacific that will benefit us over the long haul.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. And again, congratulations to Tom and to Mike. Tom, it's been great working with you. Hopefully we can keep talking from time-to-time.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","When you take a look at the other segments of the security industry that have been reporting and that have been reporting in mass in terms of what the industry segments are doing, when you look at things like video, when you look at things like overall security integration, those areas have been growing at a little bit of a slower rate than what we're seeing in your area, which is counter to what lots of people have been thinking about, video being the fast grower. Yes, units have been growing, but obviously there's been more price degradation than we've seen on your side because of manufacturing in the Far East.","What I'm getting to is what is the reason \u2013 what do you see as a value proposition for driving the growth rate that you guys have in your part of the business at or above other parts of the industry level?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it goes back to the mote that we describe around this business and that's the mechanical complexity that we deliver at Allegion in a market that's consolidating. I can look at some direct competitors that are not growing at the pace that we are. Allegion has made investments in our core mechanical as well as electronic. And I think it helps differentiate us versus some of the electronics that have lower barriers to entry.","You mentioned that the video market has slowed. Clearly, that market is reaching maturity in some cases. But it's really the number of competitors that are out there. We like our position and we think the growth that we're driving because of the complexity in the investments will reward us.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Just as a quick follow-up, can you give some indication of what percentage of your new sales are now coming from what we'll call electro-mechanical or electronic versus just pure mechanical?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So we've grown the overall portfolio in electronic products, as we indicated, up mid-teens for the quarter. That's commensurate kind of with a little bit higher than what we saw in Q1. It continues to be a larger part of our portfolio. It's at kind of the low-teens to mid-teens area as a total percentage of our portfolio.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think too the acquisitions also complement. SimonsVoss, a great add, Milre (38:55), our own presence with Schlage, helps us to understand the important of dimensions for customers and technical evolution around firmware, software, miniaturization and battery life that are going to be important in this industry. You integrate that into our mechanical platform, I think it puts us in a nice position.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. And good luck, Tom. Thanks for all the help too and look forward to working with you, Mike. Just on the European margin, so is the 10% core still intact for this year, Dave?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think certainly within \u2013 it's achievable. It has some pressure, and it's really on the timing and shifting of tooling to lower cost manufacturing areas. So, it's a risk point, but our modeling would say achievable.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is that a...","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I want you to have \u2013 there's several hundred tools that we're moving, and this is not necessarily a casual activity I would say. So there is some headwinds in the timing, but we believe 10% is achievable.","Patrick, can you get...","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Rich, I would just say it's not a question of do we get there. It's more of a timing issue. And as Dave indicated, with some of these moves from a production facility perspective, we'll probably delay the realization of that this year, be pushed into 2017. But the objective remains intact in terms of the end game. And again, collectively, looking at the region as a whole, still pretty good performance.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, would the guide incorporate something less than 10% in the spread \u2013 in terms of the EPS spread?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Not looking at the region in total, okay? But if you look at the components within the European region, base business versus acquisitions that are accretive to the margins, yes.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And then, just longer-term on Europe, so does this mean that getting to where Assa is right now, and I know you haven't given formal guidance longer-term on European margins, but does this push out your original thoughts around that on getting to that level or is this just kind of we catch up, there's a time to catch up, and we still think over the longer-term basis we can get to at high-teens type, mid-high-teens margin rate in Europe at some point?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you need to target mid-teens. Assa, kaba+dorma (42:04) is who we benchmark to. I think it's also dependent on future acquisitions, but we've made ground up quickly and I think that mid-teens aspirations is achievable.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And last quick one for me on electronic growth. So, mid-teens, there was a step-up from last quarter low-double digits. Is this the right framework in terms of growth rate going forward or is mid-teens really comfortable with that?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Comfortable.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good morning and thanks, Tom, for all your help and the best to you.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jeremie.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Question on the outlook for the second half and in the Americas in particular. It seems like your guidance embeds a slowdown in the revenue growth rate. In organic growth, you've been running well above 5% for what two years now, with the exception of the first quarter and the production disruptions. But it seems to me that your guidance embeds something below 5%. Is that correct? And what's driving this pricing slowing down, or any \u2013 because your commentary on the market sounded pretty optimistic. Thanks.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So I think you've got to look at first half, second half. Q2 was abnormally high, given some of the catch-up relative to the ERP implementation, which we now have behind us. But you kind of look at the first half, mid-single digits. Second half, slightly lower than that. So your comment is correct.","Predominantly because, last year, we had difficult \u2013 or we had really strong quarters, particularly in the residential business where we had some load-ins on new products. You may recall the launch of the Schlage Sense product, which was a big driver in Q4 in particular last year. So, that's kind of what we're looking at. Difficult comparisons.","But the core business will continue to grow. Again, we're making really good traction on our initiatives in terms of some of the new product launches. The channel initiatives Dave talked about, the retrofit opportunity, we're getting good traction there. So it's more about more difficult comparisons in the back half of the year.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Understood. And going back to the topic of commodities and middle prices going up, can you maybe help us quantify the potential impact and maybe help us understand a breakdown of your bill of materials?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So I won't get into the specifics in terms of bill of materials. But we had commented previously, raw commodity cost of roughly 10% of our material purchases, steel being probably 50% of that. So, that's the biggest commodity input. That's the biggest mover that we've seen recently.","If you try to quantify it, it's probably putting on additional pressure $0.02 to $0.03 in the back half of the year. We managed that through supply lock contracts, but everything is not hedged. And so, the unhedged portion kind of flows through the business as we purchase those components.","Additionally, obviously you've got from our supply base, they're buying the same inputs and so you've got pressure in terms of potential cost increases from our suppliers that also come into the equation. But we'll continue to manage it and offset it. As we said earlier, we have the mechanism to try to do that through pricing.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. And maybe just last one for me. I noticed the increase in working capital as a percentage of revenue. Should we consider this as transitory?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So we continue to focus on working capital. A couple of things worth noting here. The acquisitions, so the businesses we've acquired, predominantly being European based, have higher working capital needs and that's distorting the year-over-year comparatives. If you kind of back that out, we're at about 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue, about 50 days cash conversion cycle. So there is some of impact of the acquisitions which, hey, look, we'll continue to drive that and look for ways to become more efficient.","Secondly, as it relates to some of these facility moves and the ERP implementation, you carry higher inventory and safety stock. So, as we make those transitions, effectively we'll burn more inventory. And so the numbers should come down. But longer-term basis, I would anticipate us to be able to operate effectively, efficiently at about a 5% working capital as a percentage of revenue.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I would reinforce about our ability to be as efficient. I would add that Patrick's comments is the peak of the construction season. This business leverage is incredibly, don't want a lack of material or finished inventory to inhibit our ability to drive revenue. And there's clearly a shift in philosophy about that with Allegion. Have our product available at our wholesalers, in our warehouses, and continue to drive our industry-leading lead times, and it helps us to grow.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","And I would like to comment \u2013 Thanks, Jeremie. And this is Tom. I would just ask, let's try to keep the question maybe to one question the rest of the way. We're going to run pretty tight today.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Oh, hi, everybody. This is Peter on for Steve. Could you maybe talk through, put a bit of a finer point on \u2013 within the Americas for Q2, how much of the growth was actually from ERP catch-up and therefore sort of one-time in nature? And any dynamics we should be expecting from there?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. You may recall, Americas I think was essentially flat in Q1 and we anticipated kind of mid-single digits last quarter. Q2, we caught up predominantly on the shortfalls related to the ERP implementation and in the ops. So, great progress there. That's why you saw the really high organic growth.","I'm not going to give you a specific number, but just to say, we've gotten all of that kind of behind us. You may recall, we had anticipated it would be a 50%\/50% split Q2\/Q3. So we're now at a normal run rate I think going forward. But it did impact kind of the organic growth, let's say, maybe 3 to 4 points.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. And I would say the first quarter was kind of low-single digits was the growth rate.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Overall, I'd guide you to look at our first half year-over-year. And what I'm pleased with that we're seeing growth in all of our business lines, closers, locks, exit devices, and I think it shows the strength of the market.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And actually, if I could just sneak in a follow up. I had thought that in Q1 that absent the ERP impact that electronics growth was in the high-teens, and so excluding the ERP, and it was higher before that in 2015. Is that a slowing or is it just sort of steady as she goes and the dynamics are actually pretty consistent?","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you need to think about this as mid-teens. Remember, we've had a lot of new product introduction over the last several quarters. Globally, this is forecasted to grow at high-single digits. So I think our mid-teens reflects our execution and how you ought to think about that.","Peter Richard Lennox-King - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey, Tom, it's been great working with you, and congrats on the role.","Tom Martineau - Director-Investor Relations","Yeah. Thanks, Tim.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","My question is really just on M&A. And I guess I'm curious how are you feeling about the cadence of M&A this year, and how do we think going forward what your ideal cadence is? And I'm just asking because last year you did maybe five acquisitions and year-to-date you're closer to one. So I'm just curious how the pipeline looks and how you guys could kind of think about the ideal cadence of M&A going forward.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously, we'd like more. It's a function of availability, timing. We continue to work on the pipeline, the relationship building. And it's the nature of the beast. Sometimes these come in dumps and lumps. But the overall market, the relationship we're building, we feel good about.","What's the level of revenue we'd like to add? I'd like to think $50 million to $200 million on an annualized basis would be a nice cadence. But I want to remind you we're going to be disciplined in the capital deployment and bolt on what's right for Allegion. So, that's how I'd describe it.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Tim, I would just add. Continue to be selective, make sure it's aligned with our core business and strategies, things that we can leverage well to get a good return on capital. And hey, we're just as busy as we were last year. We're looking at a lot of potential properties at various stages, and it just depends. We're not going to overpay for anything. We're going to stick to our knitting and buy some good businesses.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful color. I appreciate it. Nice work, guys.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congrats to Tom. Maybe, condolences to Mike. It sounds like he's getting two jobs for the price of one, but look forward to working with you.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No good deed goes unpunished for both of these guys.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Exactly. I'll keep it to one question. I know we're up against the wall here. Just on the balance sheet, I don't think you were ever actively seeking an upgrade to investment grade. I just wonder if that now, though, colors your thinking on the balance sheet at all. Or in your discussions in achieving that upgrade, are the rating agencies comfortable with you at least flexing up to that 3.25 times? Maybe they're even comfortable with you flexing higher than that with visibility to bring it down.","Just give us some perspective on your thoughts around that and if there is any change in thinking at all about the balance sheet?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No changes at least in the near term. We've been very transparent with our financial policies with the rating agencies from day one, and nothing has changed from that, as you're aware, relative to our capital allocation strategy. So the upgrade came on basis of the strength in our franchise and prospects going forward, strong cash generation, good growth prospects, EBITDA consistency, margin profile. All those type of things I think factored in the upgrade. And I think it's a benefit for us kind of going forward and looking at financings, and hopefully, we can take advantage of.","But no changes relative to our long-term debt to EBITDA, which we kind of had targeted 2.75 times and 3.25 times. And, hey, if we find a good opportunity, transaction in the horizon, it doesn't mean we can't go north of that. And we've communicated that with the rating agencies as well. They understand that. The beautiful thing about our business is we do de-lever very quickly, given the strong margin profile and the cash generation. So they're all aware of that and it came on the heels of that information.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","And the final question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks for fitting me in and congrats to Mike and Tom. A quick housekeeping item. I think you mentioned the target for investment spending is higher now. Did you or could you say what it is? And then my question was really on pricing. This fall off in Americas, especially given, I think, like the growth mix was in your favor, right, with non-res much stronger than resi. So, just curious where the pressure is coming from and to be clear on what you think is going to improve the pricing as we go forward. Thanks.","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, on the investment spending, we had incurred \u2013 there was about a $0.04 headwind in the first half of the year. We're looking at $0.12 in the back half of the year pretty much evenly split, Q3, Q4. So we're stepping up the investment spend. Some of that was planned for, but was delayed in the first half of the year. So, that's kind of how that's going to play out.","And relative to the pricing, we would, as I mentioned earlier, this quarter experience some unfavorable pricing in the resi segment. Would expect that to abate a little bit in the back half of the year and that's where you get the improvement in pricing.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And what's driving the abatement?","Patrick S. Shannon - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Less rebates and advertising, merchandising credits, those type of things. Discounts, I would say.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. All right. Thank you.","David D.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.","Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results, delivering above-market organic growth and substantial margin expansion. We delivered organic growth and adjusted margin expansion across all regions.","For the first quarter, revenue was $548.8 million, an increase of 9.3%, reflecting organic growth of 8% as well as the benefit of acquisitions, partially offset by foreign currency. Our strong organic growth was led by the Americas, which grew 10.3% in the quarter, as both nonresidential and residential businesses expanded nicely, supported by favorable end markets and continued returns on our strategic investment. The nonresidential business growth was also aided by delayed shipments in the prior year related to an ERP implementation.","EMEIA organic revenues grew at 1.3%, and our Asia Pacific business saw organic revenue growth of 4.8%. Adjusted operating income of $100.7 million increased 19% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins increased by 150 basis points, as we continue to demonstrate margin expansion from incremental volume in excess of investment headwinds.","As stated earlier, all regions showed improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 increased $0.12 or 19.7% versus the prior year. Overall, I'm very pleased with the strong revenue growth and operational performance in the first quarter. In addition, we are raising our full year EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is now $3.60 to $3.75, and reported EPS guidance is $3.57 to $3.72.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2017 guidance.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning.","If you would, please go to Slide 5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 8% organic growth in the first quarter. The strong organic growth reflects healthy markets in the Americas, continued strength in driving electronics growth and the company's focus on channel initiatives.","The favorable comparable, driven by last year's ERP implementation, was also a factor in the strong growth. Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 2% growth, and foreign currency was a headwind, particularly in the EMEIA region.","Please go to Slide 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $548.8 million. This reflects an increase of 9.3% versus the prior year, up 8% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic revenue growth from Americas, which adds strong growth in both the nonresidential and residential businesses, as we continue to deliver above-market growth. We also had good price realization in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwind seen in EMEIA.","Adjusted operating income of $100.7 million and adjusted operating margin of 18.3% increased 19% and 150 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. All regions delivered improved adjusted operating margins. The operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage, price, productivity and product mix, which more than offset the impacts of inflation and incremental investments.","I'd also note that we improved our industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.1% in the quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points versus the prior year. All regions improved on this metric in the quarter. The business continues to execute at a high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.","Please go to Slide 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2016, reported EPS was $0.60. Adjusting $0.01 for the prior year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.61. Operational results increased EPS by $0.17, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts.","A decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.05 per share increase versus the prior year. The decrease in rate is primarily due to favorable impacts from discrete tax items, including the benefits from the recently adopted accounting standard on share-based compensation. These discrete benefits more than offset unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in higher rate jurisdictions.","Next, a reduction in the number of outstanding shares drove a $0.01 per share increase. Moving on, incremental investments were a $0.04 per share reduction. These investments relate to new product development and channel initiatives, which allow us to grow faster than the market, expand our electromechanical presence and increase our vitality index.","Next, interest and other income were a net $0.07 per share reduction. This was primarily attributable to the positive impact from the sale of nonstrategic marketable securities during the first quarter 2016 that did not repeat in Q1 2017. This results in adjusted first quarter 2017 EPS of $0.73 per share, an increase of $0.12 or approximately 20% compared to the prior year, with the growth driven by operational improvements and organic growth.","Continuing on, we have a negative $0.02 per share reduction from acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these onetime items, we arrived at the first quarter 2017 reported EPS of $0.71.","Please go to Slide 8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $407.6 million, up 12.3% on a reported basis and 10.3% organically. Strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new product and channel initiatives, as evidenced by mid-teens growth in electromechanical products.","As noted on the chart, we experienced double-digit growth in nonresidential products, driven by strength across the portfolio, as we continue to see solid performance from our organic investments. Delays in shipments in the prior year related to an ERP implementation also contributed to the increase. Residential revenue also grew mid-single digits, with continued strength in electronics.","Americas' adjusted operating income of $107.8 million increased 17.7% versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points. The increase of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin was driven by incremental volume leverage, price and productivity, offsetting the impact from rising inflation and incremental investments. The operational increase, while absorbing incremental investment spend, demonstrate excellent performance by the entire Americas team.","Please go to Slide 9. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $118.4 million, down 0.1% and up 1.3% on an organic basis. The reported revenue decline was driven by currency headwinds, which offset the contributions from price realization and acquisitions. The SimonsVoss business continues to perform well and saw strong growth, especially in the dock region.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $8.5 million increased 2.4% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points, while price and productivity more than offset the impacts from inflation, investment and currency headwinds.","We continue to see margin expansion despite the inefficiencies we experienced associated with the previously announced restructuring plan to optimize our manufacturing footprint in the region. The complexity of the move is challenging. As a result, the benefits we expected to realize are delayed.","Please go to Slide 10. First quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $22.8 million, up 9.6% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.8%, driven primarily by solid growth in the Australia and New Zealand region, as we are seeing good traction on our channel expansion initiatives. Total revenue was also supported by favorable foreign currency impacts and contributions from acquisitions.","Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $0.6 million, with adjusted operating margins up 260 basis points versus the prior-year period. Strong volume leverage and improved operational performance led to the adjusted operating margin expansion.","Please go to Slide 11. Available cash flow for the first quarter was negative $48.7 million, which is a decrease of $40.5 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease is driven by the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the quarter, partially offset by higher net earnings.","Working capital, as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle, increased in the first quarter 2017 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements and the inventory build related to the EMEIA manufacturing move. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital.","Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow guidance of $300 million to $320 million, which is net of the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment.","I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2017 guidance.","David Petratis","Thank you, Patrick.","Please go to Slide 12. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our 2017 guidance for revenue and increasing our earnings per share guidance. We are holding the revenue guidance growth at 5.5% to 6.5%, both on a reported and organic basis.","Our view of end markets remains favorable. We continue to see positive indicators in institutional and commercial verticals. In addition, we expect solid residential markets as the momentum in single-family construction continue. We believe that our organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will continue to deliver better than market growth.","We are raising our adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.60 to $3.75, an increase of $0.05 on both the low end and the high end. This represents adjusted EPS growth of 7.8% to 12.3%. The $0.05 increase is related to nonoperational items. The guidance includes a reduction of reported EPS related to restructuring and acquisition expenses in the amount of $0.03. This brings our updated guidance for reported EPS to a range of $3.57 to $3.72.","Included in the revised guidance is an assumption for the full year tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19.5%. The guidance continues to assume outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million.","Please go to Slide 13. Let me finish by reiterating that I'm very pleased with our first quarter execution and results. As a summary, total revenue growth of over 9%, organic revenue grew at 8%, adjusted operating margins increased 150 basis points, adjusted EPS by nearly 20% growth in the quarter. These are strong results and position us well for the full year. We are affirming our guidance for revenue growth and available cash flow, and we're raising our EPS outlook.","Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Kwas at Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone. Just on the investments for the quarter, was that more weighted to the Americas versus other parts of the world?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. It's heavily weighted towards Americas. That trend will continue. As we kind of indicated last time, it's probably 80:20, Americas versus rest of the world. Similar ratio for Q1, and we'd expect that to continue throughout the balance of the year.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then just on near-term as it relates to - as we think about seasonality with Q2 and whatnot, you have a tougher comp in the Americas given you recaptured the sale of the last year second quarter from ERP. Patrick, any thoughts there? Any additional color we should think about and put under consideration as we look at the balance of the year?","Patrick Shannon","I would - we had a strong quarter. As we indicated, some of that strength, just driven primarily from the - not only growth and the initiatives and the returns on investments we're making, but some of it because the easier comparison because the delayed shipments last year, as you're aware of.","Tougher comps in Q2, but markets remain fairly strong and tracking towards the organic revenue growth we had indicated at the beginning of the year, 6% to 7% for the full year. Probably a little bit because of tough comps in Q2, I would anticipate a lower revenue growth. But the outlook for the full year still remains fairly positive, just given the activity in the marketplace, response from our customers, order intake, et cetera.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then last quick one. Dave, just on M&A, so you did a small doors acquisition earlier in the year. As you think about the business portfolio, what are the sorts of assets that you're seeing out there that are attractive? And how would you characterize multiples? And how motivated are you to add more door assets to the portfolio?","David Petratis","So first of all, I'd say, overall, the pace here is active. Second, we continue to favor the electronics space. We continue to be - work to understand to how we can strengthen our door offerings. Clearly, the Republic move helps us from a regional basis. We think that's important, and we'll continue to try and strengthen that out across North America.","But that was the value of Republic, is getting closer to our customers. If you remember, our field crap business heavily centered around Cincinnati, with a couple of mud centers. The door business requires closeness to customers, and that acquisition really helped us to buy operational assets that helps us grow faster.","Operator","The next question is from David MacGregor at Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter in the Americas, but I wanted to just maybe dig in a little bit on the European business. And David, can you just kind of unpack that relatively flat growth in Europe and just talk about the puts and takes that you saw in the quarter?","And then as well, I guess, while we're in Europe, just do you expect the timing of the benefits from the Italian restructuring if they're running behind? What's - can you give us an update in terms of how you think about the timing of those benefits flowing through?","David Petratis","Sure, David. First, when I think about overall Europe, extremely pleased with our long-term progression. We've come a long way since 40 months. Extremely pleased with the growth of SimonsVoss. It was an acquisition in electronics that we targeted, and the performance of that business is strong.","Third, some of the moves we made in terms of the restructuring, especially around our CISA business, are very complex. I'm talking running SKUs of over 600 and the total base of over 3,000 SKUs. That change improved our overall profitability, but put some complexity into the supply chain, and we'll work through that for the balance of the year.","I'd emphasize, with that move, we will have some money - we built some backlog that we'll work through as we go through the balance of the year, but overall feel good. The complexity or challenge is optimizing that supply chain. And with that number of SKUs, it doesn't come overnight.","David MacGregor","So how should we think about EMEIA growth in the second half of the year?","David Petratis","I would, in line with our projections, low single digits, with any momentum coming out of the SimonsVoss and the adoption of electronics, and then improving our operational capabilities.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks, good morning guys. So my first question, maybe touch a little bit on the raw mat headwinds that you saw this quarter. It seems like it was a pretty big headwind across the board, and you're able to offset that with price, but I'm curious to hear how you think that progresses through the year.","Patrick Shannon","So you're right. We've seen a significant movement in commodities across the board. The biggest impact for us relates to steel, brass and zinc. Steel, year-over-year, is up, at least at the end of the quarter, over 40%. And it's moved since then, another like 20%, so significant movements.","And as you indicated, we've been able to move faster in price to offset the commodity headwinds. What I would see through the balance of the year, just kind of given where the current commodity prices trade today, is continued pressure on the cost side. It will escalate a little bit in Q2, Q3 because if you recall, we hedged some of our exposure on a forward-looking basis. And so we're protected.","And to the extent the commodity prices stay in place for an extended period of time, the exposure becomes greater. So continued pressure, Q2, Q3. The comps get a little bit easier in Q4 because that's when we start seeing big movements in the cost base. But we will endeavor to mitigate that, offset it, et cetera. And that's our current plan through pricing actions.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And just maybe that - is the base case there that price cost stays positive as we progress through the year? Or is it possible that in the next quarter or so, you could go negative there, and then you'd make it up in the back half of the year?","Patrick Shannon","It could be a little negative, but I would think we'd be neutral to slightly up is the expectation, certainly as we look on a full year basis.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it. That's helpful. And maybe if I could sneak in one more. When I went and visited you guys, spent time with you guidance at ISE West, it seems like you guys were really excited about the - your ENGAGE platform. I'm just wondering, like how much opportunity is there with the platform? How much is that adding to your share gains in recent quarters? Just maybe expand more strategically, that would be helpful.","David Petratis","So when we think about ENGAGE, and as we communicate, think about our overall electronic growth, which is low double digits, it's clearly a differentiator in the market. We think there's opportunities in the commercial, institutional and multifamily space, where we can differentiate our mechanical capabilities with electronics, with ENGAGE.","And what we're selling there is convenience, ease-of-use and centralized control over the locking systems, and we think that's an opportunity that we talked about at Investor Day that we'll roll for the next decade.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Wojs at Baird.","Tim Wojs","Good morning. I guess, my question, Dave, just if you could look at non-res and maybe talk about what you're seeing in maybe some of the larger verticals? We've been hearing that institutional is starting to really gain some steam. So I'm curious if you're seeing that. And then just how we should think about the impact of institutional on mix and margins through the year?","David Petratis","I feel good about the institutional demand, the healthcare demand. Our spec writing capabilities or our spec writing abilities are robust. That's how I describe it. You can see some variation across different geographical regions in North America, but it's strong. And it's a bellwether, I think, as we talked about it at Investor Day, as we look at over the next '17 and '18, maybe even a little steam picking up in education. Healthcare, we think '17 will be a good year, and then some softening as we move into '18. And commercial office, because of high occupancy rates, have continued to roll.","So we continue to stay positive. Concerns? Ability of labor to put equipment in place, architectural firms to be able to work through the design phase. And that's been a concern all along, professional and construction laborer to be able to put in place, I think, will continue to be a cap or a drag on growth, which puts more importance on our self-help initiatives to be able to grow.","Tim Wojs","And is there any way to think about institutional versus commercial mix and the value of a door opening in one vertical versus another?","David Petratis","The institutional mix has a higher concentration of SKUs and higher value for us. So if, internally, you prioritize one opportunity or the other, we're always going to go stronger on the institutional side.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Kessler at Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Kessler","Thank you. You talked about resi being mid-single digits, which has declined slowly and stabilized over the last couple of years, but the overall Americas being, obviously, growing faster than that. Can you talk about, and particularly as we saw at ISE West, both the mortise and the cylindrical, and the - what we call the ENGAGE platform, what type of growth you're getting in that mid-market area that is transforming from mechanical to electromechanical? Because clearly, if resi is not growing at 15% anymore, something else is growing at 15%.","David Petratis","And that growth is leveraged by our position in electronics. Really pleased with the residential electronic growth. We think our ENGAGE platform and our investments we're making to go after multifamily strengthens our offering, where we have some deterioration in terms of res performances in the opening price point segments of the market. And it's not that we couldn't get more aggressive there. We think there's better places.","So you balance that out. Mid-single-digit growth for resi is levered for faster growth from electronics, and we're just not aggressive on the opening price point. I think that will continue to be - the opening price point will be a challenge. As you look at the need for new home constructions, there's some big gaps in the opening price points of the market.","Jeffrey Kessler","This begs the question of what type of growth you're getting in the mid to- small and mid-commercial market as well as the multifamily and institutional - smaller institutional market, I should say, when it comes to the ENGAGE platform. That must be growing faster than mid-single digits. It's probably, if you balance that out, it's clearly up there in the teens.","David Petratis","I would characterize it as this, Jeff. Our single offering, Schlage locks, through e-commerce and wholesale, are what leads the sales growth today. But our best opportunity are in these connective systems, and that's what we're going after in multifamily. Underserved by Allegion - that segment of the market has been underserved by Allegion historically.","Jeffrey Kessler","Can those - and just finally, a quick follow-up on broadening that particular set of technology out there, to what extent is that applicable to the institutional - the larger markets that are out there, including institutional health care, doctors' offices, accountants, things like that?","David Petratis","I want to make sure I understand your question. As our electronics evolved - our ability to be able to better serve that? I think when you think about college campuses, we look at as a growth driver, think about residential dormitories, we've got cited examples where we've been successful. That's going to continue to grow. I think as we try to go into what we call project-based business, and more effectively compete with a total Allegion package, we think that's opportunistic.","And then as we get into the commercial buildings, our NDE, with the cylindrical and mortise capability, gives us the ability to offer a total package solutions on the interior doors. This is what we would say is the mother lode of opportunity in our core markets.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. Because that's what we got really excited about at ISE West, the ability to start putting those NDE products on the insides of these places.","David Petratis","It's clear opportunity for us. I think we're well-positioned. Remember, when we first came out with the NDE, we were first out there, but we needed that mortise. And it tightens up that offering pretty nicely to go after these interior doors and, again, offer a very elegant solution to a building operator that he can get away from keys.","Operator","The next question is from Rizk Maidi at Berenberg.","Rizk Maidi","Yes, good morning guys. My question is on pricing really. So pricing was up plus 1.1% in Q1, and your largest competitor in Europe improved pricing by 2% in the quarter. How should we think about this? Are you pushing for more volume in the quarter? And also, how should we think about pricing for the rest of the year, given that there are 2 other big players trying to be aggressive in the U.S. as well?","Patrick Shannon","So I would characterize it as every year, we - particularly in Americas, we go out to price increase in Q4. And so we start realizing the benefits basically beginning of the following year, as a lot of the activity is price-protected, if you will. So what you saw in Q1 was in line with our expectations in the market. We are not - I'd say we're competitive in the market.","We're not being overly aggressive from a discounting perspective, either on residential or nonresidential products. I would anticipate the pricing improvement to continue throughout the course of the year, maybe get a little bit better than the 1-point improvement that we saw in Q1. And that kind of continued throughout the course of the year.","David Petratis","I would also add, our European competitor has a larger exposure to steel with their larger steel door business. So they've got to pull that lever just to stay even with the escalation of steel prices.","Rizk Maidi","I see. And then just quickly, secondly, on the EMEIA division. So a 0.1% volume growth in the quarter, and I think you benefited from 2 extra working days there. Is there something that we should be aware of there in terms of issues beyond the supply chain issue in Italy?","David Petratis","Just building on my comments, we've made big gains in terms of our overall profitability. Part of that came from a repositioning of the supply chain that we're still working. We were really encouraged by the growth in SimonsVoss. As we move our exposure to the DACH influence markets, those are better growth markets than our traditional Mediterranean exposure.","So overall, we were pleased with the quarter, especially in terms of the year-over-year improvement, and know that we have work to do in terms of shoring up that supply chain. And you'll see that come throughout the year.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Barry at Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Good morning. I don't want to harp too much on the pricing, but just a follow-up. I think the pricing is still better in non-res versus in resi, right, the sort of big-box?","Patrick Shannon","They were actually fairly equal in Q1. But normally, you're right. I mean, we get - we have the ability to push price a little bit stronger in non-res than res.","Robert Barry","Got you, okay. I mean, I was going to ask, given the context of non-res being so strong, but it sounds like it wasn't really that big a deal. Just a housekeeping item on the cadence of the investment spend. I think you were expecting it to be higher in 2Q and 3Q in the Americas. Is that still the case?","Patrick Shannon","That is still the case. As we continue to invest in both our channels and new products, there's, obviously, carryover from the prior year. But funding the new initiatives starts to really ramp up more so in Q2, Q3. So you see a little bit heavier investment in those quarters relative to Q1.","David Petratis","I would add. I continue to like our opportunities to grow organically through these investments. I believe, every quarter, we build our credibility in terms of making bets and getting returns on those bets. And we're still opportunistic in terms of our view that we can make those investments and grow the top line and get great leverage.","Robert Barry","Yes, make sense. David, maybe just one big picture question. I mean, it seems like things are firing on all cylinders. If you were to - but you also have a pretty healthy growth expectation kind of baked in. At this point, where would you say there's potential upside to your outlook this year, and just to keep a balance to where do you think the downside risk is at this point?","David Petratis","So I think upside, number one, would come through share gains through our initiatives. I believe pretty strongly that the overall market is capped by labor install, design capabilities. So our ability to execute, which I've got a pretty high level of confidence on.","Second, some of the questions Jeff touched on, the electronics growth look at us to get even more aggressive in promotion of our ENGAGE capabilities. Multifamily, we think these are opportunistic. On the downside, you've just got lots of potential shocks out there that can dampen consumer demand and confidence, and that's on a global basis.","So you've got to have - I think you've got to be aggressive in terms of opportunities we see, and then be ready to act. And from my perspective, that's part of being in the construction service industries. Things can change quickly. I think we're - we review with a discipline to make sure that, where we can - where things are going right, we can go faster. And if they're not, we adjust the change.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just, I guess, my questions would be, just within the Americas market, specifically, if you'd seen any change in the pace of ordering or pipeline activity regarding customer spending over the past 6 months. Or it's been fairly steady? And then secondly, whether the delays - some of those delays in the European restructuring have affected your near-term views on the desirability of doing acquisitions in the EMEIA region over next sort of six months or so.","David Petratis","First, in the Americas, it begins with our quotation and specification capabilities, the pulse of that, feel very positive about that. The tone and tenor of the market is as solid as I've seen since 2006 and '07. We want to reemphasize that. I mean, we've come through some pretty dark days since the collapse, and the tone and tenor of the market is as robust as I've seen since the collapse. We still are not at peaks.","In education, we would say 88% to peak. Healthcare's at 85%. Commercial office is robust. We'd put that at 99%. But you look at that in context, we think great opportunity for us to go out, take the investments, the new products and go out and grow in the marketplace. So feel good about things.","these types of businesses can ebbs and flows. And I think, again, it's the ability of the labor to put it in place. The European question, I continue to be positive on overall Europe in terms of our position, electronics accelerating and us continuing. A huge amount of change has gone - taken place in Allegion Europe, and we will continue to be opportunistic in terms of looking at that through acquisitions. Again, these are more the string of pearls, small acquisitions.","As we think about Europe, we think about it in 3 dimensions. How can we improve our technology? How can we move north and improve our northern exposure, which are typically healthier markets? And how can we improve our spec writing and channels to market? So you have to take a long-term view there. We continue to build relationships in terms of that acquisition pipeline, but feel good about the positioning. At $0.5 billion of revenue, we've got a lot of room to grow in Europe.","Operator","We have another question from Jeffrey Kessler at Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Kessler","Thank you. When most people think of Europe, they're thinking of obviously 2 of your largest competitors over there. I actually tend to think of Spain as your competitor there. And I'm wondering if you believe, at this point in time, technologically, you have the capability to go head-to-head with your Spanish competitor there, who's obviously, from an aid point of view, is probably too expensive for anybody to take on right now? But from a competitive point of view, this is kind of where you have to break through with SimonsVoss?","David Petratis","So we admire our Spanish competitors. They've got a good business. Their positioning is different than ours. We're much more successful in the educational, institutional, healthcare. They're much more active, light commercial, hotels. And so, in the morning, at Allegion, we have to wake up and understand who we are and go after those markets.","With that said, as we invest in new products, we go after some of those segments thereafter and continue to leverage our growth outside of these dock areas. That's our best opportunity to grow, but that's how I describe it, Jeff.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. So the amount of cash you intend to develop, is there tweaking to your cash conversion ratios that you're making throughout the year, depending on business conditions, and what you feel you're going to need to invest in? I mean, do you have a - has the plan changed? Is the plan changing now from what you talked about perhaps 6 or 7 months ago with regard to how much cash you wanted to come down to the bottom line?","Patrick Shannon","So no change in the outlook in terms of our available cash flow for the full year. The long-term target is to continue to drive cash flow to be at 100% plus of net earnings. Feel good that that's sustainable, given the low investment requirements, particularly in working capital and CapEx. So we'll continue to drive that.","And the deployment of the capital, as we indicated in Investor Day, is we've got certain things that are designated, whether it be CapEx, dividends, debt repayment, et cetera, but we've got a big bulk of capital available for strategic investments, either through M&A or opportunistic share repurchase.","And we'll continue to look at those opportunities as we progress throughout the year, but no change relative to our short-term or long-term guidance in terms of cash generation going forward.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks.","Michael Wagnes","Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call.

We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted.","Please go to slide number 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion experienced modest top line revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in the Americas offset by weakness in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Americas region had reported an organic growth of 6.8% in the quarter driven by both the non-residential and residential businesses. The EMEIA region saw market soften and the complexity of moving our operations from Turkey to Poland negatively impacted the top line as well as operating income.","The level of effort in executing a move like this cannot be underestimated. While we did experience some impact from the transition, we are better positioned after leaving Turkey. Asia Pacific continued to experience weak markets in Australia and saw deteriorating markets in China.","Electronics growth in the Americas came in just over 12% in the quarter and increased over 10% for the full year. We continue to see electronics as a long-term positive trend, as more and more products become connected for ease of access","As I look to our end markets, U.S. nonresidential remains healthy and U.S. residential has improved. As I mentioned EMEIA and Asia Pacific are experiencing weaknesses in the markets they serve and we see that continuing in the near-term.","Adjusted operating margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points for the full year.","Margin expansion was led by the Americas region, which saw a full year adjusted margins, up 120 basis points. Volume leverage was good during the year, and the price productivity inflation dynamic was positive.","In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS growth came in at nearly 5%, bringing the full year increase to approximately 9%. Available cash flow was up nearly $14 million to $422.6 million for the year.","Overall, I'm pleased with our full year 2019 results. We saw good revenue performance, expanded adjusted operating margins, delivered solid adjusted EPS growth and generated substantial available cash flow.","Please go to slide 5, and I'll walk you through the fourth quarter financial summary. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $719.5 million, an increase of 2.4%, inclusive of 3.5% organic growth.","Currency headwinds and the impact of the divestiture of our business in Turkey offset some of the organic growth. Americas led the way on revenue growth, offsetting the weakness we experienced in EMEIA and Asia Pacific. Patrick will share more detail on the regions in a moment.","Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points in the fourth quarter as we saw significant margin expansion in the Americas with declines in Europe and Asia. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 increased $0.06 or nearly 5% versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by higher operating income.","Favorable share count and interest expense offset the unfavorable year-over-year tax rate increase. Available cash flow for the year came at $422.6 million, an increase of nearly $14 million versus prior year. Increased adjusted earnings and improvement in net working capital were the driving factors for the increase.","Please go to slide 6. This year, we're recognizing Schlage for its past, present and future innovation. 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the brand, and we're proud to celebrate this milestone in various ways that support the business and engage the customer, non-residential and residential audiences.","As a legacy brand with a rich history there is no doubt that Schlage is an important part of the Allegion story. Schlage has been providing security, style and peace of mind for the last 100 years.","From the first push-button lock pioneered by Walter Schlage in 1920 to the high-tech mobile solutions of today, our trusted brand's passion for door hardware is rooted in security and steeped in innovation.","As you may recall, we saw a strong market acceptance of the Schlage Encode residential lock after it was introduced in 2019, especially because we were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi deadbolt to the market.","By year's end, the Schlage Encode was recognized as the best-in-class product by consumer tech influencers at CNET, Digital Trends and Consumer Reports among others. Just last month, it was named the best smart door lock to keep intruders out, highlighting the peace of mind Schlage is known to bring to homeowners across the globe.","And it's not only -- and it's not the only one driving recognition of the Schlage suite of products, our Schlage Sense and Schlage Connect also continue to receive accolades in the smart home market as the best smart locks you can buy and the best tech gifts.","Collectively, these smart locks along with Schlage Encode, has been recognized by tech experts as the best to work with Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and Google Home.","As a powerful brand, we expect Schlage will continue to set the bar for customer experience in our industry and redefine what's possible with security solutions for seamless access.","Please go to slide 7. Last March, we announced our business strategy, centered on seamless access and a safer world. Allegion has a strong internal innovation engines, creating award-winning products like the one you just saw as well as overture for specification work flow and next-generation products like the SimonsVoss, SmartHandle AX.","As we looked at the future, we see the opportunity for technology to drive progress in seamless access. What I'd like to highlight today is edge computing. We made a leap forward in edge devices with the acquisition of ISONAS. It was a good technology move.","And through Allegion Ventures, we're investing in companies that approach authentication and people flow in new ways companies like Pindrop, Robin and Openpath. I'm excited to see the ways we can create new value and access by current Schlage products and the data and analytical capabilities of a company like Openpath.","You'll see us continue to look for opportunities to invest, partner and drive progress through internal and external innovation that aligns with our strategic pillars: Be the partner of choice, deliver new value and access, smart capital allocation, expanding our core markets and focus on enterprise excellence.","Access has been a part of the company heritage for more than 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2020 outlook.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. Please go to Slide number 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2019. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 3.5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Overall, we saw solid volume and price realization led by the Americas region. Price continued to remain strong, particularly in the Americas nonresidential business.","The impact of the divestiture of our business in Turkey, along with continued currency pressure in EMEIA and Asia Pacific were a headwind to total growth. With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. Total top line revenue saw an increase of 4.5% for the year and organic growth came in at 4.6% led by Americas at more than 6%. As indicated, Americas organic growth in the fourth quarter was higher than the full year results, while EMEIA and Asia Pacific were weaker.","Please go to Slide number 9. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $719.5 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 2.4% versus the prior year, up 3.5% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $151 million increased 4% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21% increased 30 basis points. The margin expansion was primarily driven by solid operating leverage on incremental volumes in the Americas along with pricing and productivity outpacing inflation.","Headwinds to margin performance include incremental investments which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. For the full year, the company experienced adjusted operating margin expansion of 70 basis points.","Please go to Slide number 10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.39. Adjusting $0.17 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration cost related to acquisitions and benefits related to U.S. tax reform, the 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.22.","Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.08 as favorable price. Operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase, reflective of the $226 million of share buyback that occurred during 2019.","The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction and unfavorable year-over-year tax rate drove another negative $0.03 per share impact. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.28, an increase of $0.06 or nearly 5% compared to the prior year.","Lastly, we have a $0.42 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, trade name impairments, as well as loss on divestitures in Turkey and Colombia. The loss on divestitures was predominantly associated with non-cash currency translation adjustments, previously deferred in equity and reclassified into earnings upon the sale of the divested businesses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.86.","Please go to Slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $526.3 million, up 6.8% on both a reported and organic basis. The growth was driven by strong price realization and volume. Both the nonresidential and residential businesses grew nicely and at similar levels to each other.","The residential business had strong growth in the quarter attributed to new products and increased sales in the builder channel. Electronics growth for the quarter was just over 12% and was sequentially higher than the prior quarter. As Dave mentioned earlier, the full year electronics growth in the Americas was solid at just over 10%.","Electronics products continue to be a long-term growth driver as consumers and end users migrate to electronics from solely mechanical products as a value connectivity and convenience. Americas adjusted operating income of $153.9 million increased 16.8% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 240 basis points. Strong volume leverage, along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation, drove substantial margin expansion. Incremental investments were a 40 basis point decrease to margins. With the outstanding Q4 performance, full year adjusted operating margins in Americas were up 120 basis points.","Please go to slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $149.6 million, down 5% and down 1.5% on an organic basis. The lower volume was driven by weakening end markets across the region. The impact of the divestiture of the business in Turkey and currency headwinds also contributed to the revenue decline. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $16.7 million, decreased 25.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, decreased by a disappointing 310 basis points.","During the quarter, inflation exceeded price, plus productivity and currency headwinds continued to be a drag on margins. In addition, revenue declines also had a negative impact on operating margins. The plant relocation from Turkey related to the divestiture of that business, drove additional costs in the quarter. The magnitude of the move while anticipated resulted in some operational inefficiencies that are likely to continue in the near-term future but are also expected to be resolved as we progress in 2020. These types of moves are extremely complex. And though we did experience increased costs, we are better positioned being out of Turkey in the long run. With the drag of the Q4 performance, full year adjusted operating margins were down 10 basis points in the region.","Please go to slide number 13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.6 million, down 16.6% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was down 13.4%. The decline was driven by continued weakness in Australian end markets, particularly on the residential side, as well as declines experienced in China, attributable to weaker end markets. Total revenue continued to be affected by currency headwinds.","Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.9 million, a decrease of $4.6 million with adjusted operating margins down 800 basis points versus the prior year period. Approximately $1 million of the income decline was attributable to inflation exceeding price plus productivity. Significant volume declines and unfavorable mix had a large impact on the reduced income and margin.","We have initiated restructuring actions to lower the cost base and accelerate integration of the GWA business. These actions will better position us to address the market challenges in the region. Full year adjusted operating margins for Asia Pacific were down 180 basis points in 2019.","Please go to slide number 14. Available cash flow for 2019 came in at $422.6 million, which is an increase of $13.9 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by higher adjusted net earnings and improvements in net working capital, partially offset by increases in restructuring spend and capital expenditures.","Looking at the chart at the bottom of the slide, it shows working capital as a percent of revenues increased based on a four-point quarter average. However, the year-end working capital as a percent of revenue was lower at the end of 2019, compared to the same point in time last year. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to increase available cash flow and minimize investments in working capital, increasing the velocity of asset turnover.","I will now hand it back over to Dave for a view on our full year 2020 outlook.","Dave Petratis","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 15. We continue to see favorable trends in our primary end markets in 2020. We also believe growth in the electronics portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions and we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend.","In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals. The residential end markets have rebounded and improved. We expect the general trend towards electronic products in both residential and nonresidential businesses to continue. With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4.5% to 5.5%. We are projecting Americas total revenue expansion to be 4% to 5% with a slight impact from divesting our business in Colombia.","In Europe, markets have softened in Germany and Southern Europe and remained weak in the U.K. For the region, we project total and organic growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% led by our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses.","In Asia Pacific, we expect weakness in the Australian markets to continue particularly in residential. The market in China has also softened. With that backdrop, we expect growth in the region to be flat both on a reported and organic basis with declines expected in the first half of the year and modest recovery in the second half on easier comparisons. All-in, we are projecting total revenue growth for the company at a range of 3% to 4% with organic growth between 3.5% and 4.5%.","Please go to slide 16. Our 2020 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $5.10 to $5.20, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. As indicated the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 6% to 8%. Our outlook anticipated -- anticipates continued volume leverage and a positive equation for price, productivity and inflation. We also expect margin accretion in all regions for the full year, but continued pressure in the first half for EMEIA and Asia Pacific.","Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we remain focused on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allows us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences for electronic products. The combination of interest and other expense is expected to be a slight positive to earnings per share.","Our outlook assumes a full year adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 16.5% to 17%, an increase from 14.3% in 2019. It also assumes outstanding weighted average diluted shares of approximately 93 million. The outlook additionally includes a $0.10 per share impact from restructuring charges during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated at $5 to $5.10. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2020 to be in the $450 million to $470 million range.","Please go to slide 17. We are pleased with our 2019 performance, which saw top line growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 4.6%, adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points, adjusted EPS growth of nearly 9% and strong available cash flow. And while it's not highlighted on this slide, we strengthened the foundational elements of Allegion's culture that will help drive our success as a company into this new decade.","Safety and sustainability and engagement, in 2019 we were safer reducing workplace accidents and their cost, which were already below the industry average. We were cleaner, reducing energy inputs and waste outputs and we were significantly more engaged, meaning our global employees are more committed to our vision and our work than ever before.","As we look to 2020 and renew our commitment to safety, sustainability and engagement we are well-positioned to drive continued growth in revenue and earnings. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted earnings per share and generate substantial available cash flow.","Before we take questions, I'd like to take a moment to share some news with regard to the organization changes here at Allegion. Mike Wagnes, will be assuming a general management role, within the Americas business. Mike has been Treasurer. And Head of Investor Relations since the summer of 2016.","Since that time, Mike has served as a valuable voice for the shareholder community, among the leadership team. As we move forward, Tom Martineau, Vice President Finance, for the EMEIA region will assume the Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations role.","Many of you are familiar with Tom. And know that he brings a wealth of financial experience and knowledge that will position him well as Allegion's primary representative, to the investment community. I'd like to congratulate both Mike and Tom, on their new opportunities.","This transition has been completed. And you can begin contacting Tom, for any investor-related questions, on a go-forward basis. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. And thanks, Mike for all the help, in the last few years. Just wanted to follow-up on the comments around the first half softness, particularly in the international regions, just wondered, if you could put a finer point on what that means for the earnings cadence through the year.","Although, you don't guide quarterly, but I guess in recent years the first half has been around 45%, 46%, for the full year earnings. Do you expect a similar ratio this year, or is it more back-end loaded?","Patrick Shannon","I would see a similar ratio, but just as we kind of highlighted some continued pressure, particularly as it relates to the international regions with the softness in the markets, trying to recover some of the margin deterioration, we experienced in Q4.","Americas business will continue to, caught up with the same seasonality of the business from a revenue perspective, as you guys know stronger Q2, Q3, but overall, similar type of profile, but weakness in the international areas.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. Then on the point you just made, you mentioned in APAC the restructuring initiatives, something we can understand what's happening there.","Maybe just within the EMEIA region, help us understand, how much of a surprise it was that inflation exceeded price plus productivity in Q4.","And maybe what are the measures, if any beyond the Turkey plant relocation that you're implementing in the EMEIA region to turn that business around.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. So if we look at the European business from a margin perspective, in Q4, I'd say, disappointing operational performance. Really driven from weakness in the end markets, particularly in Germany, U.K., we saw some softness.","And Germany as you know is a real strong point for our business, particularly in the electronics side, with higher margin profile. So we had somewhat of an unfavorable mix as well, that negatively affected us.","And then you throw on top of that, some of the inefficiencies with moving the plant, from Turkey to Poland and just trying to work through that, both from an operational perspective as well as supply chain, third-party providers.","We will work through that. And it's going to take sometime. But there's going to be some kind of continued pressure on that. So we'll continue to work through that.","Going forward, your question relative to actions, yeah, we will continue to evaluate our business. And size it accordingly to market demand. But that's just the kind of a continuation of what we're going to do to operate the business.","So there will be some activity there to recover margins, particularly in the back half of the year.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird. Please go ahead.","Josh Chan","Hi, good morning and congrats Mike on the new role.","Mike Wagnes","Thanks Josh.","Josh Chan","My first question is on the Americas just on your organic guidance for 2020. It looks like the growth is slightly lower than the 2019 growth. But is that mainly due to the price maybe not being up as much and a pretty steady volume type of growth outlook? Just wondering how you're feeling about the cadence of growth in the Americas.","Patrick Shannon","So, I feel really good particularly on the performance and in Q4, they put up another strong growth -- organic growth 6.8%. So, I think we're entering 2020 in good shape. All the indicators as Dave highlighted end markets continue to remain strong, particularly in the institutional segment which you know favors our business well.","As we look into 2020, it's I think more kind of what you highlighted not as strong of a price profile for 2020 outlook. We'll continue to drive it. But from a material input cost kind of in a deflationary environment, probably won't get as much price in 2020 as what you saw in 2019, but we'll continue to work that.","But I would say hey 5% organic growth midpoint of guidance is still strong. It's just -- you also have tougher comps in the back half of the year and so maybe a little conservatism there. But feel good about where we're entering 2020 basis of the markets and how we're performing.","Josh Chan","Yes. That's definitely a solid growth there. And my follow-up is on the EMEIA region. You mentioned that the transition from Turkey kind of impacted you in Q4. Just wondering how much of the demand weakness was because of some of that transition. And how much of that would you say was the end markets in the quarter?","Dave Petratis","So, good morning Josh. I would -- number one European end markets definitely softened. I think if you look at industrials and automotives which we're particularly strong with that still -- that softened our electronics businesses. And then I'd say general decline in our mechanical side because of regional weakness U.K., Italy, and others. So, clear market weakness.","Second is the move from Turkey to Poland a good productivity play for us over the long-term, but we moved a lot of jobs, a lot of tools, change of the supply base and that certainly impacted our ability to serve our customers and drove inefficiencies.","I think as you think about 2020, we'll get better every month. But we're talking almost 140 new roles in Poland. Good productivity inside that. But as an old manufacturing guy, we'll get better week-to-week, month-to-month and I think have this operation in pretty good order by midyear.","Josh Chan","All right. Thanks Dave, thanks Patrick, and good luck on 2020.","Dave Petratis","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Good morning, gentlemen.","Mike Wagnes","Hey Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Hey Mike. Congrats and Tom are you sure you want back? So, Mike thanks for all the help and Tom looking forward to working with you again. So, a couple of questions. First, in terms of your -- on the electronics side, do you guys have -- we've heard some concerns about second and third-tier suppliers. How comfortable are you guys with your supply chain for the electronic components for the lock business going into first and second quarter given what's happening in China?","Dave Petratis","So, we have an outstanding supply chain team here. They've been working with the events in China and the coronavirus. I would say this Andrew. Every week that China stays shut down it will put pressure on our supply chain.","Remember we typically produce in region, but we still draw a lot of sourcing out of China. Probably more concerned about second-tier suppliers, providers that could supply subcomponents to final assemblers. So, we're well out in front of us.","I think the timing helped us a little bit with the Chinese New Year. We would typically stock up. But again, I looked at some reports yesterday out of China, only about 30% of the industrial workforce is back to work. It's really a function of how quickly this comes back up.","Andrew Obin","Got you. So limited...","Patrick Shannon","And Andrew, I would just add to that that kind of looking at is, we're not heavily exposed in region obviously, there will be a impact. But globally, you're probably looking at minor disruption in Q1. I think it's more of a Q2 and then the longevity how long does this thing last. And \u2013 but right now for a full year basis the expectation is that there wouldn't be any impact relative to the guide that we've provided here.","Andrew Obin","Yeah. I just want to make sure that there's not like one chip that will shut down production line for electronics. Just a question on the electronics, you guys have been doing great. How should I think about business mix for North America given the strength in electronics relative to mechanical, because I would imagine there is margin difference? Thank you.","Patrick Shannon","So the margin profile on electronic products both commercial, residential are similar to mechanical, but what you have is a higher average selling price. So there's more EBIT dollars, if you will with that migration and it is a favorable mix for us to the extent we can continue to drive that. And that's some of our incremental investments that we make to drive demand, particularly in electronics to put new products out to the market faster. It's centered around that, because that is a favorable trend in both the industry and for Allegion.","Andrew Obin","That's fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Deepa Raghavan","Hey, good morning. I echo my congrats to Mike and Tom as well. Two questions from me. First is Americas. Resi versus non-resi expectation within Americas organic growth guide, do we assume they both grow at the same rate, or is there perhaps a delta driven by resi having to do some catch-up in the first half?","Patrick Shannon","So I would characterize it as \u2013 as you know, we historically don't give specifics around outlooks relative to the residential non-residential businesses. So just take it in aggregate. There will be differences between the businesses as we progress. I would say this. If you kind of look at the residential business the backdrop is more favorable from industry perspective than what we were talking about three to six months ago.","So we would expect that to be positive. And then new products like Encode are performing extremely well, and higher electronics growth in resi than the non-resi. So just think about it in those terms. And \u2013 but overall, Americas is performing well from an organic perspective.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. That's helpful. My follow-up is on the incremental investment spend that's $0.15 that you provided. Is that spread \u2013 how is that spread out over the year the $0.15? And also is this all going into the APAC region, or is that more spread out across geographies?","Patrick Shannon","No. The majority similar to prior years would be Americas focused. We believe we have a lot of opportunities to continue to invest in the business. Again, it's centered around new product development and channel-specific initiatives where we have underserved markets that we believe we can continue to drive through our channel.","So predominantly Americas, and the cadence of that, I would say fairly evenly split as we progress throughout the year is how you should be thinking about it. But overall, $0.15 pretty much in line with what we've experienced in the last couple of years.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Good luck, Mike. Tom, nice to have you back. I guess David is there anyway of talking about just what you're assuming for growth of the broader markets where you compete in 2020 just some sense of what you've got in your guidance?","Dave Petratis","I'd say strong institutional. We continue -- as you think of 2019 to 2020, we actually see that market continue to get stronger, our spec position, our backlogs. So like that with a focus on education those bond issues that we look at across the country are going into security and we like that trend.","I think the other significantly more favorable risk and then complemented by electronics the residential market was in the bit of a doldrums in 2019. I think there are some things that step up nicely for Allegion in the Americas as we go into 2020 and which would include new products the full year of Lennar and continued to grab this -- on our team to go out and grow that part of the market.","David MacGregor","Encouraging. And I guess is there any way to quantify this Turkey to Poland? There's been a lot of discussion. We've been kind of talking around the point, but is there any way to put some numbers on what that meant to the quarter? And how you're thinking about the potential headwind here in the first half of 2020?","Patrick Shannon","So the answer to the latter part of your question, yes, it will continue to be a headwind for the first half of the year and I would expect by Q3, we're at a full run rate perspective in getting the realization of the benefits that we anticipated when we set forth in the move. So i.e. production should be smooth, no disruption in supply chain et cetera. It was a drag on margin in the quarter as well as unfavorable mix and the deleverage associated with the reduction in organic growth.","David MacGregor","Thanks. Good luck.","Patrick Shannon","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kessler","Hi. And again congratulations to Mike and to Tom. Tom, good to have you back again on this side. The -- on the electronics business in the U.S. or in the Americas I should say, can you parse out what areas seem to be providing you with some of the better growth that you're seeing? Is it in NFC? Is it you're beginning to use power over Ethernet? Is it beginning to use other areas of access control or other new products that you have recently developed for doors and entryways or for that matter the use of overture in driving business too? Do you -- can you kind of parse out, what it is on the electronics side that is really -- that's really driving this better-than-expected growth here?","Dave Petratis","I think number one a great lineup of capabilities. I think two, you mentioned our spec writing capabilities, but it's really that installed base with technical mastery working with clients could be the University of Michigan, could be Iowa Western Community College, it could be the University of Tennessee. Those products and capabilities come together in a trusted relationships that help us grow. I would say things like ISONAS, our investment in multifamily, which can position itself in college dormitories. It's that trusted position in a market that wants to move keyless that is driving the growth.","Jeff Kessler","All right.","Dave Petratis","Let me give you one other one too. Encode the first WiFi lock, the battery sustainability there our ability to get through some technical issues. And I think growth on our parts in terms of our mastery to be able to connect into the web of complexity that can appear in the a residential home or a commercial institutional site, it's how things connect our teams have put a lot of work on. And I think as we unload out of the box and connect, we're doing a better job that builds customer loyalty.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. Sticking in the same area. When you're talking about your -- more or less the -- on the commercial side of electronics, is it just institutional, or when you look at -- are there areas other -- obviously smaller from -- business from the get-go but perhaps fast-growing healthcare or if you want to call it a strategic or specific new types of logistics, are there areas in those markets where you have particular focus in putting investments and actually getting return on those investments over the next two to three years?","Dave Petratis","I think our priority will continue to be heavily institutional focused because of that installed base and our spec writing capability. Our things like the master key system the ID, edge devices are already there. So ability to upgrade that puts us in an A position.","I'd say second, really doing I think a nice job on multi-family and mixed-use. You see a lot of movement into the intercity our ability to solve multiple problems for a developer including keyless access has given us some nice growth across the country.","Jeff Kessler","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Dave Petratis","Good morning.","John Walsh","And thank you to Mike for all the help over the years. I guess first question just looking at the cash balance, obviously you've been growing nicely. You had announced that new share repurchase program. Just wondering if you could talk about the priorities for your uses of cash as we think about 2020 and beyond?","Dave Petratis","I would say, our uses of cash has been pretty clear. We like the organic growth especially around the opportunity to seamless access in electronics. Second is M&A. We continue to work extremely hard on deals in what I call the mid-major area. And think about the future of how we can position Allegion stronger for electronics and capabilities that will help us realize this vision of seamless access.","And yes, you did see our announcement authorized by the Board to increase the dividend as well as a reload of the stock buyback. Our message is that, we want to make sure that our capital is put to work efficiently. And if that means returning it to shareholders we pull that lever as well.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you for that. And then maybe just a question around you mentioned some channel investments there just don't know if you can be any more specific if that's on kind of the specification side of the channel, e-commerce, big box kind of what we should be thinking around kind of the channel investments you highlighted earlier?","Dave Petratis","You hit one of them. We continue our specification is one of the strength. Overture would be an investment to help -- give new tools to customers and our spec writer. And then relationship's important there, feet on the street that can help us grow and optimize that tool.","Second multi-family, we continue to see a strong market there that we've historically been underpenetrated. And like our electronic offering to be able to grow in that market we put some investments back in res because we see that market responding would be examples of how we're segmenting the market and investing.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you. Appreciate the color.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks.","Mike Wagnes","We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call and have a great day.","Operator","This conference has now concluded."],"1378":["Allegion PLC (NYSE:ALLE) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call February 18, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Tom Martineau - Director, IR","Dave Petratis - Chairman, President and CEO","Patrick Shannon - SVP and CFO","Analysts","Charles Clark - Credit Suisse","Steven Winoker - Sanford C.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Martineau, Director, Investor Relations. Please begin.","Tom Martineau","Thank you, Latoya. Good morning, welcome and thank for joining us for the fourth quarter 2014 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to you in today\u2019s call are available on our Web site at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our Web site.","Please go to Slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Our release and today\u2019s commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude restructuring and spin expenses. Also included in these adjustments are the impacts related to a movement in measuring results in Venezuela from the official exchange rate of VEF6.3 per U.S. dollar to using the Venezuelan governments SICAD II exchange rate of VEF50 per U.S. dollar. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the quarterly information in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation for further details.","Also in the fourth quarter of 2014 the Company changed its method of accounting so that all inventory is now based on first-in first-out method from the last-in first-out method. The financial statements for all periods have been revised for this change and recapped quarterly data has been provided in the appendix of today's presentation. The impact of this adjustment was favorable by 1.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impact to the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorable by 0.4 million. As a result our tax and inventory accounting are now on the same basis. And the Company achieves global consistency with one inventory accounting treatment.","Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Thanks Tom. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of organic growth, operating leverage and cash flow generation. Revenues were 573 million up 5.5% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 7.6% on an organic basis. The Americas region delivered strong organic growth of 8.4% with increases in all segments and the timing of large system integration projects drove organic growth of 17% in Asia-Pacific region.","Organic revenues were relatively flat in Europe reflecting ongoing market softness. Adjusted operating income of 106 million increased 9% versus last year and adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points for the company reflecting solid operating leverage on the incremental volume and improved pricing. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 increased 26.7% versus the prior year. Patrick will cover the details later. We're issuing our full year 2015 EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 an increase of 12% to 17% compared to adjusted 2014 EPS excluding Venezuela. The guidance reflect overall organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%.","Please go to Slide 4. Now that we've completed our first full year as a standalone public company I would like to take a moment to review our performance. First, it\u2019s hard to appreciate the amount of effort it takes to standup a company. We\u2019re truly fortunate to have a strong team at Allegion that embraces the change necessary, while ensuring we met our customer and shareholder commitments. And although you don\u2019t see it as a metric on the slide, one of our core values is to be safe and healthy, which we focus on every single day of the year. We finished 2014 with a loss time incident rate of less than 1%, 26 locations with zero loss time days, 13 sites celebrated a million hour milestone without loss time incident and in our Bogota facility there was an 81% reduction in the number of injuries, resulting in zero life loss time days in our first full year of ownership. Allegion is one of the safest companies in the world, I\u2019m extremely proud of this. It\u2019s a true north metric of Allegion\u2019s mass manufacturing excellence and the commitment to safety.","Last year at this time I shared with you the 2014 financial goals of the company. We delivered revenue in the expected range, with some incremental volume covering lower than expected price. I\u2019m pleased with the top-line performance of the business, given the challenging market environments and currency headwinds. Adjusted earnings per share came in at the high-end of our range and taking into account the realization of our lower effective tax rate, we exceeded the high-end of our original guidance by $0.09. Spin and restructuring expenses were within expected ranges and we over delivered on available cash flow. It was a solid first year for Allegion and I believe we are positioned well for 2015 and the long-term growth to deliver high shareholder returns.","Please go to Slide 5. Globally we hit the ground running in 2014 to secure large project customer wins for the Allegion portfolio. This slide reflects a sampling of some of the project wins in 2014. We continued to leverage our strong institutional knowledge with project wins in education and healthcare. We\u2019re proud to have outfitted both in elementary school and middle school in Shanghai, China with Schlage Locks as part of a safe campus initiative and to have our locks and accessories at the premier Stanford Medical Center in Fargo, North Dakota. It\u2019s exciting to also note that Allegion is pioneering safety and security for world traveling facilities like Levi\u2019s Stadium which is the new home of The San Francisco 49ers as well as notable hotels and office spaces alike.","Please go to Slide 6. Of course our project wins are also highly reliant on our ability to innovate and in 2014 it was a year of significant innovation investment with Allegion\u2019s emphasis on electromechanical conversions, we launched both ENGAGE Technology and Schlage Touch. With ENGAGE Technology, we\u2019re changing the way commercial building owners and tenants think about the interior building access. ENGAGE is a connectivity platform that is easy to install, manage and use. Our Schlage NDE Series wireless locks with ENGAGE Technology can be installed in minutes with a screwdriver and allow users to manage electronic credentials with cloud-based Web and mobile apps. Schlage Touch was launched in October aligned with the keyless era we\u2019ve been pioneering for homeowners, given the ability to unlock their doors using a stylish touch-screen pin pad.","For residential we\u2019ve really emphasized not just the strength of our locks, but the style and design. In 2014, we expanded our style options to offer more choices to our customers. We\u2019re now offering more design in finished options that support both modern and traditional taste. Allegion also expanded style options for high-end non-residential and multi-family customers with the M Collection Series of levers for Schlage and Von Duprin.","In our non-residential mechanical product lines we created more specialized applications for our customers, this includes the Von Duprin AX device, which was the first and currently only UL-certified exit device to meet the new California building code five pound operating force requirement and the Von Duprin Quiet electric latch for medical facilities where both patient and caregivers value an environment free of excessive noise from traditional exit operations.","Please go to Slide 7. As you probably seen Allegion the recently launched Schlage Sense in January 2015 as an integral part of Schlage\u2019s leadership position in the Internet-of-things as an innovate extension of the keyless era the residential lock comes with a mobile app that allows homeowners to manage it with their phones or with the locks\u2019 touch-screen pin pad. Specifically, it\u2019s designed to work with Apple\u2019s HomeKit technology providing advanced security with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the Schlage Sense lock and iPhone and iPad and iTouch. HomeKit also lets consumers control their Schlage Sense lock with their voice using theory.","The Schlage Sense system can manage up to 30 codes at the same time. Its app allows homeowners to create and delete access codes, check unlock status and view activity. Residents can also use the app to update settings and check battery life without connecting to an existing home automation system or pay a monthly subscription charge. Schlage Sense launched at the Consumer Electronics Show and had over 300 million impressions in one week. Major news outlets applauded the innovation, Wired named it one of the 11 hot products from the show, Fox News named it as one of their top-eight list of the most innovative products there and CNET praised the talk-to-unlock capability. With Schlage Sense we're continuing to generate positive coverage for Allegion and expect the product to be available for our customers later this year.","To help stay on the forefront of innovation and the growth of the Internet-of-things Allegion also recently made an equity investment in iDevices. iDevices like Schlage launched the next-generation connected home solution at the Consumer Electronics Show and our partnership will amplify the impact of Schlage Sense on the market. As part of the minority stake in the company Allegion and iDevices entered into a joint technology agreement. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update our full year 2015 guidance.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Please go to Slide Number 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue for both fourth quarter and full year. This is helpful as the impact of pricing in Venezuela and currency headwinds across the business brought quite a bit of noise in the results. If you focus on the organic growth we delivered 7.6% and 5.1% growth for the fourth quarter and full year respectively. Both include 2% of price increase associated with Venezuela, the stronger organic growth reflects improving markets and introduction of new products.","Pricing benefits have been mostly driven by Venezuela however we're seeing pricing improvement sequentially and expect to gain improved traction in the first half of 2015 particularly in our U.S. non-residential business. One another things to note is the currency line, we really started to see the impact of a weaker euro in the fourth quarter, adding the impacts of a softer Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB and Australian dollar and you will see a fourth quarter year-over-year impact of a negative 2.4%. Although the strong U.S. dollar will continue to create pressure on the bottom-line, it is important to remember that most of our costs were in the same region with our revenues, which mitigates some of the income pressure.","Please go to Slide Number 9. Reported net revenues for the quarter were 573.5 million as mentioned on the previous slide this reflects an increase of 5.5% versus the prior year up 7.6% on an organic basis inclusive of Venezuela pricing. We realized high single-digit growth in the Americas with growth in all segments of the market, U.S. commercial grew low single-digits and residential segments increased mid single-digits. Latin America was up significantly primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation.","EMEA revenues were down approximately 10% driven by currency headwind. Asia-Pacific revenues were up over 17% due to strong mechanical hardware and the timing of large system integration projects. Adjusted operating income of 106.6 million increased 9% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 18.6% reflects an increase of 60 basis points versus the prior year, it's favorable price, volume leverage and productivity more than offset increased investments and inflation. We're extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital.","Please go to Slide Number 10. This reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2013 reported EPS was $0.12 a share, adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.04 and $0.44 related to discrete tax items the 2013 reported EPS was $0.60. Operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as pricing, productivity and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 26.3% rose $0.07 per share improvement versus the prior year. Other net items added $0.04 primarily due to foreign exchange gains, offset by $0.01 of incremental interest expense.","Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities, for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.07 reduction, this results in adjusted fourth quarter 2014 EPS of $0.76 a share. Continuing on, we have a negative $0.39 per share reduction consisting of $0.08 of restructuring and spin related expenses, $0.09 for the Venezuelan devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, $0.19 for non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances and $0.03 for the extinguishment of capitalized debt cost related to the October amendment and extension of our senior credit facility. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the fourth quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.37.","Please go to Slide Number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were 390.8 million up 8.4% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 5.4% on an adjusted basis. Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage de Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada. Volumes improved in the non-residential segment by low single-digits led by the strength in mechanical and door businesses. U.S. residential growth in the mid single-digits was driven by strength in the builder and e-commerce segments. Revenues in Venezuela doubled year-over-year led primarily by price. Americas\u2019 adjusted operating income of 100 million was up 13.3% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new products and channel development.","Please go to Slide Number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were 103.5 million down 10.3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble which impacts Eastern European sales. Market driven weakness in hardware sales in France and Italy were mostly offset by strength in the Interflex and hospitality businesses. EMEA adjusted operating income of 11.6 million was down 13.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 11.2% down 40 basis points primarily due to unfavorable product and market mix. For the full year, adjusted operating profit has more than doubled delivering 210 basis points of improvement. When including the impact of the UK door divestiture, operating margins improved 280 basis points compared to the reported results in 2013. The Company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 with ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions and the elimination of unprofitable business.","Please go to Slide Number 13. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were 79.2 million up 17%. The revenue growth was driven by mid-teen system integration growth and high-teen mechanical hardware growth. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of 9.7 million was up 42.6% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 220 basis points due to incremental volume leverage and favorable margins from the FSH acquisition completed in Q2 2014.","Please go to Slide Number 14. Available cash flow for 2014 was 207.5 million a decrease of 1.6 million compared to the prior year. The reduction reflects higher capital expenditures of 31.3 million mostly offset by improved working capital. The incremental capital expenditures were associated with new product development, information systems and spin related projects. We continue to operate with a very effective working capital structure and realized a 15% improvement in our cash conversion cycle for the year. Full year available cash flow ended the year at 111% of net earnings from continuing operations exceeding our original goal of 100%.","Please go to Slide Number 15. By now the slide will be very familiar as it reflects our commitment to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with gross debt to adjusted-EBITDA of 2.9 well within a normalized target range of 2.75 to 3.25. We continue to fund incremental investments in organic growth for new product development, channel strategies and operational excellence to accelerate core market expansion. We believe these investments will enable the company to grow in an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market. We remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. Dave already mentioned the iDevices equity investment made earlier this month and we have additional opportunities that are deep in the pipeline process. Over the course of the past year the company has developed an acquisition strategy, built capability and developed an acquisition pipeline. We want to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available until we vet and conclude on all M&A opportunities.","Please go to Slide Number 16. Our full year 2014 effective tax rate was 28.6% and we're forecasting a full year 2015 effective rate of approximately 22% as a result of the tax strategies executed in 2014. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company where we can leverage to move cash efficiently through the business and achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings, as well as cash flow growth. We're still targeting our effective rate to be at or below 20% next year.","Please go to Slide Number 17. Before I hand things back to Dave, I want to speak about our Venezuela business and the impact of the devaluation. The recent drop in the price of oil has accelerated a deterioration of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the company concluded that the SICAD II exchange rate was the most appropriate rate to use at the end of the year. This decision had two immediate impacts. First we devalued the bolivar denominated monetary assets resulting in a pre-tax charge of 12.1 million or negative $0.09 per share. Second we took a non-cash before tax inventory impairment charge of 33.3 million or negative $0.19. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of goods sold and reflected the lower of cost and market valuation of the inventory held in Venezuela.","As a result of the change in exchange rates there will be significant ongoing translation impact related to the devaluation which will essentially eliminate the reported 2014 results associated with the Venezuela business. This month the Venezuelan government announced changes to an exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or SIMADI. The company is currently evaluating this announcement. Adoption to the SIMADI rate would result in additional charges to re-measure the net monetary assets and impair other assets.","I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full year 2015 guidance.","Dave Petratis","Thanks Patrick. Please go to Slide 18. As we look forward to 2015 we will continue to be faced with current fee volatility and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In the Americas we remain cautious but increasingly positive on the U.S. non-residential market recovery. We're still in the early days of a construction rebound and estimate that we are only 75% to 80% of the pre-recession peak. The recovery will continue at a much slower pace as compared to historic cycles as the economy navigates tight labor availability and modest improvements in public spending. This is especially true as it relates to the institutional segment which is approximately 60% of our non-residential revenue. As such we see the non-residential markets growing at low single-digits in 2015. The commercial new construction markets will continue to grow in low to mid single-digit with the institutional markets beginning to improve. The non-residential after market growth will approximate GDP growth and remain in a low single-digit range.","The U.S. residential markets will increase mid single-digit driven by both builder and big box segments as we continue our slow and steady recovery out of the recession. Single-family home construction which remains approximately 30% below historic average will continue its recovery, although we don't expect to see normal levels for a few more years. The multi-family segment will continue to remain strong. Consolidating the market outlooks we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 4% to 5%. Foreign exchange headwinds from Venezuela and Canada will be about 6 to 8 percentage points leaving us with a reported revenue growth of negative 2% to negative 3%.","Our outlook in Europe continues to remain subdued driven by weak GDP growth, political uncertainty and high debt. The Southern markets remain soft with relatively slow growth as monetary policy easing helps to support recovery. We project low growth in the non-residential construction markets in Germany and the UK, France and Italy will see slight improvements supported by renovation activity offsetting weak new construction and Eastern Europe growth will struggle given geo-political climates. All-in we project EMEA organic growth to be flat to negative 2%. Taking into account currency headwinds in the region, we expect recorded revenue of negative 9% to negative 11%.","The Asia-Pacific market to continued to show mid single-digit growth in both residential and non-residential segments, growth in China continues but at a slower rate than recent history. Australia and New Zealand will continue to improve, while North Asia will be flat driven by soft residential construction. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8%. Total revenue is estimated to be 5% to 7%. All-in, we are projecting organic growth of 3% to 4% for Allegion. Incorporating the currency headwinds, we expect total revenue of negative 3% to negative 4%.","Please go to Slide 19. Our 2015 earnings per share range is 2.65 to 2.75 an increase of 12% to 17% compared to 2014 adjusted results, excluding Venezuela. The earnings increase is primarily driven by operational improvements and tax rate charge partially offset by investments in the business, Venezuela devaluation and EMEA currency headwind and non-recurring exchange rate gains and other income. Investments will be predominantly focused on new products and channel of development to meet demands of the electromechanical conversion as well as driving solutions for the underserved repair and replacement market. The full year effective tax rate assumption of the guidance is approximately 22% and our outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. As mentioned previously, the guidance has assumed minimal contribution from Venezuela. And although we don\u2019t typically provide quarterly guidance, it\u2019s important to note that margins early in the year will be under some pressure on a year-over-year basis due to carryover expenditures which were not in place at the beginning of 2014 as well as new investments in 2015.","Please go to Slide 20. Let me finish by reiterating that I\u2019m pleased with our 2014 results. We made significant progress in our first year, we delivered solid organic revenue growth, we increased operating margins while investing for future growth, made significant progress on our tax planning strategies, established a foundation for ongoing margin improvement in Europe and continue to achieve a high level of cash conversion performance. We enter 2015 positioned well and we\u2019ll build on our results. We remain focused on our growth pillars, core market expansion, innovation, growth in emerging markets, enterprise excellence and opportunistic acquisitions. And I believe we have the right team in place that will drive long-term growth that will deliver value to shareholder.","Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Due to time constraints, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Clarke of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Charles Clarke","Yes just wondered if you could give a quick update on capital allocation. I think in the prepared remarks you guys have talked about some deals that you were close on, close to getting over the goal line with and then obviously no reduction in share account in the guidance. So if you can just give an update on the capital allocation that\u2019d be great?","Dave Petratis","Yes sure, so as we indicated basically three pillars in capital allocation, the first being organic growth opportunities and as you saw in the guidance, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business for things that we feel are aligned with our strategy obviously and it can accelerate our growth faster than the market. I feel pretty good about those particular opportunities and the fully vetted will provide a good return on capital going forward. As we look at the M&A front, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got a much broader acquisition pipeline certainly than we did a year ago. I feel very confident that you\u2019ll be seeing a step-up in activity here in the short-term, so we\u2019re still vetting a lot of opportunities. I would characterize the delta between say M&A and share distribution would be if we don\u2019t see opportunities to expand our business and product portfolio in M&A front, we would be looking at accelerating shareholder distribution, but right now that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to be doing. We will be offsetting our dilution associated with management compensation plans. The idea is not to hoard cash on the balance sheet, so to the extent we\u2019re not increasing our M&A activity, you\u2019d be seeing a further step-up in shareholder distributions.","Charles Clarke","And just as a question to the ending leverage, 2.9 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, does that adjusted EBITDA -- does that exclude Venezuela or kind of including the Venezuelan markdowns, the leverage would be a little bit higher?","Dave Petratis","Yes so that would be on a reported basis, so including Venezuela, so if you were to kind of take out Venezuela then the ratio would go up a little bit.","Charles Clarke","And then just maybe a housekeeping, you guys are targeting the 95% cash conversion this year versus just a target of 100. Is that due to some timing on payments or\u2026?","Dave Petratis","Yes predominantly, so if you look at this business over the last three years we've averaged ACF as a percentage of continuing operations earnings of around 110%. So I would look at 2015 as a unusual year, we've had some one-time tax payments that we need to make as a result of our tax restructuring activities that took place last year. One-off on a go forward basis 2016 forward, as you know this is a great company in terms of cash flow generation and we should be north of 100% on average going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Lot to cover here, the first one is on the actual price versus volume growth in the US within the Americas. Could you break that out a little bit more for us in terms of what you actually saw in the quarter?","Patrick Shannon","So again all inclusive if you look at including Venezuela good volume growth.","Steven Winoker","Just the U.S. Patrick.","Patrick Shannon","Just the U.S., bear with me for just a minute, so most of the organic growth there was volume very little price improvement. We were able to get some sequential pricing improvement and leverage from our non-res business from the price increase we put in October last year. Residential not much a price improvement but we did sequentially see some price improvement. So in summary the majority of the increase there was all volume related.","Steven Winoker","And given the other comments you made, is that low single-digit volume then for the U.S., or low single organic?","Patrick Shannon","Yes, low to mid collectively non-res and res, yes.","Steven Winoker","And then on EMEA, maybe talk a little bit more detail from Page 12 about the progress that Lucia is making there. It's a little hard to tell, given all the puts and takes that are going on, what is going on with the plan. I know you will give us more detail at the investor day, but I'm just trying to get a sense for where you really are in terms of that comment -- recovery plan accelerating productivity versus the mix impact that resulted in the lower margin?","Dave Petratis","Well I'll let Patrick give you the some of the financial metrics. But we're on a good track, we doubled the operating income '13 to '14, cost take out -- what we've been extremely aggressive on is prune that business, that was embedded and that pruning is helping us to drive improvement. Our long-term goal 10% OI as we exit the year still stands and move into '16. The end-markets remain difficult.","Patrick Shannon","Yes I would just add Steve ended the year kind of where we had anticipated maybe a little light when we started the year, we did get the 280 basis points improvement we had targeted beginning at around 300. The mix element a little pressure there as the Eastern European sales a little bit softer than what we'd like to see. Whereas Dave indicated still targeting the 10% number by 2016, as I look at 2015 you could assume kind of similar performance in terms of margin improvement year-over-year and a lot of that coming from some of the carryover activities that took place in a restructuring in 2014. Again we're going to take a rifle shot approach on pricing, specific to customers and markets. And then the ongoing productivity and cost containment I think will be primary drivers there.","Steven Winoker","And if I could to sneak one in back to that capital allocation point you made. Patrick, at the last investor day you talked about a willingness to stretch even up to four times leverage for, quote, the right deal or the right opportunities. Are you guys still feeling confident that you would be willing to go there, or is there a reason to be more conservative these days? How are you feeling?","Patrick Shannon","No, very confident to stretch it to four times for the right transaction would not hesitate given the strong cash flow generation of this business and the earnings obviously we'll be acquiring, so that wouldn't be an issue. When we give the range of debt to EBITDA there, I look at that more on a normalized basis it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be a little bit outside of the balance there, but over a long-term that\u2019s where we\u2019d like to be and how we manage the business.","Dave Petratis","And I can\u2019t reemphasize that again for the right opportunity with and right fit with the company, we will stretch.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","I guess not being able to see some of the specific margin parameters or CorpEx for 2015 some of this is a little backed into, but it looks like your incremental margin assumption in the Americans, ex-investment, ex-Venezuela, is pretty low, call it 30 or below by my math. Is there something else going on in that? It sounds like institutional is getting better, price uptake you expect to be better, and clearly you guys had good progress in 2014 on margin expansion even with investment. So I guess first is, is that math right? And then secondly, is there something I am missing in some of the mix dynamics in the \u201915 in the Americas?","Dave Petratis","Yes so the margin excluding Venezuela improvement year-over-year is higher than what you indicated, so we\u2019ll have to maybe take it offline and look at your assumptions in terms of the mix component and taking out Venezuela. And we should see incremental pricing improvement, we\u2019re in kind of still a low inflationary environment so there should be some incremental leverage there it would be added to that, volume improvement net of investment, so we should still see some continued improvement in the Americas margin there. And the same is true for the overall company as well as the other regions and businesses of the world.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then I guess as we get out of 2015 I appreciate you guys spiking out the investments and where those are focused. Of those three buckets that you broke down in the $0.15 to $0.20, what stays, what goes, what gets bigger, what gets smaller from here and among the new products, channel marketing and some of the more systems-oriented spending?","Dave Petratis","Yes so I would say as we look forward to 2016 and beyond sequentially the, incrementally the investments come down okay and the dollars will inherently stay, but incrementally the numbers will come down. So I would be looking at some incremental investment year-over-year, but not to the magnitude of $0.15 to $0.20.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And then just one last one more housekeeping, what are you guys targeting for corporate expense in 2015?","Dave Petratis","So we ended the year as you saw at 44 million, you should be thinking about an additional 10 million or so on top of the 44, so that would give you a quarterly run-rate around 13 million to 14 million. And let me just add the delta there the increase in 2015 versus 2014, 75% predominantly is investment related, IT systems associated with our ERP deployment and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in incremental tax expense to drive our tax rate lower for 2016 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","A couple of other things, just to clarify on the comment on price, it was a little unclear because you mentioned price and then you mentioned deflation. Are you actually talking an improvement in net price as is, or is that kind of a price cost comment you are making there because of some relief on the cost side?","Dave Petratis","So sorry about the confusion, but the comment was there should be a delta improvement price over material inflation.","Jeff Sprague","And that is driven mostly by materials deflation, though, I would take it?","Dave Petratis","Correct.","Jeff Sprague","And then the comment on non-resi pricing, that sounded like it was specifically targeted on pricing. Is there some particular area within U.S. non-res where you see price opportunity, or what is really going on there?","Dave Petratis","We got traction in Q4 on our pricing initiatives and we feel that that will carry into 2015.","Jeff Sprague","And on currency, are there hedge benefits that we should expect coming through below the line as a partial offset to some of the headline translation impact that we see? Or what, if anything, are you doing on hedging?","Dave Petratis","So we do hedge our cash flow exposures, all the known exposures. You\u2019ll see some favorability on what I call transaction exchange, but only minimal amounts. The majority of our cost and revenues are kind of in the region and so there is a natural hedge there, so we don\u2019t have a lot of exposure relative to transactional gains or losses.","Jeff Sprague","And then just finally on the growth spending is there a figure you have in mind or something you could guide us to think about impact on the top line from actions you started taking in \u201914 and now ramping up in \u201915? Is there a discernible impact on your organic growth in \u201915 from these actions and how would you expect that to play out going forward?","Dave Petratis","I would like to maybe reserve that for midyear. We made significant investments in '14 the NDX would be a good example of that, those are going on the shelf of our wholesalers and I would like to see the actual pull through. I would say new products should help us grow as those get into the market on both the residential and non-residential. Second is a longer term investment is in our channel development and this is where we think in the light commercial repair and replacement that we\u2019re getting less than our share, so I am investing and we should be able to see traction as we move through 2015.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","David, you talked about aggressively pruning bad businesses in Europe. I wonder if you could just go back and maybe dig in a little further there for us and give us a sense of what you have still on the books there that would be unprofitable business. What would that represent in terms of revenues and what would be the loss or the burden to the P&L right now?","Dave Petratis","So if we said our mechanical side is 300 million it\u2019s 5% to 10% of that top-line.","David MacGregor","And can you give us a sense of what it means at the operating line?","Dave Petratis","So, first of all when we made the comment pruning bad business, it's not surely a business it's sale through to particular distributors or customers and that type of thing. So it\u2019s normally at a margin lower than what we realized for the full year this year, so call it basically a breakeven type of scenario. And would be baked in to our plan to get 10%, some of those are OEM commitments that you just don\u2019t get out of overnight.","David MacGregor","And then I guess on the U.S. business you talk about organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. You talk about slow and steady improvement in the US non-res construction business. In your 2015 guidance what are you assuming for non-res remodel growth? I wonder if you could just remind us again what the mix percentages are for new versus remodel in your non-res business.","Dave Petratis","So we define the new construction in the commercial as where square footage is added. And so we think of that R&R it's 50% 55% of our top-line. As we think about that growth we see activity picking up over the next three years in that institutional new construction phase that will help us, but specifics in terms of that elements of growth don't have it at the top of my mind.","David MacGregor","And then just a big picture question, I guess you have talked in the past about trying to grow your spec writing capacity. I guess I just wanted to check in with you and see if you are where you need to be at this point or where you may still have some work to do?","Dave Petratis","We're strengthening our spec writing capability with tools that we believe that we're the leader in the market in terms of spec writing, so generally pretty comfortable with that. I think some of our competitors potentially are envious of our position, but our investments along that line are more in configuration tools that help us to be more efficient at serving that construction market.","David MacGregor","Are there still feet on the street that you need to add, or are you satisfied with where you are there?","Dave Petratis","We're satisfied our investments will be in the management of the channel, making sure that our through stock businesses in the local markets are meeting the expectations of a market leader.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Jeff Kessler","With regard to the partnership with iDevices, we actually spent a long time with them at CES. Given iDevices close tie to Apple and home automation, what type of lock and non-lock wireless solutions could we expect from Allegion from this during 2015-2016? You don't have to give me the exact product, obviously, but the types of things you are going to be doing?","Dave Petratis","Number one our Schlage Sense that will come out later in the year, well positioned to line up and serve that market. A couple of things as we thought about iDevices they've got some history working with Apple, we think we can learn from that. We think they can also benefit from some of our supply expertise. And then collaboratively sharing technology in this Internet-of-things if you would have noticed Jeff iDevices are coming out with some electrical switching, and it's indicative of this collaborative capability that we think is important to our core lock business.","I think the other thing that you may have picked up at the Consumer Electronics Show was our partnering with Honeywell, Chamberlain, iDevices and others, we really believe that our products have to operate in a community of technologies and it will help us refine those roadmaps.","Jeff Kessler","With regard to your development of your channel, you have been talking about a bifurcated area here. One, that you are trying to build or wait for pent-up demand coming out of the institutional market where you have been negotiating deals for some time now. Number two, developing a channel -- better channel capacity for the small business area. Can you talk about number one, because these are both areas where you have been under capacity in terms of number one, revenues in the institutional area? How are you developing the channel to pull that through? And number two, on the small business area, how are you developing the channel to pull that through?","Dave Petratis","So and what we call the light commercial R&R we size that market let\u2019s say $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and we believe we\u2019ve got a high single-digit market share and compare that to the presence that we have on new construction. It\u2019s apparent to us that we have to develop stronger channel policies, inventory requirement in the local market and work with our channel partners to get more of that through stock business to compliment what\u2019s already going through on a new construction basis. I like to think about it as we\u2019re flexing our muscle we should be getting more of that through stock in places like Miami or the Washington DC area. We\u2019re putting in the systems and processes to be able to get our share of that market which we think is naturally ours.","Jeff Kessler","Does that also include working with distributors?","Dave Petratis","Yes sir.","Jeff Kessler","Okay.","Dave Petratis","And potentially changing our lineup of distributors, I feel one of the strengths of Allegion when we win a major hospital job and we run that through wholesale distribution that allows us to require the stocking of inventory performance on small project jobs that will help us grow.","Jeff Kessler","And also just to follow-up on that, my institutional question?","Dave Petratis","Yes please. I may restate your institutional question please.","Jeff Kessler","The institutional question, again just similar question in that there has been some pent-up demand in institutional business. It hasn't come through yet. You've been talking about negotiation now for probably about six months. Are we at a point now at which you are more positive for 2015 or 2016? Obviously the turnaround time on these negotiations are quite long, but that is out there and the question is how far do you think you are into that process?","Dave Petratis","I\u2019m more positive on the improvement in institutional spending as we move into \u201915 and \u201916 and we\u2019ll talk about that at our Investor Day.","Operator","Thank you. And the next last question is from Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is open.","Jeremie Capron","I wanted to go back to earlier questions on pricing. Could you talk about what you are seeing in the marketplace at this point and what are your expectations in 2015 in terms of potential price gains?","Dave Petratis","So we had price increase announcements in the second half specifically around our commercial businesses in the Americas we felt we picked up traction in specifically late Q3 and Q4 and those will carry in. We still feel that it\u2019s a positive price environment it\u2019s going to be 1%-2% as we move through 2015. We think Europe will be difficult.","Jeremie Capron","So within your overall 3% to 4% organic growth guide for 2015 you have more than one point of price gains in there?","Dave Petratis","No, it\u2019s a little bit under 1% if you look at it across the globe, Americas specifically which is the lion share obviously a little bit under 1%.","Jeremie Capron","And on the material cost side of things, metal prices are obviously coming down. Can you talk about what you are seeing and how you expect commodity prices to affect your cost base in 2015?","Dave Petratis","Yes so if you look at our commodities the important ones would be steel, brass, zinc and aluminum. Steel you kind of look at the spot rate today relative to the average in 2014 I think very consistent. Brass which is a big spend for us is down so that would be beneficial, aluminum and zinc flat to little bit up. So collectively right now on basis of the spot rates, I would say kind of the same as 2014. We do hedge commodities in terms of supplier lock contracts, so it\u2019s not a financial hedge or instrument, so any further decrease in the spot rates would kind of come into our results over an extended period of time.","Jeremie Capron","And maybe lastly on CapEx and R&D spend, obviously a significant step up in 2014 compared to previous years. What should we expect in 2015 in terms of CapEx intensity, I know you are running at about was it 2% to 2.5% of sales. Are we seeing more increases going forward and then similarly if you could comment around R&D dollar spend?","Dave Petratis","So on the CapEx side you are right there was a big step up in 2015, 10 million of that 50 million in total spend, related to spin-related projects IT specific on a more normalized basis we're looking at 40 million per year which is our plan for 2015. And that would include IT spend associated with our ERP system, maintenance and NPD kind of programs, productivity et cetera. So I look at capital 40 million kind of a normalized level. One thing to keep in mind is this business and we get a recovery in the non-res area, we do not have significant capacity constraints that would require additional incremental capital expenditure. So feel pretty good that we can manage it at 40 million. In terms of R&D we stepped it up in '14, we're generally holding at that level into '15. If we see the opportunities are out there we'll invest but we'll inform you of that.","Jeff Kessler","What about the effective tax rate? It looks like we are looking at a lower effective tax rate in 2015 than what you guys had in mind just a few months ago? Where do you think we ultimately settle say in 2016 or 2017?","Dave Petratis","So I think aspirationally we've said aspirationally less than 20, if you go back 15 months ago I have got to reemphasize we didn\u2019t have a tax department. We've invested here and aggressively it's part of our corporate cost step up and it's delivered a good return. But we think long-term high-teens aspirationally could be possible.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Tom for closing remarks.","Tom Martineau","Yes, and we just want to say thank you and appreciate everybody joining today's call and have a very safe day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"1534":["Allegion Plc (NYSE:ALLE) Q1 2018 Earnings Call April 26, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Patrick S.

MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Allegion Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I now would like to turn the conference over to Michael Wagnes, Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2018 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide number 4. And I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in the morning's press release, Allegion got off to a solid start in 2018, delivering double-digit top line growth and earning per share expansion. For the first quarter, revenue was $613 million, an increase of 11.7%, reflecting organic growth of 3.3%. Benefits from acquisitions and foreign currency tailwinds contributed to the top line growth.","All regions grew organically. Americas saw organic growth of 2.7% in the quarter against the tough comparable, supported by solid price and high-teens growth in electronics. The Americas business continues to see strong end-market fundamentals, although labor availability continues to impact the timing of the completion of projects and thus causes some choppiness in the timing of orders and shipments. This results in a healthy construction backlog, which we see across the U.S. According to the Associated Builders and Contractors Incorporated, backlogs in the construction channel are at highs for the decade, which we believe leads to a longer cycle.","The EMEIA region continues its rebound and delivered robust organic growth of 5.9%, driven by favorability across most products and geographies. Asia-Pacific organic growth was essentially flat, growing 0.2%. Adjusted operating income of $104.2 million increased 2.8% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 150 basis points due to inflationary pressure, incremental investments and expected margin dilution related to our recent acquisitions completed in Q1 2018. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 increased $0.07 or 9.6% versus the prior year. Additionally, we are reaffirming our full-year revenue, EPS and available cash flow outlook.","Please go to slide 5. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to take a moment to talk about an issue that has surfaced far too often over the past couple of decades, and that is school security. The voice of Allegion's customers continue to be a source of innovation for our teams across the globe. In response to a market need for improved K-12 perimeter security, Von Duprin announced the launch of its new remote locking and monitoring product innovation in February.","At ISC West earlier this month, we were honored with the Judges' Choice award for these solutions during the 2018 Security Industry Association New Product Showcase. These latest Von Duprin solutions were designed to enhance perimeter security in K-12 facilities by enabling remote daily lockup, centralized emergency lockdown, and door status monitoring.","They are retrofit solutions that expand a school's reach of the electronic access control system to secondary openings that would traditionally go unaddressed because of the cost and complexity of running wires. Without electronic access control, these openings may be left unlocked or propped open, compromising its security and limiting the school's ability to effectively lock down the facility in response to an emergency.","We know America's 100,000 K-12 public schools are on average more than 40 years old, many haven't been supplied with the mechanical and technological advancements created to better protect students, teachers and administration. Allegion is working with industry organizations, law enforcement officials, educators, parents and others to drive recognition of school security infrastructure needs among government officials at the state and federal level.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2018 outlook.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning.","If you would, please go to slide number 6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 3.3% organic growth in the first quarter. The modest organic growth reflects strong performance in the EMEIA region across most product and geographic segments, with more modest growth in the Americas due to a tough year-over-year comparable.","Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices and inflation across the supply chain.","As a response to the rising commodities (sic) [commodity prices] and inflation, we have accelerated pricing actions in the Americas with a recently announced price increase to take effect in July. With this action, we still anticipate price plus productivity to more than offset inflation for the year. In addition, we are taking other necessary cost containment actions to mitigate the impact of the inflationary headwinds.","During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 4.7% growth and foreign currency was a tailwind, particularly in the EMEIA region. Overall, our recently completed acquisitions from the first quarter of 2018 are performing extremely well. They're delivering good top line performance with strong margins and are immediately accretive to adjusted earnings per share.","Please go to slide number 7. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $613.1 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 11.7% versus the prior year, up 3.3% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $104.2 million increased 2.8% over the same timeframe from last year.","The adjusted operating margin of 17% decreased 150 basis points. The margin decline was driven primarily by inflationary pressures which exceeded price plus productivity. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, along with unfavorable product and geographic mix. And while our recent acquisitions are dilutive to Allegion margins, as previously anticipated, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share.","Please go to slide number 8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2017, reported EPS was $0.71. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2017 adjusted EPS was $0.73.","The combination of interest expense, other income and non-controlling interest increased EPS by $0.04, driven primarily by the reduced interest expense resulting from the company's debt refinancing that took place at the end of the prior year. Operational results increased EPS by $0.03 as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts.","The EPS increase related to acquisitions and a reduced effective tax rate, which were $0.02 and $0.01 respectively, offset the impact of incremental investments which were a $0.03 reduction. The incremental investments relate to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development, as well as channel strategies. This results in adjusted first quarter 2018 EPS of $0.80 per share, an increase of $0.07 or approximately 10% compared to the prior year.","Continuing on, we have a $0.05 per share reduction for acquisition-related and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at first quarter 2018 reported EPS of $0.75.","Please go to slide number 9. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $439.1 million, up 7.7% on a reported basis and 2.7% organic growth. The organic growth was driven by volume and price as we experienced another strong quarter for electromechanical products, which grew high-teens. The acquisitions of TGP and AD Systems drove 4.7% growth to total reported revenue. The Americas residential business saw mid-single digit growth; and non-residential products, excluding acquisitions, experienced low-single digit growth.","Americas' adjusted operating income of $113.5 million increased 4.1% versus the prior-year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 90 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by the dilutive nature of Allegion's recent acquisitions, which was anticipated. Unfavorable product and business mix also contributed to the margin decline. The incremental investment headwind was offset with positive price and productivity in excess of inflation.","Please go to slide number 10. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $150.3 million, up 26.9% and up 5.9% on an organic basis. The strong organic growth was driven by favorability across most geographies and businesses, with particular strength in the portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The reported revenue increase was boosted by currency tailwinds, along with contributions from the recently acquired QMI business.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $9 million increased 12.5% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 80 basis points, with incremental investment headwinds and commodity inflationary pressures driving a majority of the decrease. Also having an impact were inefficiencies and inflationary pressures related to a strike at our manufacturing location in Turkey. These margin pressures were slightly offset by favorable leverage on incremental volume during the quarter.","Please go to slide number 11. First quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $23.7 million, up 3.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 0.2%, with the flat organic growth driven primarily by project timing. Total revenue was supported by favorable foreign currency impacts. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $1 million, with adjusted operating margins down 680 basis points versus the prior-year period. Unfavorable product and geographic mix, inflationary pressures and incremental investments drove the reduction in income and margin.","Please go to slide number 12. Available cash flow for the first quarter was negative $18.8 million, which is an improvement of nearly $30 million compared to the prior-year period. The improvement is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment in Q1 2017, along with higher net earnings in 2018, partially offset by increased working capital and expected higher cash taxes.","Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in the first quarter 2018 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and will continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate turnover in order to minimize investments in working capital.","Lastly, we are affirming our full-year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million.","I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on the full-year 2018 outlook.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. As noted on the slide, we're affirming the 2018 outlook given during our previous earnings call. We are holding the total revenue outlook for growth at 10.5% to 11.5%, with organic growth at 4% to 5%. Our view of end markets remains favorable across the globe.","If we look closer at the Americas business, end-market fundamentals remain solid as we continue to see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and expect momentum in single-family construction to continue to support solid residential markets. However, due to the ongoing constraint across the construction supply chain, including labor, the industry is still experiencing delays in overall project construction, which has an impact on the timing of our revenue and causes choppiness from quarter-to-quarter. Construction backlogs continue to be at record highs.","European markets continue to rebound nicely and are being bolstered by general macroeconomic conditions such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment that remain favorable to markets. The GDPs in all key economies are growing and total revenue growth continues to be assisted by FX tailwinds.","In the Asia-Pacific region, timing of projects can cause large impacts on growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. Indicators we see in the Asia-Pacific region have not changed from prior outlook. Similar to Europe, FX tailwinds continue to contribute to overall revenue growth.","We expect inflationary pressures to continue throughout the year. As such, we have taken actions to mitigate the impacts of inflation and have announced price increases for significant portions of the product portfolio. With these actions, we expect the combination of price-productivity inflation to be a net positive for the year, however, not as much of a tailwind as in the prior year.","We are affirming our reported earnings per share outlook of $4.20 to $4.35 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% to 14%. As Patrick just stated, we're also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. Included in the outlook is an assumption of the full-year tax rate to be approximately 16% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million.","Please go to slide 14. As a summary, total revenue grew nearly 12%, organic revenue grew just over 3%, acquisitions contributed $26 million in revenue for the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were down 150 basis points, primarily driven by inflationary pressures. However, pricing actions are in place to mitigate. Adjusted EPS saw nearly 10% growth in the quarter.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around, you mentioned a couple of times that price and productivity, in excess of inflation, should be a tailwind for the year as a whole, but less than that, sort of 120 bps boost you had last year. Maybe explain a little bit how quickly it turns around. It was minus 50 bps in the first quarter. Do we think it's sort of a slight negative in Q2 and then positive by Q4, that kind of trajectory? Or how quickly do you think it reverses?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So you've got the numbers right relative to the spread. Price-productivity offsetting inflation a little under water this quarter, which sequentially down. And inflationary got out in front of us a little bit more than anticipated, particularly with the rise in the commodity prices.","But as we look forward for the balance of the year, as we indicated, full year would expect to be in positive territory. I actually anticipate a big recovery in Q2 relative to Q1, and hopefully be flat to maybe slightly negative would be the expectation, and then that turning more positive as we look in the second half of the year, particularly with the recently announced price increase in Americas, which should drive a big component of that going forward.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And then my follow-up question would be around the non-residential revenue growth in the Americas region. That was only up I think sort of low-single-digit, but you had the double-digit comp a year ago. Do we anticipate that that Americas non-res piece accelerates in Q2, or it's just too early to tell because of those labor shortages in the construction industry you mentioned?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think if you look at our business historically, Q2, Q3 accelerates; certainly see nothing to change that. We see markets and lead indicators like our hollow metal sales as a strong lead indicator for that revenue to come.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Could you kind of talk about some of the things that you had showcased over at ISC West most recently, the new technologies? And what do you anticipate the penetration is going to be of those new solutions that you most recently introduced?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So I think you're talking about the RU innovation of exit device that won the award?","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","That's right.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We think that product has great opportunity and it's partly driven by the need for connected K-12 security that can be activated from a central command. There's money flowing in for security for those overall markets. And I hope you have an appreciation of the installed base that we have in those markets today. We do extremely well in K-12 security in both public and private, and we think the desirability to be able to upgrade unprotected doors will drive nice growth in the exit device business. That's extremely profitable for us going forward.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","The follow-up on that would be is when do you anticipate the upgrade cycle is going to hit? So rather than just going out there and just selling to new customers or the ones where they have been thinking about security, but it wasn't a prime factor in their decision of being able to make things more automated a lot more easier. But from a historical customer perspective, when do you believe that upgrade cycle come about?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think we always see this upgrade cycle in Q2, Q3, but this will not be a spike as communities embrace the need for school security and our industry partners with them to propose better solutions. We think that's a growing opportunity for us over the next 5 to 10 years...","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","...complimented by aging infrastructure and the need for more intelligent systems. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Can you maybe talk about just margin expectations just given commodity cost headwinds that you're experiencing right now? Do you think you can grow margins across any of the geographic segments this year?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So I think a way to think about it is, we had highlighted on the last quarter conference call and kind of talked a little bit about full-year expectations. Keep in mind, with the recent acquisitions, although accretive to earnings per share really like what we're seeing there in terms of the growth in those businesses and strong performance, they are dilutive to our overall margin performance.","I would say the expectation would be, on an aggregate basis, margins to be kind of flattish for the full year, year-over-year. So that would imply with the dilutive nature of the acquisitions that base business slightly improving, given the volume leverage, the expectations on the organic growth, as well as slight improvement on the price\/productivity inflation equation.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, David. Maybe I wanted to follow-up one question on your comment around commercial backlogs being higher than they have been in the last 10 years. How does that then translate into the growth framework for the second half of this year and, even more importantly, into 2019? Does it give you a little bit more visibility from the longer-term perspective? How are you guys thinking about that?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So we're net positive on that. We think it snowplows, it pushes that recovery longer into the cycle. I think it puts a challenge on us to sharpen our game and partner with the projects that will go faster.","Second is, driving productivity through the entire value stream. We've introduced digital tools that help architects and our spec writers to drive productivity, and then how we can do more pre-factory install ahead of the job site to take labor off. So we think net positive. And as I have traveled the world, I've been on three continents since the start of the year, I've never been more robust about what I see in terms of construction activity.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's good to hear. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Dave, just a follow-up on that point. Makes sense what you're saying about labor, right? We can see it in the unemployment rate and shortage of truck drivers and things like that. But what maybe is a little peculiar is like we're not hearing it, for example, from like the HVAC guys and maybe some of the more skilled trades, for lack of a better term. Is the bottleneck like right at the end at the installation side of the equation, or is it kind of elsewhere in the project flow from a labor standpoint?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We actually do surveys of the value stream to try and get a sense. And whether its architects, wholesale distributors, contract distributors, locksmiths, if they had more labor capability prepared, they could grow their businesses; one.","Number two is, I see the numbers coming out of Lennox and Trane. I think I would put out the hypothesis that, during the downturn, those skills held better than some of the more general skills. I think some of that general labor went to other parts of the economy and to rebuild that back, I think, is a challenge. In particular, electricians, millwrights, ironworkers are in tight supply and it's a headwind that we'll face across construction going forward.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Makes sense. And can you just remind us how big your educational business is as a percent of the total company?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, Jeff, if you think of our non-res business, right, in the Americas, non-res is about 70% of Americas. And of that non-res business, about 60% is institutional markets. We don't disclose educational markets, but institutional is probably 60% of the non-res in the Americas.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I would just add. Next time you go on a college campus in a K-12 school, our position there is extremely strong.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. I know it is. I'll be looking for you on Villanova campus next month at graduation. How about that?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","And you know what, we're there.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Morning, Tim.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. So, maybe just sort of back on the labor question. Just as you kind of think about the projects converting today or maybe you call it a conversion cycle or quote to order or something, but what does that kind of timeline look like today versus what you might consider normal? Is it a couple months, is it six months, is it a year? Just trying to kind of think about how some of the projects are kind of being pushed out and the timing around it.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think you've got to go to those reports out of Associated Construction. You see about a three to four-month swell. What I'd say normal backlog, let's say five months to six months is now 10 months. That's how I'd describe that.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then maybe just bigger picture. Within electronics growth, over the last kind of 12 to 18 months, have you seen any change in the balance or mix between the residential business and the commercial business within that electronics growth rate that you disclosed?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Resi is growing faster. It's because of some of the new entrants. I think when potential customers evaluate our products, I think we've got some excellent solutions out there. And the overall awareness, whether it's last mile, Amazon Key, millennials moving up, it's put upward momentum. We believe \u2013 if you went back to Analyst Day, we'd say the market 4% to 8% growth on resi and it's on the high side, and we're doing better than that.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Good luck on the rest of the year.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. On the mix of residential growing faster than non-res, that was some of the headwind in the quarter are the right takeaway?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. That's correct.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on institutional, Dave, can you just comment about what you're seeing on institutional projects? I know education got asked earlier. Just that tends to be I think a little bit higher margin for you. What's kind of the flow through? And is the labor constraints more relegated to that end market or how should we think about that?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I would characterize this Q2, Q3 are our best opportunity in institutional. The activity there is setting up to be solid for us. What we see, when I was up in the Northeast, is conversions to electronics and in our commercial institutional type products.","That segment of the market, you've got a window of time on a college campus or a K-12, and those contractors tend to be maybe at a higher level of sophistication than just a commercial building, and that's a general. But you've got to get that done in a tight timeframe and they tend to push those projects through. That gives us volume in Q2 and Q3.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","And I'll just add. With the anticipated improvement in those end markets, it is a favorable product mix for us because the suite of products is more Von Duprin, LCN, Schlage collectively together, and being the leading market provider here in the U.S., that's a good trend for us. I do have another...","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So is that growing faster?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is that growing faster than the other parts of non-res for you for this year? Is that the anticipation?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Essentially same across all verticals, maybe a little bit improvement relative to the prior year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Morning.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning. You referred to previous 2018 guide, which I appreciate, but I noticed you left out kind of the regional breakout slide from the deck. Any change in the composition of that guide by region?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, historically, we don't provide kind of the regional guide in terms of margin, that type of thing. The revenue guide, if that's what you're referring to, is the same in terms of what we gave last quarter and, collectively, organic growth of 4% to 5% across the board and that varies of course by region. But our revenue guide across the regions and in total has not changed from when we were together last quarter.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks for covering that. And then, secondly, just the price increases. Can you just talk about what percentage of the overall portfolio will be favorably influenced by these increases?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So we are looking at improving our price position across the globe. We have better ability to get higher pricing probably here in the Americas. So that being, say, 70% of our portfolio, it would apply predominantly to Americas. And we've been a little bit more aggressive there in terms of the price actions. As indicated, we've already announced to the field a price increase on non-residential products beginning July this year.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And I guess just how confident are you in your ability to take pricing in the residential space?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","It's our biggest headwind. We certainly got a big exposure at big box, and the opening price point part of that portfolio is under pressure. So it's a challenge there. We're going to work hard to try and get some price realization there.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Rob.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just wanted to understand a little bit better what was going on with the margin dynamic in EMEIA. I mean, you were able to offset inflation in Americas, but not in EMEIA. Curious about the impact since the Turkey strike, is that's still ongoing or is that done? And just in general, I mean do you still think you can grow the margins there this year. I think it was a 50 to a 100 basis point expectation?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So the strike in Turkey has been completed. So we've reached conclusion and agreement. The impact there, there was a retrospective adjustment and an ongoing impact, if you will. And so, we had the flow through of the retrospective adjustment on margins. If you were to kind of pro forma that out, you'd have margins pretty much equal to maybe slightly better than the prior year.","So, going forward, we still believe we can see some margins to be slightly up year-over-year. I like what we're seeing in the business, particularly in the volume growth. Electronics business is growing extremely well. And so, we like what we're seeing there from a top line perspective and would expect for the full year, as we had indicated at the beginning of the year, for margins to be slightly up even with this impact of the strike that we incurred in this quarter.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got it, got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I wanted to just touch on what you said in answer to the earlier question on the pricing, especially in the U.S. with the big box partners. I mean, I know those conversations are never easy, but just given the inflation is so apparent now, I mean is it just more of a given that there will need to be pricing and are you getting that?","And in particular, if you could also just touch on, you mentioned pricing pressure in the opening price point. That's spilling over also into where you'd play, I think you're more in the middle and higher end. Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So there's never been a better opportunity to go have those tough discussions with big box. It's hand-to-hand combat. But the table is set. Inflationary forces at work. It's good for them, it's good for us.","Our portfolio is not well-positioned in retail around opening price point. We certainly have offerings, but our electronics \u2013 our Schlage Champagne brand products are the replacement product of choice, and we position there consciously. And customers today are choosing that opening price point more than we would like. When those products fail, we like the replacement part of it, but it's one of the challenges we have with the portfolio.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And maybe pulling some volume out of the base price point, if that's...","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Correct.","Robert D. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. At the recent ISC West Conference, congratulations, you guys win a fairly big prize for what could be in my opinion a very high volume type of a door closer. And I'm wondering if you could comment on your ability to take essentially what was a mechanical product, put some electronics into it, and have a product that could still be mass produced for a lot of different types of institutions.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So a couple things I like about that product, Jeff, is it's got several patents that I think are unique to the industry and that product. Number two, I think you're aware of the large installed base that we've got. In an environment where there's a need and demand for better school security and connectivity, we think that products got outstanding opportunities. I was at our Von Duprin factory yesterday and extremely confident in our ability to produce a high-quality product that we're known for and meet the demands of the marketplace.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","How fast can you get that into the market?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","It's really as we roll forward, this next couple of quarters important. We have a unique relationship through our field offices and our service partners to work with those schools and I think it will move through very quickly.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. And finally, just as a quick comment, I was on the ASSA ABLOY call this morning and they talked about the Americas being the single most, the big pain point for both commodity inflation and trying to work with customers to try to get the pricing back up. They said there was a lot of resistance at the beginning. They are beginning to get it now. So I would assume that the same thing it begins to apply to you folks.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","I think we are in a better position as a price leader here. I think we've always worked extremely hard to get the value that our specification and products demand. You certainly see a bit of a headwind in this quarter for us, but it's more \u2013 anytime you slam tariffs down, our suppliers certainly take that opportunity. Demand is high, but I like our position to be able to get the price that we deserve in the marketplace, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the call to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","We'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's call.

Mr. Wagnes, please go ahead.","Mike Wagnes","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call.","On the call today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today\u2019s call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to Slide number 2 and 3. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Today\u2019s presentation and commentary include non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will now discuss our second quarter 2019 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted.","Please go to Slide 4, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We had modest top line revenue growth in the second quarter, and we saw strength in our Americas nonresidential business. Our residential business in the Americas was flat driven by challenging new construction markets. We also experienced currency pressures in our European and Asian businesses. Although our Americas business growth was lower sequentially in the second quarter, overall growth in the first half of the year was strong at 5.7%.","As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to see healthy end markets in our nonresidential business, particularly in institutional verticals. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of these healthy markets in the second half of 2019.","We also expect that residential markets should start to improve versus what we have seen in the first half of the year. Americas electronics growth was approximately 9% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than our historical growth rates. Our electronic growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected ramp-up in the new residential construction market and focused channel actions that we started in Q1 to drive more consistency and better alignment with our existing partners.","We believe that with these efforts now complete, we are positioned nicely and expect to accelerate electronics growth during the remainder of the year. This is further supported by the healthy demand for the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock, renewed efforts with existing partners and the benefit of new partners including Lennar.","Allegion\u2019s combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market as it continues to evolve and grow.","Moving now the Slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the inflationary pressures we experienced. I\u2019m pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase again this quarter.","During the quarter, the company closed its production facility in Turkey. Some products formerly produced at this site for brands in the EMEIA region are in the process of being transferred to other manufacturing locations in Europe. We continuously look for ways to improve Allegion\u2019s supply chain. This action will help us to streamline our operational footprint in Europe, which is necessary to maintain sustainable and profitable long-term growth in the region. It\u2019s also a normal part of our enterprise excellence strategy focused on driving cost competitive positions in all elements of our supply chain.","In the second quarter, we delivered a slight increase in adjusted EPS driven primarily from operations, which was offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. We\u2019re updating the full year revenue outlook. We are now projecting total and organic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. I\u2019ll speak to the individual regions later in the presentation.","Lastly, we are lowering the outlook for reported EPS to a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share down from $4.60 to $4.75 reflecting the impact of the exiting of the Turkey operations. We are also tightening the range and raising the midpoint for 2019 adjusted EPS outlook from a range of $4.75 to $4.90 per share to a revised outlook of $4.80 to $4.90 per share.","Please go to Slide 5, and I\u2019ll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. Revenue for the second quarter was $731.2 million, an increase of 3.8% inclusive of 3% organic growth. Acquisitions contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas organic growth came in at 3.3% in the quarter driven by strong price realization. The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth, and Asia-Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year.","Adjusted operating margin increased by 20 basis points, aided by price and productivity, which more than offset inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization and productivity savings to combat inflationary pressures.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, increased by $0.01 versus the prior year. As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance offset by unfavorable comparables in other income and the tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is down approximately $20 million. The decrease in cash is related to increased capital expenditures and increased working capital to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure.","Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, and we touched on it again in our first quarter call. We\u2019ve chosen to include it again this quarter to highlight our belief that the five strategic pillars that Allegion has laid out are the foundation of our future.","The pillars that guide Allegion are; expanding core markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. To be the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we\u2019re intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms to integrate well with others.","Delivering new value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster.","Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns.","Last, enterprise excellence. Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company\u2019s history from 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.","Please go to Slide 7. With this continued focus on Allegion\u2019s strategic pillars that support our vision and growth strategy, we are excited about the partnership opportunities for the Connected Home. To us, this means being recognized as experts with innovative products in open standards, ultimately allowing for seamless integration with best-in-class players. You might remember from our Investor Day event that we showcased a variety of our partners for the U.S. residential market, again highlighted on this slide. Our strong presence with retailers, e-commerce and home builders position us well in the Connected Home space.","Schlage Encode, our first ever Wi-Fi enabled Deadbolt is providing \u2013 is proving to be an essential part of our portfolio and working with our partners. Schlage Encode was launched in late Q1, works directly with the Key by Amazon app and Ring devices and is a market-leading part of the Schlage home experience. It will also be part of the Lennar standard home automation offering. Our work with these partners through innovations like Schlage Encode is a prime example of how we will increase electronic adoptions in the residential market space. In addition to accelerating electronic adoptions, strategic partnerships will continue to help drive our vision of seamless access in a safer world.","Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I\u2019ll be back to discuss the full year 2019 outlook.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. Please go to Slide 8. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I\u2019ll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 3% organic growth in the second quarter. Strong price realization of 2.2% drove the organic increase this quarter. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures moving forward. Also during the second quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 2% growth offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced in both the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.","Please go to Slide number 9. Reported net revenues for the second quarter were $731.2 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 3.8% versus the prior year, up 3% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $157.3 million, increased nearly 5% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% increased 20 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating income increase. Leverage on the incremental volume also contributed to the margin expansion. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 70 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions.","Please go to Slide number 10. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was $1.19. Adjusting $0.06 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost related to acquisitions, the Q2 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.25. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.01 increase as we executed nearly $70 million in share buyback in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest drove a $0.02 reduction, which is mostly impacted by favorable other income in 2018 that did not repeat.","The year-over-year increase in the tax rate had a $0.04 unfavorable impact primarily driven by the unfavorable mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. This resulted in adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.26, an increase of $0.01 compared to the prior year. Lastly, we had a $0.10 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring and acquisitions. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the second quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.16.","Please go to Slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $545.1 million, up 3.5% on a reported basis and 3.3% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong price realization of 2.5%. When compared to Q2 of last year, we experienced mid-single digit growth in the nonresidential business and residential was essentially flat. Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas region coming in at approximately 9%. On a year-to-date basis, the Americas has delivered total growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. Americas adjusted operating income of $162.4 million increased 4.2% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 20 basis points.","The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Additionally, leverage on the incremental volumes contributed to the increase. Inflationary pressures are expected to ease during the second half of 2019. Combined with our pipeline of the productivity actions, this should position us for increased margin expansion throughout the remainder of the year. Incremental investments were a 60 basis points decrease on operating margins.","Please go to Slide number 12. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.2 million, down 3.8% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven primarily by pricing and favorable volume in our portable security, SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weakness in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. As Dave mentioned earlier on the call, during the quarter we closed our manufacturing operations in Turkey. There was minimal impact to revenue and adjusted operating income in the quarter.","Dave will discuss the full year impacts related to this closure when he discusses the outlook later in the call. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.4 million decreased 5.8% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 20 basis points. Excluding currency impacts, the region would have seen a 10 basis point increase in margins driven by price and productivity exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 60 basis point headwind to operating margin.","Please go to Slide number 13. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $43.9 million, up 45.8% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 4.7%. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 47%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 6%. Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1 million with adjusted operating margins improving 140 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity and inflation dynamic was positive in the region. Incremental investments were a 140 basis point decline on adjusted operating margins. We are pleased with the continued progress in the Asia Pacific region as the strategy and restructuring initiatives begin to drive operational improvements.","Please go to Slide number 14. Year-to-date available cash flow for the second quarter 2019 was $77.7 million, which is a decrease of $20.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by increased capital spending and higher working capital requirements to build inventory in advance of the Turkey plant closure. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the second quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher. We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are updating our full year available cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million. Reduction from the prior outlook is inclusive of the closure of operations in Turkey.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook.","Dave Petratis","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 15. As can be seen on the slide and was mentioned earlier, we are updating our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue is now at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will remain strong throughout 2019. In residential, we expect markets to improve versus what we experienced in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend.","For the European region, we expect continued strength in our electronic business led by SimonsVoss and Interflex. We expect this will more than offset weaknesses we are experiencing in Southern Europe leading to positive organic growth for the region. However, total revenue will be negatively impacted by currency headwinds.","In addition, we have reduced our revenue outlook for the EMEIA region to account for the impacts of our decision to exit operations in Turkey. In Asia Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand, particularly around residential end markets. The total revenue outlook reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which passed its one-year anniversary on June 30. We are also updating our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.80 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 7% to 9%.","As Patrick stated, we are updating our cash flow outlook to a range of $410 million to $430 million with the reduction from prior outlook inclusive of our closure of our Turkey operations. The outlook assumes no change in the previous \u2013 in previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately 16%.","We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately 94 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed during the first half of the year and including expected share repurchases for the back half of 2019. The closure of our Turkey operations is expected to have $0.14 to $0.17 impact on the reported EPS, some of which has been seen in Q2 and a $0.02 impact to adjusted EPS in the third quarter.","Please go to Slide 16. A brief summary of Allegion\u2019s Q2 performance. Total revenue grew 3.8% in the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. Organic revenue growth grew 3% in Q2 and 4.3% year-to-date. Adjusted operating margins were up 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was up slightly.","Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning, guys.","Dave Petratis","Hey, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","So Dave, just back on some of the channel strategies or some of the moves that you made in residential to punch up growth a little bit. And I guess, this is the question the follow-up wrapped up in one. What did that cost you in the quarter? How should we think about that as a driver of the acceleration in the back half? And what were those moves specifically?","Dave Petratis","So the channel plays that we addressed was really what I\u2019d call maintenance. As we have expanded rapidly especially through e-commerce, there was some clean-up that we needed to go do and \u2013 to protect ourselves on pricing. It clearly was reflected in our electronics growth, particularly residential in Q2. We think that\u2019s behind us. I\u2019d say in an overall backdrop, particularly in resi, we thought the channel would perform better in new construction. I think it\u2019s pretty widely seen that there were some challenges in new construction including we expected acceleration with Lennar. That\u2019s progressing, but those were the factors that we went in and worked, and we think it positions us nicely for the second half.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Any numbers that you can share around what you think that costs and what you think that adds going forward?","Dave Petratis","I think the numbers are out there in total. Don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of it. But the work is behind us and you\u2019ll see that performance improve in the second half.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Okay, thanks for the color.","Dave Petratis","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Good morning, all. Two questions for me. Looks like your second half margin assumptions are a little better than some of us are expecting. Can you provide some color on what the expectations are for price realization in the second half? Is that going to be at a 2% run rate for the full year? Also can you parse that out between resi pricing and the Q1 was positive, but demand continues to be flattish there. So how does that compare resi pricing versus nonresi pricing? And then I have a follow-up.","Patrick Shannon","Yes. So on the pricing front, as indicated in our comments, really strong price realization in Q2. And just remember relative to our pricing actions, you may recall last year, we implemented the price increase in beginning of July. This year, we pulled it forward to May. So in effect, you had the impact of two price increases for this quarter year-over-year. So that\u2019s why sequentially and for the quarter year-over-year, you had really strong price realization.","As we look forward to the second half, we still anticipate good price realization but sequentially will be down relative to what you saw in Q2. You\u2019re probably looking at an overall impact, we\u2019ll call it around 1.5% kind of going forward. As it relates to the nonresi, resi area in terms of pricing, most of the price realization is coming from nonresidential markets given the strength there and our ability to pass it on to offset inflationary headwinds.","So we will continue to see that. You may recall last year, we had some choppiness in the residential segment associated with pricing as related to rebates, promotions, those types of things. A lot of that is subsided, and I\u2019d say as anticipated kind of a flattish pricing environment as it relates to residential and to the extent, we can push, we will, but it\u2019s improvement on a net basis after taking into consideration some of those promos and rebates.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. So it looks like you\u2019re not necessarily concerned about nonresi at all even though some of the recent data points like ABI came in a little anemic. Just can you talk to the momentum there in nonresi here in the U.S., specifically institutional? Is that your backlog visibility to end of the year that gives you the confidence that your organic growth in the second half can actually pick up? Thank you.","Dave Petratis","Our backlog visibility is clear, in particular with the commercial institutional backlog. Remember those are long-cycle projects. And we feel very good about the book backlog that\u2019s on the business. I think the other thing that\u2019s important is long-term trends, particularly in the institutional markets, upgrades of schools, college campuses for higher security needs continue. Today, I\u2019ll speak to the Iowa Board of Trustees on campus security. It continues to be a trend. I think we continue to see positives in the hospital segments, and we like our backlog and opportunities going forward.","Patrick Shannon","I would just also add Deepa that some of the leading indicators that we look relative to our business is, well, it\u2019s kind of macro items. The order, bid quote activity, specification writing continues to be positive, trending upward. And so that\u2019s always a good indicator in terms of business down the road. Also from a macro perspective and you look at some of the things, for example, the number of on-referendums, particularly in institutional market continues to remain strong.","The construction backlog also is at a healthy level. Some of the things, the job openings in the construction markets continue to be very healthy. And so all these things would indicate that market demand continues to remain strong and as Dave indicated particularly in the institutional segment where we have obviously a strong market position and it\u2019s a richer mix of products in our business, which helps us on the margin profile as well.","Deepa Raghavan","Great, color. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. Good morning. May be just following up, I was particularly interested in what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial markets in Americas nonres. And maybe just help me understand a little bit more clearly what drove that slowdown in the nonres growth in Q2? Was it something that happened late in the quarter? Does it just go back to some of those labor shortages you talked about? Or have you seen some of your commercial customers may be pushing some orders or projects to the right because of macro factors rather than labor shortages?","Dave Petratis","I think if you look at just pure commercial construction, there continues to be a healthy environment. We obviously like the institutional college campuses more, but as I travel around the nations, you see commercial certainly at its maximum development and output. With that said, in the upper parts of the Midwest, it was extremely wet, that the ways construction activity, shortages of labor, I think, are rapid. We see labor tightness as high as it\u2019s ever been since 2008.","So we think those factors actually snowplough the length of job. We also see some tightness and extended lead time in door availability, which impact our ability to drive business through. But with that said, overall health of the commercial and institutional part of the market driven by spec, quote and backlog continues to be favorable for Allegion.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then just my second question maybe switching to the EMEIA region. Maybe help us understand a little bit of context around the Turkey plant closure. Understood that there were some specific macro and economic issues in that country over the last couple of years, in particular, the extent to which those played into the plant decision versus just an overall look at your EMEIA regional capacity and trying to get that capacity down maybe. And how happy you feel now post the Turkey plant shutdown regarding your EMEIA footprint?","Dave Petratis","So never happy with any of our footprints till it\u2019s fully optimized. So globally, we continue to work. I think, second, I\u2019d remind you that a lot of our acquisition activity has been in Europe. As we brought on new capacity, we felt the opportunity to optimize that was there. Turkey also from \u2013 on macro and political standpoint, a lot of pressure there. And at the end of the day, we thought that the best move from \u2013 to Allegion was to consolidate that and we\u2019ve executed that at a very good level. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of our teams to go and make that move. I think overall our view in Europe is to continue to optimize that footprint to continue to improve our profitability and ability to serve the customer in the region.","Julian Mitchell","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Dave Petratis","Good morning.","John Walsh","Maybe the follow-up first. Just wanted to better understand the electronics acceleration in the Americas you\u2019re talking about in the back half. Just looking at Q3, you obviously have a very difficult compare. Should we expect that to happen as early as the current quarter? Or is it more of a back half commentary about trends just given how it can be kind of lumpy?","Patrick Shannon","So you will see improved electronics growth sequentially relative to where we were in the first half of the year beginning in Q3. But given the tough comp in Q3 last year, more of it perhaps weighted in Q4. And a lot of that growth associated with some of our \u2013 what Dave talked about in terms of the channel activities that we have now completed, that\u2019s behind us. This new arrangement with Lennar will begin to continue to drive traction there and our Encode product continues to sell through extremely well. So we see continued growth in there.","So those three activities will boost the electronics growth, particularly in the residential side, and commercial still remains healthy. And we have a good backlog of activities and channel partners that will drive that going forward as well.","John Walsh","Great. And then you talked about the channel with e-commerce. How about Big Box? I mean it was a different product category, but we have heard destocking there. Anything to call out there that would have impacted residential in the quarter?","Dave Petratis","I would say the Big Box channel was sluggish, and we expect performance improvement in the second half. I think the Schlage Encode and our strength, Allegion through our Schlage brand and Big Box still have the highest-rated products available. Our partnerships with Ring, Apple, Amazon and those integrations, I think, make a great choice for consumers. And we expect to improve performance in the second half.","John Walsh","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","Tim Wojs","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Dave Petratis","Good morning.","Tim Wojs","So maybe just on Americas margin in the back half of the year, I think just kind of doing some math here, maybe we are looking at an acceleration in the margin improvement from up of 20 basis points in the first half to may be something like up 100 in the back half. And just kind of wondering how much of that do you expect to be driven by just kind of improving price cost? And how much of that should be driven by just core operating leverage?","Patrick Shannon","So those are the two primary components that will drive operating margin accretion in the second half. Feel really good about where we are as we look forward to those opportunities. The price, productivity, inflation dynamic will continue to improve there. So recall relative to the inflation we are getting to easier comps starting here in Q3 as it relates to commodity cost and then pricing and that type of thing.","And you may recall our methodology is try to hedge inflation in terms of \u2013 not financial hedges but contracts with suppliers. So we lock into prices on an outward to 12 months. And as inflation subsides, we see that perhaps later than other people might. So we\u2019re going to start reaping the benefits in the second half as it relates to the reduction in commodity costs. That can be a big driver. And then the continued volume leverage and the margin accretion associated with that is a big driver as well. And we had a couple of one-off type of things that are nonrecurring as well. So that collectively will serve to improve the operating margin performance.","And I\u2019d just say as a collective company for the full year and we communicated this at the beginning of the year, the objective is to get close to 100 basis points improvement for the full year, which gets us back to kind of like the 2017 levels and still feel like we have good visibility to that relative to the improvement in the price, productivity, inflation dynamic as well as the leverage on the incremental volume.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Great.","Dave Petratis","I would add Tim that we were pretty clear that we would create a faster dynamic in the second half. I was extremely pleased with how we drove the equation in the first half. And I think we\u2019re set up nicely with identifiable projects that will help us achieve our goal.","Tim Wojs","Great. Okay. And just in a more deflationary environment, I just want to make sure I\u2019m thinking about pricing the right way. You should be able to kind of in your \u2013 every year be able to get some modest price realization, but in an environment with lower raw material cost, that traction is probably towards the lower end of your historical range, right?","Patrick Shannon","So as you know, we have the ability to pass on price whether in an inflationary period or deflationary environment. We\u2019ve been fairly successful in doing that. And we\u2019ll continue to remain competitive and push that where we can. So this year for example, the gross price increase was lower than last year and last year being the higher inflation period. But on a normalized level, we should always get 1% to 1.5% of price increase across the business.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Okay, great. I will hop back. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks, Good morning, everyone.","Dave Petratis","Okay, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","So just thinking about the growth for the back half of the year again in the Americas. I think this past quarter, you guys did roughly, I think, less than 1% on the volume side and it seems like this needs to pick up, so call it 4%, 4.5% just to get to the low end of the guide. So how \u2013 outside of like what you expect to see as increased penetration on the electronics side, what you do think are the biggest drivers that\u2019s going to get you there and seeing the acceleration in 3Q and 4Q?","Dave Petratis","Yes. So let me take it by segments of the market maybe. So on the resi side, it\u2019s really a combination of couple of things, what we talked about previously on the electronics growth and all the activity there relative to the channel, Lennar, new products introduction as well as channel partnership that will help us drive volumes there. Secondly, on the res side, we see a pickup in the builder channel. Collectively that will help us in terms of push-up more volume. On the nonres side, it\u2019s continued strength in the end markets and the healthiness of that and the visibility we have relative to again the order activity specification, backlog, et cetera, I feel fairly positive relative to the volume expectations in the second half.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Okay. Got it. That makes sense. And I guess, maybe my follow-on there is our thinking about like just seasonality. Last year, things were roughly from an earnings standpoint in line 3Q versus 4Q, but seasonally things kind of shift year-to-year. How are you guys thinking about the composition or the cadence for the second half of the year, 3Q versus 4Q? Is there an expectation that one quarter will be much stronger than the other?","Patrick Shannon","We don\u2019t normally provide the quarterly guidance, but you should anticipate perhaps maybe a little bit higher Q4 and Q3.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeff Kessler","Could you go through some of the new products that you believe are going to \u2013 particularly on the electronics side that you think are going to boost growth in the second half, particularly those that are aimed at the institutional market where you seem to be the most optimistic?","Dave Petratis","So Encode on the res side would be what we lead with. Second, maybe not so much in terms of new products, but the partnerships that we\u2019re continuing delivery with Apple and seamless access on college campuses, you\u2019ve seen some of our wins. I think, Mercer college is a clear example. Second, work with Lennar. I think early on, we said that we would be open in our ability to go in and partner is providing wins in the marketplace. We\u2019ve also got our exit devices that are wireless that are driving in the institutional phase. So we think we\u2019re set-up well.","I would also go back to some of our earlier generations of products, the ADCO has been out several years, but is positioned to be able to provide that open integration and communication capabilities that customers appreciate. There\u2019s already installed base of that and our ability to be able to leverage that in new electronic applications is why we are winning.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. My follow-up question is around Turkey. Could you go a little bit deeper into what are you \u2013 what are your goals in terms of moving production from Turkey to where? And essentially what is \u2013 what are the driving forces that will allow you or makes you think you\u2019re going to become much more efficient in having plants that is not in Turkey?","Dave Petratis","So through the acquisition pipeline, we developed a capability out of Poland. In 2017, 2018 we announced a new facility there. We are filling up that facility. Some of that will come with Turkey and it\u2019s really optimizing the supply chain from where we believe is a competitive price market to be able to serve Western Europe. So we think we are nicely positioned. If you look at the history over the last five years of the restructuring that we have driven across Europe, it has significantly improved our profitability, and we think this is the next step in that. Our ultimate goal is to continue to incrementally improve operating income year-over-year and this is another step in that process.","Jeff Kessler","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Dave Petratis","All right, Jeff.","Operator","And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane","This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Maybe just following up on that comments on the Turkey operations. Could you quantify sort of a payback period for the \u2013 about $20 million in cash cost relating to that closure?","Patrick Shannon","So anytime you close a facility in Europe, it\u2019s going to have an extended payback period, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s more of a, I\u2019d say, a risk mitigation activity than a significant payback on a cash basis. Right thing to do, as Dave mentioned, to serve our customers with expedited supply chain capability. And so there are some benefits throughout the supply chain, not so much from a labor arbitrage, but it\u2019s definitely the right thing to do and we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to leverage our footprint going forward.","David Ridley-Lane","And then on your comments about optimism for new residential construction. Are those mainly tied to weather? Or are you seeing other reasons why new residential homes in the U.S. would be picking up?","Dave Petratis","First, the adoption of electronics, especially Encode 2, we were going through a conversion with Lennar, which will give us top line revenue expansion as we provide them exclusively to their home starts. We continue to have a focused effort on that pro build driven by those electronics. And I think the overall market and it\u2019s no surprise as you look at other companies reporting the new home construction was soft, driven by a variety of factors, we don\u2019t see a big rush to recovery. We think that it runs flat, but we think ourselves will help us both on new construction and retrofit as we move into the second half.","David Ridley-Lane","Appreciate the color. Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Good morning, everyone. One of the things that \u2013 I guess, you\u2019re talking about price productivity versus inflation and price and inflation are always a challenge to forecast. Productivity is presumably is up, and you got a better handle on it. Just help us to better understand what productivity should represent quantitatively if you can quantify for us over the next few quarters?","Patrick Shannon","So I would characterize it this way. As you\u2019d expect in any company, it\u2019s all about having a robust pipeline in terms of productivity actions and those would occur either on the sourcing material side and\/or at the factory level, labor efficiencies, cost reductions, those types of things. And we got very good visibility in terms of we\u2019ve already executed. That will take place in the back half of the year as well as opportunities for improvement going forward and that\u2019s across all our facilities globally.","So feel really good about the healthiness, robustness in terms of our productivity pipeline of both the sourcing material side as well as the throughput in the factory. And then you get the normal leverage of volume overhead leverage equation on the incremental volume that kicks in as well. And as you know, we have very high contribution margins that will contribute to the margin expansion. So it\u2019s a combination of a lot of activities that are going to help us going forward. And on the productivity pipeline visibility, we got very good clarity and expectations on that and good visibility.","David MacGregor","Is there any way you can quantify that for us Patrick?","Patrick Shannon","I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the question?","David MacGregor","Is there any way you can quantify that for us? Or at least give us some sense directionally how productivity should compare year-over-year over the next few quarters?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. So I\u2019d just say it\u2019s increasing year-over-year, and we\u2019d expect that to continue. The other thing I mentioned here too that we sometimes forget about relative to the productivity, but we are starting to reap benefits from the acquired businesses last year. So the margin profile attached to those will increase, as we get more volume leverage integrating with our sales channel and also integrating some of our enterprise excellence methodology there at those facilities are helping us. And so the acquired businesses is part of the equation and building them in through our company and methodology will help our productivity as well.","David MacGregor","Okay. Thanks for that. Second question is, just I guess, on price elasticity and specifically maybe with respect to the non-specified commercial business and maybe mechanical residential as well. But it would seem that with the pricing, you\u2019re seeing a growing gap between opening price point. And I just wonder if you\u2019re seeing people mixing down? Or if that\u2019s creating a little more of a headwind for you from an elasticity standpoint? If you can comment on that?","Dave Petratis","I haven\u2019t really seen it in the marketplace. So normally the price movements on the low end and the high end, we look at it by product, but it stays relatively close. So the differential doesn\u2019t move that much between the product categories. And so we\u2019re not seeing a migration at all relative to the low price point. It\u2019s actually, from our perspective, it\u2019s been one of our channel strategies to have a broader breadth of products in that price point that we could sell through the discretionary market. And so that\u2019s been something we continue to drive for the last several years.","David MacGregor","Thanks very much.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Brett Linzey","Hey, good morning guys. It\u2019s Brett, hoping in for Jeff here. Just a question on the Falcon brand. Obviously, we had relatively newer initiative for the company on the value side, but how has the Falcon category grown through the first half of the year relative to some of the traditional mid-to-premium brands? And then as you think about the spec business and some of the bids that are coming in, have you seen a change in the quality preference, specifically for interior doors, but with the Falcon brand where they \u2013 you now might be able to meet some of those requirements?","Dave Petratis","So remember, we have positioned with three brands, Dexter, Falcon, and then our premium Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN. We see nice growth in the Falcon brand, maybe a little bit less in Dexter, but what\u2019s happening there when a project gets valued engineered and we need to compete, we\u2019ll pull in those products. You see it a lot in like commercial and you will see Falcon exit devices keyways, Glynn, IVES would be another brand that we would use. I think it depends on where you\u2019re at in the market segmentation. Hospitals, college campuses are going to go for our performance products. And we are going to continue to use our global capability to offer customers choice.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just looking at the Americas nonres business up mid-single digits. Is there a way you could separate institutional versus commercial in the quarter, how those performed? And then thinking about the second half, I mean, do you think in commercial can you count some growth or is institutional basically going to carry the day here?","Patrick Shannon","I think we will see growth across all verticals. Institutional should be a little bit stronger and again that\u2019s a richer mix product for us holistically. And so \u2013 but strength across all verticals is the way I would be thinking about it.","Brett Linzey","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to turn the call to Mr. Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes","We would like to thank you, everyone, for participating in today\u2019s call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Wagnes","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which we issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses and charges in current year and prior year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results in comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our third quarter 2017 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide number 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David Petratis","Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another solid quarter of operational results, delivering continued margin expansion and modest organic growth.","For the third quarter, revenue was $609.4 million, an increase of 4.9%, reflecting organic growth of 2.7% as well as the benefit of foreign currency and acquisitions contributing to the overall growth. All regions contributed to organic growth.","Americas saw organic growth of 2.8% in the quarter, supported by strong price and mid teen's growth in electronics. The Americas business continues to see favorable trends in end markets. So constraints across the construction supply chain including labor continue to impact the completion of projects, which caused some choppiness in the timing of orders and shipments of our products.","Europe had another solid quarter of organic revenue growth of 3.1%, led by strong growth in our portable security and SimonsVoss businesses. Our Asia Pacific business saw organic growth of 0.4%.","Adjusted operating income of 134.6 million increased 6.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 30 basis points, as we continue to experience margin expansion driven by strong price and incremental volume in excess of investments and cautionary headwinds.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 increased $0.09 or 9.7% versus the prior year. Overall, I'm pleased with the operational performance in the third quarter. In addition, we're updating full year EPS guidance. Adjusted EPS guidance is now $3.75 to $3.80 and reported EPS guidance is $3.21 to $3.26.","Please go to slide 5. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to take a little time to talk about Allegion's foundation for electro-mechanical convergence and connectivity. At Allegion, we blend the best elements of our mechanical heritage with the latest technology that provides the security our customers expect, along with the convenience and connectivity they desire. That's what allows Allegion to lead the electro-mechanical convergence in the security industry today.","For instance, over the last twelve months we have sold 1.5 million residential electronic walls. To best illustrate our leadership in convergence, this slide showcases the evolution of some of our residential products. On the far left you see a Schlage Mechanical Deadbolt, something that most people listening today probably grew up using.","Since 1920, when Schlage was awarded the first patents for cylindrical and push-button locks, we've been pioneering in the home security hard since then. Now, our experts have been creating innovative smart locks for nearly 10 years, leading us to the products you see on the far right, our latest launch the Schlage Sense Wi-Fi Adapter.","This simple lock again provides android and Apple user's access to the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolts from anywhere. No smart home platform needed. We launched it in August along with android compatibility for the Schlage Sense Smart Deadbolt. Just like our Mechanical and leading Smart Deadbolt's, we're confident the Schlage Sense Wi-Fi Adapter will become a staple in the residential market place.","We're equally confident in the bigger picture. Allegion's extensive base of mechanical and electronic solutions serves as a robust foundation and competitive advantage for our growth into the ongoing electro-mechanical convergence.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full-year 2017 guidance.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number 6. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 2.7% organic growth in the third quarter. Pricing was strong this quarter and was favorable in all regions. As a company we remain disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact rising monetary functions. As a result, pricing improvements have continued to exceed material inflation. During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 1% growth and foreign currency with a tailwind particularly in the EMEIA and Asia Pacific regions.","Please go to slide number 7. Reported net revenues for the quarter was 609.4 million, this reflects an increase of 4.9% versus the prior year, up 2.7% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the strong price performance in all regions. The total growth was driven by favorable currency impacts, in addition to the price performance.","Adjusted operating income was 134.6 million and adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, increased 6.2% and 30 basis points respectively when compared to the prior year. The operational improvement was driven by solid price and productivity, which more than offset the impacts of inflation in incremental investments.","The price performance allowed us to absorb and manage through the higher inflation we experienced. The business continues to deliver both organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.","Please go to slide number 8. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2016, reported EPS was $0.02, adjusting $0.91 for the prior loss on divestiture, restructuring expenses and integration cost related acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.93.","Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 with favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Interest and other income were a net $0.03 per share increase, driven by non-operating gains. The combination of the adjusted effective tax rates and share count grow by $0.01per share reduction versus the prior year.","The adjusted effective tax rates grow by $0.02 per share reduction. The increase in rate is primarily due to the mix of income earned in higher tax rate jurisdictions. Share count reductions increased EPS by $0.01. Incremental investments were $0.02 per share reduction. These investments relate to new product development and channel initiatives, which allow us to grow faster than the market, expand our electro-mechanical presence and increase our vitality invests.","This results in adjusted third quarter 2017 EPS of $1.02 per share an increase of $0.09 or nearly 10% compared to the prior year with the growth driven primarily by operational improvements.","We have a negative $0.08 per share reduction for debt refinancing costs, acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to this onetime items, you arrive at third quarter of 2017 reported EPS of $0.94.","Please go to slide number 9. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were 455.2 million, up 4.4% on a reported basis and 2.8% organically. The modest organic growth was driven by strong pricing in the quarter as well as mid-teens work in the electronics products which offset the impact of timing of orders that was a positive benefit in the second quarter. The price performance continues to allow us to effectively manage the price cost dynamic.","On a year-to-date basis the Americas region has had strong organic growth at 6.2%. Americas adjusted operating income of 137.1 million, increased 3.6% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin is primarily driven by unfavorable product and mix in incremental investments.","Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were 125.1 million up 7.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% organically. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in both the portable security and SimonsVoss businesses along with solid price performance. Currency tailwinds also contributed to total growth.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $10.6 million increased 45.2% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by solid price, favorable leverage on incremental volume, favorable mix and the currency tailwinds offsetting the impacted inflation in incremental investments. Our EMEIA business had strong operating performance in the quarter as we continue to focus on areas that would drive us the double-digit margin profile in that region.","Please go to slide number 11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were 29.1 million, up 2.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 0.4%, driven primarily by favorable price as they drop comparable notably in Australia and New Zealand muted the volume growth. Total revenue was also supported by contributions and currency tailwinds.","Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was 2.2 million, with adjusted operating margins up 130 basis points versus the prior-year period. Operating margin increases were driven by favorable price, productivity in FX more than offsetting inflationary impacts.","Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2017 was 136.3 million, which is a decrease of 15.7 million compared to the prior-year period. The decrease is driven by the previously announced $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter, partially offset by higher net earnings. Excluding the discretionary pension payment for 2017, available cash flow increased $34.3 or 22.6% compared to the prior year period.","Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle slightly increased in the third quarter 2017 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfilment requirements. As noted we are updating our full year available cash flow guidance to approximately 300 million, which is net of the $50 million discretionary pension funding payment.","Please go to slide number 13. I want to take this time to highlight the changes from our recent debt refinancing we previously announced. During September we closed our refinancing of our credit facility and in early October we issued investment grade senior notes, the proceeds of which we used primarily to regain our previously outstanding high yield senior notes. Our outstanding debts as result of the refinancing increased slightly. However, our debt to adjusted EBITDA remained approximately the same at 2.8 times and 2.2 times on a net basis.","Our refinancing in upgrades with investment grade resulted in an unsecured capital structure with maturities extending approximately three and a half years and demonstrates our financial strength and strong cash flow characteristics. It also reduces our cost of capital and future borrowing cost, which enhance our ability to form accelerated organic growth as well as future acquisitions.","Lastly the refinancing will reduce our annual interest expense by approximately 13 million or $0.09 per share, a quarter which will be realized in Q4 of this year.","I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2017 guidance.","David Petratis","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 14. As noted on this slide, we are updating the revenue guidance in all regions. We are reducing revenue guidance in the Americas and Asia Pacific while increasing in EMEIA. This results in revised guidance range for a total revenue of 6.5% to 7% and organic revenue being revised to a range of 5% to 5.5%.","If we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid as we continue to see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and expect momentum in single-family construction to continue to support solid residential markets. However due to constraints across the supply including labor the industry is experiencing delays in overall project construction which has an impact on the timing of our revenue.","For EMEIA region, we are raising both the total revenue and our organic revenue outlooks. European markets have started to rebound nicely and are being bolstered by continued general macroeconomic improvements such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment. For the first time in a decade the GDP in all of our key economies are growing. Total revenue growth is also being assisted by FX tailwinds in second half of the year.","In the Asia Pacific region, electronics remain a key driver of the growth. Similar to EMEIA, the FX headwinds are anticipated in the original guidance are not as prevalent. As we look out to 2018, we would expect end markets to continue to grow and expect organic revenue in line with our previously provided long term profit of 4% to 6%, which includes the benefit of electronics growth as well as continued performance in our channel initiative.","We are updating our 2017 adjusted earnings per share to a range of $3.75 to $3.80 this represents EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%. This guidance includes a reduction of reported EPS related to debt refinancing cost and restructuring and acquisition expenses in the amount of $0.54.","This brings our updated guidance for reported EPS to a range of $3.21 to $3.26. Included in the revised guidance is the assumption for the full-year tax rate to be between 18% and 18.5%. This guidance assumes average diluted shares count for the full year to be approximately 96 million shares.","Please go to slide 15. Let me finish by reiterating that I am pleased with our third quarter execution and results. As a summary, reported revenue grew nearly 5%, organic revenue grew nearly 3%, is up 5.5% for the year, adjusted operating margins increased 30 basis points. Adjusted EPS saw just nearly 10% growth in the quarter and it's up almost 13% for the year. These results position us well to complete 2017.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research.","David Petratis","Hi, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just maybe a bit of a follow up on some of the residential electro-mechanicals and clearly the market is off little bit in the past week or so with after picking up I guess in the Amazon key announcing yesterday. I guess you guys have a lot of partnerships out there and so have pretty good leadership position, but how would you characterize some of these changes and then could you give kind of a walkthrough of how this Amazon key maybe a future opportunity or why you guys are not part of that in the show partnership?","David Petratis","So, number one we welcome the introduction of Amazon Key. We think this whole category is in its early stages, early earnings as we have said in the past maybe 3% to 5% penetration. So, we like the opportunity having intensity and what we call the last foot or last mile in terms of this delivery we think we are in a very good position with over 1.5 million locks sold year, that were installed in the residential category. We work with all players. Amazon, we are encouraged to click on and look at our products offering on Amazon, we have got the highest star ratings. Consumer reports rates our e-lock as best in class and we think it's opportunity plus. We continue to have having investments to be able to work and with our open platform approach to be able to grow the category. So, I think there is a bevy features that are loaded into our lock in terms of its design and robustness that gives us a leadership position. Whether it's Amazon, Google, Siri, Control4, there is a variety of operating platforms that we compile with and we like our position.","Josh Pokrzywinski","But there is nothing proprietary in what's coming out what's I guess the new key platform that Schlage couldn't fit into eventually.","David Petratis","No. And I can encourage we may be - with our presence in this market place maybe a little bit more insightful on some of the opportunities and pit falls as you are inviting people into the home. Remember some of the early challenges with voice activation on which side of the door, we think thinking through these details and in this case maybe not being the first, but a follow will be a good position for legend.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning guys.","David Petratis","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie","Can we maybe just touch on the Americas for a little bit? And if - David maybe you can talk a little bit more about the constraints that you are seeing on labor and on the project side. How much of an impact do you guys estimate that has happen this quarter, that it impacted this quarter and then as you think about the upcoming quarter, it seems like you are inviting in acceleration in the Americas in your guidance so maybe talk a little about what you are thinking about for $Q as well?","David Petratis","So, we would say in the quarter maybe two points of overall growth. What are something is driving that number one if you have heard me over the last year, I have talked about constraints in the market place. Construction, unemployment is that the lowest since 2001. There is clearly tightness in the job markets. We had our top distributors in Chicago early September and general consent is was their backlogs had never been higher and their ability to turn on had never been lower and talked about constraints from the architectural level right down to install, so there is clearly some constriction in the market. I would include also in that commercial doors normally would run two to four-week leave times they run long all year and in 8 to 12-week range. This significantly impacts our commercial. We hang all of our stuff on door. So that constriction appears. We think some of that will move through in Q4. If not, a constraint that's going away in '18 or '19, we actually think it pushes the expansion further ahead. I think as we look at '18 and the long term we like our view in terms of the continued end market performance. We think about education, healthcare, single-family. We like the continued expansion of that. We see some slowdown in multifamily. It's not one of our sweets spots. We actually think our lack of share in that position in electronics and some of the things we are investing and will give us growth. So that's how we see it.","Joe Ritchie","Okay that's helpful. I guess just a maybe follow up on that comment so, is it fair to say then if it - from an end market perspective outside of multi-family you are not really seeing much the slowdown whether there is some this timing related things that impacted the quarter and moving forward do you expect to see the acceleration come back in like what's 4Q and in early part of next year, is that fair?","David Petratis","It's extremely fair and I would reemphasis as we look to '18 and '19 and spend significant time understanding our end markets, we believe our long-term growth projections in 4% to 6% is bought on. I think it also put some challenges on a region in terms of the jobs we pick in that overabundance of backlog when you think about constraints in the market place, we will get sharper in making sure that we are putting our resources behind the jobs that we believe will move through.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense. One last question on pricing, I know that you guys were planning cut through a pricing in August fairly it was a strongest quarter, strong as it was last quarter. Did you already thought to feel some of the impact of that pricing this quarter or is that really more on the time for 4Q?","David Petratis","And we benefited in this quarter there will some carry forward for the balance of the year, but the expectations you are probably not going to see a stronger price realization as Q4 as what you saw in Q3.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Timothy Wojs with Baird.","Timothy Wojs","Hey, guys good morning.","David Petratis","Good morning.","Timothy Wojs","So, I just maybe just an update a little bit on the investment spending. I see that it recently the Americas business I think it had slowed down a little bit maybe versus what you guys had done in the first half so, just an update on kind of what you expect to spend from investment perspective in 2017 and then maybe any preliminary thoughts on 2018. Thanks.","David Petratis","Yeah, so we had - when we started the year had provide some original guidance with a range of $0.15 to $0.20 year-to-date I think we are at the $0.11 year-over-year incremental investment spend up you know for Q4 for the full year I would say probably at the low end of that guidance is not a little bit lower. So, anticipate Q4 to kind of be after it maybe a little bit higher than what you saw in Q3. As we look forward to 2018, we will provide more specific guidance when we report Q4 results in February. But kind of we had indicated previously we look at it relative to market conditions, what are the opportunities, what's the capacity, can we accelerate things like electric products and at option rates those type of things. So, more color to come there we can balance that relative to market conditions. So slower market would be in less investment the kind of manage earnings going forward so.","Timothy Wojs","Okay, great. Good luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much. Just wanted to circle back on the labor source of just in the Americas issue, so I guess I find it interesting that you had raised your organic growth guide in the region slightly back in July then you are lowering it today. So just trying to understand what point did you see a sudden shift in this aspect of constraints and I guess what's your confidence so conviction level in the visibility of the growth guidance for Q4. My guess is it implies volume growth about 2% or 1.5% in the Americas in Q4, so I just intrigue sort of how quickly and when things really change that they're cosy to move from an increase in the guide to a reduction within the three months.","Patrick Shannon","So, if you look back on the year - first half of the year was pretty high. It doesn't mean that their product was always installed. So, we actually saw a deceleration in July, but I think as we would have said at the end of our Q2 call we plan this business for a year-to-date basis. We are - I think well within the range that we forecasted. We saw tightness in the labor market. Is that going to affect our projects, ultimately yes, but it clearly was an evident in the first half of the year. I would also say this there is some new answers to our business. Our strong position in K12 in college campuses sets us up for that strong first half their products have to be on side to be able to take care of the summer upgrades and its part of how the business works and companies if the labor availability would have been there, we would have shipped more products.","David Petratis","I would you say Julian, that you know we cannot look at the fun end of the business in terms of specifications, bit code activity still very strong market conditions that the fundamentals we can have in change and that state fairly consistent kind of throughout the quarter. You know the follow up perhaps in billing revenue is more back end loaded towards the quarter. You know the Q4 guide is little bit higher than what we saw in Q3 and basis of what we are seeing in the market place if you locate on that. I would also add I think we worked extremely hard with our economic forecasters over in the last four years they have a view. I think we generally had good perspectives on the health of our end markets and confident in our 4% to 6% growth going forward into'18.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks, and then just one quick follow up. I think pricing sorry not pricing volumes mix at negative slightly in the Americas in Q3 even though I think non-resi out grew res in the quarter so maybe just give any color you can on the mix issue.","David Petratis","Yeah, now actually it went the other way. As we indicated - the really good growth on electronic products that was driven heavily from the residential segments, so the residential business which all of you know has a lower margin profile actually have grew the non-residential segment and that was contributing to the mix that we highlighted in the quarter and drove the margins slightly down year-over-year in the Americas segment.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you and the next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Kwas","Hi, good morning. Just when we think it on late July when you gave the outlook updated outlook for the year, what was the expectation for volume in the Americas at that time. I assume it wasn't zero when you look at volume mix, but what is the way to quantify that or think about that relative to your initial internal expectations.","David Petratis","So, I have to go back and look at those specifics. On the slide we give the revenue guiding. You got that doubt for there in terms of total reported in organic growth. So, the organic growth number of course included in that component would be the volume as well as price and pricing. I think we had it maybe a 150 to 200 basis points type of range and, so you deduct that from the organic growth and you kind of get the volume number. So, it's higher than what we are anticipating. Pricing actually being a little bit longer or so many better and so always the change in the guidance if you will, is all volume related.","Richard Kwas","And that's all the stuff that's still in backlog or in your terms of being in a project and then just been pushed basically is the message or?","David Petratis","That is the clear message. I read some commentary of coming out of Dallas and the Florida regions not related to hurricane, but just project delays that have been showed in the '18.","Richard Kwas","And then just touching on capital allocation here so limited M&A here year-to-date you have talked not building cash you got a buyback in place. How should we think about that?","David Petratis","So as we have indicated our capital deployment strategy in a balanced flexible disciplined approach, our process is way-to-way indicated leads with investments in driving organic growth then M&A and then perhaps shareholder distributions, I would say particularly from the M&A perspective very active pipeline, lot of focus in the fire and I feel fairly confident to put some points on the board here within the next three months and so that's why you haven't seen a as long as long we have some capital deployment. So, stay tuned more to come on that.","Richard Kwas","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Brett Linzey","Hi, good morning, it's Brett Linzey in for Jeff.","David Petratis","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Linzey","Hey, just wanted to come back the pricing obviously strong in the quarter again. I guess as you look at those pricing measures is it primarily related to a price to cover inflation or you getting some help from new products or FX maybe some finer point there.","David Petratis","So, it's predominantly to cover inflation so anything related to new products would come through in the volume side. So, when we calculate price it's really year-over-year same products and obviously we have been fairly active and going forward price increases. We have got better tools now to measure better alignments relative to in centres etcetera. So, I think from an overall management perceptive operational excellence we have done a very good job across the globe to try to maximize price to clearly offset the commodity price increases.","Brett Linzey","Okay and then maybe just back to the end market so I mean cycle duration is obviously a big topic here as you unbundle both the commercial markets and your institutional markets you look at your front lines [ph] your project metrics. What are those telling you in terms of visibility into '18 between both institutional and commercial?","David Petratis","We see positives in education, healthcare. In our commercial will be about the same level as it was in '17. So, we see good opportunities, as we look at the '18 in those verticals.","Brett Linzey","Okay great and thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital.","Saliq Khan","Hi, good morning everyone.","David Petratis","Good morning.","Saliq Khan","Hi, Dave two question kind of whole lot of this early is low but if you still go looking at the clue that you guys got if I strip out the overall price inflation from currency, how does your strategy change overall going to the 2018 being able to get better volume not on the North America because I know that is a sign in the interest in market right now. If I look across the globe, how will your strategies change, will you be able to push up more products and increase the volume.","David Petratis","So, in Europe we are going to continue to push electronics and the bundling around projects. Some of the same channel initiatives that we deployed in the U.S. and the Americas we believe have opportunity in Europe and the Middle East. That's big project based that leads with our electronics. In Asia Pacific continued growth again in the electronics we think our mill rate and SimonsVoss offerings as well as the introduction of the Schlage electronic brands puts us in a great position for growth. And in Asia Pacific that's not only driven by new product introductions but the quality of our products, lots of electronics up there that have high failure rates. We really provide that Asian customer base the high-quality product that puts us on a good position.","Saliq Khan","So, one follow if it is worth, that is as in lot of technology changes across the industry and across the region as well. So, if you look out into 2018, all the currently solutions out there some alluded to August won't be in a quarter [indiscernible] earlier, are there other solutions out there that you find interesting that you think could be a great addition to your product portfolio.","David Petratis","There are - I think if I got a decade the connected building the connective institutions going to create I think outstanding opportunity for a region to expand the penetration of electronic locks. We think the app the portion and connectivity solutions in working with a variety of building control platforms are important better grounds and we have got investment and top leadership going after that including partnerships with Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Siemens and Amazon, Apple, Google as well. These I know - I see yesterday's news in terms of the connectivity with the Amazon, we work with them every day as a supplier as well as a partner on connectivity.","Saliq Khan","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone. I guess I want to ask you a question David on the discretionary commercial market. I know this is an area where you have done a lot of work for some time, but this segment contributes to growth and maybe can you talk about how competitive conditions maybe your discretionary commercial business. Thanks.","David Petratis","I would say in our channelized initiatives working with lock smith and wholesale distributors continue to exceed our expectations. The competitive positioning certainly there is [indiscernible] we think we're in a nine-inning game we probably in the fourth and fifth there is more work to be done. Our deployment of human resources will be completed this year and we like the upside part of it. It also gives us confidence that as we move in '18 we will see the benefits of that.","David MacGregor","And I guess just regard to your discussion about negative mix in Americas I know you have been harder on Falcon and some of the lower price point brands. Are these gaining share and if so are you seeing any capitalization on the premium brands.","David Petratis","They are gaining share. I would like to think that again a position comes from our competitors, but as you see projects push out one of the reasons they do push out is there is value engineering going on in the project because the prices escalations by us and primarily steel. In commercial and institutional building so, general contractor will say do I have the ability to trade off our premium brand to the Falcon brands, we think the work that we have done to solidify and enhance those brands helps us to grow. Remember historically David, we just walk away from them. We say okay, its value engineered they are not going with our premiums today we stay engaged and we think it helps us grow.","David MacGregor","Okay, thanks. Just one quick follow up, in Europe, what was the organic growth excluding portable security in SimonsVoss.","David Petratis","I don't know the number well to give back to your math.","David MacGregor","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hi, guys good morning.","David Petratis","Good morning","Robert Barry","Actually, I just wanted to clarify something you said really, or did you say that non-rents was up mid single and the resi up low or the resi was up mid single and the non resi up low single.","David Petratis","The question with mix is that the volume from resi was up more when you look at the commercial business that revenue growth was driven more by price, so that the resulted into negative mix between the two.","Robert Barry","Was there any significant difference in the growth between the aftermarket and the new construction components of resi and\/or non-res?","David Petratis","Nothing that we saw there is any difference relative to the mix.","Robert Barry","So, I think if it is like the labor constraint issue might be appear more pressure in the construction piece of the business versus the other which is more consumer driven.","David Petratis","I have had face-to-face consider discussions with general contractors as well as lock smiths, electricians they are all beating about it.","Robert Barry","Yeah, it just broad labor availability. I guess just last question on demand in electricity do you think that's relevant here at all higher prices impacting the volume or causing any mix down.","David Petratis","I don't think that's happening at all.","Robert Barry","Got you, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and as there are no questions I would like to return the call over to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes","We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Tom Martineau, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.","Tom Martineau - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank for joining us for the third quarter 2015 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide number two. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring, acquisition and divestiture expenses and charges in current-year results and restructuring and spin expenses from prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business, when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our third quarter 2015 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide three, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Allegion with nice organic growth and operating margin expansion. There has been a tremendous amount of positive activity during this past quarter and we'll be covering in today's call.","Revenues of $544 million grew 5.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 0.4%, reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. Of note, organic growth for the business has averaged more than 6% over the last 12 months. And our electronics portfolio continues to perform well in the quarter, improving more than 30% versus prior year.","We have seen a continuous acceleration of the electronics growth rate, reflected of an ongoing electromechanical transformation and supportive of our increased investment in accelerating new electronics security products and solutions.","The Americas segment grew 7% organically driven by continued strength in both the non-residential and residential business. In EMEIA, organic growth of 2% reflects a slight improvement in the region, although market recovery continues to be mixed across countries. Our one decline this quarter is in the Asia-Pacific region with negative organic growth of 10%. Patrick will provide more details on this later, but the decline is primarily driven by weakness in our system integration business in China.","Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior year. We realized the operating margin expansion in all regions and improved overall margin by 120 basis points. We continue to show margin improvement, while absorbing incremental investments, investments predominantly in new products and channel initiatives creating a 90 basis points headwind in the quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 increased 35% versus the prior year, driven primarily from improved operating performance, acquisition and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by incremental investments and foreign exchange impact. This is our fifth straight quarter with double-digit earnings per share growth. We are raising our full-year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $2.85 to $2.90 per share.","Please go to slide four. We have been extremely active as a company affecting change aligned with our long-term growth strategies. I'm happy to report that we successfully closed the three acquisitions mentioned last quarter within the expected timeframe.","We are well underway with the integration work and have already seen contribution in our third quarter results. We are excited to realize the benefit of our broader electronic portfolio as well as seeing the expansion of our position as a global leader in portable security. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Venezuela business. This decision was made to reduce risk associated with an uncertain economic operating environment.","Also in the quarter, we announced our intent to sell the majority stake in our Bocom Wincent business in China. Although a market leader in the system integration industry in China, this business was not deemed to be a good strategic fit with the rest of the Allegion portfolio. The sale has the benefit of reducing risks in an environment that is currently realizing an economic slowing, combined with tightening credit, and reduces the high capital requirements of the business. This decision allows us to prioritize efforts and resources on core mechanical and electronic hardware solutions.","And earlier this month, we reached an agreement with regard to the restructuring plan for our CISA business in Italy that will ensure a long-term viability, enhance the customer experience. CISA remains a critical part of the European portfolio and will continue to provide innovative solutions for convergence of mechanical and electronic technologies.","In conjunction with the plan, we will begin to transition products of \u2013 non-specialized product to Flex, an existing supplier of Allegion today. Flex offers innovative design, engineering, manufacturing, real-time supply chain insight and logistical services to companies of all sizes in various industries around today's connected world.

Schlage Sense will be \u2013 officially be available in retail in November in selected big-box stores like Home Depot and Lowe's.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2015 guidance.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to slide number six. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the third quarter as well as our growth by regional segment. As indicated, we delivered 5.1% organic growth in the third quarter, supported by incremental volume that reflects improving market fundamentals, price improvements and early traction on our key organic growth investments in products and channels. We realized solid organic growth in Americas and EMEIA segments.","As expected, unfavorable foreign currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth noted by the negative 7.5% decline. Our reporting segments were impacted by currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against currencies in EMEIA and Asia-Pacific as well as the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Acquisitions and divestitures provided 2% of growth, which includes contributions from acquisitions offset by Venezuelan divestiture.","Please go to slide number seven. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $544.5 million. This reflects a decrease of 0.4% versus the prior year, up 5.1% on an organic basis. We realized strong organic growth in Americas and EMEIA across most product segments. We continue to experience great progress in electronic product growth, up over 30% compared to the prior year period. This growth was across both residential and commercial segments and is the result of new products and accelerated adoption of electronic products.","Adjusted operating income of $116.8 million grew 5.3% compared to the prior year. Incremental volume leverage and acquisitions compensated for increased investment spending and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. Adjusted operating margin of 21.5% reflects an increase of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion and certain infrastructure programs had a negative impact of 90 basis points on the quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.7% is a record performance since the company went public in December 2013.","Please go to slide number eight. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.65. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.03, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.68. Operational results increased EPS by $0.12, as pricing, production and favorable operating leverage were more than offset inflation and unfavorable currency exchange impacts.","The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.15 per share improvement versus the prior year. The improvement reflects favorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower-rate jurisdictions and the benefit of discrete tax items recorded in the quarter. Acquisitions and interest expense added $0.02 as did other net items.","Next, incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategy specific to taxes and IT investments were a $0.03 reduction.","And lastly, the net year-over-year impact of Venezuela at current exchange rates is a $0.04 reduction. This results in adjusted third quarter 2015 EPS of $0.92 per share. Continuing on, we have a negative $1.20 per share reduction for charges related to the Bocom Wincent, Venezuelan business divestitures as well as acquisition and restructuring expenses. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the third quarter 2015 reported EPS of negative $0.28.","Please go to slide number nine. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $418.9 million, down 1% or an increase of 7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes, pricing and contribution from the acquisition of Zero compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada, in Venezuela and the divestiture of a Venezuelan business.","The higher volumes reflect strong organic growth in both residential and non-residential products. This reflects better-than-market performance driven by our new product and channel initiatives. Americas adjusted operating income of $122.2 million was down 1% versus the prior-year period. Pricing and productivity more than offset inflation and investment, while incremental volume was absorbed by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the Venezuelan divestiture. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points, while absorbing incremental investment spending that created a 70 basis point headwind in the quarter and unfavorable mix due to the Venezuelan divestiture.","Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for EMEIA region were $91.5 million, up 2.2% both on a reported and on an organic basis. The growth was driven by strong pricing within the mechanical business and modest volume increases. Significant ongoing currency headwinds were offset by recent acquisitions completed in the quarter. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $5.9 million was up $4.7 million or 392% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 510 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in an ongoing business transformation as well as partial-quarter contributions from the recent acquisitions, which were accretive to the region's margins.","Please go to slide number 11. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $34.1 million, flat to the prior year. Revenues were down 10.2% on an organic basis. Strength in the hardware business and acquisitions offset unfavorable foreign exchange and a decline in the Bocom Wincent system integration business. The decline reflects the slowdown of the China business environment and the delay of a few large projects.","Note that this business historically relies on large project awards in the second half of the year. During the third quarter, projects in the pipeline have been delayed, resulting in a year-over-year reduction in revenue of approximately $6 million or negative 36%. We also expect an impact to the fourth quarter organic growth rates, which Dave will discuss later. Of note, the announced divestiture of Bocom Wincent reduces future risk inherent in the seasonal nature of the business both in terms of size and timing of awards.","Asia-pacific adjusted operating income of $0.7 million was up $1.2 million or 240% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 360 basis points due to the mix shift of hardware volume, productivity and acquisitions, which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts.","Please go to slide number 12. Year-to-date available cash flow for 2015 was $98.7 million, a reduction of $36.3 million compared to the prior-year period. The reduction in year-over-year cash flow was due to increased operating cash requirements and one-time cash tax payments, partially offset by reduced capital expenditures.","We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and continue to see improvement in working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle. We expect full-year available cash flow for the business to be approximately $200 million. This guidance incorporates a reduction in anticipated 2015 collections for our Bocom Wincent business and slightly higher working capital requirements.","I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2015 guidance.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 13. Looking at full-year revenue guidance, we are increasing our growth expectations for the full year by 1 point. In the Americas, we are improving organic revenue growth by 50 basis points, reflecting the third quarter results. Reported full-year revenue growth for the Americas remains consistent to prior guidance as the increases in organic revenue is offset by increased currency headwinds. We see the end markets as unchanged from prior guidance with regard to verticals or construction growth.","Total revenue for EMEIA region now reflects the inclusion of the SimonsVoss and AXA acquisitions, while growth guidance remained unchanged. The largest change occurs within our Asia-Pacific region, where we now forecast organic revenues to decline for the full year by negative 13% to 15%. This impact flows through the total Asia-Pacific revenues that are primarily offset by the inclusion of the Milre acquisition.","As Patrick mentioned earlier, when discussing Q3 results, the revenue call down is related to the Bocom Wincent system integration business where we now forecast a number of large projects to be delayed until 2016. And note that we would continue to include Bocom Wincent in our guidance as announced, but not yet closed transaction.","Furthermore, margins for Bocom Wincent are historically strongest in the fourth quarter due to increased volume, which compensates for operating losses in the first three quarters. Given the reduction in volume, we expect full-year margins for Asia-Pacific to be down from prior year and close to breakeven.","We estimate the earnings impact of the lower Bocom Wincent revenues in the fourth quarter to be a headwind of approximately $0.05 versus prior guidance. Inclusive of this impact, we are still able to increase full-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations to a range a $2.85 to $2.90. This reflects an improvement of our adjusted effective tax rate now estimated to be 20% for the full year, an improved operational performance. Furthermore, this incorporates the impact of acquisitions as well as increased interest expense related to the new senior notes.","Please go to slide 14. The third quarter results were very strong and represented solid growth with a 5.1% organic revenue increase, a 120 basis point margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth of over 35%. From a market perspective, the trends for the U.S. market are still leaning positive, although economic data remains choppy. And after a long recessionary cycle, we are seeing signs of slight improvements in our primary European geographies.","In Asia-Pacific, China growth is decelerating, while other countries outside China are holding. Overall, the business continues to perform well, and we are executing at a high level. We're making the top portfolio decisions that need to be made and we'll continue to execute on our strategies to drive profitable growth and customer satisfaction.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to just, Dave, ask you about institutional markets. I know it didn't seem like you changed your outlook at least in the Americas around verticals. And the institutional activity seems to be getting better here as the years progress, which provides some visibility into 2016. So, just want to get a quick update on your initial thoughts as we move forward over the next six months to 12 months on institutional.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","As we see the institutional markets, they continue to lean positive. But we don't see a huge sea change in the environment that we've operated in previously. I recently was at our California field office and was extremely pleased with the bond approvals for Southern California schools. So, it tends to support our view and I think your view that institutional spending, state government spending is improving. But we're still nowhere near normal.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. But net-net, would you say that that should be an incremental positive as you look at \u2013 start to think about 2016 versus this year?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think it's a mixed bag. It's positive, as I saw in California, you move into some of the oil patches, like Texas, which has been a good driver, softer. So, I think you've got to take into context, we continue to be leaning positive, but we still think we've got a couple of years for the institutional state budgets to normalize.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just last on Europe. So, the margin outperformed versus expectation here in Q3. You've got the 10% target for next year. How would you gauge progress versus your goal in Europe at this point?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","10% target doesn't change. We lost a couple months in the labor negotiations, which we closed. And overall, very pleased with the trajectory of the base business and believe SimonsVoss and AXA pushes us well into our goal aspirations. But our goal remains the same. On the base business, 10% OI and we're headed towards that achievement.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I think you called out some progress in terms of the channel in the U.S., the repair and replace market. Could you dig a little deeper into this and give us more color around the progress there and where you're starting from and if the timeline has changed at all?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, we reviewed our channel initiatives and growth in the retrofit and tenant improvement build-out in the quarter. The results are exceeding our expectations, but I want to ground you, we launched that program in six cities. I've said clearly, our target is to launch that across the United States and Canada, let's say 32 cities, and we'll do that over 36 months. But we're pleased with the progress and it's embedded in our organic growth. And we see further progress as we move into 2016 and 2017. I think why wouldn't I go faster? This program's got to be done correctly and it takes people. And so, pleased with the results and we'll continue to work on these areas.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","That's good to hear. And moving to the electronic portfolio, so I think you said more than 30% growth in electronic last year. I mean, between the new Sense, you've got the Connect series, and now you've got SimonsVoss that's added to the portfolio, it looks like you have a pretty full range now of electromechanical locks. Can you...","(28:03 \u2013 35:06)","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We are mindful of that. Whatever the economy deals us, I think you can look for us to execution, but we erred on the side of caution.","Unknown Speaker","I mean is, how things are tracking so far in the quarter warrant keeping that low end of the range where it is?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We would say yes.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. And then maybe just a quick on pricing. I mean, pricing has been accelerating for the last few quarters. Just curious about what's driving that. I assume some of the new products, but also the outlook for pricing.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We raised prices end of Q3. We saw some effects of that in the quarter. I would say the pricing environment continues to be slightly positive. I think in the Americas, we got a little less than 1%. And we continue to see that moving forward as opportunistic, how can we sharpen our gain in terms of achieving price realization on the commercial as well as the residential side.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. Just a little bit more color too, Rob (36:21). The majority of that price increase or what you're seeing in the numbers year-over-year is on the commercial side. Residential has kind of been a challenge throughout the course of the year. Anytime we introduce new products, that's not reflected in a price change, i.e., it's just the delta shows up in organic growth or new products.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. Did the change in price cause any pull forward into the quarter?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","No, not really. We think it's a pretty good comparison and didn't really pull forward any activity.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Hey, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just because I got disconnected here, you can cut me off if you already went through it, but I think as a follow-up to Rich's question earlier on European margins. If we had to take that 10% and true it up just for the new business, from a mix perspective, that you guys have acquired, maybe not pretending any margin improvements there, but kind of fully loaded what would that look like now on a more apples-to-apples basis?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So, we'll be giving full year 2016 guidance at the next quarterly conference call. The acquisitions are accretive to the overall margins. So, you would expect to see, as you look at the European region next year, to be north of 10%, certainly. As Dave highlighted, the business has really made good progress relative to the margin expansion. On the base business, we continue to get the carryover effects relative to the restructuring programs we executed last year. Team has done a great job on pricing. We talked about really looking at customer-specific accounts and trying to be more specific there in terms of implementing and executing price increases.","This move, in terms of the facility, helps bridge the gap from base business performance to get us closer to that 10% margin on base business. So, a lot of good progress there. When we go out with guidance on a going-forward basis, we'll probably be talking about how the overall European region is performing and provide guidance relative to that aspect.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. And if I could just ask a corollary to that, on all the puts and takes in 2015 guidance, can you maybe parse out, aside from Bocom, what the acquisitions and other divestiture, i.e. Venezuela, are contributing to that?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","For what period, specifically?","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","For 2015, so I guess for the fourth quarter, for the changes you guys just made, how much of that is the other deals that have closed?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, you saw in the quarter, again, net of the incremental interest associated with the acquisitions, i.e., the new senior notes, about a $0.02 contribution, net. I would anticipate to see something similar in Q4 relative to the acquisition performance. And going forward, you would expect that perhaps to get a little bit stronger as we begin to realize the integration efforts, synergy attainment and those type of things.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. But no real step function into the fourth quarter necessarily?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","No. No.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, guys. Also, line cut out on me as well as the number of investors, so if ask something that's already been asked, just let me know. On the organic growth side for the fourth quarter, just want to make sure I understand this. Bocom, et cetera, is being included in that kind of sounds like negative organic growth in total for the entire quarter. Is that correct?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","That's correct. And that business, in particular, Q4, I mean, last year had a very strong quarter. There was a couple of large project wins in the quarter. And so, if you look at it year-over-year, it's about a $30 million call down in the quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. So, that explains that. And then, on the capital allocation side, where are you thinking now in terms incremental leverage given where you're running and what you're seeing in the U.S. and Europe being a little bit stronger? How are you thinking about continued acquisition runway in size, tuck-in versus maybe a larger transformational versus share buybacks at this point?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We continue to be aggressive on working the acquisition pipeline. Deal size tend to be reflective of what you saw in AXA, SimonsVoss or smaller, you know, is what our game is. We think there is plenty of runway there. Patrick, some additional comments?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, you guys are aware. I mean, we target a leverage ratio from 3.25 to 2.75. We're a little bit north of that today. Not concerning because of the free cash flow generation of this business. We delever fairly quickly and we'll do so next year. So, I think next year's plan would kind of put us back in the middle of that range. And we've indicated previously that would not have an issue with going to, say, 4 times leverage for the right transactions. And we also have our equity currency that we could use for the right type of strategic deal.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in on tax rate, if you didn't answer this. So, ex those one-time items, where are you? Does that change your kind of expectations in terms of where you're trying to head?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","For this year, no. So, the majority of the rate improvement for Q3 was one-time favorable discrete items. We've got a full year effective rate of 20%, which puts Q4 around 22%, which was our beginning-of-the-year guidance. We are still marching towards the 20% target for 2016, making some good progress there, a little headwind relative to the acquisitions just given the nature where the earnings are. But I think we'll be able to execute some tax planning strategies that mitigate that and get us within the target that we established last year for 20% in 2016.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And I'd been disconnected as well. So, if you've addressed this already, I apologize. But Dave, you talked about the 90 basis points of...","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","David, can you speak closer to the phone? You're just fading on us.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. I'm sorry. A lot of phone troubles here this morning. I apologize. You talked about the 90 basis points \u2013 can you hear me now?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yes.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. The 90 basis points of headwinds associated with the investments. I think earlier in the year, you'd been up closer to about 150 basis points. So, it seems like maybe that's coming off. Maybe now with Sense roll out, that continues to come off, I'm not sure. Maybe you could talk about that and just what do you expect that number to look like for the fourth quarter, but I guess more importantly for 2016?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, we had or beginning-of-year guidance had guided incremental investments around $0.15 to $0.20 per share impact year-to-date. We're around $0.15. Q4, you're going to see a tapering off. Maybe there is $0.02 to $0.03 impact. And the year-over-year impact relative to the margin comes down, maybe to around 40 basis points or 50 basis points. You may recall last year, Q4 in particular, really stepped up our activities associated with engineering and those repair retrofit market opportunity that Dave talked about, making incremental investments in the channel, et cetera. So, it does start coming down. You kind of look forward to 2016, and you would expect the incremental year-over-year investments to also decrease on a full year basis as we previously highlighted at our shareholder meeting in March.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. In the residential, I wonder if you could just talk about, within kind of the conventional product offering, what competitive conditions within the big-box aisle look like right now and the extent to which this is impacting your residential margins.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, from a competitive standpoint, in big box, our results are strong. We think the overall demand, especially for renovation and retrofit, is positive. New home starts again will be choppy, but we think they normalize around 1.4 million to 1.6 million; we like that. We think the new products; Schlage Touch, Schlage Sense, Schlage Pulse, actually expands the total available market for our products. So, I'm net positive and I think we're executing well. I challenge all of you, understand the new Schlage Sense. It's a superior product out there and I think we'll perform well in that environment versus the competition.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Last question. Just within your portfolio of North American businesses and the various lines and the markets you've got there, do you watch one or two or three as particular leading indicators? And what would you be seeing there right now?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, ironically, our door business, Steelcraft, is an early indicator, because in the new construction, it's like cement and starts, so it gives you an indication of what's ahead. And I'd say, generally, that business continues to lean positively. I think all of this construction, whether it's residential, commercial, is capped by labor availability, land availability. And if I looked at just frame, doorframes, that market continues to be positive.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on all the progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is now open.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Hey, Tim.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess just the first question I wanted to ask. If you look at the midpoint of your prior guidance and the midpoint of this guidance, there's some moving pieces and I was just hoping you could tell us or maybe break it into a few buckets in terms of how much is the core guidance up? How much is acquisitions? How much is the tax rate? And then maybe, what the headwinds are from Bocom and then maybe some of the Venezuela stuff? It sounds like there might be a little bit of incremental there from the divestiture.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, if you kind of start with the beat relative to Q3 performance, tax, $0.07 to $0.08; ops, $0.05 or so, and you had other of a penny. The way you should probably think about Q4 is \u2013 or the full year is that that carries forward and then you've got a negative reduction on Bocom, which we mentioned a $0.05, and that's offset by acquisitions net of interest of a couple pennies and then the general business or operations $0.03 is how I would kind of characterize it, if you got midpoint to midpoint.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, if we just completely ripped out Bocom, what would be the adjusted impact in the full year of 2014?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So...","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Is that (49:15) $0.06?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","That's $0.06 per share, year-over-year...","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then be higher in the fourth quarter. I'm not sure I understand because $0.05 is coming up for Bocom, but effectively that will be divested by the next time you guys report. So, I'm just trying understand what the total impact on EPS could be from Bocom.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, year-over-year $0.05. That assumes some profitability in the quarter. Okay.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","We've got it in for the full quarter. If the divestiture takes place, let's say, December 1, for example, it would have some added pressure on earnings, because a lot of the revenue generation is in the month of December, it's just the way the contracts work with the government. But we'll see and we'll talk about that when we get there.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then, the other question I had was just \u2013 it's a broader question. But Dave, could you talk a little bit about just the Safe Schools initiatives. I don't know. You've talked about it a little bit in the past, but just curious where we are maybe with those initiatives and what's the opportunity for Allegion over the next few years from just Safe Schools?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think Safe Schools is predominantly driven by funding. There is movement. The State of California has passed legislation that requires locks with visible signaling capability that you can visually see that is secure for rooms with over five people. But there's still a long way to go on this. We've created a list for consortium and awareness on this. But we're still on the front-end of this initiative. And I think we're providing some good thought leadership in terms of how do we keep students safe, but how do we also create an environment that allows them to exit, if required. I mean, you've got concerns of fire safety as well as violence safety. This is all opportunistic, but it continues to be in its infancy in development and I think lacks funding.","Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Well, nice job and good luck.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Mitchell (51:40) with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sorry, it's Julian Mitchell. Just a question around the European business, trying to understand the margin impact from acquisitions. In Q4, the last couple of years you've had a very strong margin. What sort of margin rate should we expect for Europe right now this quarter exiting the year?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, normally, we don't provide quarterly guidance relative to regions, but given the accretion relative to the acquired businesses and some of the improvements that the business is executed on during the course of the year. North of last year, I mean, you're exactly right. Seasonally, it is the best quarter for that segment of our business. I think it was around 11% or so last year. So, you can expect the results for this quarter to be north of that in aggregate.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thank you. And then, just my follow-up is on the Asia-Pacific. Maybe give us sense of the scale of that business and the profitability ex-Bocom and what the strategy there is from here? Is it sort of consolidating what you have left? Do you look to kind of re-grow with acquisitions off that lowered base?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, think about Asia-Pacific in our mechanical core business $90 million to $100 million, slightly profitable on today's scale. We'll work to put improved profitability and growth into that region similar to what we've done in Europe. I think the thing to remember, Asia-Pacific, from a mechanical electronic standpoint, grew low-double digits in the quarter. So, with our FSH acquisition, the Milre acquisition, we think we're building a base there that can compete. And it's another strategic issue that will go to drive what's our long-term view there. But we think \u2013 we're positive on the region. We think China, India, the whole area will continue to be a growth opportunity for us and will position ourselves over the long term.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. I was also off for a few minutes. So, I apologize if any of this is repetitive. But I just wanted to get a little bit more in the price costs. Patrick, can you give us some idea of how much of the realized price you saw was just kind of actions to counter FX versus kind of real like-for-like price? That's the first question.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, the actions implemented to offset FX predominantly was in Europe, smaller part of our business, but they did see some good price pull through in the quarter. But from an overall perspective, relative to the total company, small impact on price, so the majority of the price improvement you saw coming through in Americas, very little FX related. And so, we would expect with a new price increase announced this quarter, hopefully, that trend to continue going forward.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I'm sorry. I missed it. Did you say the size of that price increase?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Excuse me?","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Did you say the size of that price increase, earlier in the call? I missed that.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","No, we didn't. I mean, the list price is always announced at a higher level. And then when you settle after discounts and rebates, et cetera, it's lower. But normally, we look to try to get a 1% net price improvement year-over-year. That's the target.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then...","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Sometimes, it's difficult to get particularly in the residential segment.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And then you mentioned inflation in your opening remarks. I'm sure there is some meaningful cost deflation in parts of the equation. But net-net, the cost structure is experiencing inflation. Can you provide a little more color on that?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So, the inflation comment really salaries, people-oriented-type costs. Materials year-to-date, I'd say, we're at a net positive when I look at how prices have reacted, particularly given the commodity cost today. I mean, you're looking at spot rates for brass, zinc, copper, et cetera, 20%-plus below last year's average rate. And we would expect to participate in that decline in cost. Keep in mind, our raw material purchases, not a large percentage of our overall material buy. And we do enter into supplier contracts as we've talked about previously. So, no immediate impact on our operating results, but certainly as we look forward to 2016 given where commodity rates are trading today, it should be a positive effect on our margins going forward.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And just one quick one finally and I'll jump off. Just the deals you said are similar in Q2 then Q3, why would that be if you only had kind of a partial quarter impact in Q3? Is there some other purchase accounting or some other dynamic going through or seasonality in the businesses that you bought?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So, it's predominantly the interest impact. So, operationally, much higher uplift on the results, but it's the full-quarter effect on the interest. And we're adding in all the interest costs associated with the $300 million senior notes issued at the end of September. So, you've got the full quarter effect of that offsetting the operational impact.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Got it. Thank you.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Kim with HBK. Your line is now open.","Thomas H. Kim - HBK Investments LP","I'm all set. Thank you.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Tom Martineau for closing remarks.","Tom Martineau - Allegion Plc","Yeah. I'd just like to thank everybody for attending. Again, I apologize for the technical delay that we had earlier in the call, but appreciate everybody's patients as we went through it.

For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide number 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered another strong quarter in Q3 and I'm pleased with our operational performance, which has positioned us well to deliver a solid 2018. Allegion saw a strong top-line revenue growth in the third quarter with strength across all regions. The Americas saw solid volume in both the non-residential and residential businesses, as end-market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals.","Price was very strong in the Americas and remain firmed in Europe. Asia-Pacific saw organic growth rebound nicely in the quarter. Acquisitions continue to contribute to total company revenue growth. Electronics growth globally continues to accelerate and was quite substantial during the quarter, led by the Americas region, which saw nearly 30% growth in electronic products during the quarter. We see the electronics growth outlook continuing to be a long-term positive trend, as more and more products become connected for ease of access.","We are driving price realization and productivity actions in an effort to mitigate the substantial inflationary pressures we are experiencing. We did experience margin declines in the quarter as acquisitions were diluted. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were flat year-over-year. I'm very pleased with our ability to manage those inflationary pressures and maintain organic margins through both pricing and cost actions.","In the third quarter, we delivered robust EPS growth, seeing more than 20% expansion in adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations and tax rate benefits. This EPS performance highlights our continued focus on driving increased shareholder value.","Last, we are raising our outlook for revenue and EPS. Total revenue growth is projected to be between 13% and 13.5%, raising from our previous range of 12.5% to 13.5%. Organic revenue is being increased to a range of 5% to 5.5%, up from the 4% to 5% provided last quarter. For adjusted EPS, we are raising the range to $4.43 to $4.50 per share, bringing up the low end of our previous outlook, which was $4.35 to $4.50.","Please go to slide 5. In Q3, Allegion delivered strong top-line revenue performance. Revenue from the third quarter with $711.5 million, an increase of 16.8%, inclusive of organic growth of 8.5%. Benefits from acquisition also contributed to the top-line revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact.","All regions grew organically. America led the way with organic growth of just over 10% in the quarter, supported by robust growth in electronics, strong pricing, and solid volume in both the nonresidential and residential businesses.","The EMEIA regions saw organic growth of 3.4% and Asia-Pacific organic growth rebounded nicely, coming in at nearly 6%. Adjusted operating margins decreased by 140 basis points due to the dilution related to our acquisitions made earlier this year. Excluding the impact of those acquisitions, the base operating margins were flat year-over-year as the business did a good job of driving price realization and productivity savings to combat continued inflationary pressures.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 increased $0.21 or 20.6% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by our operational performance and a favorable year-over-year tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is up more than $90 million nearly 68%. The prior year discretionary pension funding payment, along with increased earnings, are driving the increase.","Please go to slide 6. Electronic growth continues to accelerate. Our global brands continue to innovate to develop smart solutions across residential and nonresidential markets. One recent example of such innovation is the SimonsVoss SmartHandle AX, which was launched in the third quarter. The SmartHandle AX is a modular handset that leverages the SimonsVoss AX platform. This means the solution has a flexible design that can adapt to different door variants and global standards, while also offering smart features like Bluetooth phone-to-door communication. We are excited that this technology can be leveraged globally because of its adaptability and open architecture.","What's more interesting, the SmartHandle AX has an intrinsic security feature to put users' minds at ease. It fits seamlessly into existing security hardware environments with retrofit features, including door monitoring. At Allegion, innovation in access is an opportunity to put our customers first. Our SimonsVoss SmartHandle AX offers security and compatibility as well as easy installation and extended battery life without compromising design quality.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2018 outlook.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 8.5% organic growth in the third quarter. This high organic growth rate reflects outstanding performance in the Americas region, which saw very good price, solid volumes in both the nonresidential and residential businesses, and nearly 30% growth in electronic products. The significant growth in electronics occurred in both the residential and nonresidential businesses as Allegion continues to be well-positioned to take advantage of the industry trend of moving toward electronic locks and connected security solutions.","Pricing for Allegion, in total, was strong in the quarter and more than offset material inflation, as the company is taking necessary actions to help mitigate the impact of continued inflationary pressures. Third quarter price realization was strong in our Americas and EMEIA businesses, with pricing that was essentially flat in Asia-Pacific.","Overall, I was very pleased with the improvement in pricing, both year-over-year and sequentially. The pricing performance demonstrates the strength in our brands, products and channels. Also, during the third quarter, acquisitions contributed 9% and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all three regions.","Please go to slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $711.5 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 16.8% versus the prior year, up 8.5% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $149 million increased nearly 10% over the same timeframe last year.","Adjusted operating margin of 20.9% decreased 140 basis points with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions. Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were flat year-over-year.","Total inflation slightly exceeded price plus productivity, as price realization and necessary cost containment actions, which drive productivity, helped mitigate the impact of inflationary headwinds. Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 50 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. And while acquisitions were dilutive to margins, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share.","Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2017, reported EPS was $0.94. Adjusting $0.08 for the prior year restructuring expenses, integration cost-related acquisitions and charges related to debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.02.","Operational results increased EPS by $0.11 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.10 with the favorability driven primarily by the favorable impact of tax reform, favorable discrete items and changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions.","Acquisitions contributed $0.02 in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other income and non-controlling interest increased earnings per share by a penny, with favorability from interest offset by the prior-year non-operating gains.","The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.03 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending to take advantage of the accelerating electronic products market, continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment. This results in adjusted third quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.23, an increase of $0.21 or 20.6% compared to the prior year.","Lastly, we have a $0.02 per share reduction for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring as well as adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at third quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.21.","Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $530.1 million, up 16.5% on a reported basis and 10.1% organically. The organic growth was driven by robust growth in electronic products, which came in at nearly 30%. Pricing was also very strong in the quarter, delivering 2.5 points of revenue growth. Both the non-residential and residential businesses saw a solid volume performance. The non-residential business grew low-double digits, excluding acquisitions. Residential experienced high-single digit growth. Acquisitions added 6.6% growth to total revenue.","Americas' adjusted operating income of $154.3 million increased 11.4% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 130 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by the dilutive acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were down slightly year-over-year as price, productivity and volume leverage nearly offset the impact of high inflation and headwinds from incremental investments.","Please go to slide number 11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $134.4 million, up 7.4% and up 3.4% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics driven by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The reported revenue increase was boosted by acquisitions, which more than offset currency headwinds.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $10.2 million increased slightly versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points driven by margin dilution from acquisitions. The base business saw margins increase with volume leverage, price and productivity more than offsetting inflation and incremental investments.","Please go to slide number 12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $47 million, up 61.5% versus the prior year. Organic revenue rebounded nicely, growing at 5.9% and was volume-driven. Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door and Access Business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter.","Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $3.2 million, an increase of $1 million, with adjusted operating margins down 80 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to other regions, dilution from acquisitions drove the margin decline. The base business adjusted operating margins were up slightly, with price and productivity more than offsetting the unfavorable impacts from inflation, incremental investments and mix.","Please go to slide number 13. Year-to-date, available cash flow for the third quarter 2018 was $228.6 million, which is an increase of $92.3 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017, along with higher net earnings and favorable working capital changes.","Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased slightly in the third quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses.","As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million","I'd now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2018 outlook.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide number 14. As noted on the slide, we are updating revenue outlooks for all regions and for the company as a whole. We are raising total and organic revenue growth in the Americas and lowering total and organic revenue growth outlooks for both Europe and Asia. This results in the consolidated outlook for total revenue increasing to a range of 13% to 13.5% and organic revenue increasing to a range of 5% to 5.5%.","If we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid as evidenced by our third quarter results and we continue to see positive indicators in the nonresidential markets with particular strength in institutional verticals, which is expected to continue through 2019.","We expect a strong demand for electronic products, especially residential electronic locks, to continue as more residential consumers desire connected smart access to their homes. European markets are expected to continue to see modest growth driven by electronic products. General European macroeconomic conditions, like consumer and business confidence, remain positive, but are softening. The GDP in all of our key economies are expanding.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we should see solid growth with strength in electronic products. However, the markets in our Australia and New Zealand businesses have slowed. The total revenue growth for Asia-Pacific will continue to be bolstered by the acquired GWA Door and Access businesses. We expect inflationary pressures to continue for the remainder of the year. The Americas price increase put in place during the quarter has gained good traction and will continue to help mitigate the impacts of inflation.","We are raising our reported earnings per share outlook to a range of $4.23 to $4.35 up from $4.15 to $4.35. And we're also raising adjusted earnings per share to $4.43 to $4.50, up from the previous range of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14%.","As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million. The outlook assumes the full year tax rate to be approximately 14.5% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million. As noted, there is no change to our assumption for investment spend in the outlook. It remains at $0.15 per share.","Please go to slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q3 performance, total revenue grew nearly 17%. Organic revenue grew 8.5%. Adjusted operating margins were down 140 basis points and were flat when excluding the impact of acquisitions. Adjusted EPS saw more than 20% growth in the quarter. End market fundamentals in the Americas remain strong.","Now, I and Patrick will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Maybe a first question around the margin impact of inflation relative to price and productivity, similar to Q2, it was a slight headwind, I guess, to margins in Q3. How are you thinking about that spread into Q4 and then, particularly, into next year as tariffs continue to rise?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, Julian, as you indicated, Q3 on a dollars basis, we're a little bit underwater, not significantly. So, I think the team, in aggregate, has done a really good job to help mitigate the inflationary headwinds with incremental pricing. And you saw the price realization come in extremely strong, particularly in Americas. So, really good progress there. As you're aware, we're starting to see the inflation, particularly as it relates to inputs on commodities, to be more stable. And with the incremental price realization, we'd anticipate Q4 to be slightly positive. So, we're starting to turn the corner is how I would suggest in Q4.","As we look out going forward, the way I would think about it, you really need to look at the components of both price and your assumptions for inflation. As you saw in Q3, outstanding price realization, north of 2%, that provides a very good backdrop and tailwind, if you will, in terms of price improvement, particularly in the first half of next year, which you may recall this year, we only had about a 1% price improvement year-over-year in the first half. So, good tailwind there.","In inflation, again, material stabilized. So if you assume there's not a big increase relative to the current spot rates, which if you look, by the way, whether it be steel, brass or zinc, the current spot rates are anywhere from 10% to 20% lower than the peak spot rates in earlier this year. So, I'd expect lower inflation next year. And so, what's the net of all this mean? It means that we should see significant improvement in terms of the price\/cost dynamic in 2019 going forward, and that should help us in margin accretion for next year. I think it sets us up well.","One other thing I'll note is that, keep in mind, you're seeing margin dilution from this price\/cost dynamic because, essentially, we're holding flat, offsetting inflation with price. And the tyranny of the math, if you will, suggests that you're going to have margin dilution, maybe not dollars, but certainly margin dilution if you're not getting more than 20% north of your inflation.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. That's very clear. And then, my second and last question will just be on the Americas region; in particular, noticed the higher investment spend as a headwind in Q3. When you think about the Americas overall as a region, is there anything that in terms of market structure or competition or investment requirements that means that your margins have kind of peaked or do you see a good path still for margin expansion in the medium term in the Americas?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Still see opportunity for margin expansion, just as I've mentioned, getting margin accretion associated with this price inflation dynamic. Also, the incremental margin on volume is still quite strong, 40-plus percent. Don't see any pressure as it relates to pricing that would deteriorate that going forward; and, the market fundamentals, extremely strong, particularly in Americas. So, there's nothing that I could see that would suggest any margin dilution or we're peaked on margin going forward.","As you think about investments, we will continue to invest in the business. There's opportunities to drive the business faster, I would say, particularly around electronics in terms of demand creation. And we'll continue to look at those opportunities. And there'll be more color provided on next quarter's conference call. But I think we've got good opportunity to continue margin accretion as well \u2013 not only the base business, but the acquisitions as we continue to accelerate those and fold them into our specification writing capabilities, I think that's going to provide us good opportunities as well as operational excellence improvements.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just maybe take a step back here for a second. I think at your Analyst Day last year, you reiterated your long-term EPS growth algorithm of 10%. And I know there are a lot of moving pieces, particularly around price\/cost, and maybe a bit more macro agita than we had a quarter or two ago. But, Dave, you talked about still having strong visibility in institutional, that that continues into 2019. Is there any reason from what you see today that that shouldn't be still a reliable starting point for people to think about that EPS growth algorithm over the next, call it, year plus?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We stand behind our long-term outlook in terms of EPS growth. We were strong this morning in our belief in end markets, and especially around the institutional piece. You can look at education, healthcare and areas that we do well in; I like the outlook for 2019.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then, just a follow-up on an electromech, 30%'s a big number and I know not the most \u2013 the largest installed base out there, or the largest base, but anything new either on the product side or new channels that we should think about as maybe that 30% cascades out for a couple more quarters?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think...","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Something like it.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Especially, in U.S. res, you see acceleration, because of new entrants, because of things like last-mile delivery. But I think the maturity of the keyless world continues to develop globally. We're extremely pleased with our electronic development globally, but a bright line shining on SimonsVoss and Interflex. We think this market has a decade run. And when you start thinking about access as an opportunity, smart devices, the proliferation of cell phone, smart credentials will redefine access in the next decade. And we think Allegion's in a great position, along with the security industry, to be able to take advantage of that.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. I would just add too, Josh, that if you think about the trend here, this is a, as we've indicated, low penetration on electronic locks and home, we'll call it high-single digits. And so, that provides for a good backdrop for continued growth. And just a reminder that we're not as dependent upon new construction in the resi market, a lot of our sell-through is DIY. And so, I just think there is significant opportunity, as homes become more connected, to accelerate this whole electronics growth. Good secular trend, not as dependent upon new construction going forward.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate the color, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Hi. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, John.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Hey. So, wanted to ask a question about the strong free cash flow generation as we think about the deployment of that and maybe you can give us a little bit of color on how your pipeline looks. Obviously, you've been able to successfully get several deals here done in the year. But how does that look kind of going forward? And do you have the ability to kind of continue to do deals given that you are integrating a few right now, even though they're smaller?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, number one, pleased with the cash flow generation of the business, especially the core. We challenged our teams in January that we expected better inventory management on the core business, and they've done a good job to optimize that. And it's showing on the bottom line in terms of cash. Expect us to go in and drive improvements in the acquisition side of what we're acquiring as well.","I think, two, when you move (32:21) how we'll deploy that cash, the acquisition pipeline continues to be active, robust. We did six acquisitions in the first half. So, we're in the process of digesting those, but our people continue to develop the relationships that complement that pipeline. I think we're more mindful in terms of the access in the future and how electronic, software and systems can help leverage our core business.","With that said, assets are expensive in the M&A pipeline. And we've said that if we can't deploy that cash, we will return it in terms of share buybacks and dividends to our shareholders.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Thank you. And then, maybe just following back on an earlier question around tariffs and the outlook going forward. Clearly, the spot rate today, obviously, if we run the math forward, but how would you contemplate or how would you react if we do see that List 3 kind of increase in \u2013 as we think about next year?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, the first point is that we do not have significant exposure on imports from China. It's predominantly on fighter brands, accessories, those type of things, because we do a lot of region insource and manufacturing. So, I'd say, low exposure from an overall perspective. On the materials that we do import here to the U.S., we have a couple alternatives to mitigate. One is find alternative sources of supply, which we're working on. And two is to mitigate it by a price increase.","And with the products that are impacted by the L3, we have already gone out and announced a price increase effective December 1 and to help mitigate that. So when I look at the impact for 2019, I would say the expectation is it will be offset entirely, i.e., no impact; and then for the balance of this year, minimal impact, if any.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I'd reemphasize, our North American supply chain is local, in North America. And it gives us some of the best margins in our industry that we continue to focus on to meet customer requirements and drive productivity. We think it's a good setup. We work to try and emulate that globally, where we can have competitive supply chains that helped us put up industry-leading margins.","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Rob Aurand, on for David today.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","I guess just looking at mix within the Americas, can you talk about kind of the growth you're seeing in the premium brands versus the fighter brands?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. I would say, similar across the board, premium may be a little bit stronger, particularly as institutional markets recover. And that, as you know, is a really good trend from an overall market demand, because we got favorable mix there. Strength across all the brands and product categories, maybe the premium brands doing a little bit better than the fighter brands. But we're seeing good growth, particularly as it relates to our channel-led initiative on the discretionary business here in the U.S., which is more of a lower price point type of product. So, overall, strong growth in all the brands and products.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And obviously, acquisitions are dilutive right now. Can you give us a sense of when could the current acquisitions become accretive to margins?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, the expectation is that we would begin to see some benefits next year as we continue to integrate those businesses and leverage a little bit more on top-line growth. So, I would expect some year-over-year improvement. The margin profile of those acquisitions collectively aren't at the aggregate margins that we see today, but they should begin to show some positive incremental improvement next year, if you're looking at it a year-over-year basis.","Robert Aurand - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Please go ahead.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Tim.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, just circling back to the electronics growth. Just that 30%, that's an organic number?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, is there a way just to think about how the growth rate kind of compares on the residential side and maybe the commercial side within electronics?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, we're not going to give specific numbers, but resi a little bit higher than the non-resi piece.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then just my follow up, you talked about some pretty strong institutional visibility. How about some of the commercial markets as you go into 2019?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think it's no secret that the commercial environment is peaked. We still see opportunities in that market. 800 hotel rooms announced last Sunday here in Indianapolis would be an example of that. We think our product positioning gives us the opportunity to continue the growth along with our channel initiatives. But as you think about 2019, healthcare, education look favorable. Our quotation activity looks favorable and we'll continue to take what the commercial market gives us as we move forward.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Well, good luck on the rest of the year, I guess. Thanks.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","See you in a couple of weeks.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Definitely.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. This is Ron Jewsikow on for Rich.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Just drilling down a bit further on the M&A dilution in the Americas, because it was a pretty sizable step-up versus last quarter's headwind, we're calculating an operating margin on the acquired business a little under 10%. First, is that correct? And second, what's included in that figure such as (39:29) or integration cost or anything like that?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So, that would be fairly close. Keep in mind, there's heavy amortization expense associated with intangibles. So, really, on a cash basis, EBITDA is the mid-teens \u2013 mid to high teens. And so, hey, look, the performance of the business under a little bit of pressure, like we mentioned, associated with the base business in terms of higher inflation, those type of things. And I would expect those businesses, again, as that subsides a little bit more, to improve margins going forward.","Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate that color. And then, just a follow up. I know you guys have been hesitant to give this in the past, but given where we are right now I think for resi, can you provide new construction versus reno split, or how much of resi sales are direct to the builder channel?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. Ron, when you look at our residential business, we're more aftermarket than new construction. So definitely, north of 50% is aftermarket, the biggest channel being through big-box retailers. We don't give the exact amount, but as you think of our business, it's not as tied to new build at all.","Ron J. Jewsikow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. At the GSX conference where you folks demonstrated some of your new products and businesses, one of the things that we spent a lot \u2013 a long time on was your Overtur spec-writing system. To the extent that you can talk about it, number one, what is the game plan in terms of integrating existing, want to call it, organic company with new acquisitions into that spec, you want to call it, collaborative spec-writing capability? And number two, what markets do you think that this new system will affect first as we take a look at what seems to be a technology step ahead of the competition?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, thanks for pointing out our development of Overtur. It's a system that helps our spec writers connect with architects and designers. It's something that we've been developing over the last year here at Allegion. Number one, look for us to expand that into acquisitions integrations as we move forward. Number two, if you think about the world of specification, especially with architects, new architects entering the space expect to be connected digitally. And we think Overtur is a nice step up for that. It provides features that drive efficiencies in terms of the design and project management, and it will help us put, what I would describe, hooks in that design phase and build on the competitive advantage that already exist.","Allegion, particularly in the Americas, has one of the strongest spec-writing capabilities and investing in digital tools to advance that's the right step. We like our position there.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Also, if I could just ask a question about one of the smaller acquisitions that you made, a company that we've worked with in the past, ISONAS. They're known for essentially having, if you want to call it, their power reader-controllers, basically supplanting one big box that you had to put at the door. What markets are they, or you in conjunction now, working toward to start introducing that product through Allegion?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, I don't know that I'd want to show my hand there, but we believe, around the institutional markets advancing our wireless access technologies, that that's a perfect fit for us. And you think about the sets of products that we have in terms of wireless access design, we like how that can advance us in our growth in that segment, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. I don't have a third question to ask, but I will get you guys back on this later. Thank you very much.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Maybe you can appreciate that I just don't want to throw my cards on the table there.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","I understand that. Okay. Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","Andrew, do we have another caller in the queue?","Operator","Yes. We do have a question from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. So, just talking about that 30% growth in electronics this quarter, obviously, nice uptick. Maybe \u2013 if you could maybe just provide a little bit more color. What do you think is really driving that growth? Is this kind of like a new normal? Is there any color around whether it's product introductions or different channels that you're selling through would be helpful.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, I'd point to a couple areas, (45:42) overall broad awareness. Last mile delivery, smart doorbells, all starts with dialog, does your front door connect as well as my front door. I think second is the advancement of e-commerce. Whether it's Home Depot, Amazon, our e-commerce channels are growing extremely nicely, and this is a click-and-play type product. I think our brand is significant here. There has been some research out in the market that talks about the importance of brand awareness in the market. And we think the Schlage brand, our star ratings, if you look into some of that, the highest star ratings with the most reviews on our products are things that line up nicely for Allegion.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. No, that makes sense, Dave. And maybe since you brought it up, any color you can give on Amazon Key, your product introductions, I think, you're still scheduled for later this year. Any update on that would be helpful.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We will have a product available imminently that's compatible with Amazon Key. That was our commitment, and we're there.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","And let me add a little bit to that. We are compatible with a variety of operating systems, and we'll have a release in this quarter that connects with a world that's moving all the time.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions, and have a great day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Sir, you may begin.","Tom Martineau","Thank you, Amanda and good morning. Welcome and thank for joining us for the third quarter 2014 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release which was issued last night after market close and the presentation, which we will refer to in today\u2019s call, are available on our website www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results.

We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the 2013 quarterly information in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation for further details.","With that, please go to slide three, and I will turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with the performance of Allegion in the third quarter. Our team delivered solid operational leverage with a nice increase in demand. Revenue were 546 million up 6.8% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 6.4% on an organic basis. The American region led the way with 8.5% organic growth with increases in non-residential, residential and Latin American segments.","Adjusting operating income of 110 million increased 15.4% versus last year, all regions contributed margin improvement resulting in an increase of adjusted operating margin of 150 basis points for the company. We delivered reporting earnings per share of $0.64 which includes $0.04 of restructuring and one-time separation cost resulting in an adjusted earnings per share of $0.68. This is an increase of 41.7% versus the prior year. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance which is now forecasted to be $2.37 to $2.42 on an adjusted basis and $2.07 to $2.12 on a reported basis. This earnings forecast assumes adjusted revenue growth of approximately 4.5%. Please go to slide four.","We continue to focus on our key growth strategies that create practical solutions and innovative products that meet our customer needs. We\u2019re making great progress in Europe and although we are seeing additional market headwinds, I am pleased with the continued improvement in margin performance.","Our focus on key markets improving the portfolio and management of the internal cost structure are continuing to resolve in improved financial results.","In the Americas, we began to pilot initiative focused on the commercial repair and renovation segment. Specifically this would be the portion of the market that focus on fast moving quick ship delivery. Historically this has been an underserved market for Allegion consistent with our strategy on core market expansion we will look to position ourselves in the channel to enjoy a bigger part of this large market segment.","Capital allocation management continues to be a key element on our measurement of success for the business, Patrick will provide and update on this a little later. Please go to slide five.","Allegion continues to lead the way as businesses and residential consumers are increasingly choosing electronic locks and credentials. As we see this convergent across the globe we are now experiencing what we\u2019re calling the keyless era which is all about convenience. Our solutions are redefining the way people connect with and control their homes and offices. We launched our latest advancement engaged technology at the [ASIS] conference in September.","ENGAGE technology delivers a new level of security, connectivity and convenience to commercial office buildings and tenant spaces. ENGAGE technology provides a solution that is not only easy install, manage and use but it also affordable. Cloud-based mobile and web app make it easy to manage locks and users from anywhere supporting the growth or changing needs of a business or building. The Schlage NDE wireless lock fits a standard cylindrical door and can be installed in a few minutes with just a screwdriver. ENGAGE technology provides opportunity to expand in underserved markets. We will begin shipping in the US in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll expand globally in the future.","Later this year, we\u2019ll expand our keyless era offerings with several products that continue to redefine the way people enter, exit and connect with their homes.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I\u2019ll be back to update you on our full year 2014 outlook.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks Dave and good morning everyone and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Please go to slide number six.","Reported net revenues for the quarter were $546.7 million reflecting the increase of 3.3% versus the prior year. Adjusting prior periods for a previously discussed order flow change with our consolidated joint venture in Asia, net revenues increased $34.6 million or 6.8% versus the prior year.","Organic revenue growth which excludes the impact of our recent acquisitions, the UK door divestiture and foreign exchange rate fluctuations was up 6.4%. We\u2019ve realized high single-digit growth in the Americas with growth in all segments of the market, US commercial and residential segments increased mid-single-digits with Latin America up significantly primarily due to incremental price realization in Venezuela to offset inflation. EMEA revenues were down slightly in the quarter as geopolitical unrest and currency volatility late in the quarter created market headwinds. Asia Pacific revenues were up mid-single-digits driven primarily from an acquisition which occurred in the second quarter.","Adjusted operating income of $110.4 million increased 15.4% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.2% reflects an increase of 150 basis points versus the prior year reflecting good operating leverage on incremental revenues. We are extremely pleased with the incremental operating leverage of the business particularly as we continue to make incremental growth investments for new products and channel development in order to accelerate our earnings growth and return on capital.","Please go to slide number seven. The slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2013 reported EPS was a negative $0.81 adjusting for prior year restructuring a land sale gain and an asset impairment the 2013 adjusted EPS was $0.48, operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as pricing, productivity, and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. Note that the pricing actions were taken in the quarter to offset increased inflation particularly in Venezuela. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 29% grow $0.21 per share improvement versus the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of pretax income as well as adjustments made in the third quarter of 2013.","The next slide reflects the reduction of $0.06 per share related to the incremental interest expense incurred as a result of the additional indebtedness associated with the spin-off (inaudible) ramp.","Next, incremental investments and ongoing growth in corporate initiatives tie to our strategy specific to taxes and M&A were a $0.04 reduction. Of note, the volume benefit shown earlier on the reconciliation more than offsets the incremental investment. Increase non-controlling interest and a higher number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding in aggregate represented a $0.04 reduction in EPS. This results in adjusted third quarter 2014 EPS of $0.68 per share. Continuing on, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for restructuring and spin related expenses to arrive at the third quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.64.","Please go to slide number eight. Third quarter revenues for the Americas region were $423.1 million up 9% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of Venezuela and price increases revenues were up 5.8% on an adjusted basis. Removing the impact of acquisition and foreign currency, organic revenue was up 8.5%. Higher volumes, Venezuela pricing and the acquisition of Schlage, Colombia in January 2014 offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada.","All market segments delivered incremental volume growth, volumes improved in the commercial segment by mid-single digits as we began activities in the US markets to build repair and renovation capability with our channel partners as well as some incremental business ahead of announced price increase effective October 6. US residential growth in the mid-single digits was driven by the strength in the global markets. America\u2019s adjusted operating income of $122.9 million was up 12.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 80 basis points due to favorable volume leverage, price and productivity that more than offset inflation and ongoing investments in new product and channel development.","Please go to slide number nine. As we review the EMEA results, please keep in mind our UK door businesses have been moved to discontinued operations. Third quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $89.5 million down 2.8% and down 0.9% on an organic basis. Favorable currency movement early in the quarter offset unfavorable September impacts. We anticipate exchange rates will continue to be a headwind in the fourth quarter would note that most of our expenses are also in the region and we\u2019ll minimize the associated margin impact. Markets continue to be soft in the region in most major countries. EMEA adjusted operating income of $1.2 million was up 129% versus the prior year.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 1.3% up 570 basis points. Favorable pricing, productivity in excess of inflation and foreign currency exchange movements offset increased investment spending and unfavorable volume leverage. The benefits of previously announced restructuring the region supported the increase in productivity, this quarter represents the fourth quarter in a row in which the region has improved operating margin performance. Year-to-date, adjusted operating profit has improved by $10 million or 350 basis points.","Please go to slide number 10. Third quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $34.1 million up 6.9% and up 1.9% on an organic basis. The revenue growth was primarily due to the acquisition of FSH hardware volumes grew in the North Asia, Australia and New Zealand regions lower systematic ration revenues were mostly timing driven as ending Q3 backlog was strong. As announced yesterday, Bocom System won a significant safe city project valued at approximately $25 million. Asia Pacific adjusted operating margin of negative $500,000 was up $400,000 versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved a 130 basis points. The improvement in margin was driven by the FSH acquisition and improved business mix.","Please go to slide number 11. We generated a $135 million of available cash flow year-to-date. The decrease in available cash versus 2013 reflects incremental capital expenditures for new product development, information systems and spin related projects. As you can see from the graphs, we continue to demonstrate effective working capital management as well as improvements in our cash convergent cycle. We continue to target available cash flow for the year to approximate 100% of net earnings from continuing operations.","Please go to slide number 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, I want to take a moment to reaffirm our commitments to a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy. We ended Q3 with the gross debt-to-EBITDA of 2.9 against the target range of 2.75 to 3.25 and earlier this month we announced the amendment of our existing credit facility that lowers our cost of capital and assuming constant LIBOR rates will result in approximately 5 million with annualized interest expense savings. We continue to fund incremental investments through organic growth through new product development and channel strategies to accelerate core market expansion. We remain focused on acquisition opportunities in emerging markets, emerging technologies and product portfolio expansion. Integration of previous acquisitions are on track and they are making contributions for our financial results. We\u2019re making good progress on developing our acquisition pipeline, tighter or long term strategy as well as developing our competencies globally in this area.","We will continue to view shareholder distribution as a key component of the allocation. The company has repurchased approximately 1 million shares year-to-date for $50.3 million. Please go to slide number 13. You\u2019ll remember the slide from our Investor Day when we discussed our effective tax rate expectations. We continue to view our structure as a strategic asset of the company that we can leverage to facilitate operating strategies and to achieve a lower effective tax rate to accelerate earnings as well as cash flow growth. We ended 2013, with an effective tax rate of approximately 38% this was a result of tax essentially being prepared on a standalone or statutory rate basis.","Our first communication for 2014 was that we anticipated an effective rate of 31% and then updated our guidance last quarter to reflect a 30% rate. Subsequent to this, we\u2019ve continued our tax strategy and planning efforts and we now anticipate a full year 2014 tax rate to be approximately 28%. The reduction from a prior guidance was a result of accelerating the execution of tax planning strategies. And as we\u2019ve discussed previously we set an initial target of a mid-20 rate by 2016. I\u2019m happy to report that we will exceed this target by 2015 a year earlier than originally anticipated. And I\u2019d also like to add that we do not see any impact or tax strategy with regard to recent inversion and Irish tax legislation changes.","This was all made possible by the efforts of our strong tax team which evaluated and prioritized opportunities and invested appropriately to support the accelerated reduction in the effective tax rate. In addition, based on what has been achieved and a better view of the opportunities we have revised the objective to be below 20% by 2016.","I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2014 guidance.","Dave Petratis","Thanks Patrick. Please go to slide 14. For 2014 we expect revenues to be up approximately 4.5% for the full year. In the Americas, we expect high single-digit residential revenue growth and strong Venezuelan growth driven by pricing actions to offset material and other inflation. And although we realized nice growth in the quarter we still only expect modest non-residential revenue increases for the full year as institutional market recovery continues at a very slow pace.","Our outlook for Europe revenue growth is now at negative 2% slightly worse than previous expectations. This reflects the net impact of our portfolio pruning, the currency exchange headwind that began in September and general market softness. Of note increased geopolitical uncertainty in the region continues to limit overall recovery and is an obstacle for a sustained growth. Given our system integration backlog exit in Q3, we are guiding to the revenue growth of approximately 10% in Asia Pacific region as previously announced our Asia Pacific team to our Bocom System brands and an alliance with China Telecom one the Wuhu, Citi Skynet project valued at approximately 25 million. This project continues our success with safe city projects in China.","Please go to slide 15. We are increasing our 2014 EPS guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecast to be in the range of $2.37 to $2.42 an increase of 10% to 12% from 2013 adjusted earnings per share. This is driven by operational improvements, European actions and a reduction in the effective tax rate while investing and positioning the company for future growth. Restructuring spin cost and the write off of debt issuance cost related to the amended credit facility are expected to be approximately $0.30 of the impact during the year resulting in an EPS range of $2.07 to $2.12.","The effective tax rate assumption in the guidance is approximately 28% and outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. Finally, the guidance does not reflect the potential risk of a devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar. For more information on this topic, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the period ended September 30, 2014.","I know everyone is interested in 2015 and we are in the process of developing our guidance and we\u2019ll provide more detail in our next earnings call. I can assure that we expect modest growth to continue next year with a continued slow March to recovery. U.S. residential markets are still a number of years away from what I believe to be a normal construction level of 1.5 million homes. And we are planning on unpredictable non-residential recovery but are positioned well to meet demand if recovery exceeds expectations in the year.","Where we still see meaningful European growth occurring after 2015 we believe the 2015 European market will remain flat to negative driven by weak GDP growth political uncertainty and high debt levels. And the Asia Pacific market will continue to be one of the strongest growth regions albeit at a slower pace than recent history. Our plan for double-digit earnings growth in the business remains given the solid business fundamentals margin enhancement opportunity particularly in Europe and the tax rate reduction. Please go to slide 16.","So to summarize I was pleased with the results and solid performance in the third quarter, we demonstrated the strong leverage potential of the company given revenue growth. We continue to focus on what matters, leaving the electro-mechanical convergence, driving core market expansion, improving European profitability, executing our tax strategy and driving on a balance and flexible capital allocation plan. I feel good about where we are in our first year and we are positioned for fourth quarter and long-term success. Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Yes, good morning everyone.","Dave Petratis","Good morning David.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","North America strong performance so you had very strong incremental margins so I\u2019m just wondering was that the Venezuelan FX or could you just talk about the factors behind those strong incrementals?","Dave Petratis","Yes so I would say Venezuela they contributed a little bit to the market improvements, we\u2019ve done a really good job in terms of offset inflation or price improvements exceeding inflation so there is some contribution there. So we\u2019ve been really pleased with the operating leverage in our core facilities here in Americas both on the commercial and residential side. So I think you\u2019re seeing a really good uplift in margins as associated with the incremental volume primarily. Good productivity offsetting inflation.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","I guess it looks like you\u2019re leveraging off investments that maybe you\u2019ve made in the past and so you had less incremental costs associated with those revenues, how much further sort of run rate you have in front of you on this, how much could we see incremental margins stay strong like this for the next couple of quarters or is it longer?","Dave Petratis","I think we\u2019re leveraging investing of the past if you look at the roof line take outs and lean implementations in North America that have been driven over the last few years, we proved in Q3 that increased revenues have significant leverage capabilities in the company and as markets returned to normal we\u2019re very positive on our potential.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah and I would just add a lot of the incremental margin will also be dependent upon our future investments. So we\u2019ve always kind a say we try to balance the two making sure we get some incremental margin associated with the incremental investments that drives future growth. So in the future you may not see such a big increase but it\u2019s all going to be dependent upon the level of investments we put in the business.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay thanks for that. And then just secondly, can you just talk about within North American and your non-res business velocity through the quarter and how October may fit into that.","Dave Petratis","I thought we commercially went out and took the opportunities that were on the table. I wouldn\u2019t call it velocity, the market was there we are able to convert it. We talk about in the discussion this morning that we believe there is growth opportunity in the fast moving true stock businesses. I felt in coming into the business that there was an opportunity there we\u2019ve ran some cast regions and what we called pro-express and the results were favorable. So in markets that maybe uncertain we\u2019re working hard and what I call self-help to get more than our fair share and this R&R like commercial space.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Would that account for the increase spend and the finished goods inventories?","Dave Petratis","A little bit but not significantly.","David MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Robert Berry with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open.","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Hey guys good morning.","Dave Petratis","Good morning","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Nice work on the tax rate. Maybe I wanted to actually just start there and clarify it sounds like the outlook now for 2015 is that the rate would be below the mid-20s.","Dave Petratis","Yeah that\u2019s correct. I think a good way to think about it this year we\u2019re ending about a 28% effective tax rate we\u2019ve got a glide path and pretty good visibility by 2016 to get to 20%. The majority of that reduction of 8 points you would see next year.","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","And would you expect it to kind of filtering gradually through the year or should we just assume for the whole year whatever you\u2019re going to assume below the mid-20s.","Dave Petratis","So we\u2019ll give more specific guidance in our fourth quarter earnings call relative to the annualized effective tax rate, but you will see it pretty much the whole year. As we continue to execute additional strategies and there will be some added benefits during the course of the year, but most of that will come in beginning of the year.","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","And what\u2019s the rate you\u2019re assuming in 4Q.","Dave Petratis","We\u2019re about with the full year effective tax rate of 28% or about 24% for the quarter.","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","24% okay. And then maybe just shifting focus to the Americas region it sounds like well it was very solid in quarter very good volume growth. But it sounds like there is some real caution around 4Q and easing. Is that just conservatism or was there strength in 3Q that was a little abnormal you don\u2019t seeing carrying forward.","Dave Petratis","I believe this recovery is been one of the choppiest of my business career. So we\u2019re cautioned, our business softens in Q4 and in the Q1 just because of the construction season we\u2019ve got to be mindful of that. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on this commercial R&R through stock capability that will take several quarters and years to really master but I feel good about our position.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah and then I would also add looking at the results is probably a little pull forward from Q4 and to Q3 in conjunction with our previously announced price increase that went into effect the first week in October. And if they talked about this repair replacement market, the new promo that we had in the market there for that so.","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","And then just finally a clarification on the impact from Venezuela price in the quarter. Is that just over a 3% or what was the impact from Venezuela on pricing in Americas?","Patrick Shannon","So Venezuela price increase was basically if you look at the total increase for Americas up about 2.7% and our pricing all of that was associated with Venezuela. So commercial and residential were essentially flat for the quarter.","Robert Berry \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Right. Okay, great thank you.","Dave Petratis","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Thank you and good morning fellas.","Dave Petratis","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Good morning. Just a couple of questions back to the repair and renovation opportunity. As you stepped into that how is your view evolving on actually the size of the opportunity. And have you seen any competitive response obviously your gain there is someone else is paying and just wonder what the market reaction is if you\u2019ve seen that yet.","Dave Petratis","We have size the opportunity we put it $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. We think we get less than our in title share of that have not seen the competitive response. I think you\u2019re familiar with the electrical industry. Having stock on the shelf and managing that through stock business have been neglected in our business model and believe that we can flex our capability there and whether a competitive response.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Have you size your revenues there now current.","Dave Petratis","Say it again.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","What\u2019s your revenue take in that piece of the market currently.","Dave Petratis","I would more from a share perspective low single-digits. You get into the institutional and new construction we go up 25% to 30%. So we think there is gain there. We think we\u2019ve got some opening price points. Product gaps that we\u2019ve got a deal with but we see it is very opportunistic.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","And I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on institutional you gave some \u2013 color there, but sounds like we\u2019re still just kind a bumping along the bottom is that fair or do you see a little bit of a turn have thing. Just a color.","Dave Petratis","I am bumping along the bottom with it, we\u2019re cautious I would say 2015 will lean positively, but this is a slow grind to normalization.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Yeah. And then just one last one and then I\u2019ll move on for Patrick. Patrick should we expect to cash taxes to come down and locks up with just kind of what\u2019s going on in the P&L.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah that the delta between book provision and cash should be relatively same actually cash will be lower this year so yes, it\u2019s at. So as the tax rate comes down that provides obviously more cash flow for the business to invest for future growth. So it\u2019s a good thing.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Yeah thanks and good morning all.","Dave Petratis","Good morning.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Maybe just on the tax rate. What is the is there any US margin impact overtime as part of your strategy in other words do you see any headwinds to US margins as you start to down this tax rate path more aggressively.","Patrick Shannon","So as you guys know the majority of our pretax income is US centric. As we look into our strategy and kind of looking at what we think the potential rate can be in the future. We did not take into account any significant change in the mix of earnings. So that wasn\u2019t take in account. But as our businesses grow internationally and we improve the results at both Europe and Asia. I mean that will help a rate a little bit but not significantly.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, alright. And secondly on EMEA, could you maybe give us a little more depth on is there progress there. Clearly you talked about weak markets one of your competitors noted I think 3% organic for themselves for they\u2019re more Northern European weighted. What in terms of how should we think about kind of market impact versus the things you\u2019re doing yourself consciously to narrow your scope and drive prior margins in the future?","Patrick Shannon","I think you\u2019re probably familiar that we trend the portfolio in the UK with our door business. Our numbers are adjusted for that. It what you see is the softening of the business. I talk about that there is five or six markets that we\u2019re really well positioned in Italy, Spain is the example Greece. These are weak markets I\u2019ve certainly would trade some of the economic growth in Northern Europe. We think our Interflex business which is more access control is driving some growth but as we look at the overall space we\u2019re not encouraged that the markets is gone help us.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Well I guess the question from me then is the 6% and 19% goal as you\u2019ve called out previously. Are they still do they still apply a very much they did or any change in thinking on that front.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah so the way I would characterize it is a lot of good progress this year should be up 300 basis points relative to last year\u2019s numbers. We\u2019ve got some restructuring benefit that will carryover in next year that will give us nice tailwind there. I\u2019ve got pretty good line of site to like an 8% margin basis of current volume. If you kind a look at the opportunities in terms of we still have a couple of unprofitable segments in the business that we can change. Taking a rightful shot approach from a pricing perspective not only markets centric but also looking at specific customers and then accelerating our productivity on the lean initiatives. To get to the 10% goal still have some wood to chop, but I think we can get there, but that would be on a kind of a flat volume relative to today. If markets continue to weakened and we\u2019ve got some pressure on volumes that will put pressure on live margin of 10%.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","And Patrick what timeframe is that 8% around.","Patrick Shannon","That would that\u2019s a 2016 again good line of sight that. And need to execute some additional initiatives to put bridge the gap to 10%.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Right 2016 average margin though right.","Patrick Shannon","Yes, yes.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, alright. I\u2019ll hand it off thanks.","Patrick Shannon","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Great thank you. Good morning guys, taking behalf of Jeff Kessler today. Two real quick questions, the first one regarding Europe. Potentially as you\u2019re looking at the discretion improvement and trend in Europe. Many of the integrators that are out there right now would likely choose between an Allegion, [Alsa] and [Caba]. What are you doing right now essentially to be able to raise the overall profile with the distributors?","Dave Petratis","Great question. Number one is a more work around our specifying capability. We were hanging on what I call three stock model you\u2019ve got a create demands from specification. Our partnership with [Eco Sholtek] is a good example of that they\u2019ve got an outstanding lean door offering and it gives us the opportunity to go in to specifies and talk about products that compete on fast and allows us to pull through stock products. So more work to do that some model investment. As I think about specifying pulls I tend to like to have people in a common room that are going out to customers versus one in Paris one in Bellona, one in Madrid. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re working. Second would be transferring some of our own lean initiatives to make that we\u2019re \u2013 our cycle times are shortened our delivery commitments are solid it would be a couple of areas.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Great thank you. The other question I had was and sticking with the Europe itself. Interflex you guys have mentioned this previously this was the business that\u2019s been pre-sheltered with a relatively decentralized management team under in [crystal] obviously. So over the last 14 and 16 years the margins though if I recall the margins have been up for this business. Is there any other update that you guys are able to provide us we feel like this is a much better business model now than it was previously under the previous management team.","Dave Petratis","Well thanks for that. If you visit us at the [SN] Show in Germany Interflex presented as a standalone company. We have named a new general manager for that business and with an effort to trying get them some oxygen I want to look at them and their performance and we\u2019ve set them up to do that. The second thing that we\u2019re really transforming there and it\u2019s part of our restructuring is they were trying to use direct go-to market model out of Germany and it was not working.","We push them towards the VAR model it\u2019s in its infancy but I believe it\u2019s the right path. When I was at the [SN] Show I had the opportunity to speak with AON, the large insurance group Airbus, large auto manufacturers that we\u2019ve been successful with. They love the product they love the support we just need to get that out of the \u2013 beyond the German borders we think the VAR model helps us do that. Good little asset in that European portfolio.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Great. Well I have one more question sorry. As looking at essentially the electronic locks in the access control industry (inaudible) it for that business essentially somewhere about ballpark of \u2013 little bit lower than the mechanical side. I envision that would reverse to some point. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace that could help us better understand that.","Dave Petratis","Ask me that question once more.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Sure as you\u2019re looking at the electronic locks in the access control business overall, the margins tend to be say 8% to 15% lower than the mechanical side. It could be functionally possibly hard complexity as well. And that I would envision would likely reverse to some point. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace right now that can provide us more color within that?","Dave Petratis","As I think about our ENGAGE technology and the NDE platform. In my mind it opens up opportunities to-date. Yes you\u2019re right it\u2019s the margins could be a bit softer than our mechanical. But it creates a new market opportunity it\u2019s like going from analog phones to digital phones. It\u2019s like going from cable TV to satellite I means it\u2019s we\u2019re opening up new markets people were not considering automating their locks because you had very high price complex installation capabilities with the screwdriver and an iPad you can install these lock capabilities. So we don\u2019t expect a lot of cannibalization we\u2019re really for a commercial building order simplifying his life with new products. We\u2019ve just got it out there more to learn but from my perspective we\u2019re opening up new markets.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Great. Thank you all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Kepron CLSA. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Kepron \u2013 CLSA","Thanks and good morning. Could you comment on mix and pricing going into the next couple of quarters understand the residential growth is sort of coming down and non-res on the other hand is should be picking up a little bit. And if we exclude the Venezuela effect, how should we think about mix in prices going forward.","Patrick Shannon","So as we discussed we execute it as a price increase at the beginning of this quarter. I would anticipate that we should see better price realization in our core business area in Americas than Q4 compared to what we saw in Q3 not significant but some incremental volume there. From a mix perspective don\u2019t see a big change relative to the mix I mean maybe a little bit higher residential and mechanical business, but wouldn\u2019t anticipate that to have a significant impact on margins particularly relative to the prior year quarter. So not a big impact there.","Dave Petratis","Right I would also say from a revenue standpoint demand is going to hold steady. As we go into Q4 and Q1 it some of the softest period of the construction year and we want get the volume leverage that we would enjoy like in Q2 and Q3.","Jeremy Kepron \u2013 CLSA","Okay and Dave can you give us an update on the M&A landscape what are you seeing, are you seeing the asking price is coming up particularly when you look at Asia and just give us a sense of what we should expect over the next 8, 12 months as from a region in terms of M&A?","Dave Petratis","There is a lot of work in building this M&A pipeline, satisfied with the progress we got more work to do I challenged our general managers get our teams engaged in terms of technology and opportunities building those relationships and opportunities. I spent a week in China building relationships the softening there may be increases a little bit sense of urgency but you look at that market over the next five years it\u2019s going to double so a big step change in valuations I don\u2019t see it. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in terms of the building of the pipeline of, it\u2019s a high priority for us and it takes a lot of work.","Jeremy Kepron \u2013 CLSA","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) our next question comes from Charles Clarke with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey guys.","Dave Petratis","Charles good afternoon.","Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just had a couple quick housekeeping items, few things that surprised me just in the quarter to non-controlling interest and the corporate expense, I mean the corporate expense came up like 70 million bucks sequentially non-controlling interest as well as just to know if there are any comments on kind of why or kind of how would you think about those two line items kind of moving forward?","Dave Petratis","Well I\u2019ll take corporate expense, Patrick will provide some comments as well. Number one investing, I think everybody is pretty pleased with the optimization of our tax structure and methods we\u2019re spending on longer-term tax rate that doesn\u2019t come from freight. I would say Patrick and I view on that as we\u2019ve been very aggressive from an investment perspective to make sure that that realization comes true we think it is a very good trade up second is, we were active on the M&A pipeline, due diligence is expensive it doesn\u2019t mean we put something on the hook. Third is as we have stepped up our electronic investments in new products making sure that we protect ourselves from a patent portfolio patent exposure has been significantly more expensive than we\u2019d budgeted and then the last would be IT we as we have split off from \u2013 there were needs again we want to make sure that we got the IT capabilities to be able to support a very profitable business so those would be some of things. On the non-controlling Patrick?","Patrick Shannon","Yeah on the non-controlling interest, a big piece of that is related to our joint venture with Venezuela and so you\u2019re seeing a step up in the performance relative to that entity and that would be the sequential on year-over-year increase there.","Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay great and then just to confirm the refinancing that you guys worked on this month that should bring the interest expense down by 5 million bucks next year?","Dave Petratis","Assuming the same LIBOR rates as today yes.","Charles Clarke \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Hi good morning guys.","Dave Petratis","Good morning.","Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","So I guess just a clarification from that last question on corporate expense Dave you gave a lot of detail there on what\u2019s driving that in the near term is that to say that we\u2019re seeing a permanent step up in corporate expense to some double-digit number quarterly to support this lower tax rate or is it kind of with a one-time investment to get that optimized and then corporate sells out something more sustainably lower?","Dave Petratis","No I think you got to look at it like sustaining going forward it will be in the double-digit area for the balance of this year and then going into 2015. Some of it is to what Dave had talked about and some of it is just additional cost associated with standalone publicly traded company.","Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then on the I guess implied 4Q particularly in Americas I know you mentioned some pull forward there do you have a rough sense of what that would look like and then I guess just thinking about how all that rolls up in the EPS guidance it seems like the others are pretty draconic outlook for Americas margins implied in that if you\u2019re going to get that that 300 basis points you talked about in EMEA it seems like the plug number seems to be a lower margin in the Americas and if I recall you have a pretty easy comp there from last year so I guess just first what\u2019s the pull forward and then second what should we be thinking about is in the outside driver on margins in the fourth quarter in Americas?","Dave Petratis","Yeah so the pull forward I would call it low single-digits millions there or assuming mid-single-digits it\u2019s not a significant pull forward but if you look at the percentage of year-over-year revenue increase 1.5% increase there as result of that relative to the margins going forward you\u2019re exactly right there is an easy comparison for this year relative to 2013 what we are anticipating margin improvement in Americas and we\u2019ll see that just through the incremental volume leverage productivity offsetting inflation some incremental price realization the comments on Europe, just to be clear the 300 basis points last year we reported 1% operating margin this year we\u2019ll end a little bit north of 4% of 300 basis points when you restate for the UK door divestiture year-over-year it\u2019s more like 200 basis points so that maybe a part of your delta that you\u2019re seeing.","The other piece relative to the global margin relative to the prior year comparison as Dave talked about you\u2019ve got some headwinds relative to the corporate expenditures that\u2019s putting a little pressure on that overall margins.","Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay so I guess you should still see good volume leverage in the fourth quarter it\u2019s in Americas maybe some of that\u2019s easy comp and margins in EMEA should still be seasonally pretty solid and maybe there is some fine tuning there around with the year-over-year old slide just based on some mix issue or I guess the different composition in the business?","Dave Petratis","Yeah correct.","Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay and then I guess just lastly how are you guys thinking or not thinking about the cadence of capital allocation here you\u2019ve been asked this you\u2019re in the better part of the year at this point I think the pipeline you\u2019ve mentioned you\u2019ve done a lot of work there how periods we see you guys kind of dip the tail in the water into buyback in the absence of deals kind of from this point now that you\u2019re flushed out a little bit more of a pipeline?","Dave Petratis","I would say we\u2019ll continue the balanced approach if we think stock buybacks, leads embedded discounts we have the ability to flux M&A will remind the priority. Organic growth as we\u2019ve displayed in this quarter is a great lever we like this investments in this R&R and like commercials in the U.S. but we\u2019re prudent we\u2019re investors and where we see good long-term return opportunities we\u2019re going to pull those levers.","Joshua Pokrzywinski \u2013 Buckingham Research","Got you that\u2019s helpful. All right thanks guys.","Operator","Though I am showing no further questions at this time, I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Tom Martineau for closing remarks.","Tom Martineau","Thank you and we appreciate everybody joining us today for the call.

With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to Slide number 2.

For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question, then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to Slide 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Thanks Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today.","In the fourth quarter, Allegion posted strong operational results. With one of the most engaged and safest workforce in the industry; Allegion once again delivered a high level of execution and performance.","For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $623 million, growing 6.1% on an organic basis. Total revenue increased 9.4% over the prior year reflecting strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency tailwinds. The strong organic growth was driven by all regions.","Americas organic revenues grew at 4.8% as the business rebounded nicely from softer performance in the prior quarter. Business continued to see solid price performance and again saw mid-teens electronics growth. EMEIA delivered outstanding organic growth of 7.7% driven across most products and geographies. In particular, SimonsVoss, AXA, and Interflex businesses saw strong top-line growth. Asia-Pacific organic revenues grew extremely well at 16.4% driven predominantly by the China hardware and Milre businesses.","Adjusted operating income of $135.4 million increased 32.7% versus prior year.","Adjusted operating margin increased by 380 basis points, 260 basis points of the improvement is related to an environmental remediation charge taken in the prior year. The operating performance, excluding the environmental charge, reflected continued price realization and solid leverage on incremental volume which more than offset headwinds from inflation and incremental investments. All three regions saw significant improvements in adjusted operating margins.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 increased $0.30 or 37% versus the prior year. This includes the environmental remediation charge in the prior year which had $0.10 per share impact.","Reported earnings per share of $0.10 decreased $0.67 versus the prior year. The decrease is driven by one-time charges related to U.S. tax reform and debt refinancing cost which had impacts of $0.56 and $0.40 per share respectively. These were partially offset by the $0.10 impact of the prior year environmental charge mentioned previously.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong fourth quarter revenue growth and operational performance.","Please go to Slide 5. Now I'd like to talk about Allegion's accomplishments in 2017. We continue to have exceptional occupational and safety record and continue to be a safety leader in our industry. At Allegion, we believe that safety and health is the true north measurement of business excellence. The recognition received from the National Safety Council in January of this year is a reflection of the hard work and importance that our company places on employee's safety and health.","In December of 2017, Allegion was also recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the best run companies. It's my belief that this is a reflection of our highly engaged management team driving a system of continuous improvement that harmonizes with our workforce and makes Allegion a great place to work, as well as a great investment for shareholders.","Moving onto revenue, we delivered solid organic growth in all regions. Americas and Asia-Pacific continued their success, while the European region recovered nicely in 2017. We continue to execute on our channel initiatives to drive above market growth and continue to focus on innovation to accelerate new products for the market, increasing our vitality index, and remain a leader in the digital convergence. In addition, we've seen continued strong operating leverage and expansion of adjusted operating margins in all regions. We delivered an 18.6% increase in full-year adjusted earnings per share and had another solid cash flow year.","Please go to Slide 6. Allegion recently announced acquisitions that demonstrate our commitments to deploying capital to drive shareholder value. We continue to focus on opportunities that fill product gaps, expand our business, and provide new innovative technologies that can be leveraged across the global enterprise and provide solid financial returns.","In January, we acquired Technical Glass Products, a leading U.S. manufacturer of advanced fire-rated glass and frames for doors, entrances, and curtain walls. TGP is focused on institutional and non-residential projects, provides a strong path to Allegion's floor business and will leverage the strength of our existing specification writing capabilities to help accelerate growth. TGP customers and distributors will benefit from access to the full range of Allegion's product offerings.","At the beginning of February, we formally closed on our acquisition of QMI, which was originally announced at the end of last year. QMI is one of the Middle East largest manufacturers of conventional steel and wood door and frame. QMI product offerings are closely aligned with Allegion's core business and specification capabilities and it provides customers with full door solutions in the Middle East. All of this supports our strategy to accelerate Allegion's growth in this fast growing region and EMEIA as a whole.","And finally, last week, we announced our intent to acquire AD Systems, a U.S. innovator and door solutions. AD Systems designs and manufactures high-performance interior healthcare door system specializing in sliding and acoustics solutions. These solutions are seen across the U.S. healthcare and commercial office spaces because of their think design that provides acoustic control, privacy, and ADA compliance. AD Systems is a natural fit with Allegion's already strong door and door control brands and will further enable our teams to offer best full suite solutions to customers.","All together these newest additions to the Allegion family represent leading brands and natural portfolio extensions that leverage our strong spec-writing capabilities and vertical market presence in healthcare and commercial office buildings. As we move forward to 2018, we will continue to use a disciplined approach through strategic acquisitions that drive shareholder value.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update you on our full 2018 guidance.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning.","Please go to Slide number 7. This slide highlights the components of our revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and full-year. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 9.4% total growth and 6.1% organic growth in the fourth quarter. The full-year delivered total growth of 7.6% with organic growth of 5.7%. I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic growth from all regions. The strong organic growth reflects the continued execution of the company's growth initiatives, the introduction of new products, and strong growth in electronics portfolio.","Pricing was once again favorable in the quarter closing out a strong full-year performance in all regions as the company remained discipline in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising commodity prices. Foreign currency was a tailwind in the quarter and the full-year particularly in the EMEIA region, acquisition also contributed to total revenue growth.","Please go to Slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $623 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 9.4% versus the prior year, up 6.1% on an organic basis.","Adjusted operating income of $135.4 million and adjusted operating margin of 21.7% increased 32.7% and 380 basis points respectively when compared to the prior year. The margin improvement was driven by strong operational results, with pricing and productivity more than offsetting the impacts of inflation and incremental investments. Included in the 2016 numbers is a $15 million environmental remediation charge which had a 260 basis point impact on the adjusted operating margin in that quarter.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.3% was also a 380 basis point increase versus the prior year, and similar to adjusted operating margin mentioned earlier, includes the impact of the 2016 environmental remediation charge.","Full-year adjusted operating margins were 21% and were up 140 basis points versus the prior year. Strong operational performance drove the increase. Margin expansion was also aided by the 70 basis points from the impact of 2016 environmental charge. This represents record performance in the fourth consecutive year with improved adjusted operating and EBITDA margins, as Allegion continues to execute at a high level demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement.","Please go to Slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2016 reported EPS was $0.77 adjusting $0.04 for the prior year restructuring expenses and integration costs related to acquisitions, the 2016 adjusted EPS was $0.81. Operational results increased EPS by $0.18 as favorable volumes, price, operating leverage, and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. As noted previously, the impact of the 2016 environmental remediation charge drove a $0.10 increase.","Next interest and other income were a net $0.05 increase. This was driven primarily by the reduced interest expense resulting from the company's debt refinancing that took place earlier in the quarter.","Share count reductions drove an increase of $0.01.","Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies were $0.02 reduction. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove a $0.02 per share reduction versus the prior year. Both fourth quarter 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates benefited from the favorable discrete items recorded in the respective quarters. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2017 EPS of $1.11 per share, an increase of $0.30 or 37% compared to the prior year.","Further we have a negative $1.01 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges, as well as impacts of $0.56 and $0.40 from charges related to U.S. tax reform and debt refinancing costs respectively. After giving effects to these one-time items, you'll arrive at fourth quarter 2017 reported EPS of $0.10.","Please go to Slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $436.1 million, up 6.4% on a reported basis and up 4.8% organically. The organic growth was driven by volume and price, as we experience mid-single-digit growth in both non-residential and residential products. Additionally, the Americas saw another quarter of mid-teens growth in electronics products.","Americas adjusted operating income of $123.9 million increased $27.2 million or 28.1% versus the prior year period. $15 million of the increase was due to the 2016 environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier. Even after excluding the impact of the charge, Americas saw strong operational performance as adjusted operating income increased due to incremental volume leverage, price, and productivity more than offsetting the impacts from inflation, incremental investments, and unfavorable mix.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 480 basis points, 370 basis points of the improvement was driven by the impact of the prior year environmental charge. The remaining strong operational increase demonstrates excellent performance and execution by the entire Americas team.","For the full-year, the Americas region delivered adjusted operating margin of 28.8% continuing to expand our industry-leading margins. The region continued its strong operational performance. The full-year impact to the Americas region from the prior year environmental charge was 90 basis points.","Please go to Slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $150.8 million, up 16.5% and up 7.7% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by the impact of a strong organic growth along with currency tailwinds. Organic growth was attributable to growth across most business units and geographies with particular strength in SimonsVoss, AXA, and Interflex. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $24.8 million increased 24.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 100 basis points reflecting continued operational improvements driven by the benefits of price and volume leverage more than offsetting the impact of inflation and unfavorable mix.","Full-year adjusted operating margin came in 10.2% an increase of 90 basis points over the prior year. At the time of the spin-off, adjusted operating margin for those business was approximately 1%, we had a stated goal of reaching 10%. Reaching that goal is a significant achievement and highlights the hard work and success of the entire EMEIA team.","Please go to Slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $36.1 million, up 19.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue was up 16.4% and was driven by strong performance across most geographies and product portfolios with the Milre business acquired in 2015 and our business in China leading the way. Favorable currency impacts also benefited total reported revenue.","Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $4.7 million was up 104.3%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 540 basis points reflecting leverage on the incremental volume along with productivity more than offsetting inflation and investment impacts. The full-year adjusted operating margin for Asia-Pacific was 8.4%, an outstanding performance by the entire Asia-Pacific team in representing an increase of 240 basis points as Allegion leverages strong organic growth into strong margin expansion.","Please go to Slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2017 was $297.9 million versus $335 million in the prior year. The decrease in year-over-year available cash flow was attributable to the $50 million discretionary pension payment made earlier in the year partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital as a percent of revenues in the ratio for the cash convergence cycle increased slightly in 2017.","Please go to Slide number 14. As you are aware the U.S. Federal Government passed tax reform late last year. The legislation reduced the federal statutory rate in the U.S. from 35% to 21%, while at the same time limiting certain deductions in various other aspects of the tax bill. As a result of the new legislation, we recorded a $53.5 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 results primarily related to revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the reduced future statutory rate and uncertainty around our ability to realize deferred tax assets that were previously recorded.","In addition, the tax reform included a repatriation tax on foreign earnings. However, as Allegion is an Irish domicile company, we only incurred a minimal cash repatriation tax.","As we evaluate the impact on 2018 and beyond, we expect our long-term tax rate to remain in the mid-to-high teens with an estimated tax rate of approximately 16% in 2018. In addition, we expect to see increase on our 2018 cash taxes as a result of tax reform inclusive of one-time payments.","Finally, the law is complex and future interpretation of the legislation is expected from the U.S. government and regulatory agencies, which may result in future discrete impacts of our tax rate primarily related to the one-time charge of $53.5 million mentioned earlier.","I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full-year 2018 guidance.","Dave Petratis","Thank you, Patrick.","Please go to Slide number 15. We continue to see favorable trends on our primary end markets in 2018 and it is our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will again drive better than market growth. We also believe the electronics business will continue to outpace mechanical which additionally benefit our growth as we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend.","In the Americas, we see positive indicator in the key verticals within the non-residential and residential businesses and expect both markets to remain solid and grow in the low-to-mid-single-digits. If there is relief in the labor constraints and the supply chain, we would expect better market growth as underlying macro trends are expected to remain strong.","Consolidating the market outlook, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas up 4% to 5% and recorded revenue growth of 10% to 11% reflecting the inclusion of the acquisitions of TGP and AD Systems.","For the EMEIA region, we anticipate growth in core markets to be low-single-digits as the markets in the region continue to rebound. General macro-economic indicators such as manufacturers' confidence, consumer confidence, and unemployment rates continue to be positive. For the region, we project organic growth of 2% to 4%. When combining that with the impact of currency, and the acquisition of QMI, we project reported growth of 13% to 15%.","The Asia-Pacific markets continue to show strength in China and North Asia with a more modest growth outlook for Australia and New Zealand markets. We expect to drive above market growth as we continue to focus our efforts on key vertical markets where we are strong. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 6% to 8% and the total revenue growth is estimated to be 8% to 10% reflecting benefits from currency tailwinds.","All-in, we are projecting total growth for the company at 10.5% to 11.5% and organic growth at 4% to 5%. We anticipate continued price realization across all regions to help mitigate inflationary pressures in 2018.","Please go to Slide 16. Our 2018 outlook for adjusted earnings per share range is $4.35 to $4.50, an increase of approximately 10% to 14%. As indicated, the earnings increase is primarily driven by revenue growth and operational improvements, a lower effective tax rate, tailwind from currency, and the benefit of acquisitions, partially offset by investments in the business.","Incremental investments are anticipated to be slightly lower than the prior year and will continue to focus on accelerating new product developments and channel initiatives which we believe enable us to deliver above market growth and enhance our vitality index as demonstrated historically.","Our guidance assumes that full-year effective tax rate of approximately 16% and outstanding diluted shares of approximately $96 million reflecting the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with repurchases.","The guidance also includes a $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, EPS is $4.20 to $4.35. We are projecting our available cash flow for 2018 to be in the range of $380 million to $400 million.","Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2017 results that deliver organic revenue of 5.7% and increased our operating margin by 140 basis points and by 70 basis points after excluding the impact of the prior year environmental remediation charge. The growth of both revenue and margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates continued execution on our strategy, along with a disciplined approach to managing our business.","We continue to make progress on our vitality index with new and innovative products, while we also continue to consistently generate strong cash flow. We are executing on our flexible capital allocation strategy, as evidenced by our recent acquisition announcements, along with the increase in our Q1 dividends.","As we look to 2018, we expect to drive continued organic growth above market and expect the impact of acquisitions to help drive robust top-line growth.","We look to drive another double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share and look to generate substantial available cash flow. We have an excellent team in place that's committed to our vision to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.","Thank you to be Allegion Board of Director and the Global Allegion team for a great 2017. Here at Allegion, our best days are ahead of us.","Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","And the first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. This is actually John Walsh on for Jeff.","Dave Petratis","Good morning, John.","John Walsh","So as we think about well first solid quarter, and then, as we think about the 4% to 5% you're looking for in the Americas in 2018 that 5% is that still like a cap or meaning we've heard in the past around constraints around the market, labor, things like that? Or do you think that if the macro comes in a little bit better there is actually an ability to drive that higher from a market perspective?","Dave Petratis","I like our opportunities to be stronger. I think we have to be realistic in the labor constraints that I see and have identified for the last year. If those labor constraints work themselves through, we will exceed the market growth. I always believe, and we believe here at Allegion, that if the market is better we will do better than our share.","We've also been mindful in the projects that we're quoting and bidding. There is good projects and there is bad projects out there that go on time, trying to pick the right horses, if you will. I would say this John, we've got data out there that says general construction backlogs are at all-time highs, and the opportunity for us to excel in that environment I think is positive.","John Walsh","Hey, thank you for that. And then, I guess just as we think about the investment spend going forward, I would suspect we should continue to model incremental growth but maybe at a slowing rate; is that the way to think about that?","Patrick Shannon","So, as we indicated for 2018, the incremental spend year-over-year is up, but down relative to the prior year. So we look at it relative to opportunities in the marketplace, and as Dave indicated, we're really looking at continuing to expand our channel initiatives, market segmentation, driving demand creation particularly in electronics as well as accelerating new product development. We like the opportunities there and believe to-date the investments have provided a good return on those investments and so to some extent, it does come down to management capacity to be able to execute on some of those opportunities but each year we look at separately and it doesn't mean for example, in 2019, if there is some opportunities that we see in identifying the marketplace that could accelerate grow faster than the broader market that we could step-up those investments.","So I would just say, it's dependent upon market situations, opportunities, and what else is going on in the business relative to the incremental spend year-over-year. But thus far I've been very pleased with results we've gotten in terms of driving incremental revenue growth relative to the market.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on European operations, you sort of highlighted brands that are growing you did not highlight CISA, can you give us a sense as to what's happening in Italy, Spain, and what's happening with production move to Eastern Europe, if you could highlight, if growth rates associated with that and efficiency associated there?","Dave Petratis","CISA and Italy was the part of the growth we enjoyed in the quarter and the year. The supply chain under pressure all year got better every quarter. We continue to develop that capability and improve customer satisfaction. So I think we're in a good position to take advantage of better Italian markets and regions that CISA fix -- or serves in 2018.","Andrew Obin","And what about your channel initiative, I know that you guys sort of tweaked the channel going after new projects, are we seeing any outgrowth related to that and I'm speaking about Europe?","Dave Petratis","Yes, our channel initiatives that we pioneer here in the Americas has been expanded to Asia-Pacific and in Europe. We're in the throes of some channel analysis right now in Europe. And I think as we understand more intimately our opportunities, I think it's reflective in our growth; I think it's reflective in our acquisitions. We're extremely well-positioned in the Middle East, QMI adds to that, and this belief that we can drive granular growth through better challenges, initiatives Andrew is part of the -- I think the success you\u2019re seeing in 2017 that will extend to 2018.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo.","Rich Kwas","On the acquisitions that have been completed, how should we think about the margins here for the business, it looks -- the businesses acquired looks like it's a bit below what you would at least when you look at the Americas piece, I know doors in general tend to carry lower margins, but anything you would note there in terms of cost synergies or revenue synergies which do you think are more important for the various deals?","Dave Petratis","So like all of the transactions, I believe good product portfolios, brand positions, very good market position in the respective areas, like the growth prospects predominantly as we look at opportunities to leverage our specification, writing capabilities, as well as getting more throughput through our distribution. So I think we'll see that across all of those acquisition opportunities. So like the upside relative to the revenue and top-line.","From the margin profile, as you know, we have industry margins across the globe and these transactions will be dilutive, they are lower than our overall margin profile, but nonetheless still strong contributors in terms of operating performance. So continuous improvement in margins across the globe, but this will dilute, if you will, the overall margin profile of the company in 2018.","Patrick Shannon","Rich, I would add that the spec driven nature of these products AD Doors and TGP would be in the upper -- a few benchmark door manufacturers those margins would be in the upper end. There is clearly a performance basis that drives premium in market versus the door side.","Rich Kwas","Okay. So it appears like revenue synergies are more tangible maybe that cost synergies in the next couple of years?","Dave Petratis","Correct.","Rich Kwas","Okay, all right. And then, Patrick, on price cost for the year, you said you would be able to cover costs how should we think about price contribution at this point for the year?","Patrick Shannon","So for 2018, we would anticipate that we would continue to offset or be above the commodity cost pressure. As you know, the commodity costs have continued to increase particularly in the backend of 2017 and the first part here in 2018 but we would expect to continue to remain fairly aggressive to recover that cost increase. So we see it as a net positive for 2018 maybe not to the extent we saw in 2017, you may recall we're out pretty early with price increases during the course of the year and got really good price realization across the board, but nonetheless it's still going to be a net contributor to margin expansion for 2018.","Rich Kwas","Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeff Kessler","Hi. Could you expand a little bit on what you were doing well with your partner programs around the world, you mentioned obviously Europe, and Asia-Pac, taking the cue from the Americas. But I'm wondering if you could talk about what you were doing -- what's your overall goal this year to make the channel more efficient and whether or not there are any opportunities in direct as well?","Dave Petratis","So I give one example that we'll be in the second year here in the U.S. and it's our project-based business. We think with labor constraints in the marketplace there is opportunities to streamline specification process, provide total packages which would include door offerings with ourselves and partners, hardware packages that will reduce cycle times in light commercial and multi-family.","A second example would be partnering with architects and our spec riders in investment we called Chorus, which automates spec writings and the take-off capabilities against shortening lead times and hopefully helping us grow in the marketplace, so a couple of examples.","We've extended project-based examples to Europe; we think the addition of QMI helps us there. Jeff I don't know if you've ever been to Asia-Pacific or not Asia-Pacific but the Middle East I assume you have, you get off the airport there, you see our strengths in U.S. specified products, we believe we're in a unique position to service both European and U.S. specs that is being done with partnerships here with our spec writers in North America, so a couple examples there what we're doing.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. On that same line of thinking is -- have you because Europe is somewhat different and almost in every country, nevertheless you have a history here of being ahead of the game in terms of relationships with architects, spec writers, what is -- what are you doing in Europe on a -- either on a continental basis or on a country-by-country basis to try to mimic what you're doing here?","Dave Petratis","So we are making investments in spec writing capabilities, we're talking bodies of the systems as well as what's called digital investments that can help connect that project capabilities. We also think some of the success of SimonsVoss which we're very pleased with as we extend that into the regions out of the dark zone is helping us have a stronger project-based capability. So again we've got a long way to go here but extending the knowledge and strength that we have from North America into Europe and Asia-Pacific we think, is unlocking some growth opportunities for us, Jeff.","Jeff Kessler","Okay, great. One final question that is over the course of the next year there will be several trade conferences, trade shows out there, what are some of the newer -- the newer technologies that you are -- that you have been messing around with, that maybe able to see and touch over the course of the coming 12 to 18 months?","Dave Petratis","So I would encourage you to step in and talk to our technical people if they're on top of it. We continue to invest our vitality index increases for the fourth straight year. I think we're really working on this overall customer experience and how digital access your smart devices can enable a seamless experience not only in the home, but in complex buildings. We think things like Engage, our Sense Products, NDE, are opening salvos of that, the great capabilities with our SimonsVoss and Milre, but we think a lot more about the customer experience and access and this is where our investments are being made.","Jeff Kessler","Okay, great. Yes. Thank you very much.","Mike Wagnes","Keith, is there any other question on the line?","Operator","Yes, I'm sorry. The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Dave Petratis","Good morning.","David MacGregor","I guess question on Europe. First of all congratulations on achieving that 10% adjusted operating margin you inherited not so great situation and you've accomplished a lot there. I guess the question is where can you take it from here? What are the capital requirements in order to do that and how should we think about the timeline?","Dave Petratis","David, as you said, really good progress since the spin, very pleased with the team and reaching the objective we set when we first spun out in the company. As we've talked about previously there aren't any significant step-ups, relative to the margin enhancement going forward. I think what you'll see a basis of our 2018 guidance is continuous improvement. So we'll continue to push price cost equation, continue to drive productivity, lean out manufacturing efficiencies where we can, and those type of thing. So I would look at it from a perspective of just continuous improvement, given our current business profile there in Europe.","David MacGregor","You've got a very good free cash flow guide here for 2018 and I'm just wondering as you think about how like it's put to use, does Europe become a more sort of capital intensive part of the model over the next two to three years as you address that profitability growth challenge?","Dave Petratis","We like the cash flow of this business. We'll continue to have our priority on growth through acquisition number one. Europe has one of the best playing fields to be able to do that, but our view continues to be global, what are the smart tuck-ins that makes sense.","Second would be technology. There is a whole world of digitization that's moving in our industry and will move over the next decade, so look for us in investments there. But clearly, I'd said in Europe, we'd like to continue to move north, continue to move technically, and find targets that can move us with scale, so that's how we think about it.","David MacGregor","Okay. Last question for me is just on the investments of the $0.10 guide. I know regionally you started 2017 if memory serves correctly guiding to $0.15 to $0.20. I think you ended the year at about $0.13. Now you're guiding to $0.10. I know you asked about this on an earlier question but in responding to that, David, I think you had noted that a contributing factor here was just management bandwidth. Does that raise a question about management bandwidth here? Do we have to be concerned about your ability to capitalize on opportunities as they present themselves, could you expand a little bit on what you meant there?","Dave Petratis","So I think when I think about management bandwidth, the first one is, understanding management capacity. Our ability to efficiently deploy capital, I think after 48 months as a publicly traded company I think we know where our boundaries are. It's easy to spend money; it's not so easy to do it efficiently. We think pretty significant -- we think deeply about that.","I think as I step back and think about the technologies and opportunities that we have going forward it's important that we know where to invest, how to invest, but also where we can move the bar through M&A and do it smartly. So I feel good that we know where we're at. But I'm not going to swing the fence or stretch beyond what I think could add risk and potential problems and get a return on that investment.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna.","Robert Barry","Hey, I just wanted to clarify the earlier comment about price cost being a net positive; is that price plus productivity net of all inflation or just some incremental color there?","Patrick Shannon","Yes, so that would be our price cost, so pricing would exceed material inflation clearly. Price productivity together would offset any inflation including merit and those normal things that occur in the course of the business.","Robert Barry","Got it. And just any color on approximately how big of a net positive that is; is that a material contributor.","Patrick Shannon","You'll see it in our 10-K when we file relative to 2017 but fairly significant contributor. Again would anticipate 2018 to continue to be positive probably not to the extent it was in 2017, just given the price realization we got during the course of the year, but again favorable for the full -- anticipated for the full-year of 2018.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then, can you just level set us on the tax rate going forward it sounds like we should model 2016 for 2018 but then or should we assume it's rising after that like to a high-teens rate just wanted to clarify?","Patrick Shannon","Yes, I think the best way to look at it, again every year has some discrete items that play into the effective tax rate. So you're right 2018 we anticipate 16%. Going forward higher teens is probably a better expectation and I would -- we feel pretty good about that over the long-term. And so as you think about 2019 and beyond, you should think about a little step-up in the rate relative to 2018.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then just one last quick one on the cash flow guide the $380 million to $400 million does that include some one-time cash headwinds? I just want to clarify that I feel. Thanks.","Patrick Shannon","Yes, it does. We mentioned in the commentary that relative to the tax reform changes there's going to be some one-time cash tax payments in addition to the normal kind of repatriation tax. It is a one-off item specific to 2018. And so that's a little headwind in our cash flow and that's why you don't see quite the conversion ratio on ACF to net earnings, but believe more importantly that 2019 and beyond our stated objective of 100% conversion we should be able to maintain.","Robert Barry","Got it. So ex those one-times, you're at or above 100 this year?","Patrick Shannon","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","Tim Wojs","Hey guys nice job.","Dave Petratis","Thank you, Tim.","Tim Wojs","I guess maybe going back to Americas and just -- and just maybe more specifically on margins. Just given I think you exited the year at may be 28.8%. You've got the incremental investments but then you also have I think some dilution from the deal. So what's the right way to think about Americas margins in 2018 versus 2017?","Patrick Shannon","So I think the way to think about it is like the other regions of the globe on a base business ex acquisition, continuous improvement, again continue to get pretty good leverage and pull-through margin on incremental volume, positive contribution on price cost inflation etcetera. But the margins on the acquisitions, good businesses, but the margin profile isn't at the 28.8% referenced. And so you're looking at -- when everything is said and done kind of flattish to slightly up margins for 2018 all inclusive of the M&A activity.","Tim Wojs","Okay. And that's just for Americas?","Patrick Shannon","Yes.","Tim Wojs","Okay, great. And then maybe slipping over to the growth the 4% to 5% organically in Americas, what's the right cadence for the year? I think you have a little bit that the comps I think in the first half might be a little bit more difficult than the second half so just may be just level set us on the model around cadence of growth? Thanks.","Patrick Shannon","So you're right very difficult comps in Q1 in particular. So I would anticipate maybe the growth rates been slightly lower in Q1 this year relative to last year, but and slightly improving during the course of the year, not that big of a delta during the course of the year but slightly not as high as what you would anticipate for the back half of the year.","Tim Wojs","Okay, great. Good luck on 2018 guys.","Patrick Shannon","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just a follow-up. I guess more broadly on some of the M&A announcements here recently, Dave. I think when you first went out there is a bit of a push to get kind of a focus more on the hardware less on the door and the last few deals have certainly been specialty type products but have included a bit more door-centric stuff; is this a change in philosophy should we expect this to continue within some of these niches or how do you view that assessment because I know that was a big difference between yourselves and your largest competitor there initially?","Dave Petratis","So first of all think about it as my own maturity and understanding the business. We think we have a powerful asset and our spec writing capability and when we can come in and write a total turnkey spec especially including specialty equipment and features we think that's a good place to be. We also looked at the competitive landscape and clearly saw where we were disadvantaged particularly around our steel door offerings with steel craft and for example the Republic acquisition that we made last January gives a better geographical capability to serve customers locally. These businesses have laid adaption capabilities and it's really just thinking that through. In the Middle East with QMI we were actually winning jobs and shipping steel craft doors firms Cincinnati Ohio. So it's just I think a refinement of our understanding of the market and the points in capital that we think helps our top-line and bottom-line growth.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. Thanks for the color. And then on some of these labor shortages that were impacting last quarter, I mean clearly Americas volume growth accelerated, I guess I don't know exactly what price contributed but probably not much compared to that that bigger number in 3Q; is that a sign of some of those shortages working themselves out? Or is it just, hey, in the fourth quarter where seasonally things are slow and there is a bit more slack in the system, maybe help us understand that dynamic a bit better?","Dave Petratis","So as we look back at Q3 especially as we ended it, we saw an absence of flows through the supply chain, as projects are pressured to complete on year-end, we saw that slack move through the system, I think that's going to be something we're going to have to continue to navigate and be aware of as we go in to 2018 and 2019. I see labor constraints as well identified. I mentioned the high backlog of construction orders put in place and we think it will create shock in the market and demand as we go forward.","Now with that said, we're not -- we're looking at our value streams and say how can we invest to better position the company, our incentive structures that we can use to help move that through to get better and consistent flows, we\u2019re working on it, but we don\u2019t have it all figured out.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. And then just one last one for Patrick, I apologize for doing this, you probably didn't mean for all this deconstruction of what I'm about to do. So organic or volume-based incremental margins I think net of investments looks like they're about 30% in the guide, if the price cost is positive, I think on a volume only basis you'd probably be somewhere in the mid-20s, that seems conservative to me but is there something on the mix front or something out that we should keep in mind as maybe being an irritant to that again? Like I think that's ex acquisitions or FX I think that's a pure number that I backed into?","Patrick Shannon","Yes, so mix maybe a little bit more favorable given the growth in residential relative to the non-residential is weighing on that contribution margin. Other than that there isn\u2019t really any other significant items that would be weighing down that margin percent.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much. Maybe just trying to stick to one question, it was really on the electronics business, I think you enjoyed mid-teens growth there in Q4, maybe give us an update on what proportion of your total revenue now is coming from electronics? And also what you\u2019re expecting the growth to be in 2018 and whether you're broadly happy with your organic position and there shouldn\u2019t be a need for a big M&A deal in that segment of the market for you?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. So again really good growth in electronics portfolio across both non-residential and residential products really like what we're seeing there. As you know still low penetration particularly in the residential markets, a lot of room to continue to grow there. The overall portfolio in electronics is mid-teens as far as our global business and that varies a little bit by region. But we'd expect the electronics to continue to outgrow the mechanical products, so that percentage will continue to increase.","And as we've talked about previously good trend for Allegion, higher price points, similar margin profile means more EBIT dollars. And we will continue to drive that particularly as we look to make investments whether it would be demand creation or new product development to ensure that we can be a leader as far as that development in electromechanical convergence.","Operator","Thank you. And since that's all the time we have for questions at the present time. I would like to turn the call to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes","Thanks, Keith. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"1376":["Allegion PLC (NYSE:ALLE) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 31, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Tom Martineau - Director, Investor Relations","Dave Petratis - Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer","Patrick Shannon - Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President","Analysts","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Allegion Q2 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Tom Martineau, Director, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Tom Martineau","Thank you, Nova. Good morning. Welcome and thank for joining us for the second quarter 2014 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Allegion.","Our earnings release which was issued last night after market close and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Our release and today's commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release and the 2013 quarterly information in the appendix of today's presentation for further details.","Our release and today's commentary also reflects direct reclassification of our United Kingdom Door business to discontinued operations. Please refer to our press release and Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, for additional information.","With that, please go to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, revenues were $531 million, up 4% on an adjusted basis versus last year and up 2.9% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $101.7 million increased 1.6% versus the prior year and adjusted operating margin of 19.1% was down 50 basis points versus the prior year.","Accounting for a $2.5 million bad debt adjustment in the Asia-Pacific region, adjusted operating margin was flat to prior year. We delivered reporting earnings per share of $0.53, which includes an $0.08 of restructuring and one-time separation cost resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.61.","Organic adjusted revenue in the Americas grew 4.9%, driven by continued strength in our Residential segment. Slightly negative EMEIA revenue growth was consistent with our expectations regarding flat, but stable markets and our decision to exit certain product markets that are less profitable, dilute resources and are not scalable.","Although bookings are strong in our China system integration business, the timing of large government related contracts were the main driver in negative 12% revenue growth year-over-year.","Allegion repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for $30.3 million in the quarter. This is consistent with our previously communicated capital allocation strategy to offset dilution. We are raising the mid-point of our full-year EPS guidance, which is now forecasted to be $2.30 to $2.40 on an adjusted basis and $2.00 to $2.15 on a reported basis. This earnings forecast assumes adjusted revenue growth of 3.5% to 4.5%, similar to her previous guidance.","Please go to Slide 4. We continue to prioritize investments to meet the electromechanical transformation within the security industry. Our ability to provide new solutions that offer innovation and convenience to both, our residential and commercial customers is a pillar of our growth platform.","We continue to make progress in Europe. As part of our profitability improvement actions, we announced an agreement to divest our U.K. Door business to an affiliate of Alcyon Financial Limited, a financial investment firm. The businesses to be sold include the Dor-o-Matic branded automatic door businesses, the Martin Roberts, branded performance steel doorset business and the U.K. service organization.","This enables us to simplify our portfolio and focus on the key strategic businesses and services within the EMEIA region. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees within these businesses for their contributions and continued focus on the customer during this transition and wish them well in the Alcyon family.","Also in the second quarter, we have committed to a plan to restructure the EMEIA organization to improve efficiencies, cost structure and position future growth. We remain focused on acquisition opportunities in emerging markets, emerging technologies and product portfolio expansion. We continue to work to develop our M&A pipeline and are seeing the favorable results of our early acquisitions.","As we evaluate future opportunities, we will continue to follow a disciplined process to make sure the deals are aligned with our strategy and that we have confidence that they will create shareholder value.","Before I move on, I would like to take a moment to provide a status on our transition service agreements. We have eliminated over 75% of the TSAs with Ingersoll-Rand, and we remain confident of migrating up all service agreement by the end of the year. This has been made possible by the significant efforts of hundreds of Allegion employees around the globe.","Please go to Slide 5. Last quarter, I spoke to you about our innovation pipeline and advancements with regard to technology development. This quarter I would like to share some recent examples. Our Schlage Touchscreen deadbolt with alarm was ranked number one in electronic-connected locks in June from a leading consumer publication and our Schlage keypad deadbolt was ranked number one in electronic locks.","We are the category pioneer in residential electronic lock category and launched the first connected smart lock to the market. Our connected Touchscreen deadbolt solutions offers best-in-quality durability, best-in-class security and the convenience of fast and easy installation with sleek designs and style great for today's home renovations.","Our opened platform lock is [home] renovations. Opened platform lock is compatible with leading home automation in monitored security systems and with Grade 1 security rating building alarm technology and fingerprint resistant touchscreens we are leading the evolution to the keyless era.","We recently announced our new wireless lock with a gauge technology used for commercial applications, designed to be the easiest electronic to install, connect, manage and use, this new product reduces the owners' cost of ownership and we believe will accelerate the adoption rate of electronic locks in the commercial market.","It offers the same Schlage quality and durability commercial business owners have come to rely on, plus it comes with web and mobile app tools to help building owners manage access. It's ideal for interior office doors, common area doors and sensitive storage areas.","You have heard me discuss the complexity of our industry, including navigating the requirements of codes and standards. A great example of this is our new Von Duprin AX series exit device.","Developed to provide the market with a solution that needs recent California building code enhancements that established the 5 pounds minimum force on operational hardware for accessible openings.","Our AX product provides the first UL-certified exit device meeting the new requirements, while incorporating the rigorous standards for durability, use and functionality that are synonymous with Von Duprin.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I will be back to update you on our full 2014 outlook.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Please go to Slide number 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $531.5 million, reflecting an increase of 0.5% versus the prior year.","Adjusting prior periods for a previously discussed order flow change with our consolidated joint venture in Asia net revenues increased 4% versus the prior year.","Organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of our recent acquisitions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was up 2.9%. We realized mid-double-digit growth in residential Americas, driven by the builder, e-commerce and Venezuela segments.","The Commercial business had modest growth, reflecting continued softness in institutional markets. EMEIA revenues were consistent with our expectations regarding flat, but stable markets. Although bookings were strong in our China system integration business, the nature of the timing of large government-related contracts drove a large variance in the quarterly growth rate.","Adjusted operating income increased by 1.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.1% in the quarter. The results include a $2.5 million bad debt adjustment within the Asia-Pacific region. Excluding this item, operating margin was flat compared to the prior year period.","The company continues to invest in future growth platforms, including incremental engineering to accelerate new product development as Dave highlighted earlier and incremental channel development expenditures to accelerate growth in underserved vertical markets.","Please go to Slide number 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2013, reported and adjusted EPS was $0.64, operational results increased EPS by $0.04 as pricing and productivity more than offset inflation.","Note that pricing actions were taken in the quarter to offset increased inflation, particularly in Venezuela. The operational results also include an unfavorable $0.02 per share impact related to the bad debt that adjustment from the Asia-Pacific region.","The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate to 29.8% drove $0.06 per share improvement versus the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate is due to favorable changes in the mix, a pre=tax income and continued leverage of our tax structure.","The next slide reflects the reduction of $0.08 per share related to the incremental interest expense incurred as a result of additional indebtedness associated with the spinoff from Ingersoll-Rand.","Next, incremental investments in ongoing growth initiatives were a $0.03 reduction, increased non-controlling and a higher number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding, each represented a $0.01 reduction in EPS. This results in adjusted second quarter 2014 EPS of $0.61 per share.","Continuing on, we have an $0.08 per share reduction for restructuring and spin related expenses to arrive at the second quarter 2014 reported EPS of $0.53. The reduction is driven by one-time separation cost in the quarter of $6.9 million, as well as EMEIA restructuring and other charges of $5.1 million.","Please go to Slide number 8. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were up 5.3% on an adjusted basis and up 4.9% on an organic basis. Removing the impact of Venezuelan price increases, revenues were up 2.4% on an adjusted basis. Venezuela pricing, higher volumes and the acquisition of Schlage to Columbia in January 2014, offset unfavorable currency movement in Canada.","North America residential revenue growth reflected strength in the builder and e-commerce channels. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in residential electronic locks as this category increased over 20% compared to the prior period.","Commercial organic revenues were up slightly in the quarter as commercial verticals compensated for weak institutional markets.","Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were down 140 basis points. The decrease was primarily attributable to incremental investments and unfavorable business mix related to the higher growth of residential revenue compared to commercial revenue. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable pricing and productivity.","We continue to see improved year-over-year residential margins, which partially offset the unfavorable business mix. Although operating margins declined in the quarter, we are still projecting margin improvement for the full-year as a result of higher volumes, improved pricing and to some extent an easier comparison in the fourth quarter.","Please go to Slide number 9. We are pleased with the ongoing progress in EMEIA as reflected in the second quarter results. As we discuss our operational performance, please keep in mind, our U.K. Door business have been removed to discontinued operations in the financial results. The combined businesses had revenue of approximately $24 million and an operating loss of approximately $3 million for 2013.","Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were up 3% and down 0.3% on an organic basis. Market indicators continue to suggest stability in the southern region, but with minimal growth.","The organic revenue decline was driven by lower volume reflecting actions to selectively exit unprofitable markets, partially offset by price improvements.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 2%, up 320 basis points compared to the prior year period. The favorable improvement is driven by price and carryover 2013 restructuring benefits as well as management's initiatives to exit certain unprofitable market segments.","We remain on target to reflect a 300-basis point improvement in operating margin for the full year. The restructuring actions taken in the quarter will further lean out the cost structure with benefits realized the second half of 2014.","Please go to Slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were down 9.2% and down 12% on an organic basis. Declines in system integration revenue were partially offset by strong double-digit hardware growth in most regions.","Our system integration revenue is dependent on large government contracts that can have large quarterly variations in the timing of project awards. When evaluating the performance of his business, we monitor full year growth as the best indicator of success.","We exited the second quarter with a higher backlog and strong project pipeline and are still expecting high single-digit growth of the full-year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was down $2.5 million, driven by one-time bad debt adjustment of the same amount in the current quarter.","Excluding this impact, operating margins would have been in line with prior year's favorable pricing, productivity and the FSH acquisition offset the system integration volume decline in investments. We continue to expect operating margins to improve for the full-year as revenue increases with the seasonality of the business.","Please go to Slide number 11. Turning our attention to available cash flow, you'll see that we generated $39.4 million of available cash flow year-to-date. The decrease in available cash versus 2013 reflects spend in restructuring expenses and incremental capital expenditures for new systems, new product development and productivity investments.","We continue to manage our working capital effectively in order to improve the velocity of asset turnover, resulting in improvements in working capital as a percentage of sales as well as reduction in our cash conversion cycle.","We are still targeting available cash flow for the year to approximate 100% of net earnings from continuing operations.","I will now hand it back over Dave for an update of our full year 2014 guidance.","Dave Petratis","Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 12. If we turn our attention to end markets in the Americas, we see a shift in growth between residential and non-residential markets as compared to our prior guidance.","The non-residential markets will continue to recover at a slower pace. Availability and cost of labor continues to be a challenge and any weather-related carryover from the prior quarter appears to have been modest.","We now forecast non-residential 2014 growth in the low-single digits, mostly driven by the commercial segments of the market. We expect the institutional market to be flat to negative low-single digits for the year.","When we look at the ABI Index, a long-term indicator for Allegion, we know the institutional sector for ABI has been recovering at a much slower pace than the commercial sectors. June marked the first time the institutional index has reach positive territory since August 2013.","We see the growth in traditional commercial segments such as retail, office and hospitality as opportunities to redirect efforts to drive more share of discretionary business coming through those channels. This remains a critical component in our ability to expand in our core markets.","The residential multi-family segment continued its strong pace of growth driven by affordability, mobility and uncertainty of the job market. Although we are still below normal levels, the single-family residential markets continue to show solid improvement, driven by continued recovery in single-family construction.","As housing prices continued to increase and inventories reduced, we see increases in renovation activity, which will drive demand in our retail channels. With our residential product portfolio of new innovative products, we are well-positioned to support stronger residential renovation activity.","Our outlook for European 2014 growth remains subdued and we continue to forecast at Allegion served markets to be flat. For instance in the construction markets, two of Allegion larger mechanical markets are forecast to be slightly negative for the year.","The ongoing recovery in this market will proceed at a very slow rate and we still view recovery to normal levels to occur after 2015. We expect mid-single digit growth in the Asia-Pacific region, driven by growth in China.","Of note, we're seeing pressure in China, in the Residential segment, with increased inventory and reduced home values, while non-residential construction growth remained strong. We also see annual growth in the System Integration segment as safe city investments in China continued the shift from first tier to second and third tier cities.","Please go to Slide 13. Our full-year adjusted year-over-year revenue forecast remains up 3.5% to 4.5%. We continue to expect the Americas revenues to be up 3.5% to 5% in aggregate although the mix of the revenues had shifted when compared to previous guidance.","Essentially strong residential volumes are compensating for lower than expected institutional volumes. We see the EMEIA region as essentially flat and Asia-Pacific region to be up 8% to 10% with a strong second half.","Please go to Slide 14. We are raising the mid-point of our 2014 EPS guidance. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecasted to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.40, an increase of 6% to 11% from 2013 adjusted earnings per share. We continue to anticipate earnings growth will accelerate in the second half of this year due to higher volumes, 2014 European actions and a wider spread in the effective tax rate.","Restructuring and spin costs are still expected to be $0.25 to $0.30 of impact during the year, resulting in a reported EPS range of $2.00 to $2.15.","The effective tax rate assumptions in the guidance is approximately 30% and outstanding diluted shares are approximately 97 million. Finally, the guidance does not reflect the potential risk of the devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar.","For more information on this topic, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the period ended June 30, 2014.","Please go to Slide 15. To summarize, we are pleased with the results in the quarter given the soft institutional and Southern European market environments. The American Residential segment continues to perform well and we are taking the pricing actions in Venezuela to compensate for inflation.","We have a solid backlog of system integration projects in China, and expect to see stronger second half within that business. As evident in the quarter, we continued to make significant progress on our European profitability actions.","Our 2014 priorities are clear. We continue to execute on our operating strategies to assist us in the company for accelerated growth, drive a balanced capital location plan and complete spin-related activities quickly and efficiently.","Now, Patrick and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks very much and good morning.","Patrick Shannon","","Good morning, Steven","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Nice progress as a team and all the key initiatives that you have been talking about, but one thing it would just be helpful especially is - our net working capital reduction, again, Patrick could you just call out exactly how you are getting that?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. It's coming primarily from improved focus on both receivable and inventory turnover. I think, we have talked about historically, if you looked at the businesses from a regional perspective, Americas has been in pretty good shape. The opportunity was really in the European area. The other team has done a nice job in reducing our inventory there. Continued vigilance and receivable management and just really seeing good progress across the board.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. You expect that to continue then going forward?","Patrick Shannon","","Well, you know, if you kind a look at it over the last four quarters, we have continuously made good progress in that area both, in terms of working capital as a percentage of revenue as well as our cash conversion cycle.","I think there were some additional opportunities here, but at some point you know it becomes limited in terms of the step improvement, but we will continue to remain focused on it to drive improvement.","If you benchmark the business, it shows up extremely well. It will be a high priority for us as we run Allegion.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. Then on the Americas, just digging into that a little bit for now, the 3% pricing growth you called out the Latin American actions being taken, but was the U.S. also getting priced or is this all Latin America and price was maybe other way in the U.S.?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. The majority was Venezuela price-related. It's a high inflation economy as you know and team has done a really good job to offset the inflation there both, in terms of material as well as salaries and those [narrow] both, in terms of material as well as salaries and those types of things there.","I would say about 80% is relative to Venezuela. The majority in both, our residential and the rest of it in our residential, commercial, area, so we are getting some pricing improvement. You may recall last quarter we instituted the price increase effective at the beginning of April. It took some time to kind of work out the backlog, but we are starting to see some incremental price now going into the Q3.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","You are not seeing additional pricing related competition in the U.S. That's abnormal?","Patrick Shannon","","I wouldn't say it's abnormal. It's always a competitive market, but we are getting, I think, our share of price here.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Just on Venezuela point, again. I am not sure I am clear. What would it actually take to trigger an accounting change, the change to those other rates given you have described it very fully in your prior calls how it's a closed loop and all of that. I mean, what would actually have to happen next externally or what should we look for that would give us a sign that you would actually have the force to take that action.","Patrick Shannon","Yes. Right now, when we looked at that, I think patience is prudent you know there's a lot of potential movement there in the currency, but the triggering event obviously would be a change in the official exchange rate. We would be forced to that point in time to adapt to the new rate, but if our intent or our business strategy changes to the extent we need to go out and exchange local currency to U.S. dollars that would be a triggering event.","We talked about previously that if you look at that business it is fairly well self-contained i.e. it sources the product manufacturers distributes in-country. We don't really have a need or nor do we have a desire today to exchange local currency to dollars, so that's why we are sitting on the fence now and we will wait and see you know how this shakes out.","I think, we'll all agree at some point there is going to be a devaluation here. This is the question of when is kind of my perspective on that.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","Patrick Shannon","All right, I will pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler, Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital","Thinking of the Americas, I am wondering if you could describe the margin differential between commercial and institutional and any government business that you might have as the mix of those, let's say micro-segments changes, how does that affect you?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. Jeff, so, you know, we don't really look at it in terms of specific mix within the vertical markets. You know what we are looking at, obviously, is how the total commercial business is performing.","You know relative to residential, I mean, there was a mix change there as the residential volumes were higher proportionate to commercial, but the good news story there is the residential margins are improving. We are getting good throughput in the factory, good productivity there, so that's helping mitigate the mix change.","Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital","That was my next question. I mean, it was surprising that given all the emphasis to put on the residential versus commercial mix, with residential having lower margin you have been able to maintain the margin up there.","The other question that I had was, again, regarding Europe. I guess, is there any change in the timing of 2015 into 2016, where you want to end up at a margin. What is the processor you are going through to get to a, well it a 10% type of margin in Europe. What is the process and timing of that process?","Patrick Shannon","We have made the big moves with our pruning. You see that in terms of the exit of our U.K. Door businesses.","The second step was our internal structural cost. We have tried to move our resources much closer to our markets. The third is really getting enemies five or six markets that I see are strong in our mechanical businesses, in raising the performance and face time of our spec-writers and working with our channel partners to get more of our share in a flat market.","The other side of this is the Interflex business, which we were in the search to appoint an entrepreneurial leader there. That business is performing well and understanding the growth opportunities we have got within that space, so that's how I would kind of frame it.","I was really pleased with the actions that we have taken to get it to this point. I thought the improvement in margins year-over-year for the quarter were outstanding and we are going to continue to work that to reach the aspirations that we see.","Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital","Okay. Just follow-up question, those new Schlage electronic locks, you granted they may be under a different brand name, but are they applicable to the European market or is the European market, let's say, is it resistant to this point to residential wireless electronic locks or is it just going to be three or four years behind just by the normal course of things?","Patrick Shannon","We believe the technology is applicable. I think it's one of the challenges of the new Allegion to think about how we can leverage our technology globally. We are looking at that capability in Europe as well as Asia to be able extend it and we think we have got good opportunities to go there, but work to be done.","Jeff Kessler - Imperial Capital","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Jeff. Good to hear from you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Kepron from CLSA. Your line is open.","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","","Hi. Good morning everybody. Question on the margins in the Americas segment, you called it the shifting and the mix here really weighing on the margin. I am wondering if this purely a function of strength in the residential and weaker non-res products.","You also called that 20%-plus growth in electronic locks and I am wondering how that would affect margins in a positive way?","Patrick Shannon","Yes, so I would say that, if you looked at the revenue, the top-line, the majority of the volume growth was residential related continue to see strong end market growth there, so that was the primary driver, just the mix. The residential margins as you know are lower than the commercial, revenue margins, so that was the driver there.","In terms of electronic locks, it's a good trend for us. We are the category leader in residential electronic locks. We saw good growth there plus-20%. If you think about the margin perspective, I would say equal to maybe slightly better than mechanical traditional locks, but with a much higher price point, so not only are we getting higher margin, but were getting incremental ally dollars as well, because of the higher price point, so that's a good mix shift for us and we see that given our leading position, technology, connectivity we see that growing in the future.","Dave Petratis","I would just add in that Residential segment, the ResPro, which is new construction in our residential activity is very price-competitive, especially in today's market. As we can take e-locks on the residential side, in the retrofit market and move that up, we are going to do better.","The second thing that's improving our margins, remember, a year-and-a-half ago, we moved production capability from IR [Fu Hsing] a joint venture to our Baja facilities that team is doing an excellent job of leaning out that capability and it's having a positive effect on our margins.","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","","Understood. Okay. Then looking at the cash flow statement just two things here, one is the step up in CapEx. I think $26 million year-to-date. It's a little bit ahead of what I had in mind. Could you maybe remind us of what the percentage for this year and next?","Patrick Shannon","Yes. Sure. This year, our CapEx plan is to be around $40 million for the year, so the first half is a little bit higher. That was really done purposely. We had some systems related expenditure to get off of our transitional services agreements, particular [HRMS] systems, so we had anticipated to be front-end loaded, but we are planning on $40 million for the year. As we look into next year, I would anticipate the CapEx to kind of stay around that level close to 2% of revenue.","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","","Okay. Great. Question for Dave regarding the restructuring plan in Europe, so I think you laid out the plan, those three steps, but I am wondering if you also have an idea that what be the ideal manufacturing footprint in Europe and would that be a further step in the restructuring plan?","Dave Petratis","We continue to challenge our manufacturing footprint globally. We certainly hypothesize around what the opportunities are in Europe. We pruning what we did in U.K. was the nice first step. It's always a challenge to restructure in Europe. We think there are opportunities there, but we are also mindful, we need to be close to our end customer, so we are working those alternatives in mind that, how we properly position the business to be successful.","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Clarke of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse","Hey, guys.","Patrick Shannon","Hi, Charles.","Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse","I guess, first question just on tax. I realize that you guys lowered the rate to 30% from 31%, probably being nitpicky here, but is that a function of ongoing internal efforts, or is that more related to mix?","Dave Petratis","More related to mix, a couple things we are able to do there from a strategy perspective to have an impact on that. You know, this is an area that obviously continues to heightened focus. It is a strategic asset of the business and we want to continue to leverage this.","We have engaged external advisors to help us in this area. The more we look into this, I think, the more we like in terms of potential opportunity. There is a lot of work to be done, so right now our guidance hasn't changed in terms of our tax rate and what we anticipate to reduce it to kind of the mid-20s by 2016.","Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. Then just looking at Americas specifically, just looking at the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year just on an adjusted operating profit line, looks like margins were down about 50 basis points. Just wondering if you think in the back half that we should expect Americas' margins to be higher year-over-year just given that blip with the Venezuela pricing that probably won't repeat.","Dave Petratis","Yes. Absolutely. We are still forecasting and projecting full-year margins to be up year-over-year, so consequently the second half margins would be a stronger to mitigate for the first half shortfall there and that's primarily a couple of things. We are looking at strong growth, a better mix in the commercial markets. We are anticipating improved pricing. We have some price increases that went into effect and we are starting to see that come through in our order book and getting good leverage on the incremental volumes as well as you may remember fourth quarter last year had a little noise in it, so the comparisons get a little bit easier in Q4 and that will help us as well for the full-year margin comparisons.","Charles Clarke - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Dave Petratis","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Hi. Good morning. A couple things, I know you didn't want to really get into the margin difference within commercial, commercial versus institutional, but I wonder if you could speak to the kind of product intensity difference, you know, kind of value per square foot or anything like that where you have been able to kind of size the difference, so I would assume your value intensity is much higher on institutional. Just wondering how much lower commercial might be.","Dave Petratis","Institutional versus commercial?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Yes.","Dave Petratis","I have not done the value intensity analysis. It's a good challenge to get to. I would describe it this way that the margins are not significantly lower. What has driven the success of the company in the institutional side is a built-to-order model and our opportunity lies in what I called through stock distributor business, inventory in the shelf, so that we first focus on what I would call the retrofit market, let's say 10-office doors in New York City.","We are doing some test cases and see opportunity to do that. There could be a bit less margin, but I don't think it's significant. We are challenging ourselves and our U.S. the Americas team that there's significant opportunity in this retrofit fast-moving market and how can we do that with our leading brands as well as our price siding brands and growth in that space?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","I was also just wondering on Europe with the U.K. move, is there a substantial amount of, call it, addition by subtraction that could happen as you right size that portfolio. Is there more revenue that comes up through divestiture?","Dave Petratis","I believe we are done. I think it's now continuing to optimize the structure and really working the channel relationships, driving more specification capabilities in front-end of the business. We have lost some of that capability over last five years and that's how you win.","We are looking at our opportunities with Interflex. That's been a good engine for us and you think in the bigger world of connected security, the Internet of things, we think there is good opportunity there, so I would say we are done at least for now.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Then just more for me, just the bad debt expense in Asia, where was that? What was it? Was it distributor, a retailer or project that you completed that you didn't get paid on? Can you give us a little more color there? Is there anything else there we ought to be mindful of?","Dave Petratis","Yes. Jeff, it's primarily related to our system integration business there, which as you know has long tails to the contracts and no payouts from customers accordingly. You know, unfortunately, we had a change in some of the payment history from a couple of primary customers. I would say, this is not a systemic problem. We did a comprehensive review of both, our receivable portfolio as well as the unbilled receivables and reserve there what you see was kind of a fallout of that comprehensive review.","You never want to have these things, but I think we addressed it properly and hopefully we have got it behind us now.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David [MacGregor] of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","","Yes. Good morning. I guess, the question is with respect to your ability to flex your operational excellence programs. Specifically, the second half top-line growth in U.S. commercial and institutional is below your expectations. To what extent do you the ability to accelerate your cost reduction and value stream initiatives to protect the margins?","I think this businesses been modeled and built on its ability to flex up and flex down. I would be critical of our performance in the first half that we anticipated it being the touch stronger and maybe stood at readiness, so we have got our eyes focused that if things don't materialize, we will flex down faster.","Unidentified Analyst","","Okay. I guess, second question is just with regard to the mix. If you could talk specifically with regard to the Americas, what kind of growth you saw in your opening price point brands versus your premium brands?","Dave Petratis","I would say generally disappointed in the opening price point brands. I think that's reflective the replacement market, the retrofit market. There is part of a channel that we are not as well positioned in.","Jeff Kessler asked the question about the [true stock]. I can name several industries where the actual true stock business carries a higher margin. Our challenge is to position ourselves in the channel to enjoy a bigger part of that space.","Unidentified Analyst","","Thank you very much.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Jeremy Kepron of CLSA. Your line is open.","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","Yes. Thank you. Just a follow-up on Jeff's question regarding the Asia-Pacific business and system integration projects over there. Could you tell us a little more about those projects that you expect to come through in the second half and precisely the nature of them. Thank you.","Dave Petratis","You may remember from Analyst Day, we gave an overview. These are typically seven-figure projects, our backlog of those projects are up 20%. This would be providing higher definition cameras in the Pudong airport. These are safe city projects, where we are pulling together systems, a video, car counting, vehicle recognition.","If you look at the Bocom business over the last five years, it tends to be second half-loaded, so normal from our perspective. We think our ability to execute on that is right. We are trying to drive more of our operational excellence initiatives to make sure we apply the same techniques on this more service-oriented capability as we do in our manufacturing capabilities, so we feel good about our ability to bring that moment in second half.","Jeremy Kepron - CLSA","All right. Thank you.","Operator","I am not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to you, Tom, for closing remarks.","Tom Martineau","Okay.

Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call.","With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we'll refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slides number 2 and 3. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law.","Please see our most recent SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from our projections.

Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will now discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and provide an outlook for 2019, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide 4 and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David Petratis","Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion saw another quarter of strong topline revenue growth with strength across all regions.","The Americas saw strong volumes in the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals.","EMEA and Asia-Pacific saw organic growth rates in the mid-single digits.","Acquisitions continued to contribute to total company revenue growth.","Electronics growth moderated in the fourth quarter, with the Americas seeing approximately 7% growth. Residential electronics performed well. However, the nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to the timing of large orders.","We had full-year electronics growth of high teens in the Americas, with strength in both parts of the business. We see the electronics outlook continue to be a long-term positive trend as more and more products become connected for ease of access.","As I stated earlier, nonresidential US end markets remain healthy, with particular strength in institutional verticals. We do see residential new construction softening, but we expect this to be mitigated by electronics and channel initiatives to drive above-market growth. ","The quarter saw continued inflationary pressures which we believe will ease in 2019. Commodities have leveled off and we project to have another solid year in price realization, with particular strength in our Americas nonresidential businesses.","In the fourth quarter, we delivered nearly 10% adjusted EPS growth, bringing the full year expansion to approximately 14% as we drove a robust 37% increase in available cash flow which totaled more than $400 million for the year.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the revenue performance in both the quarter and the full year. Additionally, while operating margin could have been better, I'm satisfied with the growth in EPS that we delivered in the quarter and the full year.","Please go to slide 5 and I'll walk through the fourth-quarter financial summary. In Q4, Allegion delivered strong topline revenue growth. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $702.4 million, an increase of 12.4%, inclusive of the organic growth of 6.7%. ","Acquisitions also contributed to the topline revenue expansion, offsetting the slightly unfavorable currency impact.","All regions grew organically. Americas led the way with organic growth of 7.6% in the quarter, driven by strength in our nonresidential business. ","The EMEA region saw organic growth of 4.3%, driven by performance in the SimonsVoss and the Interflex businesses.","Asia-Pacific had a nice quarter of organic growth, coming in at 4.6% against a tough comparable.","Adjusted operating margins decreased 130 basis points due to the dilution related to acquisitions made in 2018. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, the base operating margins were up 20 basis points.","Inflationary headwinds continued to pressure margin and exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The company is committed to driving price realization and productivity actions, such that, for 2019, the price-productivity-inflation dynamic is expected to be positive, helping to drive margin expansion across all regions of the business.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 increased $0.11 or nearly 10% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating income along with a favorable year-over-year tax rate. ","Available cash flow for the year came in over $408 million, an increase of more than 37% versus prior year. Increased earnings and the non-reoccurring 2017 discretionary pension funding drove the increase.","Please go to slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to talk a little about some of the things we are doing in the connected home space. ","In 2015, Schlage was the first smart lock to respond to \"Hey, Siri. Open my lock.\" Now, Schlage Encode is the first lock to work with the Key by Amazon app and ring devices without needing a Wi-Fi hub. It's built right into the lock.","With Schlage Encode, we took a different approach to development. Starting first with the connected home platform and developing the lock around the desired user experience, the user-first approach is part of our strategic plan to develop and integrate with leaders in connected home platforms.","In addition, we recently announced the Schlage Connect Z-Wave Plus enhancement and its compatibility with ring and Schlage Connect Zigbee certified locks with support home automation systems.","Our deep experience in connected home security has made us a go-to partner for a wide variety of platforms and home automation solutions, including Amazon, Ring, Alarm.com, Google and Apple.","We will continue to build relationships to benefit consumers and accelerate adoption of Schlage smart products.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to update you on our full-year 2019 outlook.","Patrick Shannon ","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning.","If you would, please go to slide number seven. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2018. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 6.7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which delivered 7.6% organic growth led by the nonresidential markets.","EMEA and Asia-Pacific saw continued momentum with mid-single-digit organic growth. ","Pricing for Allegion in the quarter came in at 1.5%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and any additional tariff impacts.","Also during the fourth quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 7% growth and foreign currency was a slight headwind in all three regions.","With the fourth quarter performance, you can see where we ended up for the full year on revenue growth. We delivered more than 13% total revenue growth with double-digit topline growth in all three regions. Organic growth came in at 6% led by the Americas at nearly 7%.","Please go to slide number eight. Reported net revenues for the fourth quarter were $702.4 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.7% versus the prior year, up 6.7% on an organic basis.","Adjusted operating income of $145.2 million increased nearly 6% over the same timeframe from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 20.7% decreased 130 basis points, with the decrease driven by dilution from acquisitions.","Excluding the 2018 acquisitions, adjusted operating margin on the base business was up 20 basis points year-over-year.","Total inflation exceeded price plus productivity by approximately $2.5 million and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points.","We are committed to driving the price-productivity-inflation dynamic positive in 2019 through the following actions. Price realization, improved productivity and operational efficiencies, acquisition integration performance, and softening inflation during the year. ","Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins. As discussed, these incremental investments accelerate topline growth.","Please go slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2017, reported earnings per share was $0.10. Adjusting $1.01 for the prior-year restructuring expenses, integration costs related to acquisitions, charges related to US tax reform and debt refinancing, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11.","Operating results increased earnings per share by $0.10 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impact. Favorable year-over-year tax rate drove another $0.07, with the favorability driven primarily by lower tax rates associated with tax reform along with favorable discrete items. Acquisitions were a $0.01 drag in the quarter, reflecting worse-than-anticipated performance associated with the QMI acquisition in Europe.","The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending continue to drive above-market growth and are providing solid returns on our investment.","The combination of interest expense, other income and non-controlling interests decreased earnings per share by $0.03. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2018 earnings per share of $1.22, an increase of $0.11 or nearly 10% compared to the prior-year period.","Lastly, we have a $0.17 per share benefit primarily driven by adjustments to the provisions related to the enactment of tax reform, which more than offset reductions for charges related to acquisitions and restructuring.","After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth-quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.39.","Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $492.7 million, up 13% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by strong volume in the nonresidential business as well as continued pricing benefits.","The electronics growth for the quarter was approximately 7%. Residential electronics in the quarter performed well. However, nonresidential electronics growth decelerated due to timing of large orders.","For the full year, growth in electronic products was solid, coming in at high teens, with strength in both residential and nonresidential products. ","Price realization in the quarter was 1.5%. Pricing in the nonresidential business was strong, offset by residential promotional activities.","The nonresidential business grew low-double digits excluding acquisitions. Residential growth was flat in the quarter with strength in electronics, offset by some cannibalization of the mechanical business.","Acquisitions added nearly 6% to total revenue.","Americas adjusted operating income of $131.8 million increased 5.3% versus the prior-year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 190 basis points. The 2018 acquisitions continued to be dilutive as expected and had 120 basis point impact.","Inflation and incremental investments exceeded price plus productivity in the quarter. Strong volume leverage and positive mix partially offset these impacts.","Please go to slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $157.4 million, up 4.4% and up 4.3% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter and strength in electronics, led by the SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses. The impact of acquisitions offset currency headwinds. ","EMEA adjusted operating income of $22.5 million decreased approximately 10% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 230 basis points, driven primarily by dilution from acquisitions.","As stated earlier, the poor acquisition performance was driven by our QMI business, which experienced reduced revenues in a challenging market environment, a significant mix shift to lower margin business along with some operational inefficiencies.","We have identified areas of opportunity, have commenced plans to get the QMI business back to profitability. Operational performance improvement will gradually occur throughout the course of 2019.","In addition, inflation and incremental investments slightly exceeded price plus productivity. Strong volume leverage offset some of these unfavorable impacts.","Please go to slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $52.3 million, up 44.9% versus the prior year. Organic revenue continued to rebound, growing nicely at 4.6% against a tough comparable.","Total revenue growth was driven by the GWA Door and Access business acquisition. Foreign currency was a headwind for the quarter.","Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $6.5 million, an increase of nearly $2 million with adjusted operating margins down 60 basis points versus the prior-year period. Diluted from acquisitions drove the margin decline. ","The base business adjusted operating margins were up 120 basis points with price and productivity more than offsetting the favorable impacts from inflation and incremental investments. Good volume leverage was able to offset negative mix.","Please go to slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2018 came in at $408.7 million, which is an increase of $110.8 million compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by higher net earnings, along with the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017. Available cash flow continues to remain strong and exceeded prior estimates.","Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in fourth-quarter 2018 when compared to the prior-year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses.","And while working capital as a percent of revenue saw a slight increase, we did see a reduction in the cash conversion cycle. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow.","I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for a review on our full-year 2019 outlook.","David Petratis","Thank you, Patrick. Please go slide number 14. We continue to see favorable trends on our primary end markets in 2019. And it is our expectation that the organic investments, combined with our ability to execute, will again deliver better than market growth.","We also believe the electronic portfolio will continue to outpace mechanical in all regions and we are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this industry trend.","In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals, led by the institutional markets. We expect the general trend toward electronic products to continue, which helped mitigate the softening that we are expecting in residential new construction.","With these expectations, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 5% to 6%. We are projecting Americas' total revenue expansion to also be 5% to 6%, with any remaining impact from the 2018 acquisitions to be offset by currency headwinds.","For the EMEA region, we expect strength in our electronics business to more than offset weaknesses in Southern Europe and the United Kingdom.","For the region, we project organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%.","Currency headwinds are expected to more than offset acquisition benefits, bringing expected total revenue growth in EMEA region to flat to 2%.","In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China, with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 4% to 6% and total revenue growth is estimated to be 22% to 24%, reflecting the full-year impact of the acquisition of Gainsborough Hardware and API.","All in, we are projecting total growth of the company at 5% to 6% and our organic growth also at 5% to 6%.","Please go to slide 15. Our 2019 outlook for adjusted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of approximately 6% to 9%. As indicated, the earnings increase is driven by revenue growth and operational improvements as adjusted operating earnings are expected to increase 10% to 14%. Inflationary pressures will continue to be a headwind in the first half of the year, but we anticipate pricing and productivity actions to help drive margin expansion for 2019.","Incremental investments continue to be a headwind as we continue to focus on accelerating new product development and channel initiatives, which we believe enable us to keep delivering above-market growth and allowing us to take advantage of the shifting customer preferences to electronic products.","Other expense is expected to be a drag on EPS, primarily driven by pension expense. Our outlook assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 16%, an increase from 13.5% in 2018 and outstanding diluted shares of approximately 95.5 million.","The outlook also includes $0.15 per share impact from restructuring charges and acquisition-related costs during the year. As a result, reported EPS is estimated to be $4.60 to $4.75.","We are projecting our available cash flow for 2019 to be in the $430 million to $450 million range.","Please go to slide 16. We're very pleased with our 2018 topline growth that delivered organic revenue expansion of 6%, driven by electronics which we see as a positive trend for us in the future.","While operating margin could have been better, we did deliver full-year adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14% in 2018 and we saw a robust 37% increase in available cash flow to more than $400 million.","As we look to 2019, we expect to drive continual organic growth above market. We also expect to deliver solid growth in adjusted EPS and generate substantial available cash flow.","We are well-positioned for 2019 and are committed to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive. ","I want to finish by saying that 2018 also marks Allegion's first five years as an independent company","From the beginning, we told customers, shareholders and employees we would deliver sustained profitable growth and greater value. We have delivered industry-leading organic growth at a five-year CAGR of 5.6%. We have industry-leading margins.","We are focused on the safety of our employees, health of our employees and employee engagement. We invested in the business, especially in electronics, and our positioned nicely for the future.","Allegion is a company our shareholders can be proud to own.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And this morning's first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good morning. This is Josh Hanson in for Tim.","David Petratis","Good morning, Josh.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the Americas segment. The pricing versus productivity and inflation comparison seems to be more challenging this quarter. I know you mentioned the residential price dynamic, but just wondering what were some of the important drivers behind that. Did higher raw material costs start to flow through the balance sheet? Just kind of give us some color on that, would be great.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. So, Josh, I would characterize it as follows. We commented really good strength in pricing in the commercial area. Pricing on residential was lower than anticipated, primarily due to promotional activities and some rebates and those type of things. And that ebbs and flows during the course of the year occasionally. So, a little bit lower pricing than anticipated on the residential side. On the productivity, continue to get good productivity, particularly on materials. Inflation was more than anticipated, not so much on the raw materials, but more on the nonmaterial side. So, inefficiencies associated with nonmaterials on manufacturing, those type of things. As we look forward to 2019, we believe we have a very strong pipeline in terms of productivity on both material and productivity projects from a manufacturing perspective. The dynamic will become positive in 2019 and it will continue to get better during the course of the year, particularly on the inflation side where, as you know, the commodities have kind of stabilized today relative to where they were in Q3. It starts to almost become deflation in the second half of the year, so that will benefit us as we progress throughout 2019.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks for the color there, Patrick. And for my follow-up, could I ask about the electronics growth? You mentioned a larger order within the commercial side. I guess, is it one large project in the prior year or some distributor dynamics, just some color on what drove that and how to think about electronics growth kind of going into next year?","Patrick Shannon","So, really good, continued strong growth in resi, electronics. It was more of a tough comp relative to last year on the non-resi side. But as we look forward again to 2019, don't see any reason why we can't sustain kind of mid-teens electronics growth across our portfolio. Feel really good where we're positioned, particularly when we look at some of our new products that we've introduced earlier this year. Dave talked about Encode. I think that's going to grow well for us this year. We've got some other things in the pipeline going forward. So, I think we're well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this trend. And as you know, it's still low penetration rates overall from a residential adoption and new homes. And so, we think that will continue to drive outperformance going forward.","David Petratis","Josh, I would just say, in the institutional\/commercial, you can get some relatively large projects where you go in and retrofit an entire building or campus. This is what we saw. We continue to be extremely motivated by the growth that we see in electronics and Allegion's position as we go forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. ","David Petratis","Good morning, Julian. ","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. Maybe my first question just around following up on pricing. I think pricing was a bit less of a gross tailwind in Q4 than Q3. It was up I think 1.5 points. The prior quarter, it was up about just over 2% year-on-year. So, maybe just give a bit more color on why that happened on the extent of those promotional activities that you just mentioned and whether you've seen any change in competitive dynamics in any portion of the market in the Americas.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. So, Q4 pricing was anticipated to be sequentially down relative to Q3. And the reason for that is because, in Q3, we basically had the effect of two price increases in there. Remember, we pulled forward the pricing increase at the beginning of the quarter. And 2017, you had a price increase that went into effect in August, and so you had, in effect, two price increases, if you will, for one of the months in the quarter. So, the expectation was that the pricing was going to come down sequentially.","1.5% is still pretty strong when we look at how the rest of the market is performing. Commercial, we continue to perform extremely well. Very pleased with how the team is pushing price there and remaining competitive on big quote activity. The decline may be a little bit lighter than expected and, again, it relates to the residential business on the promotional activities and the sell-through to the consumer.","I don't look at that necessarily a longer term impact. Going into 2019, would expect pricing to remain robust and would expect us to be able to deliver kind of the 1.5% increase year-over-year in 2019 relative to 2018.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And then, my question would really be about the residential business in the Americas in terms of market landscape. Maybe just clarify how much of your Americas business for 2018 as a whole was residential and what do you expect the residential piece of your business to grow in 2019?","David Petratis","So, think about a residential position about 30%. As we look to 2019, the new construction elements of the residential market will be softening. I think that's well understood. We have \u2013 in the retrofit side of it, which was our strongest position with our new electronic products, we believe that will give us good opportunities for growth and is really how we've been positioning the company. ","In a single-family, multi-family, electronic penetration is low single-digits and we're growing well above that, and we think it sets up nicely. We have also, in our channel initiatives, have some success winning some large contract with top builders. And we think, overall, we're set up for a nice year in a softer residential environment.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David Petratis","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Just to follow-up on the resi question there, did you see anything in the fourth quarter in terms of destock around the shifting landscape in that channel? It seems like the market share landscape is shifting a little bit, notably that a competitor has had some success with some of their offering. So, I'm wondering how much of what you're seeing is response to the new market versus some channel fill by some other folks. Just trying to get my hands around how much of this is short-term noise versus something that's more of a market-driven weakness over time.","David Petratis","I think in terms of the big box, there was some shifting in terms of the timing of orders as they saw deceleration in the res side of the market. We do see new competitors coming into the electronic space around res. I think if you walk through the Consumer Electronics Show, there's many new entries. I think the number of announcements and enhancements that we made to our product portfolio in terms of connectivity, as well as our channel initiatives, it positions us nicely for 2019.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then, on the 2019 implied margin guidance, Patrick, it looks like relative to the way you guys have framed up operating leverage historically that there's, call it, an extra 10 points in incremental margin or maybe $10 million of EBIT. Should we think about that as kind of the catch up from 4Q? If I were to include that in 4Q and say the price cost or some of the other irritation items wouldn't have happened, you would have had a more normal incremental in 4Q. It looks like you're catching that up in 2019. Is that directionally fair?","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. I think that's absolutely fair. And as we've indicated on the guidance for 2019, all of the EPS growth is operational related. And it's the pressure on the blow [ph] items that were getting lower than expected earnings per share growth. So, the idea here is we're going to continue to press price to the extent we can and market remain competitive and we believe we're well-positioned to do that in 2019.","The inflation dynamic is subsiding, particularly on the materials side. That will benefit us as well. We've got a strong pipeline of productivity actions that we're going to implement. We've got some areas of opportunity for improvement. I'd call it self-help on the M&A integration that we performed lower than anticipated. And then, we've initiated some restructuring activities that will help reduce our cost base as well. So, collectively, when you add all that together, I think we're well-positioned to execute on margin improvement across all regions of the business. And I feel pretty good relative to the guide. It should help us get back to kind of the 2017 margins that we enjoyed in that year.","David Petratis","Josh, I would add to that. I think I put a lot on the business in 2018. Seven acquisitions. We really pressed hard on the digitization. And as we prepare to refresh our strategic plan and went through our budgets to prepare for 2019 and really a heavy emphasis on execution and focus and I think we'll get that leverage back to our 2017 OI operating margins. ","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. Thanks for the color. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Securities Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","David Petratis","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Hey. Just a question on cash flow. You guys are generating quite a bit of it. And I would imagine, I think, part of the debt leverage has to do with your tax structure. So, maybe you're not going to de-lever. Should we expect more emphasis on M&A because you did raise dividend very nicely, but that's still fairly small. Or how do you think about in 2019, M&A versus buybacks given where the stock price is. Thank you.","Patrick Shannon","So, I would start off by saying, from a capital structure perspective, as you guys know, we ended the year in the best position since spin in terms of our leverage ratio, which provides with a lot of optionality and flexibility going forward. I just think we're well positioned there.","If you look at our capital allocation strategy, three pillars \u2013 organic investments, M&A, shareholder distribution. On the organic investments, we talk about that. We're going to continue to invest in the business for opportunities that will expand our channel presence, getting more of the wallet from our distribution base, as well as the expanding new products through R&D efforts and those type of things, promotional items, demand creation. That's based in our earnings per share and we'll continue to manage that with nice earnings growth going forward.","So, your question on the M&A, as Dave mentioned, we executed a lot of acquisitions in 2018. There's opportunities to continue to drive performance in those and spend maybe a little bit more time continuing to integrate those. And if you look at our history in terms of our acquisition performance, they really start to perform nicely kind of 2 to 3 years out. So, you have to look at these more on a long-term basis. And we'll continue to drive that execution.","Having said that, we will continue to remain active and looking at opportunities to expand our business either through new products or geographic expansion. Our pipeline remains robust. But the key is we'll be disciplined. And we'll only do transactions that we believe will provide a good return on invested capital going forward, of course.","Shareholder distribution, we're not going to hoard cash. And we've always said, we're going to utilize the capital that we generate to either do M&A or shareholder distributions through the incremental dividend. You mentioned 29% increase this year. And you can probably see it's being more active on share buyback right now. And we're going to execute our capital allocation strategy to provide the best return we can for our shareholders going forward. And that could be either M&A or shareholder distribution or a combination of those.","Andrew Obin","I'll leave the question on digital strategy for the analyst day, but just a question on European growth. What would it take for Europe to get to consistent double-digit margins over time? And, I guess, EMEA. Not Europe. Sorry.","David Petratis","I think continued expansion in the electronic portfolios. Extremely pleased with the SimonsVoss, Interflex performance. And I think the European market, especially in the res side of things, in its infancy, the slowest growth market. As that picks up acceleration, we think we're in a good position to benefit from that.","Andrew Obin","But you don't feel like you need to scale up significantly in your sort of M&A to fill capacity? Or do you think you can get it with existing product lines?","Patrick Shannon","So, I would characterize it this way. As David said, continuous improvement to get to kind of our top competitor in that market landscape would require either significant facility rationalization and\/or scale, getting more back-office synergies, those type of things would certainly facilitate that. But there's opportunity for continuous improvement and we will continue to drive that.","Andrew Obin","Fantastic. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Kwas","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a clarification with regards to the electronic lock. So, 30% growth in Q3 and 7% this quarter. You referenced some weakness on the non-res side. So, was it really more the project side or the comp time? I'm a little confused because your comps have been pretty steady mid-teens, high teens over the last couple of years. So, it seemed to be more project related. Did you have some come in Q3 and then something fall out of Q4. Is that the right way to think about it? Can you clarify that?","Patrick Shannon","You should think about it as project related. Remember, we put up a 30% in Q3 which was pretty impressive. The steam came out of that. I think when you think about our electronics growth, I'd look at it on multiple quarters. We continue to be at the high teens level in a market that we think is converting at maybe 7% to 8%.","Richard Kwas","But the way to think about it, Q3 had some projects come in that maybe you didn't expect in Q4 had the opposite. Is that on the non-res side?","Patrick Shannon","That's right. Correct.","Richard Kwas","Okay. And then, just on the inflation side, so on the raw side, within finished component side, it would seem like you're going to get some tailwind here starting sometime in the first half. Is this really more a labor freight issue? That's what it sounds like. And the productivity initiatives, I imagine you're gearing it towards that. Is there some more color around that?","David Petratis","So, on the inflation side, on materials specifically, commodity is kind of a mixed bag. Steel still remains higher than prior year levels. However, zinc and brass, some other major inputs into our products, lower. Collectively, Rich, we're not quite at a point right now where the year-over-year is going to show significant improvement. It's going to be more backend loaded, I would say, on materials. And then, you do have the continued inflation just on the normal operational stuff. So, think about it across the board, whether it be salaries on personnel, freight, packaging, all these type of input costs throughout the supply chain to get our product to customers. We are experiencing increased costs relative to the prior-year. So, we'll continue to manage that through cost-containment and\/or driving productivity, whether it be through CapEx spending or other measures to get continued efficiencies in our manufacturing footprint.","Richard Kwas","Okay. And then, one last clarification, with regards to the guide, is there a number we can think about in terms of M&A EPS contribution from 2018 into 2019? I assume it's within this $0.62 to $0.77 of operations, but just curious what you expect the 2018 acquisitions to add?","Patrick Shannon","So, minimal because most of them have already lapped, okay? So, most of the acquisitions for Americas has now lapped itself. Europe, there is like a one month additional month in there. So, there's not any really incremental benefit in 2019 related to 2018 acquisitions. I think the key point to mention in the guide, it doesn't assume any additional M&A activity which would be accretive to earnings and\/or share repurchase. So, it's kind of \u2013 look at it as an organic basis and that could be, if executed appropriately, some additional earnings growth.","Richard Kwas","Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","David Petratis","Good morning.","John Walsh","Just wanted to get a little more color around the $0.15 of incremental investments. kind of where they live as we think about the segments. And I know you talked about broadly new product and channel initiatives, but maybe you could also specifically speak about some of those channel initiatives in residential, if that's growing a broader presence in certain retailers or how you think about those strategies?","Patrick Shannon","So, the $0.15 on the incremental investment is distributed really basis of the size of the region. So, therefore, you would have a higher emphasis on investment in Americas relative to Europe and Asia. They are specific around driving new product development. So, putting more emphasis on resources and engineering to accelerate new product \u2013 get products out to the market faster. With the channel initiatives -- so think of demand creation, really trying to accelerate electronics growth, whether it be in the resi and\/or non-residential segment. So, we will continue to do that. Those would be the key items. As you kind of look at phasing in 2019, little bit more front-end loaded in our plan for 2019 than what you might have historically seen. So, we'll continue to invest in the business. We believe they provide good growth opportunities, good cash on cash payback as well as return on capital.","David Petratis","I would say, in terms of specific initiatives to grow in resi, more segmentation in the market. I mentioned earlier that we're picking up some wins with the big builders. We think that's driven by our electronic capabilities. Multi-family will continue to be strong in 2019. And this, again, is where electronic access is a value creator for those residential operators. And then, working with the big box in terms of point of display and inventory stocking to make sure that we've got the products on the shelves that will help pull through sales of our Schlage products.","John Walsh","Got you. Thank you. And then, as a follow-up, you've talked about investments kind of being front-end loaded here. When we think about the price, cost, productivity, you mentioned that, in the back half, it kind of actually look like deflation on some of the material costs. How should we think about the quarterly cadence or the first half\/second half relative to normal history? I think you normally do about 47% of your OP and EPS in the first half. Given those dynamics, should we think that that deviates a little bit or is that still the normal seasonality, is still the right way to think about the year?","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. Maybe a little bit more back-end loaded, I think. It's interesting, on the growth side of things, which we get pretty good operating leverage on growth, coming out of the gate, Q1 is always a little bit lighter relative to our overall growth and then it accelerates in Q2, Q3 kind of relative to the seasonality of our business. And we saw some good acceleration in Q4. So, I would kind of think about it in the same type of pattern, but from a margin contribution perspective, with the inflation kind of subsiding more in the back end of the year, so look at a heavier mix of operational improvement in the second half relative to the first half.","David Petratis","I would add to that, we are very intentional in our 2019 budgeting. I think we've got the activities that will drive margin expansion throughout the year, but the nature of it, some of these projects will go over multi quarters and will pick up momentum as the year goes on.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Robert Aurand","Hi. Rob Aurand on for David this morning. Can you talk about the month to month cadence of growth within the quarter? And then, I guess, coming into January, can you talk about the government shutdown? Did you see any impact from that at all?","David Petratis","I'd say in terms of the month-to-month growth, we naturally slow down with the construction cycle as we go through the fourth quarter. We saw some of that. I think you also saw, particularly res, our big box partner backing off some orders because of the softness that was projected in the overall res market.","Patrick Shannon","The other thing I would add, and then [indiscernible], just across the landscape of various businesses, the cold weather has impacted a little bit. We've had some occasions of factory shutdowns just because of the extreme cold temperatures in certain regions of the US. So, a little impact there as well.","David Petratis","I'd say government shutdown, we were more heavily impacted by weather. When mechanical installers can't get on the jobsite, you see that. And there are parts of the country that are having some pretty tough challenges. We'll see that as it develops, but I'd hang that on weather versus the government shutdown.","Robert Aurand","Okay. And then, just can you remind us about your tariff exposure and what's going into guidance?","Patrick Shannon","So, all tariff exposure is built to the guidance basis of what we know today. We'll see and monitor how that develops going forward. I think you've heard us talk previously that we don't have a lot of exposure because we source, manufacture and sell pretty much in region. For products that we do import from China, to the extent that they are exposed to tariffs beginning in March, that is baked in our guidance. However, as we've indicated, we are mitigating the impact of that, either through price increase that we instituted late last year and\/or productivity resourcing, those type of things, to minimize those impacts. So, all of that is baked in. So, a favorable outcome could be some upside going forward.","Robert Aurand","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David Petratis","Good morning.","Jeffrey Sprague","First maybe just a housekeeping one for Patrick. Patrick, you're guiding the tax rate up year-over-year, but I think down certainly relative to what I was thinking. I'm not sure where the Street was. But the nature of my question is, we've seen a number of non-US domiciled companies here recently signaling that their tripped up on the deductibility of interest expense and are kind of suggesting their tax rates are going to be going up. It doesn't seem like that's caught you here in 2019. But do you have any color on that? And why that may or may not be impacting your situation?","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. So, I can't really, obviously, comment on other companies and their particular tax situations. But maybe the general comment is relative to some of these proposed regulations that were issued at the end of the year, they are extremely complex and, as you say, can impact foreign-domiciled companies as well as multinational companies. And so, maybe your commentary is kind of caught up in that. I think there's going to be a lot of commentary and we'll see kind of where that ends up. But relative to Allegion, we've evaluated those extensively with our outside advisors. And we've made some necessary tweaks, necessary to kind of feel pretty good relative to our 16% effective tax rate guide for 2019. And we'll see where it goes going forward, but I think we're okay for 2019. And as it relates to interest deductibility relative to the US tax reform in 2017, that does impact us a little bit from a cash tax perspective and that's baked in our available cash flow numbers. So, our cash taxes, because of some of that limitation, will always be higher than our book provision.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. That's helpful. And then, you mentioned cannibalization as it relates to electronics growth. It sounds fairly obvious, right, the outgrowth you're having there. But is there anything that is starting to impact your manufacturing costs, your footprint, how your plans are lined up as this mix shifts? Anything that's disrupted the margins or is going to require restructuring, anything of size or scope that should be aware of?","Patrick Shannon","I don't see that, Jeff. We've got a nice position out of the Baja that we think sets that up nicely. Our res electronics are built there and we think the superior access to market and be able to get those in production quickly really helps us. So, feel good about our position. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Hi, thank you. Good morning, guys. ","David Petratis","Hi, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Hey. Maybe just touching on the Americas organic guide for a second, is there a way to maybe parse that out a little bit further. So, you guys talked a little bit about softening in new construction, resi new construction. But is the expectation then that resi new is going to be down? And then, just any other color around like the different end markets and the buildup to that guide would be helpful?","David Petratis","So, our view on residential new construction is softer in 2019 versus 2018. I think we mitigate that somewhat through our electronic offerings and our strong position in retrofit.","As we move to the noninstitutional, we continue to see strength in the educational market, which is K-12 and college campuses. That's one of our strongholds. Two things working there. You've got continued investment in electronic conversion. We think healthcare continues to be a good opportunity for the company, not so much in the big hospitals, but in the trend to go to smaller medical suites, diagnostic center, those types of things that you see happening nationwide. And then, commercial offices continue to be okay.","As I travel around the country, and I have extensively in the last 75 days, I feel a good pulse and beat in the commercial and institutional campuses, and that's reflected in how we see our growth in 2019.","Joe Ritchie","Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And if I can maybe follow-up on just talking about EMEA for a second, any other additional color you can provide on QMI specifically? And as it relates to the broader margin kind of target in that business for 2019, should we expect, just like this reacceleration or improvement in margins, can we get to double digits in 2019? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.","Patrick Shannon","So, obviously, the QMI performance was disappointing in the quarter. Tough market conditions. And that business is a longer-earnings process. So, think of installation work and when jobs get deferred for whatever reason, you're kind of saddled with some fixed costs that hit us in the quarter. We're taking action to mitigate some of those costs going forward and would expect sequential improvement continuous throughout the year to get back to profitability. So, that will start being reported, obviously, in base business beginning this quarter for Europe. So, think of Europe in aggregate along with the rest of the business with continuous margin improvement during the course of the year, either through better performance on this QMI business specifically and\/or productivity \u2013 the price-inflation dynamic getting better. And so, you'll see us back close to that double-digit operating profit margin for the full year.","Joe Ritchie","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Kessler ","Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. With regard \u2013 just getting back to the institutional markets in the US and the healthcare markets, realizing that they've been in a lot of people's pipelines for long time, but nothing is really broken out yet. Does it appear to you right now that these business \u2013 that these verticals are about to accelerate in terms of your ability to \u2013 whether you're getting it from the channel or whether you're getting it directly from them, not just educational institutions, but other institutions that maybe have been part of a discussion pipeline for a while, is that pipeline about to be turned really into \"backlog\"?","David Petratis","I believe, as I look at our backlog, they remain healthy. More importantly, the spec and quote remain healthy on both of these verticals. I wouldn't characterize it as an acceleration. I just think as we continue to drive portfolio expansion through new products and acquisitions like AV and TGP, as well as superior execution on working these more complex application, we tend to get more than our fair share. ","And I look at these market as solid and our execution can be good and it's going to benefit us in the next 12 months.","Jeffrey Kessler ","A follow-up is just \u2013 against your two major competitors over in Europe, you're somewhat of a newbie with regards to the commercial door manufacturing business. Do you feel that that you've learned something on QMI or is that so much of a one-off that it is not indicative of the dynamics of the door manufacturer market, either in EMEA or in the United States?","David Petratis","So, we have been in the hollow metal business since 1970. So, this is something under the Steelcraft brand. We're pretty knowledgeable of the space. I think as we moved into the Middle East and look back on that acquisition, number one, you've got market turbulence with some of the political instability in the Middle East. Number two, there was a pretty good change in the mix of business under the previous ownership that was target on prisons [ph] that moved. And then, third, you've got to be mindful \u2013 I don't care if you look at the wood or hollow metal business, these are tough areas to operate. So, we're mindful of that. We believe that the acquisition of QMI, Republic and what we've done with AV Systems, which is a sliding door capability, complements our strategy. We'll get those integrated and they'll perform to our satisfaction in the future.","Jeffrey Kessler ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. So, as there are no more questions, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to return the conference back over to Michael Wagnes for any closing comments.","Michael Wagnes ","We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. And please contact me if you have any further questions. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Welcome to the Allegion First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer-session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s presentation Mr. Tom Martineau, Director, of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.","Tom Martineau","Thank you, Howard. Good morning, welcome and thank for joining us for the first quarter 2015 Allegion earnings call. With me today is Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we will refer to you in today\u2019s call are available on our Web site at www.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our Web site.","Please go to Slide Number 2. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Our release and today\u2019s commentary includes non-GAAP financial measures which exclude restructuring and spin expenses from prior year results. Excluded from the current quarter results is a remeasurement of monetary assets and inventory charge reflecting a change from the Venezuela SICAD II exchange rate to using the Venezuelan government\u2019s market-based SIMADI exchange rate. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our first quarter 2015 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A we\u2019d like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Petratis","Thanks, Tom. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another solid quarter of organic revenue and EPS growth. We continue to make progress on our capital allocation plan and are beginning to realize the early benefits of our new product and channel initiative.","Revenues of $458 million grew 5.9% on an organic basis. Total revenue declined 1.7% reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency. All regions posted positive organic growth.","Of note, the Americas segment grew 7.7% organically driven by strength in the non-residential business. Adjusted operating income of $75.2 million, decreased 2.5% versus last year and as we mentioned in the previous earnings call, incremental investments were a headwind to margins in the first quarter which declined by 10 basis points. The investment impact was approximately 170 basis points.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.51 increased 15.9% versus the prior year driven primarily from improved operating performance and a lower effective tax rate offset by incremental investments in foreign exchange impact. This is our third straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth.","In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 Allegion shares, which more than offset dilution related to incentive plans. We are affirming our full-year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $2.65 to $2.75 or $2.61 to $2.71 on a reported basis which reflects the first quarter Venezuelan devaluation charge that Tom mentioned previously.","Please go to Slide 4. As you know opportunistic acquisitions is one of Allegion\u2019s five strategic pillars. Aligned with this we\u2019ve recently announced two acquisitions and I\u2019d like to welcome Zero International and Brio to the Allegion team. We remain focused on acquiring great businesses and these strategic acquisitions will expand our product portfolio and provide opportunity to expand globally.","Zero International is a recognized leader in door and window products for commercial applications. These product lines include premium ceiling systems for sound control, fire and smoke protection, and threshold applications. The high-quality product portfolio from Zero expands our customer offerings which can be leveraged through our existing specification capability in channels.","The acquisition of Brio expected to close in the second quarter at sliding and holding door hardware to Allegion\u2019s portfolio that provides opportunity to expand globally. Brio\u2019s suite of products include door hardware systems and accessories for interior sliding and folding doors, weather fold exterior folding doors, straight-sliding, top-hung and bottom-roller doors and retractable insect screens.","We\u2019ve made significant progress in building the relationships and capability necessary to execute on our acquisition strategy. We continue to work the pipeline and are confident we are building this as a core competency.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I will be back to discuss our full-year 2015 guidance.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide Number 5. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth in the first quarter as well as our growth by regional segments.","As indicated, we delivered 5.9% organic growth in the first quarter, supported by incremental volume reflecting improving market fundamentals, modest price improvements, and early traction on our key organic investments in products and channels.","We saw good growth across most product segments and continue to experience favorable traction on our electronic products portfolio. All segments reported positive organic revenue growth for the quarter.","Currency rates continue to be a headwind to revenue growth as reflected by negative 7.4% decline. All reporting segments were impacted. Most notably, the weaker euro in EMEA and softer Canadian dollar and Venezuelan Bol\u00edvar devaluation impact in Americas results.","In Asia-Pacific, the impact of weaker Australian, New Zealand dollars were offset by Prior year acquisition. As a result of unfavorable exchange rates, reported revenue decreased 1.7% compared to the prior year period.","Please go to Slide Number 6. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $458.7 million. This reflects a decrease of 1.7% versus the prior year, up 5.9% on an organic basis. We realized 2.6% growth in the Americas, up 7.7% on an organic basis. U.S non-residential grew high single digits and residential segments X Venezuela increased low single digits.","EMEA revenues were down 17.6% driven by currency headwind. Asia-Pacific revenues were up 3.2% with good traction on residential electronic locks. Adjusted operating income was $75.2 million, decreased 2.5% compared to the prior year. The decline was driven by increased investment spending in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.","Adjusted operating margin of 16.4% reflects a decrease of 10 basis points versus the prior year. This was expected for the first quarter and reflects the impact of incremental investments and currency rates already mentioned. Incremental investments made in the areas of new product development, channel and market expansion, and certain infrastructure programs had an impact of 170 basis points on the quarter. This headwind was largely offset by the favorable operating leverage on the increased volume. The impact of incremental investment comparisons get easier in the second half of the year.","We are in the early stage of new product and channel initiatives and are very encouraged by the early feedback from the market. We continue to navigate the currency headwind, but still expect margin rates to improve in all regions for the full-year.","Please go to Slide Number 7. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter of 2014, reported EPS was $0.38. Adjusting for prior year one-time separation and restructuring expenses of $0.06, the 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.44.","Operational results increased EPS by $0.09 as pricing, productivity, and favorable operating leverage more than offset inflation. The decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate at 20.2% grow $0.06 per share improvement versus the prior year. Of note, we benefited from discrete tax items in the current quarter that were exchange rate related. We are forecasting these types of items to balance out on a full-year basis and accordingly are maintaining our effective tax rate guidance of 22%.","Interest expense improvements from the credit facility amendment in 2014 added $0.01 and other net items added $0.01 primarily due to lower non-controlling interest expenses. Foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by $0.04 due to the stronger U.S dollar compared to most currencies across the globe.","Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel management as well as corporate initiatives tied to our strategies specific to taxes and M&A were $0.06 reduction. This results in adjusted first quarter 2015 EPS of $0.51 per share.","Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04 per share reduction for the Venezuela devaluation charge to revalue monetary assets, the non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory. After giving effect to these one-time items you arrive at the first quarter 2015 reported EPS of $0.47.","Please go to Slide Number 8. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $354.3 million, up 2.6% or an increase of 7.7% on an organic basis. Higher volumes and pricing compensated for unfavorable currency movements in Canada and Venezuela. The higher volume reflects solid results against a weak weather impacted 2014, but also steady non-residential improvement and better than market results with our new products and channel initiatives.","Net favorable pricing reflects traction in the non-residential segment, offset by slightly unfavorable residential pricing driven by pricing adjustments to clear older generation product and make shelf space for our new electronic products and new merchandising connected to our style and design strategy.","Americas adjusted operating income of $88.4 million, was up 2.1% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 10 basis points due to incremental investment spending which created a 150 basis point headwind in the quarter. The investments are related to the previously mentioned new products and channel development initiatives.","Please go to Slide Number 9. First quarter revenues for the EMEA region were $81.7 million, down 17.6% and up 0.7% on an organic basis. Currency headwind continues to be a challenge in the region due to the softening euro and the Russian ruble, which impacts Eastern European sales. Solid results in Interflex hospitality in Turkey more than offset weakness in France and the soft Eastern European performance.","EMEA adjusted operating income of $2.6 billion was up $1.4 million or 116.7% versus the prior year period on revenues that were down over 17%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points primarily due to favorable pricing and productivity that more than offset inflation, investment, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.","We are pleased with the ongoing improvement in this region, especially with increased currency headwinds and unfavorable sales mix due to lower Eastern European sales. The Company continues to target an operating margin of 10% in 2016 with our ongoing cost reduction and productivity initiatives, specific customer and market pricing actions in the elimination of unprofitable business.","Please go to Slide Number 10. First quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $22.7 million, up 3.2%. Modest pricing and volume increases in the prior year acquisition more than offset unfavorable currency exchange rate movements. Residential electronic locks continue to grow in the region and the system integration pipeline supports the full-year outlook which is seasonally weighted to the second half of the year.","Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of negative $2.6 million was up 10.3% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points due to incremental pricing, productivity, and the prior year acquisition of FSH which offset inflation and currency exchange impacts. As a reminder, the Asia-Pacific region historically loses money in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business with the lowest revenues in the first quarter.","Please go to Slide Number 11. Available cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 was negative $4.8 million, an improvement of $4.4 million compared to the prior year. The negative cash flow was typical of our historical performance reflects seasonal use of working capital.","We continue to operate with an effective working capital structure and have realized that year-over-year improvement in working capital as a percent of revenue in every quarter since the spent. In addition, our cash conversion cycle improved 17% in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to guide full-year available cash flow of 95% of net earnings from continuing operations.","Please go to Slide Number 12. As mentioned in our last call, the Venezuelan government announced changes to exchange rate system that introduced a new market-based system called the Marginal Currency System or SIMADI. We adopted the SIMADI rate after its introduction and recorded a charge of $7 million before tax and non-controlling interest were $0.04 per share.","The charge includes remeasurement of net monetary assets of $2.8 million and non-cash impairment charge to adjust Venezuelan inventory balances of $4.2 million. Subsequent changes to the market-based SIMADI rate will flow through the income statement. However, at the current level of exchange, Venezuelan operating results are expected to have minimal impact to Allegion reported 2015 results.","I'll now hand it back over to Dave for an update of our full-year 2015 guidance.","Dave Petratis","Thanks, Patrick. Please go to Slide 13. Looking at full-year revenue guidance, we are increasing our organic growth expectations, but decreasing our overall revenue growth based on increased exchange rate headwinds. The incremental organic growth is from the Americas region and reflects continued optimism in 2015 markets and ongoing traction of our growth initiatives.","We continue to monitor institutional market recovery, the given health of state budget surpluses and potential impacts of energy sector slowdown on construction markets; it's too early to call more than a moderate recovery for the year.","Overall, inorganic revenue headwind in the Americas is unchanged, has a slight increase from the Zero acquisition offset to an increase in Canadian currency headwind. The most notable change in the EMEA region -- is the EMEA region, although organic projections remain unchanged, currency movements have created another six points of headwind.","Inclusive of the revenue update, we are affirming our full-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.75 and reported EPS of $2.61 to $2.71, which incorporates the first quarter Venezuela devaluation impact of $0.04 per share. We continue to project full-year margin growth in all regions, with incremental operating leverage being used to support growth investments.","Please go to Slide 14. Let me finish by reiterating that I was pleased with the first quarter results. We delivered organic revenue growth of 5.9%, held adjusted margins relatively flat while absorbing investments in currency pressure and grew EPS by nearly 16%.","We are executing on our margin improvement efforts in Europe and continue to deliver a flexible and balanced capital allocation plan with both share repurchases and acquisitions announced in the quarter. And finally, we remain on track to deliver our original EPS guidance.","Now Patrick and I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Robert Berry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Robert Berry","Hey guys, good morning.","Dave Petratis","Good morning, Rob.","Patrick Shannon","Good morning.","Robert Berry","Nice quarter. Congrats.","Dave Petratis","Thank you.","Robert Berry","David I wanted to just follow-up on your comments on the revised outlook for the Americas segment. I can certainly understand wanting to have some caution, but given the quarter you just put up I think to get to the midpoint of your revised organic growth range implies a pretty material slowdown in the volume for the next few quarters. So are you seeing evidence of some of those headwinds that you flagged as reasons for caution or just how are you thinking about the evolution of the core growth for the rest of the year in Americas? Thanks.","Dave Petratis","So we are net positive as reflected in my comments on core growth. We see modest recovery in the institutional and commercial. We are cautioned by the weak GDP growth. We are mindful that recovery in our mind is capped by the available investment dollars, especially in institutional and capped by the amount of labor. So as we talked and evaluated on the year, we like to see another quarter and make any adjustments or save with our current guidance at that point.","Patrick Shannon","Hey Robert, I'll just also add in the first quarter the comparisons were a little bit easier. You may recall last year of Q1 with the weather impact was a little bit softer. And so the 7.7% growth in Americas reflects a stronger year-over-year comparison, but also keep in mind seriously going forward we have pretty good growth last year Q3, Q4 around 5% in Americas. So the comparisons get a little bit more difficult. But as Dave indicated, a little caution here like the start to the year getting really good traction on our investments, particularly, in the channel lead business, discretionary market as well as some of the NPD initiatives. So feel good about that.","Robert Berry","Okay. Fair enough. I will get back in the queue. Thanks.","Dave Petratis","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from -- I'm sorry, next question or comment comes from the line of Timothy Wojs from RW. Baird. Your line is open.","Timothy Wojs","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Dave Petratis","Hi, Tim.","Patrick Shannon","Good morning, Tim.","Timothy Wojs","I guess, just -- the question for me is just on Americas on pricing. I think in the 10Q pricing was up a little bit on the top line, but it didn\u2019t cover inflation. So, I\u2019m just curious, is that due to timing just because wages went up a little bit more in the first? How should we think of the pricing and inflation dynamic this year? And then maybe just a little color on how you guys think about raw material inflation as we progress?","Patrick Shannon","Yes, so on the pricing front as we had indicated last call, we\u2019re still anticipating little under 1% on pricing. Now you didn\u2019t see that full benefit in the quarter accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year, but getting pretty good traction on the non-residential products. It\u2019s the residential side that we commented was a little softer than anticipated and some of that is just moving out older product to make room for the high demand of our new electronic products, so a little pressure from that. Relative to your inflation question you\u2019re exactly right, I mean in the commodity area, steel, brass, copper, zinc, all the things inputs are going to our products, seen a decline year-over-year. We\u2019re not yet seeing the full impact of that, because as part of our policy we lock into suppler hedge contracts and so, we look out 12 months and we kind of hedge some of that. So, you\u2019d see some more that in the back half of the year. But potentially it\u2019s some upside if the prices stay where they are today.","Timothy Wojs","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Patrick Shannon","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Jeff Kessler","Thank you. See I made it in this time. Thank you. Can you get a little more granular on the investments that you\u2019re making particularly in the Americas with regard to both building up the channel, and your channel investments as to which way that is going as well as a traction or any new product introductions that you\u2019re coming out within the -- in the spear of the NPD technology area, and if that is going to be addition additive to revenues or will there be some cannibalization this year?","Dave Petratis","Yes, so you may recall just from a -- just to recalibrate everyone we did reflect our Analyst Day incremental investments year-over-year full year basis, $0.15 to $0.20 and you saw $0.06 headwind in Q1 relative to the prior year period. The majority of that is Americas related probably two third, the remaining one third would be tied to our corporate, what we call infrastructure investments tied back to our M&A building capability, taxes, systems, those type of things. As it relates specific to Americas, I\u2019d say two thirds probably NPD related on both residential and non-residential products. One third being channel, related to this discretionary market which we think is a huge upside for us in the future. If you relate that relative to the benefits we\u2019re seeing, I would say in the organic revenue growth for Americas which was close to 8% for the quarter, you\u2019re probably getting one to two points tied back to those specific initiatives. So, I think pretty good traction really on that should hopefully accelerate. We like what we\u2019re seeing in the market place. So, on a full year basis I would see that maybe improving a little bit, but getting good I\u2019d say return from those investments.","Patrick Shannon","I would add from a new product standpoint we will continue to rollout products that complement our ENGAGE technology and that communication interface, connected interface complements our strong mechanical base and then announced rollouts August, September in the residential space along connectivity.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open.","Grace Lee","Hi, this is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. We have two questions. One is, it\u2019s nice to see some acquisitions in Asia. Can you give us an update on acquisition pipeline there, and also we\u2019re wondering how this ongoing acquisition would impact the margin improvement initiatives in the region? The second question is about, 1% to 2% organic growth you just mentioned which is tied to the channel initiative. I\u2019m just wondering whether that\u2019s to do with the initiative of growing the U.S. repair and retrofit initiative.","Dave Petratis","So, after quarterly review we took time to access our success on the acquisition pipeline. I\u2019d remind you that when we created the company we\u2019re dormant, more active globally and pleased with the progress and investments that we\u2019re driving. The Brio acquisition is from the Asia Pacific region we see great opportunities to leverage that hardware capability globally in warm weather climates that use accordion style doors. We see the pipeline opportunities in Asia continue to build as we develop the relationships in that are important to be successful in building the successful acquisition plan. So, very pleased with that progress. Second.","Patrick Shannon","So, relative to your question on the margin, so the acquisition of Brio would lift the margin in that region. It hasn\u2019t closed yet. We do anticipate it\u2019s a close in Q2. So you\u2019d start seeing some of that improvement hopefully in the back half of the year. I mean there is integration cost and step up of inventory. It has a little pressure this year, so not a significant impact. But clearly in 2016, it operates at a much higher margin, so it would weigh favorably to the overall Asia Pacific results. And last one, the one to two points in the channel and new product, channel initiatives included in that.","Dave Petratis","So two observations on channel development. Our highest priority is in the Americas, specifically the U.S. We see opportunities to be -- to grow organically in the light commercial R&R space. We saw traction in that in Q1, and it benefited us. But as we sharpen our channel strategies we\u2019re leveraging that learning into the Asia Pacific region in Europe. We think there is good opportunity to bring good channel management techniques to the company that will unleash growth opportunities in the regions we operate.","Grace Lee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning guys.","Dave Petratis","Hi, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","I guess I have a question on Americas margins, but maybe to help frame it up.","Dave Petratis","Josh, get closer to the phone.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Sorry. Can you hear me now?","Dave Petratis","Louder, clearly, but go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski","All right. Will try that.","Dave Petratis","Perfect.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just before we -- I had a question on Americas margins, but I guess that maybe to help frame, you guys gave the mix between more the retrofit versus institutional on the non-resi side in the quarter?","Dave Petratis","So, not a big impact on the mix associated with that incremental volume for the quarter.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Okay. So just based on some of the investment spend, it looks like you guys converted the revenue growth, call it about 45% in 1Q, 45% incrementals if you back out in investment. It doesn\u2019t sound like you got a lot of price in the quarter clearly seasonally not a lot of volume through the business. Is there something else that\u2019s helping drive the incrementals or should we think of this as where we\u2019re functionally at based on where the mix of the business is today?","Dave Petratis","So, I want to make sure I understand your question. You\u2019re questioning the incremental leverage at 45% whether that\u2019s sustainable going forward?","Josh Pokrzywinski","Right, because it looks like mix could actually get better from here. It doesn\u2019t look like there was anything too crazy and then, price was pretty anemic. So presumably there is some room for expansion there as well.","Dave Petratis","Right. So, as reflected, the 45% see through pretty good leverage there. I would expect that to continue. As we indicated should see more favorable pricing going forward. We do have the incremental investments that will continue to be a headwind. Comparisons get easier in the back half of the year. We are still forecasting Americas margins improvement for the full year. So, as the investment headwind kind of comes down, then you see margin improvement. The other thing, if you\u2019re looking at it just from a margin perspective, don\u2019t forget Venezuela is weighing, I wouldn\u2019t say heavily but it weighing on the mix relative to the margin and even with that headwind we\u2019re seeing margin improvements. So if you look at ex-Venezuela there is pretty good margin improvement maybe 100 basis points or so.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Terrific. All right. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Dave Petratis","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Peter Lennox-King","This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Could you talk a little bit about how momentum progressed through Q1 on the sales through in these regions and then I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but maybe if you could just give an indication on how that momentum progressed into and through April what you\u2019re seeing so far?","Dave Petratis","So I\u2019d classify momentum in the resi space. We saw good traction in growth and what we call work probuild [ph] which supports new construction. We saw some softness in the repair and replacement on the resi side and weather impacts that. I think the South West United States in the resi market continues to be high, predictably from the weather standpoint in North East which is a good market for us with frozen. On the commercial institutional side, I would describe a generally good lift in all markets. As you think about the institutional builds, a lot of that traction gets moving in Q1 for summer activities especially in schools, universities that type of thing, and then you\u2019ve got your normal project load. We see a step up there in resi reflected in our optimism. Hospitals under pressure, again a step up in the institutional and we\u2019re seeing traction in our development of the channel expansion that we want to influence in the commercial R&R. And that\u2019s probably stronger in some targeted markets. And as we roll out that full program, expect similar results.","Peter Lennox-King","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Charles Clarke from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Charles Clarke","Hi, guys.","Dave Petratis","Charlie.","Charles Clarke","I just had a quick question probably can't make specific comments on it, but just a headline this morning that the merger between Kaba and Dorma or at least the announcement. Just didn\u2019t know if how that maybe changes the industry or how that changes your M&A outlook or, just anything that you could kind of talk about with respect to that?","Dave Petratis","So we certainly caught that this morning, analyzing it. We\u2019ve got great respect for Kaba and Dorma, we\u2019ve known then over the years. It\u2019s I think a strong reflection of a consolidating industry. It remains heavily fragmented as we\u2019ve talked about in our analyst presentations. And the strength of that merger is really outside of the United States and it\u2019s a clear indicator that as we think about capital deployment, if there is good assets to bring into our portfolio we\u2019re interested and we continue to work on it, so more to come on that as we evaluate the news in the morning.","Patrick Shannon","And I would just add Charlie, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy. We\u2019ll continue to execute and you saw good traction in Q1. We have a lot of organic growth opportunities particularly in Americas. We\u2019re continuing to get good improvement in European margins, all that doesn\u2019t change and we\u2019re going to continue to drive shareholder value through our organic growth initiatives, things we can control and as Dave said, continue to be aggressive on the capital allocation plan.","Charles Clarke","Okay, thanks. Just a quick one just on growth, for the quarter, I mean 7% Americas is a big number, so its low single digits residential, high single digits non-residential. Has institutional -- is institutional growing institutional specifically, was that up in the quarter?","Dave Petratis","Positive indicators, I would classify it as low to mid single digits. We\u2019re going to do well in any kind of recovery in that space. But again, capped by labor the ability to install it and I think our bigger opportunities is pursuing our channel base strategies that gets us a bigger share of the existing market. As I said, in any type of recovery we\u2019ll do extremely well in the Americas.","Charles Clarke","Thanks a lot, guys.","Dave Petratis","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Robert Berry from Susquehanna. You line is open.","Robert Berry","Thanks for taking the follow-up. Actually we did want to follow-up on the pricing comment earlier. I think some of the benefit you saw in commercial was being offset by the resi as you mentioned. Is that temporary, it sounded like it might be temporary if you\u2019re clearing out inventory and how much did that weigh on kind of the net pricing in the quarter?","Dave Petratis","Yes, so I would say it\u2019s temporary through perhaps this quarter, might see some softness as well as those programs continue. How much did it weigh, maybe 30 basis points or so.","Patrick Shannon","From a business perspective, driving your style and design which means some inventory switch out and we\u2019ve got new products entering the market from resi electronic standpoint which we think is good opportunity for us as that market converges.","Robert Berry","Right. So, I guess that yes, so that that 30 BIP should elevate as a headwind?","Dave Petratis","Correct.","Patrick Shannon","And let me just add something here too, maybe as a point of clarification. When we look at pricing impact its similar products year-over-year, when we\u2019re up selling so with our replacement of the new electronic products, as we talked about before it comes at a higher price point which adds revenue dollars, that\u2019s not captured in the year-over-year price improvement. So that would be captured in volume. And so the replacement does have a positive impact in terms of higher price point and as well as because the margins are similar higher OI dollars.","Robert Berry","Okay, perfect. And if I could also just quickly follow-up on the remaining investment spending, $0.15 to $0.20, $0.06 in the quarter, the remaining call it $0.09 to $0.14. Is that going to be evenly spread over the remaining three quarters or is that weighted in some way to second quarter?","Dave Petratis","Its\u2019 more heavily weighed Q2, Q3; Q4 falls off significantly. So there is minimal impact in Q4.","Robert Berry","Great. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Shannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is a follow-up from Mr. Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Jeff Kessler","Thank you for taking the follow-up. You\u2019ve talked about taking your Venezuelan exchange rates to the official SIMADI rate. You obviously are aware that the black market rate or the street rate is, remains quite different than what anything the government has been able to say for the last -- actually this is consistent for the last two years. But this time we know the vision is that disparity is getting pretty big. What do you do to monitor that and how are you -- how can you manage against that, the fact that we have got something like, I\u2019d say its more like 170 to 1 at this point as opposed to 50 or 60 to 1?","Dave Petratis","I believe our current thinking of the business we\u2019re up in almost 200 to 1, 192. I think second if you look at what's left on the balance sheet, there\u2019s not a lot of risk there, and we\u2019re reflecting on our long-term position in Venezuela in considering our option.","Jeff Kessler","Okay.","Patrick Shannon","Jeff, even to add a little more clarity, I think any political solution in Venezuela is going to take years. And the amount of time we spend at that just trying to explain it is a distraction with the overall impact it has on the business.","Jeff Kessler","Yes, I mean I\u2019m just trying to -- I\u2019m just trying to dispose of this as something that you have to think about every quarter, it may -- that becomes less and less meaningful but you still -- its still like there\u2019s bug in the back of your head.","Dave Petratis","Yes.","Jeff Kessler","All right. Thank you very much.","Dave Petratis","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Dave Petratis","Hi, Jeff.","Brett Linzey","Stepping in for, Jeff. Hey this is, Brett. Hey, I just wanted to come back on the investment spending. It sounds like you guys are getting a pretty quick payback there on the new products in some of the refresh. Should we think of 2015 as really kind of a one time refresh across the portfolio? And how should that play out as we think about the model into 2016? I mean, has it become kind of a permanent fixture of the cost space or did some of that go away?","Dave Petratis","Yes, so as we talked about during the Analyst Day, you need to think about the incremental investments for both 2014, 2015 being a step up in the cost space, i.e. things like NPD, a lot of engineering spend associated with that will stay in the cost. However looking forward into 2016 beyond those level of incremental investments comes down. I think there would still be some as we continue to find growth alternatives organically. And then you may recall with the payback and the returns on those investments EBITDA margin growth starts to out pay significantly the incremental investment spend. And so, look at it as an increase in the cost space, but the level of year-over-year incremental spend coming down beginning in 2016.","Brett Linzey","Okay, great. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all I had.","Dave Petratis","Yes.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no additional questions in the queue at this time.

Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Wagnes, Vice President, Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the Allegion fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion.","Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning; and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call, are available on our website at allegion.com. This will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to Slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Please go to Slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring, impairment, acquisition and divestiture expenses and charges in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results and provide 2017 guidance, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to Slide number 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion posted another strong quarter of operational results and closed out a very strong year. The high level of execution and performance is driven by one of the most engaged and safest workforce in the security industry.","For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $569.7 million, growing 5.2% on an organic basis. Total revenue increased 4.4% over prior year, reflecting the impact of divestitures and foreign currency partially offsetting the organic growth. Our strong organic growth was led by the Americas, which grew 7% in the quarter, as both non-residential and residential business expanded nicely. EMEIA organic revenues grew at 1.4%, and our Asia-Pacific business saw organic revenue decline by 0.7%.","Adjusted operating income of $102 million decreased 1.4% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin declined by 110 basis points. These declines were driven by a $15 million environmental remediation charge taken in the fourth quarter, which reduced the adjusted operating margin by 260 basis points.","The operating performance, excluding the environmental charge, reflect continued price realization and solid leverage on an incremental volume, which more than offset the 70 basis points headwinds from incremental investments. Europe and Asia-Pacific saw significant improvement in adjusted operating margin. The environmental remediation charge did cause the Americas' overall operating margin to decline.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.81 decreased $0.08 or 9% versus the prior year. This includes the environmental remediation charge, which had a $0.10 per share impact. Overall, I am pleased with the strong revenue growth and solid operational performance in the fourth quarter.","I'd like to briefly talk about the environmental remediation charge taken in the quarter. At Allegion, we help keep people safe and secure where they live and work, while safeguarding our environment at the same time.","In the fourth quarter of 2016, with the collaboration and approval of state regulators, we launched a proactive alternative approach to remediate two sites in the United States. This approach will allow us to be more aggressive in addressing the environmental conditions at these sites and reduce the impact of potential changes in regulatory requirements. As a result, we recorded a $15 million charge from environmental remediation in the fourth quarter.","We value the importance of a cleaner world. We are committed to being a responsible member of our global communities, and the actions we are taking at these sites benefit both Allegion and the environment.","Please go to Slide 5. Now, I'd like to talk about Allegion's accomplishments in 2016. We continue to have an exceptional occupational safety record and continue to be a safety leader in the industry. We delivered high organic growth, led by our Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. We've executed our channel-led business strategy and continued to focus on innovation, helping to drive organic growth and increase our vitality index.","In addition, we've seen continued strong operating leverage and expansion of adjusted operating margins in all of our regions. We delivered a 10.2% increase in full year adjusted earnings per share and had a record year from cash flow, as our available cash flow increased to $335 million, an increase of $112.8 million or 50.8% over last year.","Please go to Slide 6. In 2016, our pioneering brand launched a range of new products across the globe in a variety of markets and verticals. On this slide, you can see a sampling of those newest electronic and mechanical innovations. In the Americas, we launched Schlage Control Smart Interconnected Locks for the multi-family market, allowing cloud-based mobile app control for property managers and phone credential capabilities for residents.","Late in the year, we introduced the Everest 29 SL cylinder by Schlage, which allows commercial buildings on multiple key systems to be brought into one unified restricted key system without replacing current door hardware.","In Europe, the Briton 571 EL is a new commercial exit device that integrates with electronic access control systems, meaning, it offers both panic exit functionality and can be monitored remotely. In fact, it can be paired with the SimonsVoss MobileKey, our new app-based access control solution for medium to large buildings that can control up to 20 doors and assign access to 100 users at a time.","In the Asia-Pacific, Milre added five new electronic locks like the MI-480s that draws on the latest residential market design trends to offer homeowners a sleek rim lock with keyless entry via a smartcard or passcode opening.","As a result of our focus on innovation and investing in new product development, we have been able to increase our vitality index, which was single digits in 2014 to high teens in 2016 with a goal of approximately 25% in 2018. As a result, this will continue to drive organic growth and help leverage our connected platforms across the region.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results, and I'll be back to update you on our full year 2017 guidance.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. Please go to Slide number 7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 5.2% and 5.8% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively.","The strong organic growth reflects improved markets, the introduction of new products and the company's channel initiatives. Pricing was favorable in the quarter in all regions, as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impacts of rising commodity prices. Foreign currency was a headwind in the quarter, particularly in the EMEIA region.","During the quarter, divestitures were a slight headwind, which offset the impact of acquisitions. For the year, all three regions were favorable on price and saw headwinds from foreign currencies. Acquisitions more than offset the impact of divestitures.","Please go to slide number eight. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $569.7 million. This reflects an increase of 4.4% versus the prior year, up 5.2% on an organic basis. I was particularly pleased with the outstanding organic revenue growth from Americas, which had strong growth in both the non-residential and residential businesses off a tough comparison from the prior year.","We continue to make significant progress with our new product introductions and channel strategies. We had improved pricing in the quarter, offsetting the currency headwinds seen in EMEIA. In the fourth quarter, we lapped the large acquisitions completed during 2015. As such, during the quarter, the incremental contribution from acquisitions was offset by the impact of the divestiture of the system integration business in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Adjusted operating income of $102 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.9% declined 1.4% and 110 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Included in these numbers is the environmental remediation charge of $15 million, which had a 260 basis point impact on the adjusted operating margin in the quarter.","Excluding the environmental charge, the underlying operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage and continued progress on our EMEIA margin transformation. During the quarter, price and productivity more than offset the impacts of inflation and incremental investments.","Our EBITDA margin of 20.5% was a 110 basis point decline versus the prior year but, similar to adjusted operating margin mentioned earlier, includes the 260 basis point impact of the environmental remediation charge. Excluding the charge, all regions improved during the quarter. The business continues to execute at a high level, demonstrating both strong organic growth and operational margin improvement, while continuing to make investments for future profitable growth.","Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter 2015, reported EPS was $0.74. Adjusting $0.15 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration costs, related acquisitions and divestitures, the 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.89. Operational results increased EPS by $0.16, as favorable price, operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. As noted previously, the environmental remediation charge drove a $0.10 reduction.","Next, interest and other income were a net $0.07 reduction. This was driven primarily by the positive impact from the sale of non-strategic marketable securities during the fourth quarter of 2015 that did not repeat in Q4 of 2016. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate drove $0.03 per share reduction versus the prior year. The increase in rate is primarily due to unfavorable changes in the mix of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and reductions in certain countries' statutory tax rates.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2016 was lower than anticipated due to favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions and changes in certain countries' statutory tax rates.","Incremental investments related to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies were a $0.03 reduction. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, subtracted $0.01 in the quarter. This results in adjusted fourth quarter 2016 EPS of $0.81 per share.","Continuing on, we have a negative $0.04 per share reduction for acquisition and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at fourth quarter 2016 reported EPS of $0.77.","Please go to slide number 10. Fourth quarter revenues for the Americas region were $410 million, up 7% on both a reported and organic basis. Strong organic growth reflects above-market performance, driven by our new products and channel initiatives. As noted on the chart, we experienced solid, high-single digit growth in the non-residential products driven by strength in our premium brands and mid-single digit growth in residential products, with solid performance in both our retail and builder channels.","Revenue growth was strong across most product categories with continued momentum in electronics. Americas' adjusted operating income of $96.7 million declined slightly versus the prior-year period as a result of the $15 million environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier.","Excluding the charge, operationally, Americas' adjusted operating income increased due to incremental volume leverage, favorable mix and positive impact from foreign currency. Overall, price and productivity offset inflation and incremental investments. Pricing realization improved sequentially in the quarter with good performance in both commercial and residential markets.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 260 basis points, driven by the 370 basis point impact from the environmental charge. The operational increase, while absorbing the incremental investment spend, demonstrates excellent performance by the entire Americas team.","Please go to slide number 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $129.4 million, up 0.2%, or up 1.4% on an organic basis. The reported revenue growth was driven by the impact of the organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by currency headwinds. In particular, the portable security and SimonsVoss businesses saw solid growth. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $19.9 million increased 13.1% versus the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points, reflecting continued improvements in the ongoing business transformation, more than offsetting currency headwinds.","Although it isn't reflected on the slide, the full year adjusted operating margin for EMEIA was 9.3%. At the time of the spin-off, adjusted operating margin for this business was approximately 1%. This is a significant improvement in operational results driven by an extremely dedicated EMEIA team.","Please go to Slide number 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $30.3 million, down 8.5% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 0.7% and was impacted by the timing of orders and large non-recurring projects in 2015. Total revenue declines are attributable to the divestiture of the system integration business in 2015.","Our Australia and New Zealand markets continued to be strong along with Southeast Asia. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income of $2.3 million was up 4.5%. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was up 100 basis points, reflecting favorability in price and productivity along with the impacts of divesting the system integration business.","Please go to Slide number 13. Available cash flow for 2016 was $335 million, an increase of $112.8 million or 50.8% compared to the prior-year period. The increase in year-over-year available cash flow is primarily attributable to higher net earnings.","Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by planned increases in inventory levels in certain areas to improve customer fulfillment requirements.","As discussed later in the presentation, we made a $50 million discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension plan in January 2017. This contribution significantly improved the plan's funded status, while also reducing future cash payments to the plan and reducing anticipated increases in pension expense for future years. This outflow is included in the guidance of available cash flow for 2017.","Please go to Slide number 14. Since the spin, we stated our capital allocation strategy is one that defines a balanced and flexible approach, which remains a primary focus today. We ended the year with a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.9 times, in the middle of our targeted range of 2.75 times to 3.25 times. If you recall, we ended 2015 with a 3.5 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA. This reduction reflects growth in EBITDA during the year, as well as mandatory principal payments made on our secured credit facility.","Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ended the year at 2.3 times. As Dave will discuss later in the guidance, we continue to see opportunity to fund incremental investments for channel strategies, new product development and demand creation to accelerate core market expansion.","Supported by our 2016 performance, we believe these investments will enable the company to continue to grow at an accelerated pace and faster than the broader market as well as provide superior returns on invested capital. We also remain focused on growing our portfolio through acquisitions. We plan to keep our flexibility and our balance sheet optionality available for potential M&A opportunities.","While we did not close as many transactions during 2016 as we did in 2015, the M&A pipeline remains active, as evidenced by the recent announcement of our acquisition of Republic Doors.","And lastly, we have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends that reflects strength and confidence in our cash flow. In addition, we will continue to repurchase shares to offset dilution and to be opportunistic when appropriate.","Last week, we announced a 33% increase in our quarterly dividend and also announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we repurchased 850,000 shares for approximately $55 million under our previous share repurchase authorization.","In summary, we have many options to deploy capital for the benefit of our shareholders. This is driven by our ability to generate consistent, high cash flow.","I will now hand it back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2017 guidance.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide 15. We expect continued growth in our primary markets in 2017. And it's our expectations that the organic growth investments, combined with our ability to execute, will deliver better than market growth.","In addition, we believe the mechanical to electromechanical convergence will help stimulate the growth of our business, as we are well positioned to take advantage of this industry trend. In the Americas, we see positive indicators in key verticals within the non-residential and residential businesses.","On the institutional markets, we continue to expect solid growth. Safe school initiatives and the need for school security upgrades is evident when you review state legislative priorities. The outlook for healthcare is also positive, especially in the special care senior living care facilities. We expect growth in the commercial markets, as our channel initiatives gain traction and end markets continue to cooperate.","Overall, we anticipate mid-single digit organic growth for the non-residential segment. We expect the U.S. residential markets will increase mid-single digits, driven by both builder and retail segments in 2017. Single-family home construction will continue to be strong, although there will be some variance in this segment driven by labor and land availability. The multi-family segment will continue to remain solid, but we expect a deceleration in the rate of growth as compared to the last few years.","Consolidating the market outlooks, we project organic revenue growth in the Americas of 6% to 7% and reported revenue growth of 7% to 8%, reflecting the recent acquisition of Republic Doors. For the EMEIA region, we anticipate flat to low-single digit market growth overall. Confidence in investments throughout Europe are being affected by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Brexit. As such, we expect the UK construction market to be lower in 2017.","We expect continued growth in Germany. For the region, we project organic growth of 1% to 3%. When we combine the impact of currency, we project reported revenue of negative 1% to positive 1% for the year.","The Asia-Pacific market continues to show mid-single digit growth in residential and non-residential segments. We expect to drive above-market growth, as we focus our effort on key vertical markets where we are strong. Organic growth in the region is estimated to be 10% to 12%, and total revenue growth is estimated to be 7% to 9%, which reflects currency impact.","All in, we are projecting total growth and organic growth both at 5.5% to 6.5%. We anticipate improved price realization across all regions to help mitigate inflationary pressures in 2017.","Please go to Slide 16. Our 2017 adjusted earnings per share range is $3.55 to $3.70, an increase of 6.3% to 10.8%. The earnings increase is primarily driven by revenue growth and operational improvements, partially offset by investments in the business, currency headwinds, other income and a higher effective tax rate assumed to be between 19% and 20% for the year. We also have a net $0.02 drag associated with the 2016 impact of the sale of marketable securities, net of the environmental remediation charge mentioned earlier.","We are not expected to recur this year. We are forecasting strong organic growth and margin expansion in all reported regions. Incremental investments will be focused on new products and channel development, which we believe enables us to deliver above-market growth.","Our guidance assume outstanding diluted shares of approximately 96 million, which reflects the company's goal to at least offset share dilution with repurchases. The guidance does not include any impacts from restructuring and acquisition expenses during the year. As a result, reported EPS is also $3.55 to $3.70. We are also projecting our available cash flow for 2017 to be in the $300 million to $320 million range, inclusive of a $50 million voluntary pension funding that Patrick mentioned earlier.","Please go to Slide 17. We are very pleased with our 2016 results that delivered organic revenue growth of 5.8% and increased our operating margin by 40 basis points, net of the 70 basis point impact of the environmental remediation charge taken in the fourth quarter. The growth of both revenue and margin, while making investments in our business, demonstrates our disciplined approach to our business.","We are recognizing solid growth from our organic investments and continuing to make progress on our vitality index, while we continue to generate robust cash flows. We've made tremendous progress improving our European profitability from slightly positive three years ago to almost 10% today. It's a truly great accomplishment by the entire team to achieve these results in Europe.","As we look to 2017, we look to build on the momentum of our prior results. We look to generate strong organic revenue, drive a solid increase in adjusted earnings per share and look to generate substantial available cash flow even after a discretionary pension funding payment.","We have a safe and strong team in place committed to our vision to make the world safer, securing the places where people thrive.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just to maybe follow up on some of your comments you made, Dave, on the pricing environment and how we should think about that kind of 4Q into 2017. Presumably, this higher organic growth than you would typically start the year with includes a good amount of price. Could you maybe remind us, I guess, Patrick, how that looked in the fourth quarter?","I know you mentioned on the third quarter call that there would be a bit of a price-cost drag because you couldn't get all the increases out there right away as fast as materials were going up. And how we should think about that in 2017? So, I know a lot of questions there. But basically, kind of, follow the narrative for me on price and costs 4Q into 2017, if you could.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So, as you mentioned, Q4 pricing was favorable. If you kind of look at it, relative to the prior quarter, it sequentially improved. We did go out with a price increase at the beginning of the quarter, and our commercial segment of the business saw really good traction there. I think it demonstrates that we've continued to grow in our discipline and focus in this area.","Saw good improvement in the residential business as well, which was really positive. We believe that momentum will continue into 2017. And so, the price-cost equation, as we look into kind of the full year basis of where commodity prices trade today, most of the price should offset the commodity headwind. It is a significant, kind of, change if you look at the cost side of the equation. Commodity prices, like steel for example, is up 40%, 50% over the average rate for 2016. So, we are anticipating more price movement in 2017 to offset the increase in the commodity costs.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","But of that 6% to 7% that you have in Americas' organic, how much of that is price? And if I were to look back in the way you start off most years, how would you have thought about that historically?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, in Q4, it was about 150 basis points improvement year-over-year. As we look in kind of the full year, 2016 I think across the globe was about 1% price improvement, which is fairly consistent over the prior couple of years.","2017 will be north of that. You're probably looking at 1% to 1.5% improvement. So, the rest of the organic growth would be volume related and we would characterize that as growing at market plus. We would expect, given our channel initiatives, new product development, the traction we've gained, some of the new initiatives, new products coming out for 2017, that we would grow above market of, say, 1% to 2% is our expectation. And that's why you're seeing a fairly robust anticipation of revenue growth for 2017, as well as strong markets.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Terrific. Thanks for the call. I'll get back in queue.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question. As I look at the outlook for 2017, I would argue that probably top line is quite a bit stronger than a lot of us have been thinking and probably a lot of outgrowth there. But at the same time, you do have these incremental investments. And the question I have in regards to investments, how should we think about them because they are eating into what should be very strong operating leverage? Is this remediating underinvestment under your prior corporate ownership? Or are we sort of banking outgrowth? I know that it's a fine line between the two, but just if you could expound on that a little bit.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, Andrew, I would think of it like this. As a market leader, particularly, in the U.S., we see opportunities to segment the market and invest for growth. We've talked about this as part of our channel initiatives that I think has delivered above-market growth today. We continue to see opportunities to segment that market, but it takes people, number one.","Number two, we believe very strongly in this electromechanical convergence. Again, it takes investment in product development engineering, which is fueling our vitality index which we think gives good returns. So, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on those investments that will give us above-market growth as we go forward.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, we should get \u2013 we should also get continued improved return on invested capital going forward from these initiatives as well, right?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think that's what we've proven. It's important that we're accountable, and we see that opportunity globally. I think Asia-Pacific would be a good example in our segmentation and adjustments there. More work to do in Europe to fuel that growth. And again, it's people driving specification with great products.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. I would just add, too, Andrew, if you kind of look at these in terms of capital deployment alternatives, you have to look at it over a longer time horizon. And these, historically, over the last couple of years, have provided an outstanding return on invested capital. And so, we kind of \u2013 we look at the opportunities. As Dave said, we're a learning organization, as we look at opportunities to expand our market segmentation, and areas where we're underserved today just provides really good growth opportunities. And we're going to manage the equation so that the incremental investments, we can make those, still grow the top line and expand our margins in the region where we make the investments.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions here on \u2013 as it relates to M&A so cash balance building, I know you outlined your gross debt to EBITDA and where you are versus targets, but it's been a little while since some deals have been done. Dave, how should we think about what's going on in the market? And is this a valuation issue? It doesn't seem like it's an opportunity issue in terms of number of opportunities. But what's kind of holding back in terms of the execution?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think we haven't revealed those deals we didn't do, which I think were disciplined capital allocation decisions. The pipeline in my mind is fruitful. We continue to work it extremely hard. We think the industry consolidates. We did just knock off a small deal with Republic Doors, which we think advances the Americas. And this is kind of the nature of M&A. It had ebbs and flows, and we think there's plenty of opportunity as we move through the year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, we shouldn't read too much into the higher cash balance in normal, there's nothing pending here that is pretty significant necessarily.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I will just smile and look at our ability to generate the cash that we did in this company in 2016. It's important to us, and we're going to deploy it in a flexible manner.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just a real quick follow-up just on \u2013 this relates to near-term stuff. So, Patrick, on Q1, last year, the ERP implementation, that hurt sales and you had the rebound in Q2. How should we think about \u2013 I know you don't give quarterly guidance. But how should we think about modeling this on a year-over-year basis and the puts and takes for Q1?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. From a seasonal perspective, I think you probably have to look at \u2013 go back to 2015 and look at kind of the split there from top line perspective. It may be back into, kind of, the first half of 2016 and assume kind of revenue growth and margin expansion in both quarters year-over-year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","But you're right, the comparisons were easier in Q1 just because of the blip we had last year.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","On an annualized basis, our team went through a very challenging ERP implementation in Indy Ops and grew that business nicely year-over-year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, all right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice job on the growth.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Tim. Good to hear from you.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I guess, just \u2013 I'll ask a border adjustability question. If you guys could just talk a little bit about how we should think about some of the tax policies that have been put forth out there. And then, just internally what type of exposure you might have to Mexican manufacturing and then how that relates to the industry. And then, any sort of contingencies that you guys might be thinking about?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, any changes along the border that could affect imports into the countries, I think you got to think about it in multiple dimensions. Number one, our greatest exposure is to our resi business. And as we think about the resi, we're in the boat with all competitors and \u2013 however, that \u2013 tide rises. We think any tariffs would be passed along. Nobody is going to be able to change overnight. So, that's our biggest exposure.","On the commercial institutional, you know that, here in the U.S., we've got a very strong U.S.-based manufacturing base that leads to industry profitability. So, we think we navigate through that okay.","Third, I think this industry has good pricing disciplines. We do import component parts along with others. Again, we think we could pass that along. So, in a world of uncertainty, we have I think a lot of flexibility. And I'd emphasize, as you have been through our factories, our manufacturing excellence has a lot of ability to flex and move where we needed to be. I think we're probably at a better state of readiness than anybody in the industry to be able to adapt to change.","Timothy Ronald Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Well, good luck on 2017.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. Guys, good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Can you hear me?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yeah.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. So, I guess, I just wanted to clarify on whether you expect the Americas' margin to be up in 2017 kind of materially so, especially if you exclude the charge in 2016. It sounds like price, you think, will just kind of offset cost. Investment spending looks like it will be up a fair amount, but you'll have good volume leverage. But the net of all that seems to me, roughly, I don't know, flattish or only modest margin expansion. So, how are you thinking about that?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, we'll continue to see margin expansion. The pricing is going to be stronger. As you said, that should offset a lot of the commodity cost increase. We continue to get outstanding volume leverage on the incremental volume. And so, that should continue to move forward. Productivity improvements will continue to drive margin performance as well.","So, the margin expectation is, we'll manage the incremental investments to ensure that we get top line growth. So, we're still getting margin accretion in Americas and that should be fairly steady throughout the course of the year.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you. Just a quick follow-up, a housekeeping item. Did you mention what the electronics growth was in the quarter or could you?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, we didn't mention it in the quarter. Well, for the full year, kind of, low-double digits growth. Q4 was kind of similar type of range. It continues to grow faster than the traditional mechanical business. A good trend for us. As you know, electronic products sell at a higher average selling price, similar margin, more EBIT dollars, cash flow. So, good trend, and that's something we're investing in to take advantage of that electromechanical convergence.","Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David McGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Brandon Roll\u00e9 - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. This is Brandon Roll\u00e9 on for David McGregor. I was hoping that you could give some color on the non-residential segment and what you're seeing in specified institutional markets versus commercial distributor businesses and how growth compared for each? And to follow up on that, how do you expect these growth patterns to extend into the first half of 2017? Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, we're net positive on what we would describe as total institutional growth as we move into 2017. I think the overall environment that we'll leave in 2016 was positive. I think we called that a year ago. We work hard to understand the drivers. But we would see total education stronger in 2017 than it was in 2016. We'd see healthcare stronger in 2017 than it was in 2016.","Some changings in terms of hospitals. The hospital model is changing. We know we don't see as many big institutions, but we see a lot of more walk-in cares, imaging cares that fall right into our wheelhouse. So, we like this institutional space. I think, if you also dive into bond issues that were improved in the fourth quarter of 2016, it was net positive. There's a need for infrastructure, school security. We like our position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick one on growth spend, and I apologize if you went through this. I've been bouncing back and forth here a little bit. But obviously, it's paying off with the organic growth. But just give us a sense of really what you're targeting in 2017 and what the trajectory of growth spend might be going forward. Should we expect it to continue to incrementally ratchet up meaningfully, or do we kind of settle down into a pattern where it's kind of growing in line with sales? Thank you.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yes. So, I would anticipate \u2013 well, first of all, the step-up here is all related to specific opportunities that we see specific around the market segmentation that Dave talked about, expansion of the channel, discretionary market opportunity, new product development, those type of things.","The other thing that's fueling that a little bit is, when we acquire companies, I mean, there's opportunities that, in order to fully realize that investment and take advantage of that, investments are needed to kind of expand the capabilities of that. Republic Door would be a good example of that, where we need some infrastructure spending, if you will, to fully take advantage of that acquisition and to fill out the regional distribution capabilities for fulfillment for customers.","So, really, it's going to be dependent upon what's taking place in the industry, acquisitions, et cetera. But I would say, going forward, long term, $0.15 to $0.20 I would say is probably a peak. How much it will taper down from there is hard to say. But each year, we'll kind of look at it individually. But I think the critical thing is that, when we evaluate these, we ensure that there's good revenue growth opportunity that we can execute on it, the risk of doing that isn't significant and it's \u2013 we got to demonstrate a proof-of-concept in the marketplace before we put a bunch of capital behind it. So, we've got levers we can pull. If we can't execute, we can swaddle back a little bit.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I would just add to that, too, as we moved into 2017, a hard squeeze on what I call back-office costs and any increase in investments in things that we believe that will produce growth for us going forward in the future, including new products.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, I guess, maybe just touch on EMEIA margin. You had really nice progress this past year getting to 9.3% on an adjusted basis. I'm just wondering what's your expectation now for 2017 and beyond for the segment?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, incremental year-over-year improvement. When you come to Investor Day, we'll give you a better look at that, what we see long term, but continued step-up year-over-year. I think \u2013 as I think about Europe, it's a little bit like three-dimensional chest. We have to continue to improve our geographical position. The northern margins are better than we're \u2013 our traditional markets.","Second is investment in growth on our spec writing capabilities is important. I described our core mechanical business as more of a flow goods business that wholesalers are providing. We do the best in the world where we can drive specs. So, I wish I could be more aggressive and say, hey, it's going from this point to this. We've made big moves. But as we look at ourselves versus our competitors with similar geographical regions, we're significantly above them, so we got to be realistic in terms of how it goes forward. Our ultimate goal would be mid-teens.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, got it. And then \u2013 but I guess, for 2017 specifically, I mean, is the expectation, at least, double digits this year?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yes.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess, one area that hasn't really been touched upon today is the Asia-Pac region. You had some timing issues on sales in Q4. You've got very bullish guidance, I guess, on the organic sales line for 2017. So, just trying to understand what your visibility is like on that double-digit growth assumption, how much is in, for example, backlog or large projects that you might be thinking about.","And also, when you think about that region more broadly, what the overall ambitions are in terms of, for example, extra capital deployment, given you had been kind of shrinking in that region in the last three or four years.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, it is true we've repositioned the portfolio, I think, nicely. It's allowed us to focus on our core business. We are applying the segmented market approaches that we are in the U.S. to drive growth, and it's yielding results. We will continue to be opportunistic in terms of M&A in the region, but I'd also say patient with a flavor towards electronics.","Our Milre acquisition in South Korea, growing quite nicely and we see the Asia-Pacific region, in terms of the electronic convergence, moving faster. We want to be a part of that. But overall, feel good about our execution, confident in our growth ability, more based on the segments that we're driving. We had some project wins in the fourth quarter. That's a little bit like a license to hunt. We've got to go deliver those, which we're confident we can, and continue positive on the region.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just on the \u2013 and how about the sort of margin potential there longer term? Do you think you can get towards a European-type margin eventually if that's sort of mid-teens similar aspiration on the margin level?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","That's a good aspiration. We, again, think \u2013 the improvement year-over-year and we will go into more detail at Investor Day on how we see the next three to five years in the region.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. A little bit more difficult, just given the scale and size of the region. But steady improvement, kind of, like where we are now with Europe. We'd expect to leverage on top line growth and continue to drive price to exceed inflation and just steady improvement.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to, sort of, go back on EMEIA margins. Clearly, some nice improvements in profitability here in the past two years. At 9%, I think you're just 1 point short of the 10% target you presented two years ago. So, when you look back at the progress you made there, what do you think it is that held you back a bit? I know, last year, you had some issues with some of the European acquisitions. So, I wonder if you could comment also how you feel about the performance of these acquisitions in the first year also.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I'd say the first headwind versus the 10% is more the challenge of redeploying our manufacturing capability. We took out over 150 jobs in Italy. We have gone to some partners in some new production sites. There's always challenges with this. And as we've said in past calls, that didn't go off exactly as we would have anticipated, but we're well positioned for 2017.","In terms of \u2013 there was a pretty big transformation in the portfolio. We cut parts out. We have added, with SimonsVoss, AXA. In 2016, we established, what we call, global portable security. They're working to forward the strategies on that, which we think will fuel growth and profitability. And so, overall, we're very pleased with the improvement over the last 36 months. We have not been at this level of profitability since 2008.","The other opportunity is continuing to build our specifying capability. This comes with people. It can also come with acquisitions. SimonsVoss helps us in the spec writing capability, but you have to coordinate that across the region. This takes more time, but we think our prospects going forward are positive.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks. And the environmental remediation work that you guys are undertaking right now, you said that's coming ahead of potential regulatory requirement. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty around the regulatory environment going forward. So, I wonder if you foresee any future similar work at other facilities around your global manufacturing footprint.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I don't see any further changing needs in terms of any environmental exposures we have globally. This is another example. Over the last 36 months, we did not inherit from Ingersoll Rand an environmental department. We had to establish that, establish a review of the sites that we operate in the world. And the change or investment that we made was more driven by proven technologies. We felt that we could make that investment and remediate those sites at a faster pace versus what we were conducting. We had to work with state and local officials. And take it as our commitment to do the right thing in the places that we operate. Those will be cleaner sites. And I think we have a very good handle on what we own today.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Good morning, guys.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Saliq.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","So, one question on my end, Dave. As you take a look at the facilities that you have globally, there's roughly 30 production facilities that you guys have. I just want to get better clarity on what it is that you're doing now to bring about automation, improve the production process and ultimately reduce the cost profile and bring about speed to market.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, number one, I would look at our return on invested capital and profitability margins. We're significantly ahead of the competition. Our engineered order nature and the varieties of products that we make don't necessarily leverage huge automation investments. In things like polishing, our finishing facilities, you will see a high level. But if you go down here to India ops or into the facilities at SimonsVoss in East Germany, I think we use a balance of build-to-order human hands and automation to deliver some of the best return on capital.","Oftentimes, in manufacturing, it's how we eliminate non-value added work and help our people to improve quality customer satisfaction that yields our margins versus straight automation investment. It's not what I believe get us to the promised ground in terms of effective manufacturing.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, and thanks for fitting me in. Firstly, I mean, speaking of deals you didn't do, does dormakaba's purchase of Stanley change the competitive \u2013 or let me put it this way, how does it change the competitive dynamics in the market? Did you see it as rates of investment increase? To what extent do you feel like there is a broader strategic implication here?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, we certainly followed the Stanley movement almost from the day I arrived at the door. I think we understood our opportunity there clearly. I was not surprised at all with where that asset held up. I think you got to step back and look at it.","The performance of the Stanley Mechanical Access had not grown over time, number one. Number two, kaba dorma (01:00:10) also made another move and that was called Mesker Door. And I think they are working to try and position to look more like ourselves in ASA in the North American market. I can only say bringing together companies is never easy and being able to put together the capability of distribution, specification resources are around that.","Those new acquisitions and portfolio I think open up opportunities for us to grow. Change is never easy. That's my point there. And that's why we continue to segment the market and invest in the U.S. to drive our organic growth. So, I was not surprised by how those things came out and have no remorse.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just \u2013 you said before that electromechanical, I guess, growth was around low-double digits range this quarter. I'd just like you to, if you could, dig a little there because I know we've seen over time, as it's grown, it's gone from 20s and 30%-type growth in 2015 to now what was low-teens, mid-teens and now it seems like low-double digits, maybe lower than that in the fourth quarter.","What do you see as kind of the forward growth rate here given that we still appear to be at low levels of saturation in North America? What's the opportunity? And are you seeing some kind of slow down, or is it just a function of scale?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","No slowdown. I think we look at this market and think 5% to 8% annual market growth. We're doing better than that. And I think the challenge is for the industry and for Allegion to accelerate the adoption. These are clearly devices that can improve home, commercial institutional security. As we connect these with mobile devices; people want to be confident in them. And in my mind, this market will continue to progress, and Allegion should be \u2013 outgrow the market in that convergence.","Operator","Thank you.

With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today's call are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to Slides #2 and 3.

[Operator Instructions]. We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted.","Please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to Dave.","David Petratis","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Allegion got out of the starting gate with a good quarter that has positioned us to deliver on our 2019 commitments. We had solid top line revenue growth in the first quarter, which benefited from strength in the Americas and from the Gainsborough acquisition in the Asia Pacific region. ","The Americas' growth was driven by the nonresidential business as end market fundamentals continue to be positive, particularly in institutional verticals. Pricing was also strong for the company, led by the Americas region. Electronics growth at almost 10% for the quarter, which was lower than the growth rates we experienced in 2018. While growth improved sequentially from the last quarter, our product portfolio and new market partnerships will drive even better growth in the coming quarters.","Allegion's combination of brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships and continuously evolving channel relationships give us a great opportunity to take advantage of this market as it develops. For the full year 2019, we expect the Americas electronics growth rate to be similar to historic levels, which is supported by the healthy demand of the recently launched Schlage Encode residential lock that is ramping up in Q2. ","Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which more than offset the substantial inflationary pressures we experienced. I'm pleased with the performance as we saw operating margin increase for the total company and in each of the individual regions. In the first quarter, we delivered a 10% increase of adjusted EPS, driven primarily from operations. This performance highlights our continued focus on accelerating growth, margin improvement and driving increased shareholder value. Last, we are affirming our outlooks for 2019 revenue and EPS. We project total and organic revenue growth between 5% and 6%. ","For reported EPS, the range continues to be $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS remains at $4.75 to $4.90. Please go to Slide #5 and I'll walk through the first quarter financial summary. In Q1, Allegion delivered good top line revenue performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $655 million, an increase of 6.8%, inclusive of 5.8% organic growth. ","Allegion also contributed to the top line revenue expansion -- excuse me, acquisitions also contributed to the top line revenue expansion offsetting the unfavorable currency impact. Americas led the way with organic growth of nearly 8% in the quarter, a strong pricing and solid volume in the nonresidential business. The EMEIA region saw modest organic growth and Asia Pacific total revenue was boosted by the Gainsborough acquisition completed last year. Adjusted operating margin increased by 10 basis points, aided by price and productivity more than offsetting significant inflation. The businesses continue to focus on driving price realization, productivity savings, to combat the inflationary pressures. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.88, increased $0.08 or 10% versus the prior year. ","As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, reduced share count and a slightly lower tax rate with the other income providing the small benefit to EPS growth. Year-to-date, available cash flow is down approximately $6 million, the decrease is related to increased working capital and higher capital expenditures that were offset slightly by increased earnings.","Please go to Slide 6. When Allegion was founded, we put together a sound strategy, values and strategic pillars for our company, and they have allowed us to deliver industry-leading results, including industry-leading organic growth and operating margins. As we move into the next five years, we made some nice adjustments to the strategy. In March, we shared our refresh corporate strategy with you. Our vision of seamless access in a safer world is aligned with electronic trends and security and access. It also recognized the enhanced capabilities of technology, edge devices and our unique ownership of the opening to provide layers of authentication and enhanced safety to increase human productivity. ","We believe the five strategic pillars Allegion has laid out are the foundation for our future. Our pillars include expansion in core markets. We continue to broaden the core business through channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products. Being the partner of choice, delivering seamless access means we are intent on looking beyond our walls and leveraging our partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others.","Driving value and access, our innovation will focus on the user experience with access and working with partners to create unique solutions that increase their safety and speed up their productivity. We're also intent on bringing new products to the market faster through modular, global, scalable platforms. ","Capital allocation. Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment one that expands organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns. And last, enterprise excellence. As you have seen in our Q1, our ability to drive results through productivity and continuous improvement is a strength of our company. Allegion is committed to create value with excellent customer experience and with a culture of safety, health and employee engagement. Access has been a part of our company's history for over 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward.","Patrick will now take you through the financial results, and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2019 outlook.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to Slide #7. This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the first quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides. As indicated, we delivered 5.8% organic growth in Q1. This performance reflects another strong quarter in the Americas region, which includes 7.6% organic growth, led by the nonresidential markets and returns on our channel initiatives.","Pricing in the quarter was strong at 2.1%. The company will continue to take necessary pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures. Also during the first quarter, acquisitions contributed more than 3% growth, offsetting the substantial currency headwinds we experienced. Please go to Slide #8. Reported net revenues for the first quarter were $655 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 6.8% versus the prior year, up 5.8% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $112.1 million increased nearly 8% over the same time frame from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 17.1% increased 10 basis points. Price realization and productivity actions outpaced inflation, which contributed to the operating incoming increase and solid volume leverage contributed to the margin expansion. ","Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 40 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins and regional mix driven by acquisitions. Each of the regions saw expansion in operating margin, which offsets the corporate expense related to deferred compensation plans due to favorable financial markets and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation for retirement-eligible employees. The incremental cost associated with deferred compensation plans will offset in other income, below operating income such as it had no impact on earnings per share.","Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the first quarter. For the first quarter 2018, reported earnings per share was $0.75. Adjusting $0.05 for the prior year restructuring expenses and cost-related acquisitions, the Q1 2018 adjusted EPS was $0.80. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.09 as favorable price, operating leverage on incremental volume and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency. Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $.0.01 as we executed more than $63 million in share buyback in the quarter. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. These incremental investments are for new product development, channel strategies and demand creation spending. Collectively, these incremental investments enable Allegion to accelerate growth, particularly in electronics. The combination of interest expense, other income, noncontrolling interest and tax rate offset each other to have no impact on year-over-year earnings per share growth.","This results in adjusted first quarter 2019 earnings per share of $0.88, an increase of $0.08 or 10% compared to the prior year. Lastly, we have a $0.04 per share reduction for charges related acquisitions of restructuring. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the first quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $0.84.","Please go to Slide #10. First quarter revenues for the Americas region were $475.3 million, up 8.2% on a reported basis and 7.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by low double-digit increase in the nonresidential business. Pricing was strong in Americas region, coming in at 2.6% in the quarter, while the nonresidential business grew nicely, the residential business was essentially flat in the quarter when compared to Q1 of last year. ","Electronics growth still exceeded total growth in the Americas and came in at nearly 10%. Americas adjusted operating income of $123.1 million increased 8.5% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 10 basis points. The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven primarily by volume leverage. Additionally, price and productivity exceeded the significant inflationary pressures observed in the region and contributed to the operating income increase. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point drag on margins.","Please go to Slide #11. First quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $142.9 million, down 4.9% and up 1.7% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by pricing and favorable volume in our SimonsVoss and Interflex businesses, offsetting weaknesses in Southern Europe. Total revenue growth was reduced by significant currency headwinds. EMEIA adjusted operating income of $11.7 million increased 30% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 220 basis points, driven by price and productivity exceeding moderate inflation. The region also saw volume leverage and favorable mix, which partially offset currency pressures. Incremental investments were a 30 basis point headwind operating margin.","Please go to Slide #12. First quarter revenues for Asia-Pacific region were $36.8 million, up 55% versus the prior year. Organic revenue declined 2.2%, driven by an internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Total revenue growth was driven by the Gainsborough acquisition, which increased revenues in the region by more than 63%. Foreign currency was a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by nearly 6%. Asia-Pacific adjusted operating loss for the quarter was $0.7 million, an improvement of $0.3 million with adjusted operating margins improving 230 basis points versus the prior year period. Similar to the other regions, the price, productivity, inflation dynamic was positive in the region and the Gainsborough acquisition was accretive to operating margin in the quarter. ","Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the first quarter 2019 was negative $24.9 million, which is a decrease of $6.1 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease is driven by higher working capital requirements and increased capital spending, partially offset by higher net earnings.","Working capital as a percent of revenues increased slightly in the first quarter, while the cash conversion cycle was down. As always, we remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and will continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. ","Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. ","I will now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook.","David Petratis","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #14. As noted on the slide, we are affirming our revenue outlook. The consolidated outlook for total organic revenue remains at a range of 5% to 6%. In the Americas, we see continued positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe will continue to be strong throughout 2019. We expect the general trend toward electronic progress to continue, and we are positioned to take advantage of this trend. ","For the EMEIA region, we expect strength in our electronic businesses led by SimonsVoss and Interflex to more than offset weaknesses that we are experiencing in Southern Europe. However, total revenue will be negatively affected by currency headwinds. In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see healthy growth in China with softening markets in Australia and New Zealand. The total revenue growth reflects the full year impact of the Gainsborough acquisition, which has another quarter before we pass the anniversary date. We're also affirming our earnings per share outlook with reported EPS at the range of $4.60 to $4.75 per share and adjusted EPS to be between $4.75 and $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 6% to 9%. ","As Patrick stated, we are also affirming our cash flow outlook of $430 million to $450 million. The outlook assumes no change in the previously provided investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate continues to be approximately $0.16 -- 16% with an anticipated higher rate in the first half of the year than in the second half. We're updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares to approximately $95 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed in Q1. ","Please go to Slide 15. As a summary of Allegion's Q1 performance, total revenue grew nearly 7%, organic revenue grew almost 6%, adjusted operating margins were up 10 basis points, and were up in all regions. Adjusted EPS saw 10% growth in the quarter. Access has been an important part of our past and will be more important part of the future, as we connect the world through seamless access and smart devices. ","Now Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And today's first question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Walsh","So I guess, maybe a first question here around electronics, the near almost 10% growth. I think you've been talking about sustaining a mid-teens type growth rate on an annual basis. You have another quarter here of a high teens comp. How should we think about the cadence? And maybe a little bit underneath that number between residential and nonresidential would also be helpful as well.","David Petratis","I would say, continue your cadence or in terms of mid-teens growth for our electronics businesses. As I said in Investor Day, our industry was going to do well with this transformation over the next decade, feel good about the business with the launch of Encode, our partnership with Ring, the conversion of Lennar who is leading on electronics from the launch. We see that the adoption continues to be strong. We have a strong pipeline of new products and partnerships. When I see the 10% growth in the quarter, there was some work behind the scenes that we conducted in the channel that, I think, took some steam out of our sales, but will help us accelerate as we go forward.","John Walsh","And, I guess, maybe can you elaborate on those actions in the channel a little bit?","David Petratis","I would describe it as this. With the advent and growth of e-commerce, it can be at times a little bit of the wild west. And we went in and buttoned up some channel partners that will help us to drive price realization and growth in the marketplace.","John Walsh","Got you. And then maybe just one quick one here. Nice to see the price and productivity net be a 60 basis point contributor year-on-year. How should we think about that cadence as we go through the year? Does that actually pick up?","David Petratis","So as we've commented earlier, well, first of all, was very pleased with the performance in the quarter. It's good to see us turn the quarter on the price productivity inflation dynamic. As you'll recall, last year every quarter, we were a little bit under water. So we turned positive this year, particularly across all regions. So very pleased with the performance as it relates to that. As we look forward during the course of the year, you would see a -- from a margin expansion continued improvement as we progress throughout the year with the margin improvement being more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year, and that's when the comparisons on inflation become a little bit more easier, particularly as we look at input cost on steel and those type of things. So consider continued migration of margin expansion with more heavily back-end loaded in the back half of the year.","Operator","And the next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","So I guess, thinking back on 1Q, it seems like every company we've heard from so far has had some mix of inventory and weather discussions. So just wondering as it pertains to residential where the mechanical side looks like it was probably a little bit weaker. Anything that you saw from weather or channel destocking that makes that kind of a less of a trend line and something you can accelerate or at least improve a little bit from here?","David Petratis","I would say, first, look at the macro. We see the renovation of retrofit softened in the quarter. I think you see overall starts down or at least softened, not surprising, I think, again. Third, there are some pretty big players in retail, that have year-ends that tends to wind down the inventory. And then it was a pretty tough winter. I don't like to point at that, but especially in res, north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line people generally don't go out and replace their front door locks when it's below 0. So I think there was a lot of things working in that. Overall, I think we performed pretty well in the quarter with some of those stressors.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the price mix in Americas. I think that's the high water marks that we haven't hit in sometime. Just understanding that mix was probably particularly solid given resi versus non-resi and electronics, which probably could have been a little bit better to your earlier point. How should we think about how that paces through the rest of the year? Should that price mix number start to moderate as you lap some of the increases last year?","David Petratis","Yes. So you would expect to see kind of a similar type of dynamic maybe for Q2. And then, as you said, the price increase implemented last year beginning of Q2, so that laps beginning -- beginning of Q3, so that laps in Q3. And the price increase that we're going out with this year isn't of the same magnitude. And so therefore, the price increase year-over-year becomes less in the back half of the year.","Operator","And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just a first question on your residential business. So, as you said, this is the second quarter in a row of sort of no growth really, a lot of issues in the broader market and also weather. Maybe just update us on what you're expecting your residential business to grow in 2019? And what sort of impact do you think we could see from electronics products within that? And whether there has been any evidence of demand destruction from price increases?","David Petratis","So we don't split out the overall residential growth. I think, as you look at the macro on new build, I think, we're going to continue for single family in North America around 850, a relatively flat market. I think multifamily continues to be robust, that surprises me, but people are moving into the inner cities. These projects tend to be more price competitive, especially on the traditional mechanical hardware. We do like the trend that these are becoming more electronic. We have, over the last 2 years, had a focused effort around this, and we think it will give us some lift. The strength of our company continues to be on the retrofit fit side of this. So I like our opportunities as we go into res, and it will advance -- our growth will advance beyond what we saw in Q1.","Patrick Shannon","Let me just add too on the price perspective, as it relates to residential. It has been a little choppy, not in the sale to price through the distribution channel but more on the rebate side and discounts and those type of things. We actually had positive price realization in Q1 this year as it relates to residential. So there is no deterioration, if you will, in the pricing dynamics and what's going on in the marketplace, and believe we can continue to hold our own particularly as it relates to some of our new electronic products, and I think we'll be, continue to be extremely competitive there.","Julian Mitchell","And then my second question just on those Americas margins, it was good to see the slight increase year-on-year in the first quarter. Based on your comments around productivity efforts in the margin bridge and also acquisition impacts, should we see that, that margin expansion accelerates through the year? And what kind of headwinds from M&A on margin do you expect in Americas?","Patrick Shannon","So we would continue to see expansion throughout the course of the year, again the back half will be, a wider gap there, more favorable than Q2. M&A, as we've indicated, historically, the businesses we acquired, we like very much. We will continue to drive improvement as they become part of the Allegion business operating system and continue to drive synergies on both the top end and the cost side. Those businesses though, when we acquire, had a lower-margin profile. And therefore, by nature they are dilutive to the Americas margin, but we'll continue to get improvement in those businesses and that will help margin performance year-over-year comparisons going forward.","Operator","And the next question comes from Deepa Rahgavan with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","So my question is on the guide, year 2019. There is not much we can glean from this unchanged full year guide. There seems to be some cross-wind; Europe is softer obviously; North America holding better than we thought; Asia, maybe okay there. But let me ask you this way, does the guide at midpoint, say, $4.82 EPS or organic growth of 5.5% for the full year. Does that feel bolstered now where you stand post Q1? Or is it just stable at this point in time, which is what you were thinking prior?","Patrick Shannon","Well, pretty stable, I would say, based on the performance, pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So therefore, you don't really see an uptick relative to the guide. So feel pretty good where we are, and our execution and basis of what Dave indicated the demand, particularly in institutional markets going forward, feel really good about that and feel like we've got good visibility to execute on our guidance for 2019.","David Petratis","Deepa, I would add to that. I'd just say confident now of what we see coming out of Q1. I feel that 90, 120 days ago, a lot of uncertainty about what was going to unfold in '19. And my message to the Street is confidence. We see good solid end markets, as I travel really globally, there is opportunity for Allegion. And as I think about the electronic convergence, I like what I see ahead in 2019.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. My follow on is on Q2. Is there any quirkiness either on year-on-year basis or sequentially or comp wise we should be mindful of?","Patrick Shannon","Nothing comes to mind out of the ordinary. Other than maybe below-the-line items, you're going to see some pressure as it relates to other income expense and then the tax rate, I believe, was anticipated to be higher.","Operator","And the next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Congratulations on the quarter. Just looking at the Americas non-residential business, the low double-digit growth, is there any way you can separate out institutional versus commercial for us there?","David Petratis","We don't. I would say, as I look at our execution in those markets, we continue to perform at a high level. I think, that's reflected in the number. We see strength in the institutionals especially around K through 12 and college campuses. But as I look at those segments, I think, we see the electronic trends that are driving us, things like Overtur that we've rolled out help us to better connect with specifiers and contractors to drive that growth. And I think fundamentally, the market is strong and we're executing at a very good level.","David MacGregor","Okay. And, I guess, just as a follow-up. Just talk about the electronics business and the profitability there. Any notable change in terms of the profitability of that business, it sounds like maybe there were some investments this quarter in the residential electronics? Just how should we think about the profitability? And then how you're thinking about that as it extends to the balance of the year?","Patrick Shannon","So profitability really similar to prior years as we've indicated similar margin profile, but a higher ASP meaning more EBIT dollars. And so this whole trend of electronics growth really positive for Allegion and will continue. There is nothing in the horizon that would suggest any margin deterioration, relative to the new products we've introduced, similar margin profiles, and we believe we can sustain that going forward.","David MacGregor","Patrick, as the new product cadence accelerates, does that profitability improve? Or how should we think about that?","Patrick Shannon","No. Similar margin profile.","David Petratis","As we think about that pipeline of new electronic products, our desire is to use design innovation, standardization of global platforms to be able to maintain that margin profile.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Kessler","First question is, this year or over the last 1.5 year, we've seen an acceleration in companies that have been doing, let's call it, enhanced card access, companies like you just mentioned like one, Identiv, but some of them compete with you on card access, some of them have things that are actually outside of what you've been doing. Are you looking at expanding into that business a little bit further? And I'm not just talking about generic card access, I'm talking about card access that actually has permissions on it that gets you in, that has some maybe federal attachments to it. I know you're mostly commercial, but there are other vertical markets that the entire access business gets involved with and brings in -- involves new technologies like audio over IT, things like that. So the question -- the bottom line question is, are there card access areas that interest you to expand the business in that area?","David Petratis","I think a couple of ways we think about that. Number 1, with acquisition, ISONAS was part of that. We think we got some nice IP and capabilities. I think second partnerships, I am really excited with our venture group and potential partners and new technologies that walk through. And I think partnership is not a bad place to position. I also think edge devices will also be with layers of authenticity, will be an important part of that equation to be able to drive access through cards and readers.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. Quickly on Overtur. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about Overtur as a service, the fact that you can now have a collaborative capability that brings in a number of parties, which really does, I think, create some value added to your ability to bring a group of people to design something and help you get that product out faster. Is there a way to make that some type of a service or other parts of Allegion a service subscription -- subscription but, yes a service, I would call recurring revenue subscription-based way to get involved in working with Allegion in some way, shape or form, if something like Overtur becomes ubiquitous?","David Petratis","So the answer would be, yes. However, our first priority is to make sure the user satisfaction and adoption is at a high level. So why would my answer would be, yes? I think as you think about institutional campus, a hospital, K-12 schools, the ability to digitally capture access, workflows and keep that updated is attractive to an operator of that hospital or college campus. Think about the system Overtur keeps those things current, it's not easy for a campus administrator to go out and access those multiple documents would be one example. Another is what's installed on that door as the potential is needed for service in a variety of areas. So I'd say, we're trying to stretch our thinking of what the possibilities of digital systems like Overtur can mean to the business, and I think it's -- there is positive opportunity as we go forward, Joe.","Jeffrey Kessler","I'm just kind of following up. You have futurists who work with you and who are working beside you, and I think there is a lot of things that they can think about right now with given the base -- the broader base of your products and if something like this were to get a higher -- a very high user rate, you could probably move forward with a recurring revenue type of program.","David Petratis","I hope all of our listeners will take a look at our Investor Day presentations and our view on seamless access. There is great opportunities for us to redefine our industry and develop new ecosystems that will benefit Allegion in a variety of ways beyond Overtur, and we are excited about it.","Operator","And the next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird.","Josh Chan","My first question is on the non-res business in the Americas, growth is obviously very strong. Just wondering, you talked about visibility through the whole year. Just kind of could you give us some color in terms of what you're hearing from the channel or contractor backlogs or anything like that, that kind of lends you that confidence regarding growth for the rest of the year?","David Petratis","So contractor backlogs close to 9 months, historically that's extremely healthy. I think, we continue to see -- labor in the construction markets is tight. I think that continues to snowplough as you heard me say. I think the adoption of electronics continues to be an attractive trend. You get into the K-12 opportunity, bond issuance is on the rise. And the other one that a little bit more sobering, the average age of a K-12 school is 40 years old. And the need for upgrade with the opportunity or drive around campus security continue to be good for our business. You move over to healthcare, we see some softening in the big hospitals, but we see uptick around what we call medical offices and specialty clinics. There is a repositioning here, but these medical clinics still drive the same complexity of code and specification, product enhancements that we think drive growth. And for me as well, the commercial market continues to have legs, so we like the overall view, we think things like Overtur, our spec writing capability and then adding electronics bode well for 2019.","Patrick Shannon","And then, Josh, just as an add on. Some of our leading indicators, so big code activities, specifications written, those type of things, very strong, trend continues to be up. And normally, there is a lag obviously between the time you get those and when the products are put in place. So feel really good relative to the market demand and the feedback we get from our customer base.","Josh Chan","And then my second question is on the buyback. It seems like the pace in Q1 was maybe slightly above what you normally do in Q1. So just wondering if buybacks are -- is this more of a focus this year than in the prior years?","Patrick Shannon","Well, we indicated during our Shareholder Day, capital allocation is the key strategic pillar for the company. As you know, we are in a really good financial position. Our balance sheet is the healthiest it's been since then, with a 2x debt-to-EBITDA, cash flow will continue to increase as our business grows and expands. So we have a lot of optionality and the key message is, we're going to deploy capital, put it to use for our shareholders to drive shareholder returns. Last year, as you know, we're extremely busy and adding some really good businesses to the portfolio. We're still integrating those. Our pipeline from an M&A perspective remain active and busy. We'll remain disciplined, but if we're not active in M&A, we've always said, we would provide incremental shareholder distributions either through dividends or share repurchases. You saw the dividend increase executed in Q1. So we're more active now in share repurchase. We have available cash to put it to use, and we'll continue to do so.","Operator","And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","Dave you've became a friend, my friends typically will refer to me by both names. I don't know why, but it's been a trait since I've been in high school. Anyhow, going off on a tangent. The question I have is really regarding trends. So if we think about the first quarter, we've heard like a varying degrees of trends throughout the quarter, because of weather, because of tariffs. And I'm just wondering as you guys progress through the quarter, how did your trends either improve or decelerate as we move through the quarter?","David Petratis","I think there was a vulnerable flaw in the year that was called the government shutdown. I think, clearly, as we went through the quarter, things got better. And it's always -- there is a hangover after the New Years, things pick up, but felt good with the momentum. I felt better about our execution on price and productivity. We put up, I thought, an aggressive 2019 plan with margin expansion, and I was very pleased with our ability not only to put up good organic growth, but more pleased by our execution on the price and productivity side.","Joseph Ritchie","But I guess, specifically though, Dave, I mean as we kind of progress through March, did things get any better? Did they get worse? Like how did things progress?","David Petratis","As we went through March, and it's normal with the thawing of the ground, things get better. That's happened for the last 38 years in my exposure to building products. And in my mind, it's just a part of the spring routine, it gets better.","Joseph Ritchie","That's helpful. And if I could just kind of follow on, on your investment spending. I saw that you did $0.02 this quarter, still looking to do about $0.15 for the year. And so how does the -- Patrick, how does the cadence come through for the rest of the year on the investments? And perhaps maybe some color around the investments that you're doing for the rest of the year?","Patrick Shannon","So obviously it's going to pick up here, think heavily weighted towards the back half of the year, which kind of matches our improvement and margin expansion. The incremental investments or the same kind of criteria, new product developments or acceleration of products, particularly around electronics, feel like we're getting really good demand from those going forward. Channel development, continued investment in the channel, underserved market opportunities around the globe, we'll continue to do that. And then demand creation as related to trying to accelerate adoption, centered around electronics. Those are kind of the 3 primary categories, all kind of front-end loaded in terms of revenue, driving growth and we'll continue to do that and again it will expand during the course of the year.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to return the call to Mike Wagnes for any closing remarks.","Michael Wagnes","We would like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. Please contact me for any further questions, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Wagnes","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call.","On the call today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the presentation, which we will refer to in today\u2019s call are available on our website at investor.allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to Slides number 2 and 3.

For the Q&A, we ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up and then reenter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone, given the time allotted.","Please go to Slide #4, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.","David Petratis","Thanks, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Allegion delivered great results in Q3. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the revenue growth and operational performance, which have positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 commitments.","Top-line revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, particularly in the Americas and EMEIA regions. In the Americas, both non-residential and residential businesses saw high-single-digit growth. In EMEIA, we saw solid volume increases across most of the region.","The Americas delivered electronics growth of 10% in the quarter, which was a notable performance, considering the challenging comparable from prior year, where we grew nearly 30%. Strong market acceptance of our new highly-rated Schlage Encode residential lock continues to be robust, and help drive the electronics performance in the quarter.","We were the first major manufacturer to bring a smart WiFi deadbolt to the market, and it has a lot of momentum in the residential channel. We believe our brands, expanded product portfolio, technical partnerships, breadth of channel relationships and a large installed base provide us with a great opportunity to take advantage of the electronics market, as it continues to evolve and grow.","Moving down the slide, Allegion was able to drive price realization and productivity actions, which significantly outpaced inflation. I\u2019m proud of the performance as we saw substantial operating margin expansion, up 220 basis points this quarter.","In the third quarter, we delivered robust adjusted EPS growth at nearly 20%, driven primarily by operational performance along with favorable share count and tax rate impact. We are affirming the full-year revenue outlook, in which we continue to project total inorganic revenue growth between 4.5% and 5.5%.","I\u2019ll speak to the individual region outlooks later in the presentation. Last, we are tightening the outlook for our reported EPS going from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share to a revised outlook of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. The adjusted EPS outlook is also been tightened by rising the low-end of the range and going from $4.80 to $4.90 per share, to a revised outlook of $4.85 to $4.90 per share.","Please go to Slide 5. Revenue for the third quarter was $748.3 million, an increase of 5.2%, inclusive of 6.4% organic growth. Currency headwinds offset some of the organic growth. The Americas and EMEIA region were responsible for the organic growth results. Patrick will share more detail on this.","Adjusted operating margin increased by 220 basis points, aided by substantial contribution from price and productivity outpacing inflation. Solid leverage on incremental volume also provided benefit to the margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.47 increased by nearly 20% versus the prior year.","As mentioned, the increase was driven primarily by operational performance, along with favorable share count and a lower tax rate. Year-to-date available cash flow is up slightly. With the increased earnings, we have experienced this year, being mostly offset by increased capital expenditures.","Please go to Slide 6. In March, we shared our refreshed corporate strategy with you, which centers on our vision of seamless access. Since that time, momentum and market acceptance continues to build. For instance, smartphones and the connectivity are the norm. This translates to pressure from our customers to meet end-users\u2019 demand for a mobile connected life, while ensuring security.","Allegion is well positioned to meet this demand. We see strong uptake with our seamless ID solutions for universities and edge devices, and adoption of Schlage Encode, and in emerging technologies and venturing opportunities. We\u2019re confident in the long-term electronic opportunity and see that seamless access and safety lay a solid foundation for our future.","As a reminder, our five strategic pillars that guide Allegion are: Expand in Core Markets, we continue to broaden the core business through existing and new channel relationships, digital demand creation and leading products; Be the Partner of Choice, delivering seamless access means we\u2019re intent on leveraging partners and ecosystems to drive growth, which includes using open platforms that integrate well with others; Deliver New Value in Access, our innovation will focus on the user experience for access, as well as working with partners to create unique solutions that increase safety and speed up productivity, we are also intent on bringing new products to market faster; Capital Allocation, Allegion will continue to take a disciplined and flexible approach to capital deployment, one that spans organic investments, acquisitions and shareholder distributions to optimize shareholder returns; last, Enterprise Excellence, Allegion is committed to creating value through productivity, through excellent customer experience and through a culture of safety, health and employee engagement.","Access has been a part of the company\u2019s heritage for 100 years and seamless access will define our company going forward. Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I\u2019ll be back to discuss the 2019 outlook.","Patrick Shannon","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. If you would, please go to Slide #7.","This slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the third quarter. I\u2019ll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 6.4% organic growth in Q3. We saw strong volumes and solid price realization drive the organic increase this quarter, led by both the Americas and EMEIA regions. Volumes recovered nicely from Q2 levels, as market demand was strong.","Also during the third quarter, currency in EMEIA and Asia Pacific continue to be a headwind on total revenue growth. Please go to Slide #8.","Reported net revenues for the third quarter were $748.3 million, as stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 5.2% versus the prior year, up 6.4% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $173 million increased more than 16% over the same timeframe last year. Adjusted operating margin of 23.1% increased 220 basis points. It represents our highest quarterly adjusted operating margin since spin.","Leverage on incremental volumes, price realization and substantial productivity drove the operating income increased in margin expansion. During the quarter, all regions contributed sizeable margin improvements. Headwinds to margin performance included incremental investments, which had a 30 basis point impact on adjusted operating margins.","Please go to Slide #9. This slide reflects our earnings per share reconciliation for the third quarter. For the third quarter of 2018, reported earnings per share was a $1.21. Adjusting $0.02 for the prior year restructuring and acquisition charges as well as adjustments to provisions related to the enactment of tax reform. The Q3 2018 adjusted earnings per share was a $1.23. Operational results increased earnings per share by $0.24 as favorable price, productivity and operating leverage on incremental volume more than offset inflationary impacts and unfavorable currency.","Favorable year-over-year share count drove another $0.03 increase as we have executed nearly $180 million in share buyback so far this year. A decrease in the year-over-year tax rate improved earnings per share by $0.02. The impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.02 reduction. The combination of interest expense, other expense and noncontrolling interest had a negative $0.03 impact, which was driven mostly by favorable other income in 2018. This results in adjusted third quarter 2019 earnings per share of $1.47, an increase of $0.24 or nearly 20% compared to the prior year period.","Lastly, we had a $0.07 per share reduction for charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and debt refinancing. After giving effect to these onetime items, you arrive at the third quarter 2019 reported earnings per share of $1.40.","Please go to Slide #10. This quarter revenues for the Americas region were $567.8 million, up 7.1% on a reported basis and 7.2% organically. Organic growth was driven by strong volume along with continued price realization. When compared to Q3 of last year, we experienced high-single-digit growth in both nonresidential and residential, as nonresidential market demand remain strong and residential rebounded nicely from a sluggishness, we experienced in the first half of the year.","Electronics growth for the quarter came in at 10%. As Dave mentioned earlier, we are pleased with this electronics performance given that the quarter was going up against a nearly 30% growth rate compared to last year. Americas adjusted operating income of $175.6 million increased 13.8% versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 180 basis points.","The increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by leverage on incremental volume along with price and productivity significantly exceeding inflation. Incremental investments were a 50 basis point decrease on operating margins.","Please go to Slide #11. Third quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $137.8 million, up 2.5% and up 6.9% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by increased volume across most products along with solid price realization. Total revenue growth continues to be reduced by significant currency headwinds.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12 million increased 17.6% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 110 basis points with price and leverage on incremental volume contributing to the increase. Timing of year-over-year investments benefitted operating margins by 80 basis points, as start-up costs incurred in 2018 related to our new Poland facility did not repeat this year.","Please go to Slide #12. Third quarter revenues for the Asia-Pacific region were $42.7 million, down 9.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue decreased 4.8%. The organic revenue decline was driven by softer residential markets in Australia along with internal revenue transfer of $1.5 million to the other regions. Foreign currency was again a significant headwind for the quarter reducing revenue by more than 4%.","Asia-Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $4.4 million, an increase of 37.5% with adjusted operating margins improving 350 basis points versus the prior year period. The regions saw strong productivity, the results of restructuring actions taken last year and acquisition integration, which offset the 70 basis point headwind from incremental investments.","Of note, 2019 Q3 operating income includes a $1.1 million favorable recovery of previously remitted non-income tax, which had a 260 basis point favorable impact on Asia-Pacific margins in the quarter.","Please go to Slide #13. Year-to-date available cash flow for the third quarter 2019 was $230 million, which is an increase of $1.4 million compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by increased net earnings mostly offset by increased capital spending. Working capital as a percent of revenues increased in the third quarter and the cash conversion cycle was also slightly higher.","We continue to remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to both minimize investments in working capital and increase available cash flow. Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million.","I\u2019ll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2019 outlook.","David Petratis","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to Slide #14. As you can see on the slide, and was mentioned earlier we are affirming our revenue outlook for the total company. The consolidated outlook for total and organic revenue remains at a range of 4.5% to 5.5%, although we\u2019re adjusting within the regions.","In the Americas, we continue to see positive fundamentals in our nonresidential verticals led by institutional markets, which we believe, will continue to remain solid for the near-term future. In residential, we saw Q3 rebound from the sluggishness we experienced during the first half of the year. In addition, we expect the general positive trend for electronic products to continue for the foreseeable future, and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this long-term trend. Therefore, we are slightly increasing the revenue outlook for Americas.","For the EMEIA region, we expect continued currency pressures for the remainder of the year and have taken down our outlook for total revenue. However, organic revenue remains unchanged. In Asia-Pacific, we expect the softness in the Australian markets to continue, particularly around residential end markets. We also expect unfavorable currency impacts to continue. As such, we are lowering the outlook for both reported and organic growth in the region.","We are also updating the earnings per share outlook, raising the low-end of both our reported and adjusted EPS ranges. Our reported EPS outlook is now at a range of $4.55 to $4.65 per share, with adjusted EPS at a range of $4.85 to $4.90. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 8% to 9%.","As Patrick stated, we are affirming our cash flow outlook range of $410 million to $430 million. The outlook updates the expected investment spend to a range of $0.11 to $0.13 per share. The full year adjusted effective tax rate is being updated to approximately 15.5% with a favorability experienced in Q3 mostly offset in Q4. We are updating our outlook for outstanding diluted shares for the full year to approximately $94.3 million, reflecting the buyback activity completed so far this year, and including expected share repurchases for Q4.","Please go to Slide 15. As a brief summary of Allegion\u2019s Q3 performance total revenue grew 5.2%, organic revenue grew 6.4%, adjusted operating margins were up 220 basis points, adjusted EPS was up nearly 20%. In Q3, we delivered our highest quarterly revenue, operating margins and earnings per share.","Allegion has an operating system of operations that continue to strengthen the foundational elements of both safety and innovation. The system combined with strong brands and channel relationships has been a hallmark of our performance since spin and certainly helped us deliver the third quarter results.","Thank you to every member of the Allegion team. Your commitment to excellence strengthens our future.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] And the first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning.","David Petratis","Good morning, Andrew.","Patrick Shannon","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question, we got a lot of questions I think regarding the fourth quarter guide and given the organic performance in the quarter. Was there any pull-forward of revenue from fourth quarter into third quarter? And I apologize. I joined a little bit late. But just conservatism about organic growth, specifically in Americas in Q4, given the performance in the third quarter?","David Petratis","So, I would characterize Q3 extremely strong growth, as indicated 7% organic growth. Really good performance, both in the non-res and residential segments. No real pull-forward of activity. I would say, business improved a little bit kind of as we progressed throughout the quarter, which was good to see.","But just as a reminder, we did increase our full-year guide on organic revenue growth, given the Q3 performance. And so, that\u2019s baked in there. Our year-to-date organic growth, Americas is at 6%, and our full-year guidance is kind of within that range. And so, still expect a good Q4 going forward and we\u2019ll finish the year strong relative to top-line performance.","Andrew Obin","And then, just a follow-up question. One of your competitors highlighted on their conference calls that they are starting to see sort of signs of markets slowing. I wonder if they were referring to your census data. But you guys are \u2013 I think are quite a bit more upbeat. What kind of visibility do you have over the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you.","David Petratis","So we are solid, positive, upbeat on the economy. As I look at the positive factors, consumer confidence, low unemployment, state and local tax revenues which are a key for our business, low interest rates and tightness in the housing market. I don\u2019t know why you could not be positive about the view going forward.","I was looking at future activity for bond issues. In the State of Texas there is 84 bond issues on the ballot. I just see a trend and need in the economy for investments on both residential and non-residential and feel positive about the outlook.","Andrew Obin","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the residential business, you did have a good acceleration there in the third quarter. Whether you see that growth rate as sort of a blip, because you were starting a bunch of initiatives or whether you think that because of all your sort of self-help measures in resi, you can drive a good mid-single-digit-plus growth rate in the quarters and years ahead?","David Petratis","I think if you compare our first-half residential performance, which I believe was plus 4, was respectable in a soft patch in the market. We also had some self-help there or correction that we were doing in the channel. The market improved in Q3, that\u2019s reflective. I think the best opportunities going forward in res will be multifamily, that continues strong.","I think single family, which is important to us is going to continue to plot along. It\u2019s not getting significantly better. You add electronics on top of that with some of our leading products, our high star ratings, our connectivity and the first WiFi embedded lock. I think it sets us up for continued solid performance in that segment.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then, just my second quick one would be around the implied sort of operating margins in Q4. We\u2019ve had some questions this morning around, it looks as if that implies a softer margin performance than what you saw in the third quarter, just based on the full-year guide. Just maybe any comments you could provide on that fourth quarter margin trend year-on-year, any big headwinds or tailwinds you\u2019d call out?","David Petratis","Yeah. Well, let me first maybe comment on a little bit more specifics on Q3 operating margin performance. So as indicated, really strong across the board. All regions showing fairly significant margin improvement. We did benefit, if you kind of look at the price, productivity, inflation dynamic, extremely favorable.","Inflation, you may recall last year was at a peak in Q3. And so, the comparisons were easier, if you will, and that gap was extremely favorable in the reported results in Q3 this year. We won\u2019t see that favorability as much reflected in Q4. And therefore, the margin profile expansion won\u2019t be as strong in Q3.","However, I would say, just given the anticipated continued strength in the overall markets, revenue growth, et cetera, we will have good operating margin improvement year-over-year with margins continuing to expand. And our full-year expectation, again, is like an 80 to 100 basis point margin improvement full year. So still anticipate strong operational performance in Q4 to finish out the year.","Patrick Shannon","Hey, just one point of clarification. Julian. The number Dave quoted for residential, that was year-to-date for the resi growth.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. Thanks very much for the help.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, Deepa. Your line is open. Is your phone on mute perhaps?","Very well, we\u2019ll move on. The next question is from Josh Chan with Baird.","Josh Chan","Hi, good morning, and congrats on a strong quarter.","David Petratis","Thank you.","Josh Chan","I wanted to ask about sort of the \u2013 your confidence in terms of the Americas outlook. I wonder if you have kind of internally tried to reconcile some of the softer kind of data points versus what you are kind of seeing in your business in terms of non-res overall growth. And just kind of curious, what kind of conclusion you might have come across? And then also, what kind of verticals, in particular, are you seeing that strength into the rest of the year and 2020, I guess?","David Petratis","So a lot packed into that. I think you\u2019ve got to look at the macro noise and take heed of that. Again as I look at the macro, I see a lot of positive out there, including, again I\u2019ll emphasize state and local tax revenues. Then you\u2019ve got to square that with what\u2019s the level of our backlog, code activities. I\u2019d remind you, Josh, that construction backlogs still remain at over 8 months, that\u2019s healthy. Residential inventories, historic low from my perspective at 4 months. And then, look at our activities for quotes, we like what we see going forward, that continued solid progression of the business. You have to temper that with electronics, which we think positively influences. So we\u2019re confident in what we see over the next 9 to 12 months.","Josh Chan","All right. That\u2019s good to hear. And my follow-up is on the investment spending. I noticed that you kind of took the investment spend down a little bit for the year. I wonder, if that\u2019s a little bit of a shift in terms of thinking? Or just \u2013 is that more timing or anything to read into there?","David Petratis","Nothing really to read into that, more of a timing item. When we look at the end markets, there are still many opportunities to continue to invest in our business, particularly around channels, demand creation, new product development, this Internet of Things platform connectivity seamless access, there is a host of activities that we can continue to invest and that we believe will continue to accelerate our top-line performance. And so we\u2019ll continue to look at those opportunities and give you more kind of specifics relative to 2020 going forward. But there is a lot of activity and things we can continue to invest and continue to drive our business forward.","Josh Chan","Okay, great. Thank you for your time.","David Petratis","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","David Petratis","Good morning, John.","John Walsh","Hey, congrats on a strong operational quarter as well. I guess, two questions. One, thinking about pricing, obviously, we knew it was going to step down given the comparison of what we saw in the first half of this year, but it was better than I thought. So one, I was curious if that\u2019s kind of mix related or if you\u2019re actually realizing better capture on price than maybe you would have anticipated?","David Petratis","Nothing out of the ordinary, I mean, you hit it right in terms of \u2013 sequentially, the pricing was down, but pretty much in line with our expectations. The teams across the board, I would say, particularly in Americas and Europe continue to execute extremely well on price realization and capturing what they can. Particularly in the nonresidential segment, as you know, resi a little bit harder to get price, particularly in the big box arena, but performance has been good and we\u2019ll continue to drive it going forward and capture what we can given the strong markets.","John Walsh","Got you. And then, obviously, good cash performance, cash built quarter-over-quarter kind of what are your expectations or visibility into capital allocation decisions, whether it be M&A or share repurchase or others?","David Petratis","I would say, we continue with our strategy. We think, there is opportunities are to wring some cash out on inventories. We invested in 2019 with some of the moves that we made globally. And I\u2019m extremely pleased on how we executed on that moves. Our move from Turkey to Poland that some ERP consolidations that never hit the press that we\u2019re executing in a high level, we put some additional inventory in place that will wring out of the system. As we think about capital deployment, the M&A pipeline continues to be robust, prices are high. We remain disciplined and we continue to be active in terms of some stock repurchases.","John Walsh","Thank you. And If I can just sneak one more in here if you don\u2019t mind. Just thinking about the electronics growth rate, I mean, you have \u2013 you did have a very difficult compare, you have an easier compare in Q4. You had been doing 20% to 30% growth-on-growth and it really ticked up this quarter. Anything to call out there? Or how we should think about that growth rate going forward, just given the very strong growth-on-growth?","David Petratis","Our growth in electronics has been robust over the last several years. It\u2019s hard to put up 30% growth a year-ago and top that, so the numbers are getting bigger. The opportunities are also remaining, I think, compelling. If you remember at Investor Day, 40 billion openings in the world, connected devices, technologies, our approach to open protocols with connected capabilities continues to open up opportunities. We think, we understand the growth of these markets on a global basis and it will continue to be a positive driver for Allegion.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. But you characterized it right. If I can add that the comparisons get a little bit easier, particularly in Q4, but kind of low-double-digit is kind of how you should think about it going forward.","John Walsh","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Kessler","Thank you. At the recent GSX conference. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Brad, going through the way the company has \u2013 is essentially changing its sale, it\u2019s go-to-market with customers, trying to get a more holistic [Technical Difficulty] selling product by product. If you could \u2013 I\u2019m wondering, if that has played into the efficiency and the margin improvement that you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters?","David Petratis","So you\u2019re breaking up a little bit there, but I\u2019ll try and hit that. The conversations you had with Brad. I think, number one, partnerships is one of our strategic objectives here. Working with people, the big integrators whether it\u2019s CBORD, whether it\u2019s Bosch, Siemens, we think we bring a unique approach to that. I think, second is a heavy focus on customer satisfaction and quality through the value stream. I\u2019d like to think that from when we first work with an architect to when we install, we can be the best provider through that stream. And it\u2019s \u2013 any time you\u2019ve got an industry like ours that\u2019s got a mechanical heritage and we\u2019re introducing electronics and connectivity the high role. There is opportunity to differentiate ourselves.","And I\u2019m confident Brad talked about this, but it\u2019s really around customer satisfaction and partnering with tools like Overtur, making sure our connected devices install seamlessly on the customer campus or activity with the best products. This is our strategy.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. And as far \u2013 I know, I\u2019m breaking up a little bit, because I have problems with this phone. I apologize for that. And just as a follow \u2013 a specific follow-up to that. In going to market, how have you been able to use your open market stance compared to \u2013 eventually compared to your major competitor and being able to develop the partnerships you were talking about? And indeed, being able to convince people, more and more people to use Overtur, because you do have an open system. Are you finding that there is any resistance to that? Or is that open system \u2013 does that open system allow you to be able to talk to the \u2013 your channel a little bit easier?","David Petratis","I believe with our position and strategy to be open gives us an advantage. It\u2019s also a key that we\u2019re flexible there. We\u2019ll have customers that want control, they want closed systems. And it\u2019s really having that flexibility with our customers that were not going drive one connected strategy that we leave that to the customer and we adapt to that. I think this is important around things like identity and we\u2019re intentional in creating differentiation there.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. Thank you for that. Identity, I think, is probably going to be a step, one of your next steps going forward down the line. I mean, it would be just a natural evolution for you.","David Petratis","[indiscernible].","Jeffrey Kessler","Just a comment on my part. Okay. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.","David Petratis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","Robert Aurand","Hi. Rob Aurand on for David this morning. Last quarter, you had discussed taking actions to remove bad actors in the e-commerce channel. You\u2019re protecting pricing for residential locks. I guess can you talk about the success of that? Is that channel cleaned up now? Is there more actions to take? Or did your more bad actors just take the place of who you cleaned up last quarter? How is that playing out?","David Petratis","I\u2019d say our work in terms of just some good maintenance in the channel is behind us. The introduction of e-commerce over the last few years creates a little bit of a situation like the Wild West. You can have things appear on eBay or storefronts can pop up. It\u2019s part of the natural evolution. But, yes, we think that\u2019s behind us. And I think reflective of some of the growth we saw in the quarter.","Robert Aurand","Perfect. And then just on pricing, I mean, you\u2019re still saying strong price realization in the third quarter. I guess with raw material prices coming down, how do you see that playing out going forward?","David Petratis","I would say, and you know this relative to our industry, we\u2019ll continue to push price. Even a couple of years ago in a deflationary environment, which were, in that today to the extent of input cost being a little bit lower year-over-year, we can still probably push price a little bit, given the strong market demand. And we will do that and remain competitive.","And so, you wouldn\u2019t see necessarily the full year-over-year price increase that you will see for the full year 2019 going forward. But nonetheless, you should expect continued price realization in the broader market.","Robert Aurand","All right. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And next we have another question from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Hey, good morning. I apologize if this question was asked already. But, so can you talk about the progression of the quarter by months? If you can talk if it was progressively better, worse, or you think it was as expected? That\u2019s my first question.","David Petratis","I think a normal third quarter, we\u2019ve got operating systems here that we try and track how we move through it. It\u2019s the peak of the summer construction season. And I think things behave normally.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. Was there any pull-forward of demand in Q3 from Q4? I mean, you\u2019ve kept your guide basically, even though Q3 kind of outperformed. So just curious, what are some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about as we think through Q4? Or is there \u2013 you just want to bake-in some conservatism, because there\u2019s still a lot out there in macros that you probably can\u2019t forecast precisely.","David Petratis","I would characterize it as not any specific pull-forward of activity, i.e., specific actions. I would say Q3 came in better than originally anticipated when we were together 90 days ago, but again, still anticipating a relatively strong performance in Q4 going forward.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Okay. So just, is there a tax give back in Q4? Sorry, that\u2019s...","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. So that\u2019s a good point. And Dave mentioned it a little bit relative to the full-year guide. So as indicated, our effective tax rate for Q3 came in better than anticipated. That turns negative on us in Q4, so that you have a much higher tax rate in Q4 relative to the year-to-date tax rate, which today stands a little bit south of 15%. So with the full year of 15.5% you can kind of work the math. And so that\u2019s going to be a pretty big headwind for year-over-year comparability in Q4.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. My final one, sorry. So what is the normalized price\u2026","Mike Wagnes","And, Deepa\u2026","Deepa Raghavan","Yes.","Mike Wagnes","Deepa, we\u2019re going to ask you to get back in queue. We have to get to other callers.","Deepa Raghavan","No worries. Thank you. Yeah, thanks so much. Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I would like to return the floor to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes","Sorry. Why don\u2019t we let Deepa, since she is the last question? Launch it far away, Deepa.","Operator","Okay. Just one moment, let me reactivate her line. One minute, please.","Deepa Raghavan","Hi. Can you hear me? Hey, hi, can you hear me now?","Mike Wagnes","Sorry about that.","Deepa Raghavan","Yeah. No, no, no worries. Just one on pricing here, I mean, pretty strong pricing trends. I think this got asked a couple of different ways already. But what\u2019s the normalized price range? Do I start \u2013 do we start to bake in like more 1% to 2% price range going forward? Or \u2013 it just seems like pricing is at this point in time a little peakish. You may have the commodity tailwinds and everything. But just given, how do we think about it in a normalized range? And that\u2019s my final question. Thank you so much.","Patrick Shannon","Yeah. I think about around 1%, maybe a little bit north of that. But that would be kind of a normalized type of level.","David Petratis","I would also say, we\u2019ll continue to push Allegion to be disciplined in pricing. We\u2019re seeing wage inflation. I think it\u2019s important that our team think about those pressures and make sure that we\u2019re responsible in going out there and winning our business, driving strong productivity equations and continuing to make sure that we\u2019re compensated for the value that we create I think with our customer relationships.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, I would like to return the floor to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments, please.","Mike Wagnes","We want to thank everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. Please contact me for any further questions and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that today's event is being recorded.","Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Michael Wagnes. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for joining us for Allegion's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Dave Petratis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Shannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Allegion. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and the presentation which we'll refer to in today's call are available on our website at allegion.com. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.","Please go to slide number 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated results. The company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.","Please go to slide number 3. Our release and today's commentary include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition expenses in current year and prior-year results. We believe these adjustments reflect the underlying performance of the business when discussing operational results and comparing to the prior-year periods. Please refer to the reconciliation in the financial tables of our press release for further details.","Dave and Patrick will discuss our second quarter 2018 results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. For the Q&A, we would like to ask each caller to limit themselves to one question and then re-enter the queue. We will do our best to get to everyone given the time allotted.","Please go to slide 4, and I'll turn the call over Dave.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I want to start the call with some highlights from the second quarter. Allegion saw a strong top line revenue growth in the second quarter led by the Americas region, which saw solid volumes in both the non-residential and residential businesses as end market fundamentals continue to be solid.","Pricing was good in both the Americas and European regions. Acquisitions are contributing nicely to the total company revenue expansion, and global electronics growth continues to be strong, which we see as a long-term trend.","In the quarter, we experienced slight margin declines as acquisitions were diluted as expected. Excluding the acquisitions, adjusted operating margins were flat year-over-year as all three regions saw continued inflationary pressures. I'm very pleased with our ability to manage those inflationary forces and maintain organic margins through both pricing and cost actions, once again leading the industry.","In the second quarter, we delivered double-digit adjusted EPS growth, driven by operational performance and accretive acquisitions. The EPS performance highlights our continued focus on driving increased shareholder value.","Cash flow continues to be solid and increased year-over-year even after excluding the impact of the discretionary pension payment made last year.","Please go to slide 5, and I'll walk you through the second quarter financial summary. As you saw in the morning's press release, revenue for the second quarter was $704.7 million, an increase of 12.4%, reflecting organic growth of 5.2%. Benefits from acquisitions and foreign currency tailwinds also contributed to top line growth.","All regions grew organically. The Americas led the way with organic growth of 6.6% in the quarter, supported by solid volume in both non-residential and residential businesses. High-teens growth in electronics and favorable price. The EMEIA region saw organic growth of 1.4% against the tough comparable. And Asia Pacific, organic growth came in at 0.7%.","Adjusted operating income of $150 million (sic) [$150.1 million] increased nearly 10% versus the prior year. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 50 basis points due to continued inflationary pressures, incremental investments, and expected margin dilution related to our recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the recent acquisitions, the base business operating margins were flat year-over-year, while EBITDA margins increased.","Adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 increased $0.14 or approximately 13% versus the prior year.","Additionally, we are updating our revenue and EPS outlooks. Full year reported revenue growth outlook is 12.5% to 13.5% and includes the recent acquisitions of GWA Door & Access business and ISONAS. Organic growth remains at 4% to 5%.","Reported EPS outlook is now at $4.15 to $4.35 per share with adjusted full EPS outlook remaining at $4.35 to $4.50 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 10% to 14%.","Please go to slide 6. Before I turn the call over to Patrick, I want to discuss our recent acquisitions of GWA's Door & Access business and ISONAS, both of which closed in July. The strategic acquisition of GWA Door & Access business including the renowned Australian brand, Gainsborough Hardware, bolstered Allegion's presence in Australia and significantly increases our scale in the Asia Pacific region.","With this addition, we're enhancing our residential presence with market-leading positions and long-standing customer relationships, while accelerating our development of electronic security solutions. This is consistent with Allegion's growth strategy in the region and highly complementary to our core business. The acquisition also provides us increased distribution and allows for both revenue and cost synergies when combined with our existing business in Australia.","In the Americas, the addition of ISONAS brings a strong pipeline of innovation that will benefit from Allegion's expertise in safety and security as well as our extensive market presence. ISONAS has edge-computing technology that provides innovative access control solutions for non-residential markets and will expand our intellectual property in this segment. ISONAS intelligent devices, like its popular integrated reader-controllers, utilizing power over Ethernet, making them easy to install and cost-effective for customers.","Both of these newest additions to the Allegion family expand our core product portfolio, while accelerating electronic adaptation across the industry. We're confident in our ability to further expand the reach of their products and technology as well as increase their capacity for growth to drive shareholder value.","Patrick will now walk you through the financial results and I'll be back to discuss our full year 2018 outlook.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call this morning. If you would, please go to slide number 7. The slide depicts the components of our revenue growth for the second quarter. I'll focus on the total Allegion results and cover the regions on their respective slides.","As indicated, we delivered 5.2% organic growth in the second quarter. The solid organic growth reflects strong performance in the Americas region, which saw solid volumes in both the non-residential and residential businesses, and high-teens growth in electronic products. Pricing was favorable in the quarter as the company remains disciplined in taking necessary actions to help mitigate the impact of continued inflationary pressures.","Second quarter price realization was strong in our Americas non-residential and EMEIA businesses, but were partially offset by price-related reductions associated with the highly competitive mechanical market segment of our Americas residential retail business. We expect price realization to improve slightly in the back half of 2018 due to the Americas non-residential price increase that went into effect in July.","During the quarter, acquisitions contributed 5.4% growth and foreign currency was a tailwind, particularly in the EMEIA region.","Please go to slide number 8. Reported net revenues for the quarter were $704.7 million. As stated earlier, this reflects an increase of 12.4% versus the prior year, up 5.2% on an organic basis. Adjusted operating income of $150.1 million increased nearly 10% over the same timeframe from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 21.3% decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to the dilutive nature of the recent acquisitions.","Excluding acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were flat year-over-year. Inflationary pressures slightly exceeded price plus productivity, less than $1 million, as we are taking other necessary cost containment actions to drive productivity to mitigate the impact of inflationary headwinds.","Other headwinds to margin performance were incremental investments, which had a 70-basis-point impact on adjusted operating margins. And while our recent acquisitions were dilutive to Allegion margins, as previously anticipated, they were accretive to adjusted earnings per share.","Overall, our recently completed acquisitions from the first half of 2018 are performing well. They are delivering good top line performance with expected margins and, in aggregate, are immediately accretive to adjusted earnings per share.","Please go to slide number 9. This slide reflects our EPS reconciliation for the second quarter. For the second quarter 2017, reported earnings per share was $1.10. Adjusting $0.01 for the prior-year restructuring expenses and integration cost-related acquisitions, the 2017 adjusted earnings per share was $1.11.","Operational results increased EPS by $0.13 as favorable price, strong operating leverage and productivity more than offset inflationary impacts. Acquisitions contributed $0.03 in the quarter. The combination of interest expense, other income, non-controlling interest, and tax expense increased earnings per share by $0.02, with favorability from interest offset by the prior-year gain on the sale of an equity investment.","Moving on, the impact of incremental investments in the quarter was a $0.04 reduction. The incremental investments relate to ongoing growth opportunities for new product development and channel strategies as well as demand creation spending to take advantage of acceleration in the residential electronics market.","These incremental investments have continued to enhance growth and are providing solid returns on investment. This results in adjusted first (sic) [second] quarter 2018 EPS of $1.25 per share, an increase of $0.14 or approximately 13% compared to the prior year.","Continuing on, we have a $0.06 per share reduction for acquisition-related and restructuring charges. After giving effect to these one-time items, you arrive at the second quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.19.","Please go to slide number 10. Second quarter revenues for the Americas region were $526.8 million, up 12.4% on a reported basis and 6.6% organically. The organic growth was driven by solid volume in both non-residential and residential products. The non-residential business grew high-single digits excluding acquisitions. Residential experienced mid-single digit growth. Pricing was strong in non-residential, but was partially offset by pressures in residential retail pricing, particularly on our mechanical portfolio.","The TGP and AD Systems acquisitions added 5.6% growth to total revenue. We also experienced another strong quarter for electromechanical products, which grew high-teens. Similar to last year, we announced a price increase to go into effect in early Q3. As a result, the year-over-year impact related to customer-accelerated purchases in advance of the increase are comparable.","Americas' adjusted operating income of $155.8 million increased 9.9% versus the prior year period and adjusted operating margin for the quarter decreased 70 basis points. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was driven by the dilutive nature of Allegion's recent acquisitions, which was expected.","Excluding acquisitions, adjusted operating margins on the base business were up slightly year-over-year as favorable product and business mix were able to overcome the impact of high inflation, which exceeded price and productivity in the quarter. The incremental investment headwind was offset with positive volume leverage.","Please go to slide number 11. Second quarter revenues for the EMEIA region were $147.8 million, up 14.4% and up 1.4% on an organic basis. The organic growth was driven by solid pricing for the quarter. A tough comparable in the quarter caused the year-over-year volume growth to be a bit muted as markets remained mostly favorable. The reported revenue increase was boosted by currency tailwinds along with contributions from the recently acquired QMI business.","EMEIA adjusted operating income of $12.1 million increased 34.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points, with price and productivity more than offsetting inflation and incremental investments. The EMEIA region also saw adjusted operating margin dilution from its acquisitions.","Please go to slide number 12. Second quarter revenues for the Asia Pacific region were $30.1 million, up 3.1% versus the prior year. Organic revenue increased 0.7%. Total revenue was supported by favorable foreign currency impacts.","Asia Pacific adjusted operating income for the quarter was $0.8 million, with adjusted operating margins down 520 basis points versus the prior-year period. The Asia Pacific region saw continued inflationary pressures, outweigh price and productivity. Unfavorable product and geographic mix as well as incremental investments further drove reductions in income and margin. As a result, we have commenced planned restructuring actions late in the second quarter, which will drive operational improvements in the second half of the year and align to our overall regional strategy.","Please go to slide number 13. Year-to-date, available cash flow for the second quarter 2018 was $97.8 million, which is an increase of $55.2 million compared to the prior year period. The increase is driven by the non-recurring $50 million discretionary pension funding payment that was made in the first quarter of 2017, along with higher net earnings, partially offset by higher working capital acquirements.","Working capital as a percent of revenues and the ratio for the cash conversion cycle increased in the second quarter 2018 when compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily driven by working capital related to recently acquired businesses. We remain committed to an effective and efficient use of working capital, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to minimize investments and working capital.","Lastly, we are affirming our full year available cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million.","I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for an update on our full year 2018 outlook.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Patrick. Please go to slide 14. As noted on the slide, given performance during the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising total and organic revenue growth in the Americas and tightening the range for both total and organic revenue growth in Europe.","In addition, we are raising total revenue growth for Asia Pacific, reflecting the recent acquisition of GWA's Door & Access business in Australia, while taking down organic revenue growth in Asia Pacific, reflecting first half performance. This results in the consolidated outlook for total revenue increasing to a range of 12.5% to 13.5% and organic revenue remaining at a range of 4% to 5%.","If we look closer at the Americas business, end market fundamentals remain solid. We see positive indicators in non-residential verticals and stable demand in single-family construction, combined with vigorous demand for residential electronic products.","As I have mentioned in previous quarters, we continue to experience constraints across the construction supply chain, which causes delays in overall project construction. These delays can have an impact on the timing of our revenue and can cause some choppiness from quarter-to-quarter.","European market indicators remain positive and continue to be bolstered by general macroeconomic conditions such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment that remain favorable to markets. The GDP in our key economies are growing, and total revenue growth continues to be assisted by FX tailwinds.","In the Asia Pacific region, timing of projects can cause large impacts on growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. Similar to EMEIA, FX tailwinds continue to contribute to overall revenue growth. The large increase in total revenue outlook for Asia Pacific is to account for the acquired GWA Door & Access business.","We expect inflationary pressures to continue throughout the year. As stated in the first quarter earnings call, we have taken actions to mitigate the impacts of inflation. The pricing increases announced last quarter for the Americas went into effect earlier in July.","We're updating our reported earnings per share outlook of $4.15 to $4.35 and affirm adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50. This represents adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% to 14%. As Patrick just stated, we're also affirming our cash flow outlook of $380 million to $400 million.","Along with the revenue impacts of the recently acquired businesses, the EPS outlook also includes the acquisitions. Also included in the outlook is the assumption for investment spend of approximately $0.15 per share, which is an increase of $0.05 per share from our previous outlook. The increased investment spend represents an increase in our new product development and demand creation activities primarily for electronic products in the Americas to further accelerate growth, supported by our high-teens growth year-to-year.","The outlook also assumes the full year tax rate to be approximately 15% to 16%, with the second half rate higher than the 14.8% adjusted tax rate experienced in the first half of 2018. Outstanding diluted shares included in the outlook are approximately 96 million.","Please go to slide 15. In summary, Allegion total revenue grew more than 12%. Organic revenue grew just over 5%. Adjusted operating margins were down 50 basis points and were flat when excluding the impacts of acquisitions. Adjusted EPS saw nearly 13% growth in the quarter.","Full year total revenue growth outlook increased to 12.5% to 13.5%, inclusive of the recent announced acquisitions. Full year organic revenue remains at 4% to 5%.","Full year reported EPS outlook updated to $4.15 to $4.35 per share. Full year adjusted EPS held at $4.35 to $4.50.","Now, Patrick and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And this morning's first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Maybe my first question out, the Americas organic growth turned out to be a little bit better than we expected this quarter. And I'm just wondering, did you guys get any sense on whether there was any pull-forward demand from your pricing actions that took place in July?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I would say it's comparable from what we saw a year ago. I think you can always expect some pull-through because of pricing actions. But as we ended the quarter and extend into the early weeks of July, demand remains strong. We particularly like the activity in the institutional space and feel good about demand through the balance of the year.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And maybe if I were to kind of shift gears a little bit and just talk about the inflationary pressures that you're feeling. So, obviously, putting through a nice price increase in July. I'm just curious whether you expect both price and productivity to offset inflation in the second half of the year. I may have missed that earlier. And then, I have a follow-on on that just to \u2013 I want to dig into Americas a little bit.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, Joe, as we indicated in the second quarter as well as year-to-date, a little bit underwater, not significantly when you look at that equation in terms of price productivity offsetting inflation.","Our expectation given the price increase that goes into full effect this quarter is that pricing will improve sequentially in the second half compared to the first half. We're going to continue to drive productivity-contained costs and those type of actions. And so, we would expect in the second half that we'll be favorable on that equation in terms of price and productivity offsetting inflation.","Inflation is expected to be a little bit higher than what we anticipated. So we're going to be driving price and productivity harder to help mitigate that going forward.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just following on on the Americas side, you mentioned earlier in your comments around resi mechanical being competitive. Can you just give us an update to size that business for us today? And then, any color that you can give us around the competitive pressure you see in that business? That would be helpful.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So think total U.S. res about $400 million. I would say our position in that market is strongly influenced by the retrofit. In new construction, especially the surge in multi-family, it's been led by opening price point. It's an extremely competitive part of the business. Our position is really in the retrofit and the growth in the electronics, and it yields one of the more profitable segments in that residential space compared to competitors.","I'll say it another way. We make more margin on the sale of a residential lock than anybody else in the space. We've got excellent share and aren't aggressively looking to go position ourselves on that opening price point, which is an important space. But at the end of the day, we want to maximize the returns, so we play the game a little differently.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Understood. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Dave, Patrick, Mike.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Hey.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, all. Thanks for the color on the residential side. I want to switch to the non-res side. So with your price increase in Q3, are you seeing kind of competitors follow and do you expect that increase to be realized to the extent that normally would?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So we've seen our major global competitors fall in line. I think you've heard us talk that this industry is disciplined. I would describe Allegion as \u2013 led the way in terms of our price announcements, I think movement on discounts, and I think it reflected in our results versus the competitors. So, I think there'll be good price discipline and almost required with the amount of inflation this industry has seen over the last year.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","And I would just add that the price realization in the commercial segment has continued to be strong. And you go out with a total list price increase. You don't always get that. There's always going to be some discounts relative to that top line number, but that's just to remain competitive in the marketplace. But so far, we've been getting really good price realization in the commercial segment and would expect that to continue, particularly with the recently announced price increase that went into effect at the beginning of this quarter.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the mix side of things, could you talk about how your premium brands are growing relative to sort of our your mid-price point brands? And if you can throw in anything that you're seeing on the import side that could sort of influence the mix equation, more color on that would be great. Thanks.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Our premium brands performed well in the first half. Remember too that we've got initiatives through things like Pro Express to grow those price sliding brands and I think that's predictable. But the strength of our Von Duprin, Schlage and LCN brands are noteworthy in the first half.","We have solid growth across the entire portfolio. You're aware of our channel led discretionary business which has \u2013 we introduced some lower price point products. Those are performing extremely well as well. So, we're getting good growth from those, which will be at the lower end. But no real mix issues within the commercial portfolio of products.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, the last question from me is nice to see the Americas organic growth move higher. It looks like that in the first half you're already growing at that pace and the comps get easier in the second half if I'm not mistaken. So, is there some possibility that you could maybe do a little bit better than the range given sort of the easier comps? How are you thinking about that in the second half?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, you noted that we did increase the organic growth outlook for Americas specifically given the Q2 performance. And if you just kind of work the math, you would expect a little bit higher perhaps organic growth back half of the year relative to the first half. And so as Dave indicated earlier, like the demand that we're seeing in the end markets continues to remain real positive and we'll kind of continue to see how the market evolves in the second half of the year, but like what we've seen so far.","Josh K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","All right. Great. Good luck in the second half.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Josh.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, so on the residential price, one of your competitors had some fulfillment issues back in Q1; seem to be a little less willing to push their price. Is that kind of the factor here on the residential side or how much of the \u2013 how would you split that between structural issues with imports and I know you just went through where you play, but just curious on the go forward basis as we think out longer term, the dynamics here in residential.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think our large competitor reported this morning, looks like that's behind them. Their ERP challenges, you'd have to think there'll be some movement there. It's difficult in the big box space. So I'd drive it at that. Any price realization in that part of the market would be welcome. So think a little bit about that.","We play in a unique space. In the residential retail, really like our electronics position. We're going to make some investments in the second half that we think will grow demand, product enhancements that will improve capability with some of the communication protocols that are solid products. And it's a little bit different positioning just in the lower part of the market. So, we think that market will continue to be active, especially around the retrofit, and it will reward us.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. Rich, I would just add a little bit more color.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","The commentary on some of the price pressure on our residential mechanical portfolio, really, around discounts, not the price to the retailers or new home construction builders but more on the discount. So, a little bit higher than anticipated rebates, returns, promotional discounts, those type of things, which, quite frankly, can vary a lot quarter-to-quarter. There's peaks and troughs.","You've heard us mentioned this previously on past quarters. And going forward, we don't \u2013 hopefully, we're not anticipating that type of activity that we saw in quarter two. So, it really depends on activity specific, big box retailers and those type of things.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, is it fair to say that you feel more insulated from import competition in the residential market, in general?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Restate that again? It broke up.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is it fair to say that you feel more insulated from import offshore competition in the residential market because you don't play at the very low end? Is that a fair statement or how would you characterize the import competition, not talking about some of the larger guys?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, I do believe we're better insulated. I think we've got a superior supply chain. As I think about the residential market \u2013 as I think about the commercial institutional markets, opening price point, mid-price point, we got a better engine. And you start throwing in things like tariffs, there's importers that are going to have some challenges.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then a real quick one. Just, Patrick, as we think about second half of the year, I mean your seasonality has bounced around a bit from Q3 to Q4 in terms of full year earnings contribution, is there any color you can provide us on how we should think about the balance of Q3 and Q4 within the EPS guidance?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, we don't give quarterly guidance, Rich. I think you're aware of that. But the seasonality itself doesn't really change in terms of top line relative to prior periods, if you look at the percentage of the full year. So, I would look at that.","What I will provide is as we think about margins going forward, we indicated base business flat in Q2, still under water on a year-to-date basis, but that side of the business improving in the second half, so that for the full year, you're kind of on a flattish type of organic base business, excluding acquisitions from a margin standpoint.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Just sticking I guess, to the two-question rule. The first one is really on the acquisitions. Those are about a 50 bps drag to adjusted margins in Q2. What are you dialing in for the second half for that margin headwind globally?","And related to that, is there any color you could give on the organic growth or base margin profile of the very recent or most recent acquisitions?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So, I would characterize \u2013 so you're right, 50 basis points headwind on margins, given the acquisitions. And I'll just reiterate that the acquisitions themselves are performing to plan, and just given the profile of the business, lower than our industry leading EBIT and EBITDA margins. And so consequently, they do collectively have an impact on our aggregate margins.","Going forward, for the second half of the year, without getting into too much detail, you would expect a similar type of drag on the margins in the second half. And one of the issues going forward \u2013 not issue, but just kind of the tyranny of the math, if you will, on the Gainsborough acquisition, has a lower margin profile than even the acquisitions announced earlier in the year. And so that's going to have a \u2013 weigh a little bit more heavily in terms of the dilution on the overall margin profile.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And then, my follow-up would be, I think you've talked a lot about the Americas region already, so maybe switching to Asia. Just give us a broader update on what's happening there. You took down the organic sales guide, but you're also doing a restructuring and throwing on a large acquisition. So there's a lot, I guess, to handle for that local management team. Just maybe sort of walk us through how you're thinking about the strategy in Asia right now.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, there is a transformation led by Jeff Wood who was sent to the region last year. He's put a plan together and he's executing on that plan. His OI was a little weaker in the first half. That was driven by strong project activity in the previous year. We really did well in the Macau region with the casino build outs. Those were good margin projects that can't be replaced.","But the broader repositioning in that region is to more effectively position Allegion in the growth of electronics, and we like what we see there. And it's a little bit of a high wire act as we transform the year, but they're going to improve in the second half. And I think with the addition of Gainsborough and the other acquisitions that we've made, we're in a good position to move in coordination with the strategic plan over the next few years.","You step back even 24 months ago, got out of \u2013 or got out of...","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Bocom.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","...Bocom, we've got a clear driver to lower our cost structure and position the company that \u2013 in the end-markets that line up better with our strengths. And they're doing a good job with that.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hopefully I can count to two, because some people certainly have issues with that. So...","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Well I'm going to leave that up to you, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So question one, do you guys \u2013 I'm looking actually \u2013 one of my colleagues pointed out that in homebuilding channel, people have inflationary pressures this quarter. We've seen something similar with Pentair in their retail channel. Do you think, in an inflationary environment there is a structural difference between selling to institutions and selling to individuals, and somehow you have to adjust your pricing strategy to differentiate between these two channels?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think the channels are different. We're competing on different product attributes and when you take one of our institutional products like a Von Duprin exit device, a LCN closer, the duty cycle that that delivers over its lifecycle is different and commands a higher premium than a residential door handle that needs to operate maybe for the cycle of ownership, which is seven years or less.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And any sort of structural adjustments that you need to make in retail channels to adjust for that in an inflationary environment?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think we always need to try and position ourselves for the pressures of inflation. We also have to be cognizant of our position. If you go into the retail, you'll typically see our brands are in the premium section. And as competition enters, we've got to be sensitive that we don't price ourselves out of the marketplace. There is a point obtained.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A follow-up question. You guys were able to sort of beat up on your competition over the past couple of years. The company in Northern Europe has been somewhat distracted. Another company was merging. Do you feel \u2013 as I sort of look at this big box pressure, what's happening in Asia, do you think part of what's happening is just those guys getting their act together and just sort of payback for you beating up on them for so many years?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think electronics, the growth of the access through electronics brings new entrants and to me the behaviors are predictable. I think we have navigated that pretty well with suspect \u2013 with commentary on the retail.","Globally, I would say that we have done a good job executing our strategy with the opportunities that we have and the performance of the business, and our performance says that. I think...","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You can continue to execute globally, right? You think the strategies, the playbook still works?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I believe it still works. I really like our opportunities around access and electronics.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I'll give you a second answer there, Andrew. I really like our opportunities around access and electronics.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Terrific.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeffrey Kessler with Imperial.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. At the last tradeshow that we saw you folks, I believe, was ESX, you came out, well, you actually reintroduced an electronic \u2013 I just want to call it a wireless door closer. And it seems to me that that was one of, if not, the real highlights of that entire show.","So, the question to you is, given the fact that you do a lot of work with the channel, a lot of work with specifiers, people like that, where is \u2013 if you want to call it, where is the ecosystem in building security at this point with regard to accepting some of these new products that you've come out with over the last six months that seem to have the type of potential that your SMB-level door locks had?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Jeff, I think the product is the RURN (00:45:17).","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Yes.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","It's a nice innovation. Our acquisition of ISONAS builds along those types of things. Our increased investment in the second half and as we go into 2019, we think the adoption of electronic access control is in its infancy. And we believe that Allegion is in a great position to drive seamless access across our customers.","We think we can simplify and improve the user experience. We think we can improve security. And we're going to be aggressive to go out and help our customers, architects and end users, integrators to adopt that. We have continued to develop a very strong value proposition that we think will enhance the customer experience. So, in its infancy with great opportunities.","I want to say one more thing. I couldn't be more pleased with our global electronic growth. We characterize that as high teens. In the fastest moving markets, we think that half of that in terms of overall market growth. And it's going to continue to be a priority for our company.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Along those lines, my follow-up question, which is question number two is, over in Europe, can you describe the ability \u2013 what you're doing in electronics, particularly through influencers like SimonsVoss to bring, again, greater awareness to the channels in Europe, even though they're a bit different, to start accepting electronics and access control that have electronics in them, and start building up a base in that electronics area that can begin to mirror what you're doing over here?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","So, the European market moves a little bit slower, part of it's the complexity of that market from a mechanical standpoint. SimonsVoss continues to be a great capital deployment, really pleased with that advancement. I think something that may not have caught your attention is our investment in Nuki, which is important on the residential side of it. But look at Allegion to focus on some key verticals to bring our electronic, our mechanical capability together, to bring end-to-end solutions that we think will help us grow.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good day, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Two from me also. There's been a little bit of chatter out there that there's been kind of a pickup in import competition in the commercial stock and flow business. And folks like yourself getting spec'd in on projects, but then budgets get tight and push comes to shove and some of the lower-end stuff is actually sneaking into the jobs. To what degree are you seeing that? Is Falcon your response to that? And just wondering if the pricing actually is getting a little bit messier in the commercial market.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think any time you've got development projects that are on the margins of returns as a developer, they're going to \u2013 when you see inflationary pressures that we've seen, they'll go back and sharpen their pencils. That typically results in, what we call, value engineering. And we think our Falcon and Dexter brands that we've been working on over the last couple of years give us the ability to stay in the hunt.","This is an area of the business, when we created Allegion five years ago, that we would just fold our tent. So, we think we've developed the capability. There's always going to be projects like that. And yes, it's happening in the marketplace.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then second question, unrelated. The inflationary pressures at one level are quite obvious, but then we're also looking at brass, i.e., copper and zinc kind of falling out of bed here in the last couple of months. Can you just give us some sense of where your key inflationary pressures are now? Is it freight, is it coming through in labor, or is it still really kind of the metals complex? But I think Patrick said things are actually getting sequentially worse.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. So, if you look at the components of our inflation, a big piece of it is steel-related and that would not only be the raw material component but stampings, castings, those type of things that come through the broader supply chain.","If you look at the cost on a per pound basis, it really hasn't changed since when we talked 90 days ago, whereas, as you mentioned, the zinc, brass, aluminum, et cetera, has come down. So hopefully, we get some relief going forward on that part of the equation, but it's really steel. And then as you mentioned, freights, packaging, those type of things, ancillary type of costs in our supply chain has increased higher than what we had originally anticipated.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Good morning, David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And David, congratulations on a good quarter.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Great job.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I think I'm proud of the team and \u2013 it's meeting the challenge of these inflationary headwinds. Pretty formidable. Throwing some chairs on top of that. I think we performed well. And it says a lot about the character of Allegion that we're going to defend the profitability of our business.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. I mean, your performance on managing inflation really stands out versus so many other companies on my coverage list this quarter. So congrats there.","I want to just go back because you've made a few different comments today around the commercial business. And Patrick started off by talking about the fact that you're getting price traction there. And another point you mentioned that you're likely to get a little bit of protection from the tariffs against that import flow, although you weren't very specific about that.","Now you mentioned a moment ago about Dexter and Falcon. And I guess you're pushing through pricing out the spread between where you're pricing either your high-end or you're tactical brands is opening up versus that import flow. Are you concerned about the second half? And you've managed it so well up to now, but does it kick in and become a more formidable issue in the second half, people mixing down a little more into those tactical brands, or do you get that protection from the tariffs and that gives you a little bit of leeway?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Tariffs really have a little effect on us. In some of the opening price point, mid-price point, it could be opportunistic, but to be determined. But in terms of how I think about the tariffs, it's really \u2013 they're rounding here, number one. Number two, I like the end market fundamentals. I think I'm mindful we're in one of the longest recoveries in history, but as I look out end market fundamentals especially around institutional, which we like, are positive, I think we comment on chop. Labor still concerns me. I just ran a price increase through, what are the effects of that. I think through July it seems like our demand continues to be solid. And I think as we've shown in the first half, we're going to be able to manage through the different variables and continue to operate at a good level here at Allegion.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","What did that commercial business \u2013 what impact did that have on that 5.2% consolidated organic growth in the quarter?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","David, if you look at what we've put in the slides we said that commercial ex-acquisitions or nonres ex-acquisitions was higher than res. We don't give the exact numbers. But we did give some detail on the slide.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I'm just trying to get the commercial versus the institutional, which is a-","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","We don't disclose that detail.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Sure. Can you \u2013 is there any way you could just size that business for us, your most recent sizing?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","Yeah. If you think about nonres, nonres is about 70% of the Americas.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","And of that, 60% is institutional, 40% is commercial.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. My second question was just on the K-12 in the college business. It's seasonal business. This is the time of the year that typically favors. How was the growth there this year versus say last year?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","The growth from 2017 to 2018 across the institutional segment was up. And we \u2013 as we look out to 2019, our anticipation is that it will stay at that level.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","For K-12 in college?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Yes. K-12, there's a demand for increased security. And college campuses and K-12 from an infrastructure standpoint are still trying to dig themselves out of the deficit that was created from 2008 to 2012.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","All right. So the growth there over index the broader 5.2% number.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","We're not getting into a detailed vertical growth rates. David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks very much and congrats on the progress.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rizk Maidi with Berenberg.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yes. Hi, guys. I'll stick to two. Number one, as we're hearing some companies talking about labor shortages happening in some of the European countries, France, Holland, and Germany, your biggest competitor in Europe warned about demand in France, where housing permits, housing starts are down mid to high-single digits year-to-date. Is this something you guys have seen?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","I don't think I'm in a position to comment. As we went through the quarter, it was not an issue.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. And then, secondly, on \u2013 you said that you're expecting the price plus productivity in excess of cost inflation to be positive in nature. Can you just remind us if you are still expecting this equation to be positive for the full year?","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","So slightly positive, which requires us to be second half relative to first half to be more positive. So I think we mentioned earlier first half slightly underwater, managing the inflationary headwinds fairly well through pricing actions, and that's going to continue. But pricing improvement should \u2013 and productivity exceed inflation at the back half of the year.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. And then finally on the trade tariffs, I appreciate you guys touching on them. But just from a logistic perspective, do you source any components from China, or do you feel you have to change anything from a supply chain perspective if those tariffs gets implemented?","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","We do source components in and products from China. It's common in the industry. We have the flexibility in our supply chain to make adjustments globally, and including in-sourcing. So our industrial teams, our designs are set up to be able to have the adaptability to respond.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thank you.","Patrick S. Shannon - Allegion Plc","We'll see where that proposed legislation ends up. Any partial year impact states that it's not a significant exposure. We do a lot of in-region sourcing. And so, yes, there was an impact. We'll wait and see what the final legislation comes out. But any impact for this year is well-contained within our guidance. No problem there.","Rizk Maidi - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thank you.","David D. Petratis - Allegion Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to return the floor back to Mike Wagnes for any closing comments.","Mike Wagnes - Allegion Plc","I want to thank everyone for participating in the call today. Please reach out to me and contact me for any further questions and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
